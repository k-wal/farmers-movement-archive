So far, nearly 9.7 lakh children have enrolled themselves in libraries across the state and borrowed 2.6 lakh books. Priyanka Mary Francis, commissioner, rural development and panchayat raj department, told STOI children are the most affected, socially, emotionally and academically, by the pandemic. “Schools have remained closed and the learning that has been imparted to them for all these years is fading. In the worst case, kids are being pushed into child marriage and child labour, as reported by various media outlets. To prevent further damage, it is the need of the hour to revive GP libraries as knowledge centres of rural areas. The initiative was launched under the guidance of principal secretary Uma Mahadevan,” she said. “We are aiming for 100% enrolment of children in the age group of 6-18. Enrolment at GP libraries is for free. Panchayats have been directed to have in place a separate children’s section, with books specifically chosen for the age group of 6-18. Libraries that are given a facelift can have new and used books which are in a decent condition, provided by well-wishers and NGOs. Digital libraries are also being set up. Activities must be taken up to develop scientific temper among children, and NGOs can contribute in this regard. Efforts should be made to sustain libraries as knowledge centres, even after the pandemic,” Francis said. The number of digital library users is 42,507, and gram panchayats have collected around 3.2 lakh books through donations. Libraries asked to install TVsOf 6,009 GPs, 5,622 have libraries. They have also been asked to install television sets so that children can attend classes telecast on Doordarshan Chandana. Many panchayats have taken up innovative measures to help students in remote areas. Udupi zilla panchayat CEO Y Naveen Bhat said nearly 40 libraries in the district have been upgraded in the first phase. “We have also created at least six new libraries in panchayat buildings. GPs have been asked to reserve at least Rs 2 lakh for this project. GPs are creating WiFi hotspots in library/panchayat halls for students attending online classes in remote villages,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/9-7l-children-enrol-in-gp-libraries-read-2-6l-books/articleshow/84102216.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Disha had saved nearly Rs 10,000 — her pocket money collected over the past few years — in her piggy bank. Moved by the plight of poor patients, who are struggling to get treatment during the pandemic, Disha donated her savings to them. She handed over the amount to surgeon Dr M K Prasad of Adarsha Hospital,Puttur. Dr Prasad told STOI Disha is the daughter of Anila B, assistant manager (sales and marketing) of Janaushadhi Kendra, and Deepak Shetty from Puttur. “She wanted to celebrate her birthday at the hospital and donate the money she had collected in her piggy bank, to treat the poor. Incidentally, her birthday coincides with Doctors’ Day on July 1. To our surprise, she came to the hospital with a birthday cake, and requested me to accept her savings. She cut the cake and also handed over the piggy bank. This noble gesture makes the girl a role model for other children,” Dr Prasad said. The seven-year-old girl had not spent the pocket money given by her parents and grandfather late Shridhar Bhandary, a noted Yakshagana artiste. ‘Moved by patients’ plight’“Saddened by the plight of poor patients suffering during the Covid-19 crisis, she decided to spend her savings for a good cause,” he said. Disha said, “As I did not want a grand birthday celebration, I handed over my piggy bank to the doctor. The amount can be used for the treatment of poor patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/girl-donates-piggy-bank-savings-of-10k-to-treat-poor/articleshow/84102218.cms||Vinobha K T

Palyam Damodharam, 34, from Leninnagar in Tirupati, Muttu Setty Manikumar, 43, from Kankinadu village in Krishna district, Shaik Basha, 45, from Gandhinagar village and Jaspi Lokesh Kumar, 36, of Annavaram in Krishna district, are cooling their heels in jail now. Action unfolded on June 30 when five persons approached Chowdamma, a resident of Devaganahalli in Gauribidanur taluk, stating that they wanted to meet her husband Papanna. As he had gone to the farm, they requested her to send someone to take them to the spot. An unsuspecting Chowdamma asked her son Vijendra to accompany them. But he did not return home till evening.  In the meantime, Chowdamma received calls from three different numbers, informing that her son had been kidnapped. The caller demanded Rs 2.5 lakh to release him. A worried Chowdamma alerted Gauribidanur Rural police. Soon, Chikkaballapur SP GK Mithunkumar formed three teams to trace the boy. They traced the abductors on Old Tirchanur Road in Tirupati within 10 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/5-men-kidnap-teen-to-get-back-at-dad-who-cheated-them/articleshow/84102282.cms||Ranganath Krishnaswamy
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Citizens can upload details of trees on census app||BENGALURU: With the launch of ‘Bangalore Tree Census’ app on Saturday, the long-pending comprehensive tree census in the city is all set to be fast-tracked. Citizens can upload details of all trees on their private properties with photographs, GPS coordinates, species and measurements on the app. The app, which is available on Android and iOS platforms, was demonstrated before high court chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and other judges by uploading information pertaining to a tree on the court premises. The app has been developed by Kimzuka Solutions Pvt Ltd for the state forest department and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. BBMP deputy conservator of forests HC Ranganathaswamy said the app has been developed in such a way that citizens can upload information easily, which include GPS readings, tree measurement, species and other details. “As of now, we’ve already counted 70,000 trees in the city. According to the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, a tree is defined as one which has a girth of 27.5cm at least. We’re hoping the census will be done at a fast pace as the public will be involved in the process,” he said. Three years to compile data According to a BBMP official, it would take at least three years to complete the census and compile data. The high court had warned the BBMP for failing to begin tree census in the city in 2019, but the pandemic delayed the process. The census has been a constant demand of environmentalists for almost a decade to ascertain the biodiversity of Bengaluru as that has been the first and major causality whenever development works are taken up. Vijay Nishanth, tree expert, said: “Despite fighting for a decade to hold a tree census, it was never taken up because the authorities wanted to conceal the number of trees that had been axed. The move will give a direction for Bengaluru’s future.” The last-known official figure of the city’s tree population of over 15 lakh was recorded in 1987 when the Green Belt Forest Division, under the state forest department, was in place. The then chief minister R Gundu Rao executed an ambitious project of planting tree saplings across Bengaluru. A report of Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in 2016 showed the city witnessed a whopping growth of 525 per cent built-up area in the last 40 years, leading to decline of vegetation by 78 percent and 79 percent of lakes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/citizens-can-upload-details-of-trees-on-census-app/articleshow/84102288.cms||---
---||India||Covid effect: Bengaluru Airport seeks sharp phase-wise hike in UDF starting Oct 1||NEW DELHI: Citing “precarious financial situation,” the Covid-stricken Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL) has sought a steep phase-wise hike in user development fees (UDF) starting this October till March 2026. It has proposed to increase domestic departing passenger UDF from the current Rs 217 to first Rs 450, then Rs 550 and finally Rs 555. Similarly the hike proposed for international passengers is from the current Rs 839 to Rs 1,350, then Rs 1,650 and finally Rs 2,220. The increase have been sought to be implemented from October 1, 2021, to March 31, 2026, according to the “alternate” annual tariff proposal (ATP) submitted to the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) for determining Kempegowda International Airport’s (KIA) charges from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2026. “For any travel happening between October 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022, UDF applicable will be based on the date of ticket booking. For any travel beyond March 31, 2022, the respective period UDF charges shall be based on date of travel,” BIAL CFO B A Rao has told AERA in a letter written on June 29, 2021, with the alternate tariff proposal. Top BIAL sources told TOI the increase sought in aero tariff comes at a time when “Bangalore airport is about to complete and operationalise a massive Rs 13,000 crore expansion program.. recovery of this investment has to happen during a period when passenger traffic is at its lowest as a result of the ongoing pandemic. We are committed to completing the project and delivering a world class airport even in the face of strong headwinds in these challenging times." Bangalore airport is about to complete and operationalise a massive Rs 13,000 crore expansion program amid passenger traffic due to the pandemic. We have remained committed to completing the project in these challenging times." Bangalore Airport's communique to AERA says the authority’s traffic projections for it — domestic passengers growing from 2.8 crore in pre-Covid FY 20 by 1.7 times to 4.8 crore in FY 25 and international passengers returning to pre-pandemic times by FY 24 — “appear to be highly over optimistic.” In contrast, BIAL’s June 29 submission has updated traffic projections that sees domestic traffic at 3.8 crore in FY 25 and international climbing close to pre-Covid 46 lakh of FY 20 in FY 25 at 45 lakh. Using AERA’s “over optimistic” traffic projections as the base for tariff determination “will certainly ensure that BIAL would be faced with an under recovery of aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) during the third control period (FY 22-26) in the event of non-achievement of traffic estimates… (that) would result in BIAL defaulting on its loan covenants that need to be maintained under financing agreements executed with project tenders for the expansion project,” Rao says. While acknowledging that given the massive pandemic uncertainty no one can correctly forecast future traffic numbers and thereby aviation sector recovery, the airport operator has requested AERA to “conduct a limited mid-term review of the tariff proposal at the end of March 2023 and enable (BIAL) to amend/revise the ATP.. to achieve the final ARR determined for the third control period.” AERA finalises tariffs for airports by inviting comments from stakeholders on operators’ proposal and after considering them. Interestingly, BIAL has also sent a variable tariff plan on June 29 for the authority’s consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-effect-bengaluru-airport-seeks-sharp-phase-wise-hike-in-udf-starting-oct-1/articleshow/84101758.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The Commission has invited political parties to get their point of view on the creation of new constituencies across J&K. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a joining ceremony at JKAP headquarters in Lal Chowk here, Bukhari said though he had pleaded for holding of assembly elections in J&K without waiting for the completion of delimitation process at the all-party meeting that PM Narendra Modi held in New Delhi on June 24, the central leadership presented its genuine reasons against this demand. “The central government argued that the delimitation in J&K cannot be equated with that of Assam, where the process was postponed. It may be because of the number of seats that is going to be increased in J&K. Having said so, Apni Party has decided to form two delegations of its leaders both in Srinagar and Jammu, who will meet the Delimitation Commission with our party’s viewpoint on the entire process,” Bukhari added. He said JKAP has already “done its homework on the whole exercise of delimitation and would file petitions before the Commission on the adjustment of boundaries and description of the extent of assembly constituencies, which we believe should not be thrust (upon us) to pit one region against another for some political mileage”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jkap-to-meet-delimitation-commission-on-july-6/articleshow/84102508.cms||M Saleem Pandit

These projects are using new technologies for faster construction and have the target to complete over 6,000 houses and ancillary facilities in one year. Modi also reviewed the progress of PM SVAnidhi scheme, which provides collateral free and highly subsidized Rs 10,000 loan to each street vendor. The PM directed the officials and agencies to push more digital payment by street vendors, sources said. So far as the LHPs are concerned, TOI has learnt that all the construction companies have assured Modi to complete the projects within timeline. The PM had launched the projects on January 1 this year with the aim for large scale adoption of new technologies to build houses quickly. Sources said the housing ministry used live drone feed from factories and also from the actual construction sites to suggest how the projects are on track. Earlier in February 2018, PM had reviewed the development works in Kedarnath using drones and these were also deployed by government agencies for review of a highway project in Uttarakhand. “This was at the largest ever when drones were used for live review of progress on ground; from factories to the work sites across a dozen cities. Some of the factories where pre-fabricated items are being manufactured are far away from the work sites,” said a source. The LHPs are coming up in Rajkot, Chennai, Lucknow, Indore, Ranchi and Agartala. In Rajkot, monolithic concrete construction technology from France will make the houses strong enough to face natural disasters. Canada's technology, which is being used in Lucknow, entails pre-prepared walls, which will not require plaster and paint, the government said. In Chennai, the pre-cast concrete system technology from the US and Finland will help construct houses faster and cheaper. In Ranchi, houses will be built using the German 3D construction system just like Lego toys. Each room will be built separately before creating the whole structure. In Agartala, houses will be built with steel frames using New Zealand's technology to combat earthquakes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drones-used-for-live-review-of-new-tech-housing-projects-by-pm-companies-commit-to-complete-them-before-time/articleshow/84102584.cms||Dipak K Dash

Kathua district magistrate Rahul Yadav said, “It has been observed that the use of small drone cameras has increased in the society for capturing photos and videos at social and cultural gatherings. Anti-national elements may use similar drones and flying objects to cause damage, injury and risk to human lives in certain parts of J&K.” Officials said that such a move would help avoid any confusion in the current situation to secure aerial spaces near vital installations and highly populated areas. “Any drone or small flying objects and flying toys in the district need to be registered with ACR/SDM,” DM Yadav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-kathua-admn-bans-drones-flying-objects/articleshow/84102637.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The microblogging site then urged the court to dismiss a petition filed by a lawyer against it for alleged non-compliance, questioning the "legal and statutory" right of a user to sue a corporation registered in the US. "A writ petition is not maintainable against Twitter under Article 226… It appears that the premise… is that the petitioner has the statutory and legal right to submit a grievance to the resident grievance officer." The petitioner had complained against certain tweets and later moved court, citing alleged non-compliance with the Centre's new IT Rules by Twitter. Twitter pointed out that the complaint by petitioner Amit Acharya against certain tweets had been considered and disposed of swiftly by the company. It claimed Acharya had no locus standi to raise a complaint with respect to the tweets in question, but since his complaint had anyway been disposed of, "nothing survives" in the petition. On grievances raised by other Indian users, Twitter said these were currently being looked into by a grievance officer till a permanent appointee took over. The micro-blogging site also said it might fall within the definition of a "significant social media intermediary" under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. Twitter informed the court that it had appointed an interim grievance officer earlier, but the candidate withdrew on June 21 "before steps could be taken to completely formalise the agreement". In his plea, filed through advocates Akash Vajpai and Manish Kumar, petitioner Acharya said he came to know about Twitter's alleged non-compliance with the IT Rules when he tried to lodge a complaint against a couple of tweets. The next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-claims-substantial-compliance-questions-legality-of-plea/articleshow/84104035.cms||Abhinav Garg

The study, yet to be peer-reviewed, underlines the importance of ventilation, physical distancing and mask wearing. While the findings suggest that chances of catching airborne infection is high in closed indoors and in a hospital setting where there are many positive patients, it highlights that the demarcation of hospital areas into Covid and non-Covid zones is a successful strategy to prevent cross infections. In neutral environmental conditions, the virus does not seem to spread farther away from the patients, especially if they are asymptomatic, giving objective evidence for the effectiveness of physical distancing in curbing the spread of the virus. The study — published in pre-print server medRxiv — analysed air samples collected from various Covid and non-Covid areas of hospitals in Hyderabad and Mohali as well as from closed rooms occupied by Covid-19 patients to understand air transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and risks for healthcare personnel and visitors to hospitals. "It is evident that the spread of the pandemic may be largely attributed to non-compliance of Covid-19 safety guidelines on the part of the people. A right amount of caution with courage backed up by sound scientific principles is the need of the hour," the study said. The findings of the study show the virus does not travel much in the air in neutral environmental conditions (ambient temperature and humidity with no perceived air flow), especially if the duration of exposure is short. The virus could not be picked up at a distance of even four feet when Covid-positive individuals spent a short time of around 20 minutes in the room. The samples collected at 8 feet and 12 feet subsequently were also negative. In a situation where three people with mild symptoms were in a room for at least an hour, the virus could be detected at the same place immediately after their departure. Researchers of the study say the findings objectively reassure people that advocated preventive measures would largely be successful in preventing the infection and urge the governments to continue promoting the same. "Short-term travel and resumption of economic activity can be safe if adequate measures are taken," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-no-of-cases-exposure-duration-affect-spread/articleshow/84104468.cms||Sushmi Dey

Congress demanded a joint parliamentary committee probe, while BJP said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was being used as a “pawn” by competing defence companies. “Corruption in the Rafale deal has come out clearly now. The stand of Congress and Rahul Gandhi has been vindicated today after the French government ordered a probe,” said AICC spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, pointing to reports of the investigation ordered by the French public prosecution agency into the Rs 59,000 crore deal. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra cited the SC verdict and the comptroller and auditor general’s report, which had found no wrongdoing in the defence deal between the Indian and French governments, to reject Congress’ allegations. Reports of a middleman in the deal were about an individual named and investigated for a UPA-era defence contract. According to French media reports, the judicial investigation has been ordered by the country’s national financial prosecutors’ office, following investigative website Mediapart’s claims in April of wrongdoings in the deal as well as a complaint filed by French NGO Sherpa that specialises in financial crimes. “The highly sensitive probe into the inter-governmental deal signed in 2016 was formally opened on June 14th,” Mediapart said. Mediapart journalist Yann Philippin, who filed a series of reports on the deal, said a first complaint was “buried” in 2019 by a former PNF chief. In April, Mediapart, citing an investigation by the country’s anti-corruption agency, reported that Dassault Aviation had paid about one million euros to an Indian middleman. Dassault Aviation has rejected the allegations of corruption, saying no violations were reported in the frame of the contract. Surjewala attacked the government, saying, “When the French government has accepted that there is corruption in the deal, should a JPC probe be not held in the country where the corruption took place?” He added that the demand should not be seen through a partisan political lens, but viewed as a concern for national security. “Will the Prime Minister, like the French, now answer to the nation and tell when will he submit his government to a JPC probe into the Rafale scam?” AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted: “Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth, said Lord Buddha.” Patra countered Congress, saying, “The way Rahul Gandhi is behaving, it will not be an exaggeration to say that he is being used as a pawn by competing companies. He has been lying right from the beginning on the issue. Probably, he is acting as an agent or some member of the Gandhi family has been doing so for a competing company.” Patra said Rahul had to tender an unconditional apology in the Supreme Court for claiming that the court’s observations are a vindication of his allegations. “There is a non-disclosure clause about the pricing of the deal…However, details have been given to the Supreme Court and CAG, which gave clean chit and said there was no wrongdoing in the process, procedure and acquisition of Rafale fighter planes,” he said. Congress accused the government of massive irregularities in the deal, alleging that it was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore, against Rs 526 crore finalised by the UPA government during negotiations for the MMRCA (Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft). Prior to the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, Congress raised several questions about the deal and alleged corruption but the government rejected all charges.

The bill once finalised will need the Cabinet approval and assent of both Houses of Parliament to become a law. It proposes that any person committing an offence of “trafficking in persons” shall be punished with imprisonment not less than seven years but which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to a fine of at least one lakh rupees. The bill also lists more severe punishments and penalties for offences classified as “aggravated forms of trafficking.” It is proposed that the NIA shall act as the national investigating and coordinating agency responsible for prevention and combating of trafficking in persons. Once the law is enacted, the Centre will notify and establish a National Anti-Human Trafficking Committee, for ensuring overall effective implementation of the provisions of this law. This committee will have representation from various ministries with the home secretary as the chairperson and secretary of the women and child development ministry as co-chair. State and district level anti-human trafficking committees will also be constituted. It is proposed that whoever commits the offence of aggravated form of trafficking of a person shall be punishable with a term for ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life. The bill also makes it clear a person advertising, printing or broadcasting any material that promotes trafficking will invite punishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/draft-anti-trafficking-bill-proposes-stricter-punishment-imprisonment-can-extend-to-10-years/articleshow/84105071.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||India||Tamper-proof QR Code to be made mandatory for oxygen containers for effective tracking||NEW DELHI: Tamper-proof QR codes will soon be made mandatory for all high pressure cylinders and cryogenic containers used for storing and transport of medical oxygen for their quick identification and mobilisation. This will help the government to get details of how many of these are filled and about their location as well. The industries department (DPIIT) has issued a draft notification to make this provision mandatory. It has proposed to amend the Gas Cylinder Rules by including the provision, which says, “All the high pressure cylinders and cryogenic containers used for filling non-toxic, non-flammable gases and liquids shall have permanent and tamper proof marking in form of QR code at conspicuous place on cylinders.” The rules define “cryogenic containers” as double walled insulated closed metal containers having volume exceeding 500 ml but not exceeding 1000 litres intended for filling, storage and transport of cryogenic liquid. Industry sources welcomed the move. They said the government should come out with uniform QR code which can be read using handheld devices or by a mobile App. It will help track the location and status of such containers and cylinders. “The QR code can store the status including whether the container or cylinder is filled or empty. This is a good move towards improving the tracking of oxygen delivery mechanisms,” said one of them. Another industry source said there is also a need to tag or link the liquid oxygen tankers and other storage facilities at hospitals to a central database for real time monitoring at pan-India level. “The purpose has to be to integrate the entire supply chain and also the storage facilities so that you can take necessary steps to meet any requirement quickly,” he added. S P Singh of IFTRT, a Delhi-based think tank on transport issues, said the recent experience during the second wave of Covid exposed how various types of industrial and scrape cylinders were fabricated as oxygen cylinders to cheat the hapless patients. “Hence, QR code shall have temper proof details, usage and the type of gas allowed to be filled in such cylinders. It’s the most appropriate move at this hour,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tamper-proof-qr-code-to-be-made-mandatory-for-oxygen-containers-for-effective-tracking/articleshow/84105786.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||Why do govts lie in courts: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Expressing dismay over governments raising “with impunity false claims and defences” in courts, the Delhi HC on Saturday said this was a matter of “grave concern”. Whenever a false claim is pressed by a government in court, it “causes immense injustice” to a litigant, it observed. The HC’s anguish came while dealing with a batch of cases relating to a challenge by the government to compensation awarded by the Railways Claims Tribunal and false claims by Cement Corporation of India over a property it took on lease in Delhi. The HC asked the Centre and Delhi government to frame a litigation policy that holds officers accountable for lapses in the handling of court cases. “In all these cases, the government raised false claims/defences before this court which is a matter of grave concern. All these cases shocked the conscience of this court. It appears that the false claims are raised with impunity because there is no accountability of any government officer for raising the false claims and courts seldom take any action against the person concerned for raising false claims/defences,” Justice J R Midha said in a 31-page judgement. The court said because of these false claims even the government suffers, but the concerned officer, who has raised the false claim, does not face any action. It said “if the facts provided by the officers are found to be false/incorrect by the court, the government shall consider taking action and the copy of the judgment will be kept in the ACR file of the officer. This will ensure the officer is held accountable for the actions taken by him in the court case.” It cited the examples of Sikkim and Haryana saying they have litigation policies that brings more accountability. It said there is a need to incorporate similar rules by the central government as well as by the Delhi government. “State of Sikkim has already framed the rules for holding its officers accountable for the lapses in the handling of the Court cases. There is a need to incorporate similar rules by the central government as well as by Delhi government,” the HC observed and added that “State of Haryana has framed State of Haryana Litigation Policy – 2010 to bring visible, enduring qualitative and quantitative improvement in the manner in which litigation is perceived, managed and conducted in the State.” The Centre on its part informed the HC that there is no litigation policy of the government at present and that the National Litigation Policy, 2010 was never implemented. The court then said that its directions to enforce accountability in government litigation "are in the nature of PIL (public interest litigation)" and listed the issue before the PIL bench. It noted that as per Legal Information Management and Briefing System (LIMBS) – a wing of the central government for monitoring and handling of various court cases of government departments and ministries - 4,79,236 cases of government, 2,055 cases for compliance and 975 cases of contempt were pending as on June 8, 2021.

"The cross-examination of the survivor, extending to almost 700 pages and spread over 18 dates of hearing, was nothing short of a brutal attack on her character and alleged past sexual history, designed to shame and humiliate her," the state said. "Not only should these questions have been disallowed while recording evidence, the trial court has gone so far as to use these very questions and material to discredit her, although they were neither relevant to the case nor could they have been put to her under law," the state government said. The matter is likely to come up before the high court on July 29. The court will decide the application filed by the state seeking leave to appeal against the trial court judgment. While stating that the judgment focuses on indicting the survivor rather than trying to ascertain the role of the accused, the application says that the 527-page judgment is influenced by extraneous, inadmissible materials and testimonies, and graphic details of her past sexual history, which are prohibited by law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tejpal-judgment-consumed-by-sex-gossip-goa-govt/articleshow/84106411.cms||Murari Shetye

The complaint was filed by Vasudeva Reddy, a resident of Bengaluru. He claimed that certain pieces of land acquired for the IT corridor between Whitefield and Electronics City were denotified for illegal gain under a government notification dated June 21, 2006 by Yediyurappa (arraigned as accused no. 2) when he was deputy chief minister and they were allotted to entrepreneurs. The investigating officer filed a ‘B’ final report stating that no offences appear to have been committed by accused no. 2 under Section 13 (1) (d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Court seeks final report from DySPHowever, special judge Shridhar Gopalakrishna Bhat noted that the final report submitted by the investigating officer doesn’t instil confidence in the court and directed the deputy SP attached to Lokayukta police to investigate the matter and submit the final report/additional final report expeditiously as per law and posted the matter to August 21. The investigating officer has also been told to keep in mind observations made by the high court in its December 22, 2020 order vis-a- vis delay in investigation, when the petition filed by the chief minister came to be dismissed. In 2019, Yediyurappa had moved the high court challenging the special court’s order directing Lokayukta police to probe the matter. He contented that on October 9, 2015, the HC had quashed proceedings against RV Deshpande, who had been arraigned as accused no.1 in the case and it had been upheld by the Supreme Court too. However, the high court rejected the plea and pointed out that allegations against them are ‘different and distinct’ and there was no relief granted in his favour. The high court had further noted there was a deliberate and intentional delay on the part of the investigating agency as it did not conclude the investigation from February 18, 2015 when the complaint was referred to investigation till April 2, 2019 ,when the high court actually stayed the probe., “Being an independent and impartial body entrusted with the duty to investigate into the misconduct of the public servants objectively, (Lokayukta police) cannot give rise to an impression in the mind of the general public that it is playing into the hands of the political bigwigs,” the high court had observed while issuing direction to the special court for monitoring the investigation in such cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/fresh-probe-against-cm-in-denotification-case/articleshow/84106570.cms||---

Yediyurappa on Saturday wrote a letter to Stalin, suggesting talks to clear Tamil Nadu’s apprehensions about the project and underlining its importance for both states. TN has been opposing the project, claiming it would deny its share of Cauvery water. Project won’t affect TN farmers: CMStalin recently met PM Modi with a request that the project be put on hold. The Karnataka CM said in the letter that it would be in the interest of “all concerned and to have a better relationship between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu if the TN government, in the right spirit, would not oppose implementation of the project.” The CM informed Stalin the water project is in line with the final orders of Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal and later modified by the Supreme Court to generate 400 megawatts of power. The project, set to meet drinking and domestic water needs of Karnataka, including Bengaluru city, in no way affects the interests of farming communities of TN, he said. He sought to draw Stalin’s attention to many projects taken up by TN in the Cauvery sub-basin without holding negotiations with Karnataka. While TN has filed an application before SC against the project, Karnataka sought the Centre's nod for terms of reference to conduct an environmental impact assessment study, Yediyurappa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bsy-invites-tn-cm-for-talks-on-mekedatu-plan/articleshow/84106591.cms||---

The UP police anti-terrorist squad had earlier filed an FIR and arrested six, including Umar Gautam and Mufti Qazi Jahangir Qasmi. On June 25, the ED had registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 against Mohammed Umar Gautam, Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi and the Islamic Dawah Centre (IDC) in Delhi’s Jamia Nagar. Both the accused are in the custody of the UP ATS. The ED has claimed that both Umar and Qasmi were involved in large-scale conversions all over India. The ED referred to what it called “facts” that had emerged during searches of their premises in Jamia Nagar (Delhi) and other places in Lucknow and Sant Kabir Nagar. The ED got involved in the case only after the UP ATS in its preliminary probe traced documents regarding alleged illegal donations and transfers from different countries, particularly in the Middle East, into the accounts of Umar Gautam and a trust run by the accused known as Fatima Charitable Trust (FCT). Al Hassan Education & Welfare Foundation is in Malihabad locality of Lucknow, and has an office in Hardoi. Accused Umar Gautam was the vice-president of this foundation, but after his arrest he was removed from the post. Police sources said another arrested accused, Salahuddin Jainuddin, was a member of the Guidance Education & Welfare Society. “Several incriminating documents have been seized during the search, which reveal large-scale conversions carried out by accused Umar Gautam and his organisations all over India. The documents also reveal receiving of foreign funds of several crores by his organisations for illegal conversions,” the ED said. Earlier, the UP ATS had claimed after the arrest of Salahuddin Sheikh from Vadodara that Umar and his associates had converted more than 1,000 people to Islam by luring them with “offers of money, jobs and marriage”. The ED’s searches covered premises of IDC, the residence of Umar and Qasmi, all in Jamia Nagar, Delhi. Offices of Al Hassan Education and Welfare Foundation and Guidance Education and Welfare Society have also been searched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-intensifies-conversion-case-probe-searches-delhi-up-sites/articleshow/84106636.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||India||Pushkar Singh Dhami is new Uttarakhand CM, youngest in state’s history||DEHRADUN: Pushkar Singh Dhami, two-time MLA from Khatima in Udham Singh Nagar, emerged as the dark horse in the chief ministerial race on Saturday. Giving preference to youth over experience, the BJP named the 45-year-old as the 11th chief minister of Uttarakhand, replacing Tirath Singh Rawat, who was in the saddle for just four months. Dhami will be the youngest to take over the CM’s chair in the 21-year-old history of the Himalayan state. Sources said that by naming Dhami, the saffron party has tried to strike a balance between two key factors in Uttarakhand politics – the Thakur-Brahmin equation and the Garhwal-Kumaon factor. “Both Tirath Rawat as well as state BJP chief Madan Kaushik represent Garhwal. With the two key posts having been in Garhwal’s kitty, BJP has now preferred a leader from Kumaon area to strike a balance and send a message to the electorate in Kumaon,” a source said, adding that the choice also balances the caste dynamics as Kaushik is a Brahmin while Dhami is a Thakur. “The choice of Dhami is intended to keep Thakurs – who comprise a large chunk of the electorate – happy ahead of the forthcoming polls.” Dhami’s name was proposed in the BJP legislature party meeting in the afternoon by outgoing CM Rawat. Kaushik extended support to the proposal and it was unanimously approved by the ministers and MLAs. The oath-taking ceremony of the new CM is likely to take place on Sunday evening. Dhami said he was ready to take on the challenge. “I am aware that I have limited time but I want to assure everyone that I will make all possible efforts to work for the welfare of people. Our party has taken some major decisions in the last four years and I will continue the good work of my predecessors,” he said, adding that he has been a part of youth politics and his focus would be on youth welfare. The new CM, political observers said, will have his work cut out trying to work in tandem with senior party leaders, many of whom were in the race for the CM’s post. Having had no experience of working as a minister, he will have to quickly learn the ropes and also strike a rapport with party leaders as well as the cadre in Garhwal region, where he is relatively unknown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pushkar-singh-dhami-is-new-uttarakhand-cm-youngest-in-states-history/articleshow/84106699.cms||Kautilya Singh

It also extended business hours of shops and establishments by four hours till 9pm and allowed the reopening of malls and bars and restaurants. “The night curfew will continue to be in place from 9pm to 5am across the state,” chief minister BS Yediyurappa said after meeting the Group of Ministers on Covid-19. The new relaxations will not apply to Kodagu district as it has a positivity rate of over 5%, The Unlock 3.0 announcement came as daily Covid-19 cases consistently fell below the 3,000 mark over the past few days. These relaxations will be in force for a fortnight. “We will review the situation after July 19 and decide on further unlocking measures,” Yediyurappa said. Under the new guidelines, all shops, commercial establishments, industries, government, and private offices can be open till 9pm with 100% staff strength. Public transport, Namma Metro, autos and cabs can ply with 100% occupancy. Temples and other religious centres can be open to the public but no offerings (or sevas) are allowed.

---||Bengaluru||Safety breach may lead to shutdown in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: A number of experts have said that the failure to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour was one of the major factors that triggered the massive second wave of Covid-19. With the next stage of Unlock set to start from Monday, police and civic officials have decided to take stringent action against citizens and establishments found to be violating health safety protocols. A total of 54 special teams, comprising BBMP marshals and police personnel, will be deployed across the tech capital to spot infractions (not wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing), impose fines and register cases. An action plan to this effect was chalked out during a coordination meeting attended by BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta and Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant on Saturday. Each of these teams will comprise four marshals and one home guard or a police constable. They will work in two shifts with focus on public and private spaces that are generally crowded: markets, malls, hotels, pubs, major roads, traffic junctions, theatres, religious places and parks. Emphasising on the importance of Covid-19 safety protocols at this juncture, Gupta said that a team of senior zonal officials would make a note of areas and establishments where rules were violated the most. If there is no change in behaviour, they will lock the place down. Pant warned people against starting arguments after being caught violating rules. “If arguments occur when marshals are imposing a penalty on citizens disobeying rules, the police will provide necessary security and take action,” Pant said. Gupta said that the Covid caseload of Bengaluru, which used to report about 20,000 infections daily during the second wave, had fallen to 600 to 700 cases. It is important that people understand their responsibilities and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to mitigate the impact of the next possible wave, Gupta added. On Saturday, Bengaluru reported 481 new Covid cases and 10 deaths. Currently, the city has 19,411 active cases. “After Unlock 3.0, there will be more people on the streets. Many will not use a mask or wear it improperly. Such people will be penalised, the same way it was done earlier,” said a senior police officer. Both the police and BBMP have collected around Rs 26 crore in fines from violators so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/54-special-teams-to-keep-vigil-in-bluru/articleshow/84106710.cms||---

C S Satheesha, a 37-year-old government schoolteacher, decided to build a bamboo platform atop a tree so that he could continue to teach kids from his high perch. Satheesha, who teaches students from 1st to 5th standard at the Government Lower Primary School in Mullur, says it took him two months to build his treetop classroom. “I spent about Rs 10,000 to build it, which included lighting,” he adds. The material required — bamboo, hay and gunny sacks — was acquired with the help of friends. This out-of-the-box idea was inspired by the makeshift watchtowers (locally called “Atta-palli”) that villagers use during the harvest season to keep an eye on elephants and wild boars that could destroy their crops. Now, the platform is where he goes to hold daily classes for students in English, mathematics and Kannada. Since it’s at a height of 20 feet, the problem of weak reception has been overcome. He also helped organise some extra smartphones for students while others were taught using conference calls. His students appreciate the effort he’s made. “Our teacher is really great. Because of his innovative mind, we did not miss any classes,” says Punya, a Class 4 student. Following his success story, Karnataka primary education minister S Suresh Kumar has taken up the issue of connectivity in rural areas seriously and has urged chief minister B S Yediyurappa and chief secretary P Ravi Kumar to intervene and get service providers to fix network problems. “I have written to the CM and the chief secretary explaining the situation in Malnad and other hilly areas and requested them to call a meeting of service providers to enable connectivity in these areas,” Kumar says. A retired senior official of the department of public instruction says: “We need teachers like Satheesha who go that extra mile to teach students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kodagu-teacher-builds-treehouse-classroom-to-overcome-patchy-internet/articleshow/84106732.cms||G RAJENDRA

The spate of controversial remarks given by him soon after taking over had made many in the party uncomfortable. Also, the Kumbh testing scam had proved to be an embarrassment. Many in the party also felt he was “too simple” and not politically savvy enough to manage the ambitions of MLAs within the party and lead it successfully in forthcoming polls, as per sources. “Tirath Rawat is a simple person and during his short tenure, didn’t show the skills required to handle bureaucracy or the party cadre,” said Doon-based political analyst Jay Singh Rawat. “The controversial statements made soon after taking over, whether it was on women’s ripped jeans or equating Modi with God didn’t go down well with many. Also, it seems that the party was not convinced that going into polls under his leadership was a safe bet,” he said. “Had he contested the bypoll in Salt, the current problem would never have arisen. His advisors failed to alert him about the provisions of the Representation of People Act and its ramifications. That was a grave mistake,” said a source.

These patients came with complaints of jaundice and lethargy, after which the doctors found each had a history of taking a concoction of herb Tinospora cordifolia, locally known as ‘giloy’ in Hindi or ‘guduchi’ in Sanskrit.  A 62-year-old woman died four months after she was rushed to hospital with fluid accumulation in her abdomen — a sign of liver failure. “We, for the first time, found severe liver injury, proven using biopsy, related to the herb Tinospora cordifolia,” said hepatologist Dr Aabha Nagral, lead author of a study published in Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, an international peer-reviewed journal published by the Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver. Liver transplant surgeon Dr A S Soin, who wasn’t connected to the study, said he too had seen five giloy-related liver damage cases. One of his patients, too, died. “Many took to giloy during the pandemic to boost their immunity and as an antioxidant. Unfortunately, many suffered liver toxicity due to it,” he said. Except for the deaths, the other patients made full recovery a couple of months after stopping the herb. Giloy is among the several alternative medicines recommended by the Ayush ministry as an immune booster against the Covid-19-causing SARS-CoV-2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-doctors-caution-of-liver-damage-linked-to-giloy/articleshow/84106995.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||India||Covid-19: Antibiotics of the 1940s make a comeback in troubled times||HYDERABAD: Doctors are now increasingly prescribing antibiotics that were popular during grandpa’s times. This is to fight antimicrobial resistance that has become a major health nuisance with disease-causing bacteria and fungi turning intelligent to emerge as superbugs. The Covid-19 pandemic has only hastened the revival of forgotten drugs to treat bacterial and fungal infections. Drugs used way back in 1940s are now being prescribed to attack the modern superbugs with the old medical bullets. Since the present-day germs are not accustomed to old antibiotics, they become susceptible and die. “Forgotten formulations have now emerged as modern saviours. The experiment with old antibiotics to beat antimicrobial resistance is paying rich dividends,” said neurosurgeon Dr P Ranganadham. He said from the times of penicillin, discovered in 1928, there have been numerous drugs that saved humanity. But overuse or abuse of these drugs led to antimicrobial resistance, forcing doctors to search for new medicines. Stating that the antibiotics of the olden days come cheap and time-tested, Ranganadham, who has seen the evolution of drugs in the last four decades, told TOI that since some of these forgotten antibiotics like colistin and clindamycin could also develop horizontal spread of resistance, doctors should think of a combination therapy. According to Dr Shyamala Iyengar, senior consultant at Apollo Hospital in Hyderabad’s Hyderguda, India has one of the highest rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents. “One of the strategies to overcome this is to use outmoded antibiotics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/antibiotics-of-the-1940s-return-in-covid-times/articleshow/84107062.cms||Syed Akbar

The analysis shows an infection-preventing vaccine with 60% efficacy covering all priority groups would reduce peak symptomatic incidence of Covid-19 by 20.6% and total deaths by 29.7%. A similar vaccine with ability to prevent symptoms, but not infection, will reduce peak incidence of symptomatic cases by 10.4% and cumulative mortality by 32.9%. Read AlsoCovaxin's overall efficacy 77.8%, 65.2% effective against Delta variant: Bharat BiotechHYDERABAD: India’s first indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin is overall 77.8% effective against Covid-19 and 65.2% effective against the deadly Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, its developer Bharat Biotech said on Saturday. Revealing the final analysis results of its Phase III efficacy trialThe study supports a focus on vulnerable or priority group vaccination that seeks to reduce the incidence of mortality and offer greater protection against the disease. In a situation when vaccine supply is insufficient to cover all priority groups, model projections suggest that after key workers, priority should be accorded to all who are above 60 and subsequently individuals with co-morbidities. The analysis underlines that challenges that are particularly pressing in a country as large as India would persist even after more vaccine candidates are available. “Vaccination rollout should prioritise those most at risk of severe outcomes of infection,” it says.

The study also suggests vaccinating all defined priority groups against Covid-19 would have a substantial reduction in overall health burden, compared with a scenario of no vaccination, and complete lifting of restrictions. So far, nearly 80% of healthcare workers and 90% of frontline workers have been administered both doses of Covid vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/targeted-vaccination-drive-a-better-strategy-icmr-study/articleshow/84107016.cms||Sushmi Dey

Owner Manik Banik, who is bogged down by the worry of the huge losses he has suffered, is even more concerned about single-screen theatres standing the test of times. With cinemas being shut now as part of Covid-safety restrictions, no show was on and so, a bigger tragedy could be avoided as the fire broke out at Mini Jaya, located on the upper floor of the building. “Everything inside the 442-seater Mini Jaya has been gutted. Only the structure remains. I think my 774-seater Jaya has been spared,” Banik said. The heat inside was “unbearable” and Banik is yet to find the extent of damage. “Our caretaker’s wife has sustained burns. She is under observation at a hospital,” he said. Earlier on Friday, Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA) had written to the chief minister, urging her to consider opening of cinemas. The letter, signed by EIMPA president Piya Sengupta, highlighted the plight of more than a lakh workers, including cinema operators, ushers, lightmen, caretakers, gatekeepers, booking clerks, electricians and sweepers. “Ticket printers, banner artists, poster men are facing huge financial crisis. Just like parlours and gyms, we want the cinemas to reopen, too,” Sengupta said. Six months ago, Joydeep Mukherjee, who has the lease for Star Theatres, surrendered his lease for another hall — Krishti cinema—to the Memari municipality. “I still want the cinemas to reopen. The day we are allowed to, I will keep Star and Kalyani’s Vidyasagar Mancha open, irrespective of the business they do,” he said. However, not every person associated with the cine-world in Bengal believes reopening now is the correct step forward. Unlike tourism, Bengal’s exhibition industry did not recover during reopening last year due to low footfalls and absence of Bollywood content. Some exhibitors, who had initially lobbied for saving cinemas by reopening, themselves dilly-dallied to open their doors when the government issued orders. Sengupta has been flooded with calls from hall owners from the suburbs. “If the halls open, they will be able to earn Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 by playing old movies. When we think of the exhibition industry, we have to consider their plight as well,” she said. A section, however, still believes in exercising caution. Banik said, “If halls reopen now, those in the suburbs can survive by playing repeat films. But cinemas in Kolkata, including mine, can’t operate unless there is a steady flow of Bollywood content. Only South cinemas can sustain by completely banking on regional content.” Arun Mehra of Bengal Properties Pvt Ltd that runs Paradise is not part of the movement to reopen cinemas now. “We didn’t reopen last year. Some others did and they shut down again. We are not planning to do that. We are being cautious about reopening,” he said. Priya Entertainment has also surrendered the lease of Netaji Subhash Sadan in Baidyabati to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jaya-fire-one-more-blow-to-city-single-screen-theatres/articleshow/84101529.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Currently, food joints can function till 9 pm with Covid-19 protocols in place. “We have had some positive response from foodies who turned up in good numbers for lunch. But, we had a very poor response for the dinner session,” said Sanjib, a representative of a noted restaurant in Vizag city. “It’s good to be back with some business but as we have to close by 9 pm, we are losing out on night business,” he added. Only 50% of the restaurants in the state have resumed dine-in services while others struggle to invest in reopening their establishments, said A Venkata Ramana Murthy, president of Andhra Pradesh Hotels Association. “The virus has created panic among people, who are scared to visit restaurants. At least 30% of restaurant owners will not resume their business due to losses,” he said. The lockdown in 2020 and restrictions this year have raised questions over the survival of the over 3,000 medium and large restaurants in the state and the four lakh people who depend on this industry. Only 50% of restaurants have resumed dine-in services while others struggle to invest in reopening their establishments.

The tree was uprooted due to thunderstorm and strong winds a month back. Group centre DIG Sunit Rai said the tree was lying uprooted. “We found soft leaves coming out of it and realised that the tree was still alive. Hence, we decided to replant the tree. With the support of our officers and men, a crane was requisitioned from a private construction firm and a heavy earth moving machine was also used to dig up soil, pick the tree up and replant it at the same place. Necessary nutrients were also mixed with soil at the root. Wooden planks were placed to give support to the tree and stop it from tilting,” Rai added. The DIG said even the nutrients used were compost prepared from dry leaves. “Several other activities to protect environment, such as plantation and discarding use of plastics have been initiated on the campus where many CRPF personnel live with their families,” the DIG added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/crpf-jawans-replant-uprooted-peepal-tree/articleshow/84100169.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Though Azmi described the meeting as a personal affair, people close to the former Siwan MP’s family said the SP leader and Osama held a closed-door meeting for about an hour to discuss political scenario in Bihar. Azmi told mediapersons after the meeting that Osama should plunge into active politics to fill the vacuum created by his father’s death. He, however, refused to disclose whether Osama would campaign in favour of the Samajwadi Party candidates in the upcoming assembly polls in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. “It is too early to comment on the issue,” he said. Azmi added Shahabuddin always stood like a rock behind the RJD top leadership. “I hope the RJD also extends same support to the former MP’s family,” he said. Some political observers have viewed Azmi’s meeting with Osama as an attempt by the SP to consolidate the Muslim-Yadav (MY) vote bank in Uttar Pradesh, which is scheduled to go to the polls next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maharashtra-sp-chief-meets-shahabuddins-son/articleshow/84100763.cms||Ramashankar

The eight were travelling in two batches. According to Vijayawada police commissioner B Sreenivasulu, one of the batches was arrested on a Howrah-Goa Vasco Da Gama express. The accused are Mohammed Haasan (33), his brothers Hydar Ali Khan (37) and Imdadil Khan (21) and another relative Syudullah Sheikh (25). “None of them had a passport and confessed to having entered the country by crossing the border illegally,” a senior police official said. Cops explained that the accused, who are manual labourers, crossed the Bangladesh border and entered India via West Bengal. Later, they reached Howrah and decided to go to Goa seeking work. In another case, Railway Protection Force (RPF) sub-inspector L Viswanadh arrested four persons—Shaik Saddam (25), Mohammed Ali Ameen (19), Mohammed Sakayath Hussain (37) and Khayyum Khan (25). Cops said that the four accused also reached Howrah in a similar manner and were heading towards Chennai for work.

---||Patna||Vaccines to protect pregnant women, unborn kids from Covid: Doctors||PATNA: After the Centre’s nod to pregnant women, many expecting mothers are seeking expert advice on Covid vaccination and its impact on their health and unborn child. The decision was taken after an ICMR-Delhi study showed that the second wave of Covid-19 hit pregnant and postpartum women more severely compared to the first one. Health experts feel the vaccine may protect the mother as well as the unborn child from infection as there was evidence that infants could get antibodies in utero through cord blood. Dr Monika Anant, additional professor of department of obstetrics and gynaecology at AIIMS-Patna, said many pregnant women with Covid-19 symptoms were hospitalised with severe complications during the second wave. In the first wave, 14-15% pregnant women had moderate to severe disease while in the second wave, almost 24% had moderate and severe infection. After vaccination in lactating mothers, antibody starts appearing in breast milk within 2 weeks and highest in 4 weeks, she said. “If the pregnant women are vaccinated, they may experience milder symptoms even if they contract the virus. There would be very little or no chance of ICU and incubation requirement for vaccinated expecting mothers. It is also seen that if the pregnant women take the vaccine in the latter period (4-5 weeks prior to delivery) of their pregnancy, the vaccine may protect the newborn as well,” Dr Anant said. Noted gynaecologist Dr Manju Geeta Mishra said vaccines against Covid-19 are safe for pregnant women and protect them and their unborn kids from infection. “It is seen that symptomatic pregnant women are more vulnerable if they catch the virus than the common ones. In the inoculation, babies would also receive temporary protection from catching the virus if their mother has been vaccinated during pregnancy. In other vaccines, it was also seen that the placenta cord helps in protecting the infant from other diseases,” she said. “Several women are seeking advice about the benefits of vaccine against Covid-19 while some, who unknowingly had taken the vaccine shots in the initial stages of their pregnancy, are also contacting for help. On an average, I receive 6-7 such calls,” she added. Dr Sushma Pandey, former head of gynaecology department at PMCH, said the health professionals need to highlight the benefits as well as the risks, if any, about the vaccination against Covid-19. “Based on the information, the pregnant women should decide on their own whether they want the vaccine or not. Besides, the government should create awareness about the vaccination as well. But the vaccine is safe for pregnant and lactating women,” she said. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh told this newspaper that awareness camps will be held at all vaccination centres to encourage pregnant women to take the jab. “Awareness in the society will also be made through the ANMs, ASHAs and Jeevika workers. Special arrangements will also be made at vaccine centres for them, including separate line for pregnant women. Right now, we are waiting for the state government’s direction in this regard,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccines-to-protect-pregnant-women-unborn-kids-from-covid-doctors/articleshow/84099641.cms||Faryal Rumi

He will be the second LU student to hold the post after Harish Singh Rawat (2014-17). Both studied law at LU. The teachers and students said that they were proud that one of their own was now the CM of a state. Dhami pursued BA (1993-96), a diploma in public administration (1996-97), masters in human resource management (1997-1999) and LLB (2002) from LU. LU teachers, student leaders and former students who used to move on the campus with Dhami and accompanied him to a number of political conventions of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad are elated. He was also president of LU’s ABVP unit. “Dhami was different. He was not aggressive like other student leaders and did not believe in violent protests. I am happy that a self-made man will now be people’s face,” said head of the public administration department Prof Manoj Dixit. A batchmate and a close friend of Dhami, a Noida-based entrepreneur Anubhav Singh, said: “Dhami and I did MHRM together and I was a resident of Habibullah hostel and he was in Narendra Dev hostel. I still remember how passionate he was for ABVP .”  A politician and a university senior, Bajrangi Singh Bajju, said: “He worked with me in ABVP from 1998 till 2000. He made ABVP strong on LU campus.” Dean, law, Prof CP Singh said, “We are happy that our student has made it big. He was among few students who were active in campus politics and were good at studies as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dhami-second-lu-alumnus-to-be-ukhand-cm/articleshow/84105597.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Kolkata||W.Bengal: Hospital body seeks clarity on rate cap from panel||KOLKATA: The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) has decided to write to the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) seeking certain clarifications on the price cap on some radiological and pathological tests. This comes a day after the commission passed an order capping the charges on five radiological tests and 15 pathological tests at all corporate hospitals having 150 beds and above. “We would be trying to understand on what basis the fixed charges have been decided, how it has been calculated and also why the price cap order is meant only for the section of hospitals that have more than 150 beds. We are writing to the commission chairpe-rson on this,” said AHEI president Rupak Barua. There was already a murmur of discontent right after the order was passed by the commission on Friday. Some of the big corporate hospitals met on Saturday to discuss the latest price cap order from the WBCERC. It was unanimously decided that AHEI will take up the issue with the commission. “The order came as a surprise. We have had no issues in capping the price of RT-PCR, PPE or vaccines as these are part of community service. But we also need to generate income to pay employees and maintain the hospital and the lab,” said CK Birla Hospitals CMRI COO Simmardeep Gill. Private Hospitals rued that they already admit a certain number of patients under hugely subsidized schemes like Swasthya Sathi. Also, since hospitals with more than 150 beds are NABH accredited, they need to take stringent quality control measures involving high cost. “Apart from patients under subsidised schemes, close to 90% of those who come for treatment at hospitals are corporate patients. Therefore, how will the amount left after the capped price benefit the patients. We wish the commission had considered this while fixing the charges,” said Belle Vue CEO Pradip Tondon. “Regulation is welcome but it should also consider the kind of rising operational costs private hospitals have to incur and the inflation so that we can also survive,” said the CEO of another hospital. AHEI will be sending the letter to WBCERC commissioner Ashim Kumar Banerjee on Monday. The hospital association will take its next course of action once it gets a feedback from the commission on its request.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosp-body-seeks-clarity-on-rate-cap-from-panel/articleshow/84101284.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Patna mayor Sita Sahu flagged off the campaign along with municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma and distributed cloth carry bags made by women under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM). The mayor appealed to people to use cloth bags instead of plastic carry bags. Sahu said people can donate the plastics and old waste materials to the civic body and get the cloth bags in return. “The waste and old items given by residents will be recycled. Plastic bags are used for only 25 minutes and unfortunately it takes at least 1,000 years for a single plastic to decompose. The plastic, however, pollutes the earth in just minutes,” she said. Himanshu said a team has been formed under the DAY-NULM to make attractive and reusable bags from waste clothes. “On behalf of PMC, these women volunteers will put up makeshift stalls in all six circles of the city – Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankarbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City – every Sunday to exhibit carry bags, cushion covers, doormats and other decorative items made of waste materials,” he said. Himanshu added, “In this way, we will be able to provide employment opportunities to women and make the city free from plastic bags.” The municipal commissioner said the PMC has been working on various projects under solid waste management project to reduce the city’s pollution level. “A waste segregation plant with a capacity of 150 tonne per day will be set up in the city, where all types of waste will be segregated through manpower and machines. Along with this, an 8-tonne processing unit is being prepared by CIPET, for which an MoU has been signed,” Himanshu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/civic-body-vows-to-make-patna-free-of-plastic-bags/articleshow/84100781.cms||Faryal Rumi

Although there are a few queer-friendly counsellors and experts in the state capital, rural Bihar lacks such facilities, making it harder for the people to recover from mental health issues. Shubhankar Mondal, who identifies himself as queer, told this newspaper, “I often wonder which mental health expert I will seek help from if I have a problem. Our community faces a range of social, economic and medical disparities.” A city-based social worker, Farheen Rashid, pointed out that it was important to understand the factors that influence the mental health and well-being of the LGBTQ+ people. “Since our healthcare system is not inclusive, the LGBTQ+ community continues to face humiliation. Some practitioners often resort to conversion therapy to change an individual’s sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual. In the process they do more harm than good,” she added. However, it is not all doom and gloom for the LGBTQ+ people. Some organisations and the people associated with them are trying their best to overcome the taboo against the community. Reshma Prasad, the curator of ‘Garima Grih’, a transgender shelter home in the city, said, “With professional counsellors and psychologists, this one-of-a-kind safe space offers support to abandoned transgender and queer individuals.” A counsellor at the shelter home, Anupriya Singh, also promised to “hold conversations around queer-specific issues and come up with solutions”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/challenges-galore-for-lgbtq-community-in-states-rural-areas/articleshow/84100010.cms||---

According to officials, they arrested a man and seized over 20 kilograms of banned psychotropic drugs worth over Rs 67 lakh. Officials said they received credible information about illegal manufacturing and sale of banned drugs—diazepam and alprazolam—used to treat anxiety and sleeping disorders. Officials said the drugs were allegedly distributed among college students and to toddy shops that acted as retail units. Investigation later revealed that the accused had committed a similar offence by running a drug manufacturing unit at Ramchandrapuram near Hyderabad and was booked for supplying drugs to students and other addicts last year.

---||Visakhapatnam||State board rules roost in Andhra Pradesh, CBSE lags behind||VISAKHAPATNAM: State board schools have long been the mainstay in Andhra Pradesh’s education system. There are only some 325 CBSE and 55 ICSE schools out of the nearly 63,800 schools in the state, as per the UDISE+ 2019-20 report released by the Union education ministry. The CBSE and ICSE schools are mostly confined to a few cities of the state, where central government institutions, public sector units and Navy establishment are located. Now, the state government is planning to implement the CBSE system in all state schools. The demand for CBSE schools is mainly based on its holistic curriculum and the boards’ flexibility to parents and students to migrate anywhere within the country. The CBSE education is also said to give students an edge while competing in national-level entrance tests such as JEE and NEET. On the other hand, affordable private education as well as parents with a preference for English medium education for their children have made state board private schools an attractive option. With corporate chains setting up shop in every nook and corner of the state as well as local factors, more and more admissions are taking place in state board schools, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. Secretary and correspondent of Little Angels School at MVP Colony, Venu Mohan Manga, observed that the CBSE curriculum imparts a comprehensive and broad base of knowledge to students. “The limited number of CBSE schools is mainly because it is capital-intensive. As per existing norms, 1.5 acres of land is needed to start a CBSE-affiliated school in cities like Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and other places. For metro cities like Mumbai, at least 3,000 square metres area is needed for the school. In the existing scenario, the land alone would cost a bomb for schools” said Venu Mohan. Venu Mohan added that even the CBSE affiliation and recognition process is an arduous task as schools must meet mandatory requirements. “That is why the CBSE schools are very limited in number. The state government can start education hubs on the lines of Health City in Vizag city, identifying suitable land pockets,” he said. Narava Prakasa Rao, convener of Andhra Pradesh Right to Education Forum, explained the changing dynamics of the education sector. “With changing preferences of parents towards quality private education, Andhra Pradesh should have more affordable and quality CBSE schools. The state government can invite dedicated educationalists to set up good schools by offering lands at government prices or somewhat cheaper prices,” said Prakasa Rao. Meanwhile, the CITIIS apex committee has accorded its in-principle approval for the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation to go ahead with the tendering process for redevelopment of 40 schools under CITIIS (City Investments to Innovate, Integrate and Sustain) programme. The project is being implemented at a cost of Rs 65 crore in Vizag city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/state-board-rules-roost-in-ap-cbse-lags-behind/articleshow/84099667.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Tejashwi welcomed Maheshwar and said he will further strengthen the RJD. The leader of opposition in the legislative assembly lashed out at the Nitish Kumar government and reiterated that it will fall down soon. “They (Nitish) have come to power from the backdoor. Even people want this government to go because it has been formed against the mandate,” Tejashwi said while criticizing the government over the education, health and law and order issues. Talking about the allegations made by cabinet minister Madan Sahni, Tejashwi said it also raised questions on the CM’s tenure. “He (Nitish) is the Bhishmpitamah of corruption. Over 60 scams have surfaced during his tenure, but not a single minister or officer has been questioned. In June, no transfer is done without money,” he alleged. When asked about allegations against deputy CM Renu Devi’s brother in case of land grabbing, Tejashwi sarcastically said, “Once are in BJP, you become Raja Harishchandra. All the sins get washed away after joining BJP and no officer will dare touch you.” On Jamui MP Chirag Paswan, the RJD leader said he has empathy with him. “Whatever happened to him was wrong. Now he has to decide whether to come with those toiling to save the Constitution or will remain with the followers of Bunch of Thoughts,” he said. Meanwhile, RJD leaders are preparing for the gala silver jubilee celebrations of the party on Monday. On the eve of the foundation day, senior party leaders will speak on a Facebook live on Sunday, RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said, adding, “Lalu ji will speak from Delhi on Monday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-mla-maheshwar-singh-joins-rjd/articleshow/84100501.cms||Sheezan Nezami

SHO Jehangir Alam Khan said the victim’s parents lodged an FIR in this connection late Thursday night. “The accused is the grandson of an elderly couple in whose house the victim and his parents live on rent,” he said. Khan said the victim’s father told police that the matter was around three months old but his son recently told him about it. He said the accused was shifted by his family members soon after knowing about the FIR. “The accused boy’s grandparents alleged that the victim’s family has not paid rent for at least four months. Both the elderly persons were asking them repeatedly to clear payments which the family failed to do. Recently, both of them had asked the victim’s family to vacate their rented accommodation after arguments on failure to pay rent,” he said. Khan said the victim’s medical examination was conducted on Friday. “We are waiting for the medical examination report. Besides, we are putting efforts that at least the grandparents bring the accused once before the police,” he said. The SHO said when the victim was asked about the it, he said “sexually assaulted”. “It’s highly impossible that a child of such a tender age would be able to tell police using specific technical terms about the incident until he is tutored,” he said. Khan said police investigation is more inclined towards the possibility that the sodomy allegation is the outcome of a rent dispute between both sides. “Further things would become clear soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/11-year-old-boy-booked-for-sodomy/articleshow/84099451.cms||---

Sahni, who offered to resign from his post following differences with a senior IAS officer, asked Kumar to remain within his limits.  “I am not a ‘dalal (middleman)’ that I will maintain a balance with the officials. I am a political creature. Moreover, I know from which background he comes from. He belongs to my native district. It’s better for him not to cross the limits,” Sahni told the media. Sahni was in Muzaffarpur on Saturday to attend an inaugural function of a private hospital there.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation caution for vax unit staff ‘selling’ slots||KOLKATA: Acting on complaints against a few civic staffers at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation-run Covid vaccination clinics (CVC) who were taking cash from citizens to fix slots, the civic body’s health department has issued a circular warning stern action if anyone is found indulging in such a practice. The circular from the chief municipal health officer (CMHO) addressing deputy CMHOs has called for increased vigil at the CVCs by medical officers managing the centres. “A staffer attached to any CVC should not be involved in any sort of financial transaction in the vaccination process. If there is any complaint, it will be viewed seriously and steps will be taken against the accused,” the CMHO has told senior KMC health department officials. The warning, civic officials said, was necessary from the civic brass to ensure smooth functioning of the CVCs at a time when vaccines are in short supply and many people are returning disappointed from the clinics. “Taking advantage of an acute shortage of vaccines and the desperation of citizens, a few employees attached with vaccination centres may have been tempted to sell slots to people desperate to get the jab. We don’t want this to happen. Hence, the warning,” said a KMC health department official. On-the-spot registration at the KMC-run vaccination clinics and the rush to get the jab before the third wave has led to this opportunity for a few civic staffers to earn a quick buck. “We need to isolate these staffers who are very few in number but can destroy the morale of hundreds of dedicated employees working at the CVCs,” said a senior official in the KMC health department. The circular has also asked senior health officials to ensure that banners and posters are prominently displayed at the entrances and inside the vaccination centres, stating that jabs are being given free of cost. “As part of our efforts to streamline the vaccination process, we shall make senior officers accountable for any sort of discrepancy that might occur at our CVCs. We are committed to offer hassle-free vaccination at our CVCs,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-caution-for-vax-unit-staff-selling-slots/articleshow/84101336.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Patna||Petrol price hits century in Patna, cost of essential items goes north||PATNA: Petrol was sold at Rs101.35 per litre in Patna on Saturday while diesel was not far behind at Rs94.68/lt, as the continuous rise in fuel prices have exponentially increased the rates of essential household commodities such as vegetables, fruits and edible items by 20 to 30% in the last couple of weeks. The petrol prices increased by Rs4.58/litre and diesel by Rs3.87/litre in June, as per the price notification of city-based fuel retailers. According to wholesalers and traders, fuel prices play a vital role in the rates of vegetables, fruits and foodgrains. Harendra Kumar, manager of a wholesale vegetable service, said the prices of all the seasonal veggies have gone up by 30% mainly because of rise in transportation charges. Bhola Singh, a vegetable vendor at Mithapur sabzi mandi, said okra price has gone up from Rs20 to Rs50/kg. “Tomato and pointed gourd (parwal) are being sold at Rs60/kg, while the rates of sponge gourd (nenua) and bottle gourd have increased to Rs40/kg from Rs20 and Rs25/kg sometimes back,” he said. Mahesh Ram at Anta Ghat said rise in vegetable prices is common during the monsoon, but this time transportation cost has also played a major role behind the rate spike. “The prices of other commodities are also increasing and we are not able to save money. We are only adding the transportation charges to the vegetable prices,” he said. Bus, autorickshaw and cab rides have also become dearer as the private players have increased the rate up to 50%. Uday Shanker Singh, president of Bihar Motors Transport Federation, said buses were forced to ply with 50% capacity under the Covid-19 restrictions. “We are already facing losses due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Besides, the rising fuel prices have increased our burden. To make up the losses, we have increased the bus fare up to 50% on all routes,” he said. Bhanu Shekhar Prasad Singh, president of Bihar Truck Owners’ Association, said, “Many are out of job due to huge losses. They are not able to save money as they are forced to pay taxes from savings. There are around 5 lakh trucks for transporting essential goods and around 30% of them are parked,” he said. Since transportation cost of everything, from vegetables and fruits to other commodities, depend on fuel prices, citizens have been feeling the pinch. Anupama Choudhary, a resident of Patel Nagar, said at a time when the people’s earnings are diminished, the prices of every essential item have almost doubled. “The prices of food items like rice, edible oils, pulses, vegetables and eggs have skyrocketed. The continuous rise has completely turned our household budget upside down,” she said. Rishab Agarwal, who works in a private service agency, said from transportation charges to food items, everything has adding financial burden on the middle-classes earners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/petrol-price-hits-century-in-patna-cost-of-essential-items-goes-north/articleshow/84100396.cms||Faryal Rumi

Kolkata-based ICMR-NICED has proposed a research project to develop an oral vaccine, which many scientists and health experts said could be the next-generation Covid vaccine. The proposal has been submitted to the department of biotechnology under the ministry of science and technology. “The proposed project will be in collaboration with a German firm. We have submitted our research proposal. Once selected and funded, we can start working on it,” said ICMR-NICED director Shanta Dutta. All vaccines in the current inoculation drive in India, as well as elsewhere, are injectable and researchers have started working on developing a nasal spray vaccine against the virus. “An oral vaccine, if proved effective, would be much easier in terms of administering and reaching the masses. So it is good that an initiative is being taken to develop one after similar steps to develop a nasal vaccine,” said clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi, former head of clinical and experimental pharmacology at School of Tropical Medicine. Health experts said the Covid-19 virus is not going to disappear soon. Even if the pandemic gets over, it will continue to stay in an endemic stage and people will need vaccine protect-ion periodically. “In addition to efficacy, acceptability is very important when it comes to successful mass inoculation drives. A glaring example is that of the polio vaccine, which became more acceptable and the drive gained the much-required momentum when the oral drops were introduced,” said Dipika Sur, a former scientist with ICMR. Apart from the polio vaccine, some other vaccines that took off in the injectable form but were later developed into oral versions include vaccines against rotavirus, thyroid, cholera and adenovirus. “Some vaccines originally developed in an injectable form already have oral versions. While developing an oral vaccine against Covid is a great initiative, the oral route of administering it could be challenging as there is limited data available on fecal-oral transmission,” said Peerless Hospital Clinical Research and Academics director Subhrojyoti Bhowmick. The NICED proposal has been shortlisted for presentation. If the project gets sanctioned, the vaccine will be developed in the laboratory and tried on animals first. “Once approved and funded, it will undergo all processes of vaccine development and all phases of clinical trial for safety and immunogenicity. From the laboratory to the market, a vaccine takes five to six years. Therefore, if everything goes well, we can expect an oral Covid vaccine in the near future,” said Dutta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/niced-proposes-research-on-oral-cov-vax-for-greater-reach/articleshow/84101185.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Kafil and Haji Salim, an alleged LeT recruiter in India, were brought to Patna from Kairana in Uttar Pradesh and produced before a special NIA court on Saturday. Earlier it was reported that Salim was the father of Kafil, but NIA sources on Saturday said they only belonged to the same village. The NIA had urged the court for ten days’ remand of Kafil. Since Salim is not keeping well, the NIA did not seek his custodial remand for the time being. Salim has problems in urinating and had to be taken to IGIMS after landing in Patna to get a catheter fixed. The court sent both to Beur central jail for a day. Their next production date has been fixed on July 9. Meanwhile, NIA took custody of Mohammad Nasir Malik and his brother Imran Khan from Beur jail for interrogation on Saturday morning. Both were recruited allegedly by Salim in the terror network. Both were arrested in Hyderabad on June 30 and brought to Patna on Friday. The NIA has got their seven days’ remand. The parcel containing a chemical kept in a glass bottle wrapped with adhesive tapes in women’s clothes was booked at Secunderabad railway station. The parcel had exploded while being dumped at platform number one of Darbhanga railway station on June 17. The NIA sources said the interrogating team will try to know about their terror plans in India and the other members in their cell with whom they were in touch and who were providing them logistics and financing them in India and how. “The most crucial point of interrogation would be to know about the other members of the LeT sleeper cell and who was handling them from Pakistan,” a top NIA source said. He said the agency has found traces of the chemical used in the parcel from the residence of Nasir and Imran. Sources said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) might also interrogate the two. “Money was being pumped in India through hawala network from Pakistan, but we don’t know the channel used by them for financing the terror network,” a source said. Meanwhile, NIA has alerted the prison authorities to remain alert about Salim. Sources said the Beur jail prison authorities have been asked to arrange best possible doctors for Salim and avoid even slightest negligence. Sources said a team of doctors has been deputed for him in the jail hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nia-gets-6-day-remand-of-kafil-in-darbhanga-parcel-blast-case/articleshow/84100748.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Kaiser and three other LJP Lok Sabha members, except Chirag, have elected Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras as the parliamentary party leader in the Upper House. Paras faction also claims to be the real LJP, leaving Chirag to fight for the legacy of his father and LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan. Both the factions have decided to celebrate the birth anniversary of Ram Vilas on July 5. The protesters reportedly owing allegiance to Chirag faction of LJP also blocked the road near Parmanandpur village when Kaiser was on way to Pasraha-Parbatta to take part in a function. They also shouted slogans against the MP and asked him to ‘go back’. The situation was, however, brought under control after the intervention of the security personnel escorting to the MP. Later, Kaiser told the mediapersons that the protest was orchestrated by a group of 10-12 youths. “It appeared to be a preplanned conspiracy to defame me. But it will not affect my determination. I am with Paras ji and will remain with him in future also,” he said. He, however, hastened to add, “I respect Chirag ji too. But I have reposed my faith in the leadership of Paras ji, who was elected national president of the party.” Summy Paswan, who was leading the Saturday’s protest, revealed that Parmanandpur is the ‘sasural’ (in-laws’ house) of Paras and ‘nanihal’ (maternal grandfather's house) of party's Samastipur MP Prince Raj. Another functionary Ratan Paswan said that majority of the LJP workers were with Chirag. The district unit of the party is divided on the leadership issue. While LJP district president Md Masoom reposed faith in the leadership of Paras, Summy said a large number of party workers would visit Hajipur to take part in the proposed ‘ashirvad yatra’ to be launched by Chirag on July 5. On his return from Delhi, Paras said Chirag should launch his 'yatra' from Jamui instead of Hajipur. He also described Chirag merely as an MP of the party, who had no role to play in the LJP’s policy decisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/khagaria-mp-shown-black-flags-by-chirag-supporters/articleshow/84100054.cms||Ramashankar

Why are steroids prescribed for patients and what would be the adverse effects? Is CT scan a prerequisite for Covid-19 patients? Will the third wave be more deadly than the second? The ongoing pandemic has raised several nagging questions in the minds of the public. Dr Prabhakara Reddy, a cardiothoracic surgeon who is currently serving as the deputy superintendent, Government General Hospital, Kurnool, has become the first port of call to address the concerns of the public and bust myths in the last 16 months. From social media memes and posts to awareness videos, Dr Reddy has left no stone unturned for rapid dissemination of information since the onset of the pandemic last year—be it on disease transmission dynamics, medications, virus variants, plasma, waves, steroids, Remdesivir, vaccine, etc. His lucid social media posts and blogposts on the pandemic can be understood by even a layman in terms of medical knowledge. Dr Reddy served as the state Covid-19 special officer during the first wave. He was instrumental in drafting Covid-19 containment strategies in Andhra Pradesh and increasing oxygen lines and beds in hospitals in the first wave. He opposed getting CT scans unless it was medically necessary and prescribed, and encouraged mild cases to opt for home isolation. Speaking to STOI, Dr Reddy, who performed more than 400 heart surgeries, said the main objective behind his social media and blogposts is to create awareness among the public on the disease. “It is good to see lakhs of people benefitting from the posts as well as my Rs 300 medication kit. The government Covid-19 hospitals extended great services in both waves and I propagated the same information to save the poor from fleecing by some corporate hospitals,” said Dr Reddy, and cautioned the public against lowering their guard despite the decreasing daily infection numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/doctor-works-tirelessly-to-create-awareness-on-covid/articleshow/84100011.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Vijayawada||Civic bodies in a quandary over online classes||Amaravati: The municipal administration department’s decision to conduct online classes through Zoom application is causing a huge financial burden on civic bodies as they have been asked to purchase licences depending on the strength of students. MM Nayak, director, municipal administration (DMA), had recently asked 60 commissioners of municipal corporations and towns where municipal schools are working to launch online classes for high school students from next Monday. He directed commissioners to buy at least five licences per school to manage online class for classes VII to X. Although the DMA advised the civic commissioners to merge some of the classes for online sessions where the student strength is below 100, the decision was questioned by the civic chiefs. “Conducting online classes for the students is a good decision. But why should we purchase the licenses of an expensive mobile application when free options like Doordarshan are available,” asked a municipal chairperson. Sources said each conference licence would cost Rs 3,000 which might cost each high school as much as Rs 15,000. In addition to the licenses, the civic bodies will have to buy infrastructure like white boards and camera stands. This would result in huge burden on the municipal bodies, said sources. Interestingly, civic bodies can earn revenue by utilising Webex stream. “Majority of the children are depending on cell phones of parents who are daily wagers. The parents are worrying giving smartphones to children, particularly to girls while going to work. We need to understand their concerns and fears,” said a school headmaster. The school education department, which is managing rural schools, is streaming online classes through Doordarshan and YouTube.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/civic-bodies-in-a-quandary-over-online-classes/articleshow/84099716.cms||Samdani MN

The incident came to light after the footage was leaked to a vernacular TV channel. Podalakur police said they have not received any complaint but confirmed that the footage was indeed from the branch manager’s chambers and was leaked by one of the bank’s employees to the media. Taking cognisance of TV reports, senior bank officials ordered an inquiry. The video shows the manager getting out of his chair and molesting the woman seated opposite him. Currently, the manager is said to be not reachable and it is suspected he might be absconding. “We have neither received a complaint from the bank officials nor the victim in the footage. We have examined the footage to consider taking suo moto action,” a police official said.

---||Patna||11 Bihar districts face flood threat as rivers in spate||PATNA: The flood scenario turned grim in the basins of the Gandak, Bagmati, Kamla and Mahananda rivers due to high rainfall in the catchment areas of Nepal in the last 24 hours, water resources department (WRD) sources said on Saturday. As many as 11 districts are under potential flood threat. “What makes one nervous is that the embankments of the Bagmati and the Kamla are in poor condition. One only wishes that the embankments are not breached,” a WRD source added. The water levels in the Bagmati and the Kamla have been rising. The two rivers were flowing above the danger level at most points along their downstream. The water discharge through through Valmikinagar barrage at 5pm on Saturday was more than 2.93 lakh cusecs. The water discharge through the Birpur barrage across the Kosi is “a tamed affair” since a lot of flood protection works have been taken up in its basin in the last couple of years. However, the water discharge through Bagmati at Dheng in Sitamarhi district was around 80,000 cusecs. The river was flowing above the danger level at four other points, and also all along its downstream that passes through five districts – Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Khagaria. It, in turn, will impact the Kosi river basin. The districts hit by Gandak include West Champaran, Gopalganj and Saran. The catchment areas of north Bihar rivers in Nepal have been receiving high rainfall. Birpur in Supaul district received 140mm rain on Saturday and Chanpatia in West Chamaparan 190mm. In Madhubani district, surging waters in the Kamala river near new rail bridge at Jhanjharpur began to cause fears among people regarding flood, damages and devastations. Worst-hit is Madhubani town where waterlogging and slush-covered roads have made life hellish. The Adhwara group of rivers in western part of the district covering Benipatti, Bisfi and Harlakhi blocks too are posing threat. The district administration, however, claimed that it has made elaborate arrangements to meet the possible challenges. Large parts of paddy-growing fields are covered with rainwater in north Bihar districts. In East Champaran, Bagmati and Lalbakeya rivers crossed danger level near Dewapur on Friday. Water entered a dozen villages in eastern part of Patahi block. The floodwater has disrupted traffic on Motihari-Sheohar road. Heavy rain also triggered a huge swelling of the water level in the Burhi Gandak river. The spill-over of the river has swept through the river side, inundating many low-lying areas in Sugauli and Banjariya. The block office is under four feet floodwater in Banjariya. In Sitamarhi, torrential rain over the last four days claimed life of three children as their house wall collapsed at Islampur village under Riga block on Friday. One Md Hasim Sah’s three children – Jainav Khatoon (9), Enayat (6) and Faizan (4) – lost their lives. The villagers dug out bodies from the debris. All major rivers, such as Bagmati, Lalbakeya, Lakhadei, Jhim, Marar, Hardi and Adhawara group are flowing above danger marks, posing threats to embankments. Meanwhile, deputy CM Renu Devi, who also holds the portfolio of disaster management department (DMD), reviewed flood situation and the state of preparedness of the districts at a meeting on Saturday. She also took stock of steps taken for transfer of gratuitous relief of Rs 6,000 to each of the likely flood victim. DMD principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit presented the update on the flood situation and steps taken for the relief operations. “At least 90% of the names and Aadhaar numbers of the potential flood victims have been uploaded to the DMD portal in every flood-prone district,” Amrit informed the deputy CM.

Nagpur reported 42 new cases while Buldhana reported 55 new cases. Amravati once again reported a small surge above 40. After registering zero Covid deaths for six consecutive days, Nagpur district recorded four deaths on Saturday. 42 persons were found positive from 8,322 tests, while 84 patients recovered. With Nagpur’s four deaths, Vidarbha recorded 6 fatalities on Saturday. These include 1 death each from Amravati and Chandrapur — both municipal corporation cities. Overall, 219 new cases were reported while 253 patients recovered. The difference between new cases and recoveries is declining, which suggests that the virus spread may be gaining momentum again. Experts, however, said that around 200 cases a day will continue to be reported in the long term. As long as hospitalization is not required for Covid patients and death toll is under control, there is no need to panic, they said. Vidarbha region’s caseload reached 10,96,877. With 10,75,019 of them recovered, the recovery rate is constant at 98%, better than both state and national average. Nearly 25,000 tests were conducted in Vidarbha in the last 24 hours, which is not bad, but less than the average of 30,000. As the number of new cases has reduced in many districts, contact tracing activity has also decreased. The number of under-treatment cases reduced further to 1,653. Majority of them are under home isolation, which suggests that most hospital beds are unoccupied in Vidarbha region. Barring Amravati, all districts in Vidarbha have less than 300 active cases at present. Wardha: Six out of 1,000 test reports were detected positive for coronavirus on Saturday, taking the caseload to 49,237. After discharge of 8, recoveries are now at 47,866. The toll is at 1,322 after no death was reported on Saturday and 49 patients are under treatment in the district. New cases were detected from Wardha (5) and Arvi (1). Amravati: A 67-year-old man from Warud lost his battle against coronavirus on Saturday to take the district's toll to 1,555. The day also saw 43 new cases, taking the caseload to 96,106. Recovery of just 32 brought down the rate to 97.99% even as the total reached 94,179. This left 372 active cases under treatment. Chandrapur: One death, 23 new cases and 26 recoveries marked the day. The toll rose to 1,532 and 196 active cases remain. The casetally has grown to 84,730, while recoveries now amount to 83,002. Yavatmal: The district retained its ‘no death’ report for the 16th consecutive day, which kept the toll static at 1,789. The administration received 548 test reports, of which three were positive. Currently there are 43 active positive patients. Of the 72,727 patients so far, 70,908 — including 5 on Saturday — have recovered. The test positivity rate is 10.66% and the death rate is 2.46%. The daily positivity rate is 0.55%. Bhandara: Only 1 out of the 866 tests done in last 24 hours were positive in Bhandara district. As one patient recovered, the caseload of the district reached 59,485 and recoveries reached 58,320. Recovery rate has already surpassed the 98% mark. Only 36 patients are under treatment in Bhandara, the lowest in Vidarbha. Gondia: Eight new cases were reported, and eight patients recovered from the district on Saturday. 2,077 tests were conducted. Gondia now has 49 patients under treatment. No death was reported.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vaccination must to enter Church of North India schools||KOLKATA: Bishop Paritosh Canning, head of the Kolkata diocese of Church of North India that runs a number of schools in the city, has asked school heads not to allow any unvaccinated employee to enter the premises. A circular to this effect has gone out. “If you have to join work, get yourself vaccinated. All school heads have to ensure that no one enters the premises without a certificate,” Canning said. La Martiniere for Boys, where the bishop is the chairman of the board of governors, has a vaccination centre run by Belle Vue Clinic. Teachers and non-teaching staff of the diocese schools had been repeatedly alerted to get their jabs here. “No one can say that we did not make proper arrangements for vaccination of teachers and non-teaching staff well in advance. Reopening had to happen and we needed to be prepared,” he said. The circular also said schools have to be alert for vaccinations for children under 18. Once the process starts, schools will have to “make preparations” to ensure students are vaccinated. In all the 35 CNI churches, priests and workers have been vaccinated and though corporate services are not being held, parishioners can come pray individually. However, only the vaccinated are allowed to go in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccination-must-to-enter-cni-schools/articleshow/84101215.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The initiative began in Jaipur’s north district about a month ago, where women and girls from all walks of life joined the project. “Anyone from 15 to 70 years of age can volunteer to join the Suraksha Sakhi Yojana. We have created a WhatsApp group of participants for regular communication,” said DCP (North), Paris Deshmukh. The inaugural meetings of groups were held at different police stations including Vidhyadhar Nagar, Ramganj, Amber, Brahmpuri, Jalupura police stations. According to Deshmukh, the members of Suraksha Sakhi would work as a bridge between local police and women in distress. “We have also included NGOs involved in women’s rights and members of different self-help groups who work with women. They can shed light on any crime which a local police station may not be aware of,” Deshmukh said, adding that every police station will have a Suraksha Sakhi wing and a nodal officer deputed for the same. The wing will organise regular meetings with members to take stock of their problems. “Many times there are victims of domestic violence and other crimes who don’t come to the police station to seek help, but since NGOs, self-help groups work with women round the clock, they can alert us about a women in crisis and the local police station can intervene,” he said. Jaipur police said that the new project includes widespread awareness drives at the local level. “The nodal officer along with the SHOs will explain in detail about women’s rights, legal remedies. We are also sharing other important information related to women’s security,” Deshmukh told STOI, adding that police stations where these wings have been established are working on women-related issues on a priority basis. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/suraksha-sakhi-to-track-crimes-against-women/articleshow/84103572.cms||---

Though Kurban was strangled a fortnight back at village Parsa under Kishanpur police station area in Supaul district, the police came to know about it on Thursday night and exhumed the body on Friday and got the postmortem conducted. Kishanpur police station SHO Suman Kumar on Saturday said Kurban’s wife Zubaida Khatoon was arrested and sent to jail on Friday for alleged involvement in her husband’s murder. “Kurban’s son Mohammad Mateen and daughter-in-law Ajmeri Khatoon, Ajmeri’s father Nasir Ansari and her brother Mohammad Zakir are evading arrest. Mateen went to Jaipur after killing his father to show that everything was normal. A team would be sent there to arrest him,” he said. The SHO said Kurban had not been keeping well for several years and the family members were annoyed over his illness. “Besides, the relationship between Kurban and his wife was not good. They always fought with each other. Also, Kurban wanted to sell two kattha land in the village for his daughter’s marriage which his other family members opposed,” he said. The SHO said all these reasons led to the situation that they murdered him. “He was buried in the house where woods are stored for cooking food. Kurban's wife has confessed to her crime,” he said. In fact, the villagers suspected foul play after they didn’t see Kurban for several days. “They quizzed Zubaida, who said he had gone to Jaipur with Mateem for treatment. A couple of villagers rang Mateem on several occasions and asked him to bring his father on line, but he did not,” the SHO said. He said that created suspicion in villagers’ minds and they barged into Kurban’s residence on Thursday night and found a suspicious spot which seemed like a grave and informed the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-killed-by-wife-kin-over-property-dispute/articleshow/84100819.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Arsenic removal plant set up in Saran village||PATNA: In a bid to provide clean drinking water, Patna-based Mahavir Cancer Sansthan and Research Centre with the help of Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute and WaterAid, Kolkata, has set up an arsenic removal plant at Sabalpur village in Saran district. “By installing this plant, we want to make sure that people in the area get access to safe water. There are various technologies to ensure protection from arsenic contamination of water. Another plant in Maner has been set up by Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, USA,” said Ashok Ghosh, professor and head of research department at Mahavir Cancer Sansthan and chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board. “The units are constructed using various technologies, which are extremely effective in removing arsenic and make water fit for consumption and irrigation,” he added. As per WHO’s study, Bihar is reported to be one of the worst affected states in India by arsenic contamination of groundwater. The amount of arsenic found in some districts in the state is above the permissible level of 10 parts per billion (ppb). “The arsenic contamination of groundwater is a big issue in Bihar, particularly in several districts along the Ganga belt, including Patna, Buxar, Maner, Bhojpur and Bhagalpur. In fact, 18 out of the 38 districts that we surveyed and researched have shown arsenic level in groundwater more than 10ppb, which is the permissible level prescribed by WHO,” Professor Ghosh said. Arsenic has been identified as carcinogenic (cancer causing agent) by WHO and it has also been associated with developmental effects, neurological and cardiovascular diseases, neurotoxicity and diabetes. “Arsenic is referred to as a ‘slow poison’ because its side-effects start appearing after three to four years of consumption. The early symptoms are of two types -- melanosis, which is white scars or spots on the skin, and keratosis, which causes blisters on the palm and the sole. There is no medicine to cure these symptoms. The only way to treat them is early detection and then providing the affected person with arsenic-free water, protein and fat-rich food and green vegetables as they may revert the symptoms,” Ghosh said. As per the WHO, the most important action in affected communities is the prevention of further exposure to arsenic by providing them safe drinking water for food preparation and irrigation of crops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/arsenic-removal-plant-set-up-in-saran-village/articleshow/84099303.cms||---

More than 94,000 teachers are to be appointed in 72,000 schools in the sixth phase before the Independence Day. Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said all the officials, including the chief secretary of Bihar, additional chief secretary of education department, directors of primary and secondary education, district magistrates, district education officers and district project officers have been asked to ensure the conduct of counselling of candidates in a transparent manner. “Everything is available on the internet both for the candidates as well as the officials concerned.

The counselling for urban bodies will be held on Monday and Tuesday, and for blocks and panchayats from July 8 to 12.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Fake vaccine recipients don’t show antibody||KOLKATA: Anxiety continued to haunt those who had taken the jab at the Kasba fake vaccination camp. None has so far developed any noticeable health problem, but around 50 of them got their antibody test done out of sheer concern. The report from a private hospital showed that none had developed any antibody of consequence, proving the shots were not of a Covid vaccine. Microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri said, “One or two were found with very low amount of antibodies. This could probably be because they had been infected earlier and were asymptomatic. People should register themselves on Co-Win and approach approved centres.” Madhyamgram resident Ranabir Ghosh had travelled to Kasba to get the jab at the camps organised by fake IAS officer Debanjan Deb. His delight at finally receiving a vaccine turned into distress when the racket was busted. Ghosh rushed to a lab attached with Peerless Hospital for an antibody test. “It was hard to believe as I did not find anything amiss at the camp. I got my antibody checked,” he said. A south Kolkata resident, Nirmal Roy, who also got “vaccinated” at the same camp, has not developed any antibody either. Kaushik Saha, who runs a garment shop at Kasba New Market, complained of stress though doctors said his health parameters were fine. Saha had taken the fake vaccine on June 17. “First, I heard it could be an antibiotic, and now, I hear, it might have been a steroid. I have developed peculiar rashes and don’t know if it is due to the injection,” said Saha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-vax-recipients-dont-show-antibody/articleshow/84101572.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Rikesh Tiwari, a resident of Shivaji Chowk in the Walled City area, had sent Jaipur police on a wild goose chase on Friday morning after he called up Galta Gate police station to inform that unidentified accused snatched his bag packed with precious items worth Rs 15 lakh. According to SHO, Galta Gate, police examined CCTV videos and spoke to locals, but found Tiwari’s claims to be highly contradictory. Police then quizzed Tiwari to deconstruct the crime and pinpoint the exact place where bike-borne youths allegedly snatched his bag. “Contradictions emerged during the preliminary investigation, making it amply clear that something was amiss. During the later half of the interrogation he revealed he had schemed the heist in order to avoid repaying his uncle,” Satish Chand told STOI. Tiwari had taken a loan of Rs 1 lakh from his uncle, Pradeep Sharma. As per the agreement, he had to repay the loan to Sharma on Thursday. According to police, Tiwari had earlier missed several deadlines, but promised his uncle that money would be delivered on Thursday. “He packed some artificial gems and stones into a bag and arrived at his uncle’s house. He showed Sharma that he would sell these precious items to repay the loan. Then he later plotted the story that his bag was stolen,” Satish Chand said, adding the accused tore apart his shirt to pretend that he had tried to fight with the alleged criminals.

Bhatt has been in jail since 2018 in connection with a drug-planting case. He questioned two government resolutions prohibiting telephone facilities for certain prisoners who are detained in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) and terrorism cases. The state government submitted that restrictions on prisoners meeting relatives have been lifted now after the reduction in Covid-19 cases. Moreover, Bhatt has availed of facilities such as e-mulakat, physical meetings as well as the telephone facility. Bhatt’s advocate submitted that the state’s policy should be unambiguous and it cannot deny the facility to all NDPS undertrials. The court issued notice to the state government asking it to reply in three weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bhatt-challenges-phone-curbs/articleshow/84101593.cms||---

The Bombay high court on Friday said Father Stan Swamy, the 84-year-old Jesuit priest and activist accused and arrested last year in the Elgar Parishad case, could continue his stay at a private hospital in Bandra till Tuesday. Meanwhile, Stan Swamy also filed a new challenge to the stringent provision of Section 43 D (5) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) that regulates grant of bail in cases where the Act and its terror offences are invoked. The provision bars granting of bail to an accused under UAPA if, after hearing the prosecution as well, the court draws a prima facie opinion that the accusations are true. He also sought directions to set aside the term ‘frontal organizations’ from the first schedule of UAPA, claiming it is used by prosecuting agencies to “blatantly and arbitrarily” oppose bail pleas. Stan Swamy’s bail plea was scheduled for hearing on Friday before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, but due to paucity of time, was adjourned to July 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stan-swamy-can-stay-in-hosp-till-next-hearing-in-mumbai-court/articleshow/84105666.cms||---

Indrajit Shaw (46), a resident of Tangra, was Deb’s employee. This is the ninth arrest in the case and the first related to the City College camp. The team also searched Deb’s Kasba office on Saturday and seized attendance registers, visitor slips, applications for jobs and fake tender documents. Shaw had earlier claimed he had met Deb during a puja at Taltala and was promised the job of a head clerk in his office. Police said Shaw was Deb’s close aide. He joined in March and drew a monthly salary of Rs 23,500. Shaw said when he fell ill at work, Deb gave him a medicine, claiming to have ranked 67th in the medical joint entrance exam. But, Shaw claimed, he had to hospitalized after having the pill. Police are also checking if Deb, who passed off antibiotic amikacin as Covishield, had passed off triamcinolone acetonide as Sputnik.

The meeting, coming days after Yadav said that his party would be aligning with smaller parties for the polls, resulted in many speculations about a possible tie-up, which were denied by Singh. “This was a courtesy visit to Yadav since I was not able to wish him personally on his birthday on July 1. We did discuss the current political situation in UP in context of the zila panchayat elections,” Singh said. On Twitter, Singh thanked Yadav for taking out time to meet him in the middle of the zila panchayat chairperson elections. “We discussed the repressive policies of BJP and its attempts to convert loktantra or democracy into loot tantra,” he said. After their meeting, pictures of which both leaders tweeted, Singh said that this was not his first meeting with Yadav and in their political discussion, the two spoke about how the zila panchayat chairperson elections held on Saturday were riddled with corruption. “If BJP is winning 25 seats unopposed, it is clear that the Yogi Adityanath government has hijacked these elections,” said Singh. AAP is currently in the midst of preparing to contest its first assembly polls in UP in 2022. In the recently concluded panchayat elections, the party-backed candidates claimed to have secured 40 lakh votes or about 8-10% of the total votes for the seats on which it contested. Its confidence stemming from this result, the party has said that it will be starting a massive membership drive across the state, taking the message of the Delhi model of administration to people. SP’s alliance with BSP for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls crashed after Mayawati pulled out, accusing SP of an anti-Dalit bias and its failure to transfer votes to BSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-mp-meets-akhilesh-triggers-poll-pact-rumour/articleshow/84105648.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Woman cop lodges rape case against RPS officer||JAIPUR: A 38-year-old woman head-constable, who was earlier arrested for allegedly blackmailing and extorting money from a DSP, has filed a rape case against the officer at Shastri Nagar police station. The woman in her FIR to police alleged that she had met DSP Shyam Sundar at Rajasthan Police Academy (RPA) when the latter was undergoing his Rajasthan Police Service (RPS) training two years ago. She alleged that the officer raped her when she was a trainee. “The constable lodged a complaint, based on which we registered an FIR,” said Shastri Nagar SHO Dilip Singh. Shastri Nagar police said the FIR was registered under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC and the case was under investigation. According to police, the DSP on May 3 had filed an FIR against the head-constable at Shastri Nagar police station. The officer alleged that the woman cop was threatening to file a rape case against him and asking Rs 50 lakh to remain quiet. The official also told cops that he had already paid over Rs 3 lakh because he feared that the head-constable might sully his image. Based on the preliminary investigation following the DSP’s FIR, the Shastri Nagar police had arrested the head-constable from Jodhpur in May, where she had gone for the training after being promoted from constable to head-constable. A senior official posted at Jaipur North told TOI that following her arrest, the head constable had recently walked out on bail. She later filed a detailed complaint which became the basis for an FIR against the DSP. “In this first complaint, the DSP had alleged that she was demanding money from him, after her arrest, she gave a fresh complaint of rape. We are investigating the case,” an official said.

Sleuths of ACB stated that the DA case against them would be put up in the court with the incriminating evidences to prove that their income is not from legitimate sources and will aim at taking it to logical conclusion. The officers are Pradeep Kumar Sharma, the inspector of Soorsagar police station in Jodhpur, Nirmal Kumar Goyal, executive engineer of JDA and Manish Kumar Sharma, district transport officer, Chittorgarh. ACB officials stated that every government officer has to declare his newly acquired asset or investment in January. “This income includes assets which these officers got from their relatives, including in-laws, or any other income from his family. So, in our case of DA, it is so far found that all the three officers in their self-declaration have not properly mentioned about the income they had attained. Also, their self-declaration of the income is much lesser than what our teams in searches have seized,” said B L Soni, director general, ACB said. “Our teams have studied various documents, bank statements and other things. In our investigation so far their income is disproportionate to what is their legitimate source of income. Also, we have not yet found any evidence that indicated any of these officers have possessed these income through gifts from their family members,” said Dinesh MN, additional director general (ADG), ACB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/seized-assets-more-than-officers-declared-income-says-acb/articleshow/84103645.cms||Ashish Mehta

The service has been set up by Porvorim Rising and Penha de Franca panchayat. Students living in all the three panchayats including Penha de Franca, Salvador do Mundo and Socorro, can avail the facility, which will be provided free of cost and on a first-cum-first serve basis. “The number has been kept limited keeping in mind social distance, sanitisation and use of masks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/digital-india-just-on-paper-kids-struggling-for-internet/articleshow/84103660.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Urban development minister and Mormugao MLA Milind Naik has asked the police to inquire into the matter as it could be due to poisoning. As per locals, during the last ten days, about 7 to 8 cows have been found dead on the road. Few claimed that they saw cows suddenly falling down on the ground and dying a slow death. People have reported at least one death per day. On Saturday, a cow was seen on the road gasping for breath. A veterinary doctor tried his level best, but could not save the animal. “To save other cattle from meeting similar fate, especially those who have no owners, it has been decided to send them to cattle pounds from Sunday. The owners should take care of their cattle and not leave them on the road, and later complain about them going missing,” said Naik. Mormugao PI Paresh Naik said, “We are conducting investigation into the issue. The animal husbandry department doctors have conducted a post-mortem of a cow on Friday and the report is awaited.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/death-of-7-8cows-at-sadacreates-panic/articleshow/84103669.cms||---
---||Goa||Trial court verdict marred by ‘sexual gossip’: Goa govt in Tejpal case||PANAJI: The Goa government has said the sessions court judgment acquitting Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal in the alleged rape case has been “consumed by sexual gossip” and the alleged “sexual fantasies” relating to the survivor that were legally prohibited. “The cross-examination of the survivor extending to almost 700 pages, spread over 18 dates of hearing, was nothing short of a brutal attack on her character and alleged past sexual history, designed to shame and humiliate her,” the state said in its amended application before the high court of Bombay at Goa. “Not only should these questions have been disallowed while recording evidence, the trial court has gone so far as to use these very questions and material to discredit her, although they were neither relevant to the case nor could they have been put to her under law,” the state said. The matter is likely to come up before the high court on July 29. The court will decide the application filed by the state seeking leave to appeal against the trial court judgment. While stating that the entire judgment focusses on indicting the survivor rather than trying to ascertain the culpable role of the accused, the application says that the 527-page judgment is influenced by extraneous, inadmissible materials and testimonies, and graphic details of her past sexual history, which are prohibited by law. The court has used the same to censure her character and discredit her evidence, the application said. “The court disbelieved the version of the prosecutrix (survivor) on the basis of a conception of how a victim is expected to behave while being sexually assaulted. This finding by the trial court is unsustainable in law and is coloured by prejudice and patriarchy,” the state said. The trial court also failed to appreciate the fact that the accused himself was editor-in-chief and owner of Tehelka magazine, a highly educated man in a position of power and authority, the application said. It also said that it is baffling that while the qualifications of the survivor and her work in matters relating to gender have been used against her, to discredit her testimony, the court has adopted no such standard while appreciating the farcical, belated, and wholly-dishonest defence of Tejpal that the emails of apology sent to the survivor were either not sent or were sent at the behest other persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trial-court-verdict-marred-by-sexual-gossip-goa-govt-in-tejpal-case/articleshow/84103668.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Petrol use down 16% in April, May||AHMEDABAD: Thanks to the restrictions on movement of people during the second wave of Covid-19, the consumption of petrol declined by a significant 16% in April and May. According to data provided by Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGPDA), petrol sales declined from 2.6 crore litres in March to 2.2 crore litres in April. Similarly, diesel sales went down from 6.08 crore litres to 5.05 crore litres during the same period. Against March, diesel sales declined by 17% in April and 18% in May, according to FGPDA estimates. Explaining this, Dhimant Ghelani, general secretary, FGPDA, said, “Due to the second wave, people were extremely reluctant in stepping out. Moreover, from time to time, curbs were imposed on public movement due to night curfew and restrictions on inter-state movement. Most offices were working from home again for most staffers. Local restrictions and lockdowns in other states too impacted movement. With little movement, fuel sale is bound to get impacted.” This is for the first time after the lockdown of 2020 that fuel consumption took such a massive hit. “Travel took a hit during April and May as most people deferred travel plans even to other cities, unless there is an emergency. Leisure as well as corporate movement took a hit too. Moreover, as the second wave hit, industrial production got impacted due to a decline in demand and as a consequence, transport movement too took a hit,” said Padmajay Rathod, an Ahmedabad-based petroleum dealer. In June however, the sales have marginally recovered as movement of persons resumed across the state with the easing of lockdown-like curbs that had been imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19 infections. Petrol price stood at Rs 96 per litre on Saturday whereas diesel price settled at Rs 96.03 per litre. Fuel prices surged by 10% since April 15 however, the surge in prices did not have a significant impact on sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/petrol-use-down-16-in-april-may/articleshow/84101624.cms||Niyati Parikh

The girl did not share the ordeal with her parents all this while but confided in them on Friday and the family lodged an FIR at the Ramgarh police station. According to police, the girl had gone to feed fodder to the cattle at 9pm on June 29 when the accused — identified as Aazad, Waseem and Razzak — overpowered her and took her away from her home. “She was gang-raped by them and they threatened her to keep mum else to get ready to face dire consequences,” said a senior police officer while quoting the FIR. The minor girl, however, in a state of shock, did not share the incident with her parents. However, seeing her dull and changes in her behaviour led her mother to enquire her. “On Friday, the girl narrated her plight and told her mother that she was gang-raped by three persons. Later, the girl along with her family visited us and lodged an FIR in this connection,” the officer added. The girl also stated in the FIR that her father is usually away from home since he works as a driver and that her mother is a daily wager. “We have lodged a case against the accused under appropriate sections of the Pocso Act and the IPC. The medical examination of the girl has also been completed. On Saturday, her 164 CrPC statements were also registered and a massive hunt has been launched to nab the accused persons,” said Om Prakash Meena, deputy superintendent of police, Alwar (South). The family also informed the police that they have been pressurised by the family of the accused persons to withdraw the case and take some money instead. “They are also threatening the family. We have now lodged the case and have assured the rape survivor and her family that the accused would be arrested soon. Raids were conducted at the residential premises of the accused, who are now on the run,” the officer added.

Ghosh claimed he had merely registered himself on the Co-Win platform and booked himself a slot to get vaccinated at a private hospital in south Kolkata when the shocking SMS arrived. Ghosh says just before he was to leave for the hospital to take the first dose, he got a message stating that he had received both the doses. He contacted the hospital, which initially denied the possibility of this happening. When he provided the evidence, the hospital promised to look into the matter. Ghosh has informed both police and Swasthya Bhawan about the incident. Around 25 employees of two private IT and pharma analysis firms have also received similar messages even though they were not even present during the vaccination drive at a hospital near Chingrighata. The hospital has since issued a letter of regret. But it is yet to make any alternative arrangements to vaccinate them. IT experts said the problem could have arisen due to technical glitches on the Co-Win portal or error at the time of data being entered. “They don’t appear to be fraudulent entries. There could be errors during the database recreation and data migration. It’s not clear where the error has occurred,” said a cyber expert who doubles as a cyber lawyer in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shot-confirmation-messages-arrive-before-cov-jab/articleshow/84101630.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He added that the college would offer research facilities for study on the causes of disability and treatment facilities, especially for differently-abled. The government said it would also organise sports events like Asiad Games and international paralympics for them. The stadium, equipped with special facilities, will provide a training ground to those with special needs and serve as a venue for future events. “Divyang players will get ample opportunity to hone talent and showcase it at international level. The government will organise competitions like Asiad and Paralympics which will give Divyang players a new identity,” a government spokesperson said. Registrar of SMNRU, Amit Kumar Singh, said special arrangements had been made at the stadium for differently abled players. “Floodlights have been installed so that games can also be organised during the night. There will be live broadcasts of sporting events and arrangements will be made for sports like badminton, wrestling and basketball. The stadium has a gym and an athletics track. Football matches can also be organized here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/indias-1st-stadium-for-physically-challenged-in-lucknow-soon/articleshow/84105695.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: AUDA clears 3 Town Planning roads for Shela||AHMEDABAD: The Shela area in Ahmedabad is now getting three additional road stretches as part of its designated Town Planning (TP) scheme. The roads are for the upcoming residential areas, institutional zones, and commercial streets. They will be 12 metres wide, 18 metres wide, and 30 metres wide respectively. In all, the project will cost Rs 15.77 crore. The construction of the roads will be undertaken by AUDA. AUDA had begun the construction of a four-lane 36 metre wide road in September last year that crisscrossed the newly made TPs 1, 2, and 3. “The process of laying civic lines along these designated TP roads is underway,” a senior AUDA official said. “Several residential projects were earmarked along these roads and we had to speed up. We have already suffered a seven-month delay on the road project.” Several representations have been made to the AUDA chairman since July last year on the quality of roads in the Shela area. “Shela comes under the 24x7 water supply zone, and two large overhead tanks are planned in the area,” the official said. “Once the roads come up, we will lay the water supply lines alongside them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/auda-clears-3-tp-roads-for-shela/articleshow/84101661.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni heard a PIL by Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa to permit lawyers, citing hardships caused to them due to non-access to trains. The judges said having heard state Covid-19 task force members at an administrative meeting on July 1, it will not be possible to allow them. They said council’s members who were present “accepted that till July it will not be possible to allow travel”.

---||Chandigarh||Sikhs preferred Cong over BJP in 2019, most consider religious diversity good for country||Jalandhar: Sikhs preferred Congress over BJP in the 2019 election, the ‘Modi wave’ was visible in only two seat and Sikhs are more likely than other religious communities to see communal violence as a very big problem in the only ountry. These are the findings of the recent US-based Pew Research Centre report, "Religion in India: Tolerance and Segregation". "The BJP has attempted to financially compensate Sikhs for some of the violence that occurred in 1984 after Indira Gandhi’s assassination, but relatively few Sikh voters (19%) report having voted for the BJP in the 2019 parliamentary elections. The survey finds that 33% of Sikhs preferred the Indian National Congress Party – Gandhi’s party," the report has noted. Findings of the survey match polling patterns in Punjab in 2014 and 2019 elections when Modi wave worked only at two Hindu majority seats in Punjab – Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur – and Sikh voters played crucial role in getting Congress eight out of 13 seats in 2019 as they were also angry with Shiromani Akali Dal over the sacrilege and police firing issues of 2015. "At the same time, Sikhs are more likely than other religious communities to see communal violence as a very big problem in the country. Nearly 8-in-10 Sikhs (78%) rate communal violence as a major issue, compared with 65% of Hindus and Muslims," the Pew report has noted. The report has made another interesting finding about Sikh attitudes on passing the tradition of keeping unshorn hair down to their children and their political leanings. Sikhs who say they voted for BJP in the 2019 parliamentary elections are much more likely than those who voted for the Congress to say Sikh children should keep their hair uncut (81% vs. 56%). Among those who voted for Shiromani Akali Dal, a Sikh party, 65% say it is very important for children that their family keep their hair long, the report says. It says that about three-quarters of Sikh men and women in India favoured long hair (76%), and two-thirds say it is very important to them that children in their families also keep their hair long (67%). "Caste also is linked with attitudes on this issue. If 76% of general category Sikhs say it is very important for their children to have long hair, 59% of those belonging to lower castes prescribed to this view," the report adds on the issue. Cases of sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib relegated SAD to third place in 2017 assembly elections and now has the ruling Congress facing heat for ‘failing to deliver justice in the cases’. The Pew survey has thrown up the finding that vast majority of Sikhs (94%) regard their holy book as the word of God, and many (37%) say they read it, or listen to recitations of it, every day. It has also noted "Sikhs are more likely than Indian adults overall to say they attend religious services every day – 40% of Sikhs say they go to the gurdwara daily. By comparison, 14% of Hindus say they go to the temple every day." Sikhs are proud to be Punjabi and Indian The Pew report says as 77% of Sikhs in India live in Punjab and comprise 58% of state’s population, 93% of Punjabi Sikhs say they are very proud to live in the state and 95% of Sikhs say they are very proud to be Indian. Most Sikhs do not see evidence of widespread discrimination against their community – just 14% say Sikhs face a lot of discrimination in India, and 18% say they personally have faced religious discrimination in the last year, the report notes. Sikhs have most negative view on Partition "Of the country’s six major religious groups, Sikhs have the most negative view of the role Partition played in Hindu-Muslim relations: Nearly two-thirds (66%) say it was a bad thing." Top in considering religious diversity good for India "Majority of Sikhs (60%), Muslims (56%) and Jains (55%) say religious diversity benefits India. Meanwhile, fewer than half of Buddhists (46%) and Christians (44%) take this position." Sikhs at top in believing ‘many can be true religions’ The predominant view among Hindus, Christians, Sikhs and Buddhists is that ‘many can be true religions’ and 55% Sikhs expressed this view. Jains are about evenly divided on this question. However, Muslims have the largest share who take the position "My religion is the one true religion" (51%). Sikhs more inclined to find common ground with others Generally, Sikhs are more inclined than others to say they have a lot in common with all groups asked about in the survey. 23% say they have a lot in common with all other religious groups, compared with just 11% of Hindus who see common ground with all five groups. While 52% of Sikhs say they have a lot in common with Hindus, while just 20% of Hindus say the same about Sikhs. In the North, fully one-in-five Hindus say they have worshipped at a gurdwara. Sikhs are the most likely to say they have a lot in common with Muslims – 36% of Sikhs say this, but the majority view (55%) is that they are very different from Muslims (55%). For stopping inter-religious marriages The report notes that most Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Jains strongly favour stopping inter-religious marriage. 58% of the Sikhs say it is very important to stop men in their community from marrying outside and 59% have this view for Sikh women. Muslims top this thinking as 76% think men should be stopped from doing this 80% say women should not go for interreligious marriages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sikhs-preferred-cong-over-bjp-in-2019-most-consider-religious-diversity-good-for-country/articleshow/84105729.cms||IP Singh

Jaipur Met office on Saturday said conditions were conducive for the progress of monsoon in the state from next week, which had entered Rajasthan on June 18. Mercury took a dip across the state following rainfall at many places including Alwar, Dausa and Sawai Madhopur districts. Churu remained the hottest on Saturday logging 42.1°C. “Conditions would be favourable for the arrival of monsoon in Jaipur and other nearby districts from Monday onwards. Hopefully, the city will witness monsoon rainfall by next week,” a weatherman said. Though southwest monsoon entered the state on June 18, its progress so far has been very slow. “Due to various cyclonic effects and western disturbances, monsoon has been weak in the state. Hopefully from next week, southwest monsoon will progress to other parts in the state,” the Met said. In this season so far, rainfall has remained deficit.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority to start fencing Maa flyover flanks||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has planned to take up work to fix wires over both flanks of Maa flyover on the most vulnerable 900 metre long stretch, from Topsia crossing to the approach of 4 No. bridge, to prevent kite manja accidents on the flyover. On Thursday, a couple fell off a two wheeler and got injured when a kite string struck their faces after getting entangled in the wheels. KMDA officials said that they have initiated the process to engage an agency for the work. Earlier the authorities had fixed wires consisting of vertical poles and three layers of horizontal wires on a 30 meter stretch of the flyover as a pilot project which has been much appreciated. Police said that the long stretch between Parama Island and the 7-point crossing has become specially dangerous with over 90 percent kite string accidents being reported from here. “Under such circumstances, we have made some recommendations that include two major modifications. We have requested them to cover the entire Maa flyover stretch to set up such poles and wires. Among the modifications, we have recommended that additional three layers of wires may be installed to cover the lower portion closer to the railing to stop any chances of riders falling over. Similarly, the iron bars installed to set up the wires may be wrapped with retro-reflectors to warn riders, especially in the monsoon season when two-wheelers tend to skid,” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. The top brass of Kolkata traffic police has reintroduced a five-man police team to keep an eye on kite threads on the flyover. They have requested KMDA yet again to immediately implement a few measures that can help cut down such accidents. KMDA officials said that the plan is to install four meter high poles connected with lightweight aluminium wires alongside the crash barrier of Maa flyover instead of heavyweight frame and covering with polycarbonate sheeting which may not be ideal to resist high wind pressure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmda-to-start-fencing-maa-flyover-flanks/articleshow/84101676.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

They were evicted on Thursday as their operations hindered the flow of traffic to the hospital. Highway expansion work is underway in the area, and the stretch in front of the state’s premier healthcare facility is prone to severe traffic snarls. On Saturday morning, the fruit vendors challenged police to forcefully remove them. Fernandes and Silveira, along with the sarpanch and deputy sarpanchas from their constituencies, were at the spot, and a verbal exchange between the elected representatives and the administration went on for half an hour.“We helped the fruit vendors and a few tender coconut sellers to conduct their business, to sit there in such a way that they will not obstruct traffic. Though police objected, after the CM’s instructions, they were allowed to sit there. We — Fernandes and I — also met the CM in the afternoon. He has called for a meeting on Monday to discuss the rehabilitation of the evicted operators,” Silveira later TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fruit-vendors-back-outside-gmc/articleshow/84103744.cms||---

Police have refuted his charges claiming that these are pressure tactics to keep cops at bay. Sheku, who also has three cases of dacoity bid, was picked up by crime branch on June 24 after Mecosabagh, Gond Mohalla and Sindhi Colony residents lodged complaints against him with city police chief Amitesh Kumar in last week on May. The letter was also marked to chief minister, state home minister, state director general of police (DGP) and others. The letter signed by eight persons, mentioned Sheku’s so-called activities that had “made life of local residents, especially women, miserable”. The residents had sought intervention of police against sale of illegal liquor, criminal activities and attacks on women. Photograph of Shekhu with injuries on back and his letter against cops was circulating in many social media groups last week. Shekhu was not reachable despite attempts by TOI. Sheku in his letter claimed three cops had rounded him up on basis of a complaint of Rs25 lakh extortion “which they could not prove”. He also wrote that cops relentlessly tortured him and he had to seek medical assistance. Shekhu was allowed to go on June 24 and again called the next day. According to a crime branch official, Sheku was refusing to cooperate and visit the special unit’s office to record statement. “We had to concoct a story to bring him to the crime branch office where he was asked about the illegal activities as mentioned in the complaint against him. The cops had to send him back the previous day as there was a pressing need to divert attention elsewhere,” said an officer. A crime branch source said Sheku was not manhandled but asked to fill-up a dossier while replying to various issues. “We are clueless about how and when Sheku sustained injuries,” said the cop. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said he would look into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-having-several-offences-alleges-police-torture/articleshow/84103677.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Goa: A government headmaster shows kids how to be Covid superheroes||PANAJI: Dressed in a Superman-like outfit, a young boy urges children to ensure their parents do not loiter around the house without a bath after returning from work. The boy in a cape is the brainchild of a government school headmaster. Convinced that only children in every home can ensure prevention of the third wave, head of Government high school, Merces, Vishal Signapurkar, has designed a booklet meant to inspire kids to act as ‘Covid superheroes’. Signapurkar roped in teachers from nearby aided institutions and designed the content on how children can help prevent the spread of Covid-19 infections. He then got the material vetted by GMC’s Dr Kedareshwar Narvecar, as also officials of the directorate of health services. The creation has now taken the shape of a booklet, which is meant for distribution among school students across Goa. The illustrations of a young boy and girl in a cape were created with the help of three art teachers — Vishwaroop Naik, Yogesh Patekar and Praveen Naik, from different schools, to make the material appealing to children. “The booklet content is available in Konkani, Marathi and English. It will now be distributed in all school complexes and super school complexes in Goa to be passed on to students,” said Signapurkar. I plan to hold different online and physical programmes to train any willing school teachers in how to make young Covid superheroes out of our children. The content will also be provided to anyone who wants to get it printed and distribute it among students below the age of 18,” said Signapurkar. During the first wave of Covid, the headmaster got himself and his school teachers involved in providing online training to around 900 participants from Canacona to Mapusa, to dispel misconceptions about Covid. It helped that he is an authorised trainer with the Goa institute of public administration and rural development (GIPARD). “I saw during the second wave of the pandemic the way doctors were struggling to help parents. I thought prevention is a better option. There is a child in almost every home, and if we are able to train these children to act as Covid superheroes, it can be a very effective prevention. They can be made aware to ask their parents to wear a mask when leaving home or to not to forward messages with misinformation,” said Signapurkar. He felt that schools in Goa are in a better position than anywhere else in the country to implement such a programme. “Teachers are more accessible here to students, and children share a good bond with them and are more receptive to them,” said Signapurkar, whose booklet was released by director of education DR Bhagat on Thursday. Also, being a trainer with GIPARD, the headmaster is looking forward to offering free training to anyone willing to learn how to train children to be Covid warriors. “Any such training will be provided by me free of cost. I only want more people and schools to come forward and approach me, as I feel Goa can set an example for the rest of the country. Noone is truly safe from Covid-19 until everyone is safe. We can stop the spread of Covid-19 by propagating the message of Dawai Bhi, Kadai Bhi through children, our Covid superheroes,” said Signapurkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-govt-headmaster-shows-kids-how-to-be-covid-superheroes/articleshow/84103737.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The commission has kept the children in quarantine and questioned a renowned NGO why the child panel was not kept in the loop regarding the kids being brought from Patna to Jaipur in a train. While a FIR has been registered, no one has been arrested in the case of child trafficking yet. Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “The NGO officials claimed that before the children boarded the train in Bihar, they had information that they were being brought for labour, but instead of informing local police, they got in touch with railway police, which makes no sense. Moreover, the NGO also could not explain as to why we were not told about this matter when they had prior information. I have also asked them to give details regarding these questions along with the reason for not deboarding the children or informing the authorities at the railway stations between Patna and Jaipur.”The boys aged between 8-15 years old are now being accommodated at the government-run shelter here. “The NGO had written to the railway police when the children boarded the train on June 30 as if they had already planned that they will be rescued in Jaipur. The children are quite young and being looked after at the shelter,” added Beniwal.In the past two years, approximately 3,000 children have been rescued from labour in Rajasthan out of which majority were boys and over 1,000 persons have been arrested since 2019. Close to 1,000 children who were rescued hailed from states outside Rajasthan and were brought here under various pretext to work in hotels, factories and other forms of employment and experts claimed that majority of children were brought from Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rescued-kids-were-to-work-in-bangle-units-bought-for-rs-4k-each/articleshow/84103753.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Water cannon man Navdeep Singh, his father of Jalbera expelled by BKU Haryana Charuni||Ambala: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Haryana (Charuni) on Friday expelled Navdeep Singh and his father Jai Singh of Jalbera village in Ambala district from their union over alleged charges of misuse of union funds and violation of discipline during the farmers’ protest on January 26 in Panchkula. Notably, Navdeep Singh had hit the national news after he had climbed to the top of Haryana police water cannon and turned it off while changing its target during the ‘Delhi Chalo’ call of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha on November 25, 2020, near Mohra village in Ambala Cantonment area on national highway (NH) 44. BKU Haryana (Charuni) state spokesman Rakesh Kumar Bains on Friday released a video giving information about the expulsion of Navdeep Singh and his father. In the video, BKU Haryana (Charuni) Yamunanagar district president Sanju Gundiana is accompanied by union’s Ambala district president Malkiat Singh Sahibpura and Ganna Sangharsh Samiti leader Vinod Rana of Khuda village in Ambala district. In the video, Sanju Gundiana said, “During the protest on January 26 in Panchkula, some indiscipline came to notice and some workers attempted to break the barricades. A five-member committee was formed by Gurnam Singh Charuni to investigate this matter. Yesterday (on Thursday), the committee held its meeting and those accused of indiscipline including Jai Singh Jalbera and (his son) Navdeep Singh Jalbera were called by the committee for investigation.” “Navdeep refused to appear before the committee while (his father) Jai Singh came to attend the probe. Records were sought from Jai Singh about the funds that he had collected for the union and ambiguities were found in the same and he failed to provide the satisfactory details,” said Gundiana. About the alleged abuses hurled by Jai and Navdeep in Panchkula, Gundiana said, “They spoke wrong about our presidents and the union. They walk on a different path from the union. They have been involved in such undisciplined acts two times earlier as well, which caused loss to the union. They were warned twice and spared. But they did not listen and their undisciplined acts continued.” When contacted Jai Singh said, “We will continue to support the farmers’ protest. We have submitted all the records to the union and accept the decision taken by the farm leaders. Meanwhile, Navdeep said, “We have not misused funds and provided all the documents to the union. They are alleging that we misused Rs 25,000. This amount is nothing for us, as we own about 20 acres of land.” When asked about alleged indiscipline, Navdeep said, “We accept that we have abused Gurnam Singh Charuni and Yogendra Yadav in anger during heated arguments on June 26 in Panchkula protest. The reason is that on the other side the farmers of Punjab had broken the barricades and reached the governor house. Whereas, Haryana farmers, who had reached Panchkula in large numbers, were asked to hold back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/water-cannon-man-navdeep-singh-his-father-of-jalbera-expelled-by-bku-haryana-charuni/articleshow/84105772.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP-backed candidates sweep Uttar Pradesh zila parishad chief polls||LUCKNOW: Just a few months ahead of the high-stake UP assembly elections, the BJP received a shot in the arm as the party-supported candidates won 66 out of 75 seats in the Zila Panchayat chairman elections. As many as 21 of them had already won unopposed -- including in Varanasi and Gorakhpur -- at the time of nomination last week while the party-backed candidates emerged victorious on 45 out of 53 seats the polling for which was conducted on Saturday. A candidate backed by its ally Apna Dal won another seat, taking the NDA's tally to 67. Apna Dal (S)-backed candidate Rita Patel, however, faced a defeat in Jaunpur where independent candidate Srikala Reddy, wife of mafia-turned-politician Dhananjay Singh emerged winner. The Anupriya Patel-led party candidate Radhika Patel though won from Sonebhadra, defeating SP's Jai Prakash Pandey alias Chokhur Pandey. Immediately after the results were declared, Prime Minister Narednra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, BJP chief JP Nadda Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, UP BJP in charge Radha Mohan Singh and state party chief Swatantra Dev Singh hailed the landslide victory of BJP-backed candidates. However, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav called it a 'blatant misuse of power’ by the ruling party. Samjawadi Party-backed candidates could win only five seats, including Etawah, which the Akhilesh Yadav-led party won unopposed after BJP did not field its candidate. The other seats SP-supported candidates won were Etah, Sant Kabirnagar, Azamgarh and Ballia. The party in power has a distinct advantage in the zila panchayat president polls and even those who win as Independents often side with the ruling dispensation for obvious reasons, says a political analyst. "But even then SP's defeat in its strongholds like Mainpuri, Kannauj, Badaun, Firozabad and Farrukhabad is a big setback to the party which claims to be the biggest challenger to the BJP in the forthcoming assembly elections," he adds. The electoral battle in the rural local bodies largely remained a one-sided contest in favour of the BJP which not only received the support of independents but also of BSP- backed ward members after party chief Mayawati positioned herself squarely against her bête noire, SP, and announced of not contesting the ZP chairman elections. There were also reports of SP-backed members cross-voting in favour of the BJP, notably in Ayodhya. BJP's win was especially significant in Ayodhya and Mathura -- epicentre of Hindutva politics -- where the BJP had faced a formidable challenge from the opposition, mainly the SP, during ZP ward elections. On Saturday, however, BJP-backed candidates sailed through easily in both the districts. In Ayodhya, BJP's Roli Singh, considered close to local MP Lallu Singh, defeated SP backed Indu Sen Yadav, the daughter-in-law of SP strongman and former MP, late Mitra Sen Yadav. Likewise, in Mathura, BJP-supported Kisan Singh defeated RLD's Rajendra Singh Sikarwar. The Jayant Chaudhary-led political outfit, however, had its supported candidate, Mamta, winning from Baghpat, west UP district from where it contested after striking an unannounced alliance with the SP. A keen contest was seen in Unnao where BJP-backed candidate Shakun Singh -- widow of slain SP MLC, Ajit Singh -- defeated independent candidate Arun Singh, considered close to expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Senger, who is in jail on charges of raping a minor. The BJP had earlier backed Arun but retracted after the Unnao rape survivor wrote to PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanth. In fact, the BJP had first announced to back Sangeeta, wife of Kuldeep Senger, for the ZP ward polls. The party, however, cancelled her candidature after a hue and cry. The BJP-supported candidates also won in Congress pocket borough of Rae Bareli (Ranjana Chaudhary) and Amethi (Rajesh Agrahari). Rajesh happens to be a local businessman engaged in manufacture of spices. Reacting to poll results, CM Yogi said that the victory of BJP-supported candidates was a reflection of public centric policies and measures taken by PM Narendra Modi. "It was also an indication of people's confidence in `sushashan' of the ruling BJP. This would strengthen the Panchayati Raj system in the state," Yogi said in a tweet. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said that it was because of the hard work of party workers and popularity of PM Modi and CM Yogi which led to victory of BJP backed candidates. Though not contested on party symbols, the rural local bodies polls had turned into a contest of prestige after BJP formally announced its supported candidates, stoking a political frenzy in the opposition camp, mainly the SP. Experts said that BJP would further up its efforts in increasing its footprints in the rural precincts which would determine its electoral prospects in the 2022 assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-candidates-sweep-zp-chief-polls-win-66-of-75-seats/articleshow/84105756.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Goa||Goa: Vaccination drive begins for Nepalese nationals||PANAJI: The directorate of health services began vaccination of Nepalese nationals and those without photo IDs on Saturday, prompting 750 people in Panaji and at least 250 in Siolim to get their first dose against Covid-19 by the end of the day. “The drive will continue in Panaji on Sunday as the vaccination of all 2,000 people who reported at the vaccination site in the city could not be completed,” Dr Rajendra Borkar, a district immunisation officer told TOI. Borkar said they have taken up vaccination of Nepalese nationals after the central government issued a circular three days ago and the district administration was asked to identify potential beneficiaries and inform them about the vaccination programme. The drive will also be held in South Goa. Those without photo identities, he said, are vaccinated by using a phone number and the photo identity of a facilitating officer from the district office. Others who are vaccinated without having photo identity proofs are beggars and nomads. They have not received a direction to vaccinate foreign nationals — even those with Aadhaar cards — or OCI cardholders who are currently in Goa. He said though foreigners holding Aadhaar cards may report for vaccination, their passports will not be accepted on the portal. “They want their passport to be linked, but it can’t be done as theirs and our digits will not tally. I have made the officers aware of this difficulty,” he said. Vaccinating foreigners with Aadhaar cards is also not as per the guidelines, he said. An expert committee on Friday suggested that foreign nationals in the state and who are above 18 years of age be given an opportunity to get inoculated However, the officer said they will not able to do it unless there are clear instructions from the government. “Even though the expert committee has recommended that foreigners in Goa have to be vaccinated, there needs to be a written approval of the government for that to happen,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vax-drive-begins-for-nepalese-nationals/articleshow/84103768.cms||---

The commission has kept the children in quarantine and questioned a renowned NGO why the child panel was not kept in the loop regarding the kids being brought from Patna to Jaipur in a train. While a FIR has been registered, no one has been arrested in the case of child trafficking yet. Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “The NGO officials claimed that before the children boarded the train in Bihar, they had information that they were being brought for labour, but instead of informing local police, they got in touch with railway police, which makes no sense. Moreover, the NGO also could not explain as to why we were not told about this matter when they had prior information. I have also asked them to give details regarding these questions along with the reason for not deboarding the children or informing the authorities at the railway stations between Patna and Jaipur.” The boys aged between 8-15 years old are now being accommodated at the government-run shelter here. “The NGO had written to the railway police when the children boarded the train on June 30 as if they had already planned that they will be rescued in Jaipur. The children are quite young and being looked after at the shelter,” added Beniwal. In the past two years, approximately 3,000 children have been rescued from labour in Rajasthan out of which majority were boys and over 1,000 persons have been arrested since 2019.  Close to 1,000 children who were rescued hailed from states outside Rajasthan and were brought here under various pretext to work in hotels, factories and other forms of employment and experts claimed that majority of children were brought from Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bihar-kids-rescued-in-jaipur-were-bought-for-rs-4000-each/articleshow/84103770.cms||---

On Friday, Nandini Kataria, a class XI student from Hill Spring International School, Tardeo, helped 1,110 villagers of Dhokawade get vaccinated for free by raising Rs 12 lakh from wealthy bungalow owners, and coordinating with the local panchayat and the collector’s office for the drive. The Katarias, who have a second home in Alibaug, organised a special drive on June 14 to vaccinate staff working in the bungalows in Dhokawade village. That is when Nandini heard the staff complain about inability to get vaccination slots due to a shortage of vaccines. “I got in touch with members of Dhokawade panchayat to understand the problems in Alibaug, and was shocked to find that barely any in the 18-44 age group had received vaccines,’’ she said. “I also found that few in the 222 villages in Alibag were vaccinated,’’ she added. The teenager approached Apollo Hospitals in Navi Mumbai for the vaccination and bungalow owners of Dhokawade for contributions. “We were surprised to see a young girl leading the vaccine initiative, but it was a heartening initiative,’’ said an official of Apollo Hospital. She has already gathered funds from bungalow owners for free vaccination on Tuesday for handicapped and mentally challenged residents of Alibaug. After the vaccination drive in Dhokawade village, the panchayat of Sasawane village also reached out to Nandini. “I am now helping them collect funds from Sasawane bungalow owners,’’ she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-churchgate-girl-raises-rs-12-lakh-to-vaccinate-villagers-from-alibaug/articleshow/84105820.cms||---
---||Goa||Mapusa Urban yet to repay us, depositors say||Panaji: Rubbishing claims by Mapusa Urban Co-op Bank (MUCB) of Goa that claims of all the depositors of the bank had been settled, some of the depositors said that many depositors who had anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 5 lakh as deposits are still waiting for their funds. In a statement, the depositors claimed that over 7,000 claims which were cleared for disbursement to the depositors were rejected by Bank of Baroda due to discrepancies and are being re-examined again. MUCB, which lost its banking licence in April 2020, has begun disbursing depositors’ funds through Bank of Baroda, after the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) audited and cleared the disbursement. “Approximately 7,000 claims submitted by MUCB to Bank of Baroda, Mapusa, are returned due to various discrepancies overlooked by MUCB and are being re-examined again,” said Joseph Carneiro, one of the former bank’s customers. “Customers who had deposits of Rs 5 lakh and above, their disbursement is yet to see the light of the day and remains only an illusion.” The depositors are also irked by the One-Time Settlement (OTS) scheme offered to the loan defaulters, who the depositors blame for the bank’s downfall. Liquidator and former IAS bureaucrat Anthony De Sa has offered defaulters to apply for the OTS scheme by July end and has also given them a maximum of three months to repay the loans. Prior to this, the earlier liquidator, former finance secretary and IAS bureaucrat Daulat Hawaldar had also given the defaulters time to repay their dues and the defaulters have got a total of 520 days to repay their loans. “The frequent deliberate extensions of OTS to defaulters and wilful defaulters by MUCB liquidators has become a regular feature and well-rehearsed premeditated exercise apparently solely to protect defaulters allegedly suspected to be close associates of the management accused by the Reserve Bank of India of gross irregularities that led to the order cancelling its banking licence,” said Prabhakar Salgaonkar, another depositor. The depositors said that they were disappointed with the liquidation process and said that De Sa, who was appointed in April, has yet to meet the delegation of depositors. “MUCB allocates loans to wilful defaulters, thereafter there is no attempt to penalise and recover the bad debts or NPA, followed by announcements of OTS for very same defaulters allowing them to go scot-free at cost of depositors who entrusted their hard earned money with the bank,” said Dr Kunda Quenim, one of the depositors who along with Carneiro, has approached the Goa Human Rights Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-urban-yet-to-repay-us-depositors-say/articleshow/84103925.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||‘Biomethanation plant only way out for Sonsoddo dump’||Margao: The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) on Saturday delivered a grim prognosis for the solid waste management situation for Margao. At a presentation on the current situation at the city’s waste treatment facility as Sonsoddo, and the proposed remedial measures, GSPCB’s environmental engineer Sanjeev Joglekar said that the current pace and method of treatment of wet waste at Sonsoddo could be only lead to a creation of another mountain of residual waste, thereby nullifying all efforts of clearing the legacy dump. The Goa Waste Management Corporation is currently entrusted with the task of bioremediation of the legacy waste dump at Sonsoddo. Joglekar however said that setting up a 50 TPD (tonnes per day) capacity biomethanation plant at Sonsoddo was the ultimate solution for the city’s solid waste management. Since Fomento Green exited Sonsoddo, following the termination of its contract with Margao Municipal Council (MMC), the civic body has been handling the waste treatment plant on its own using windrows composting method. However, MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernandes candidly admitted during the presentation, in the presence of Margao MLA Digambar Kamat and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, that the civic body had “failed” in the task. Joglekar advised the municipality to rope in an experienced private agency to handle the day-to-day incoming wet waste at Sonsoddo. However, with the prevailing constraints at the site, this suggestion was met with skepticism by municipal engineers. Both, Kamat and Sardesai, agreed to the GSPCB’s suggestion and asked the MMC chief officer to coordinate with GSPCB in inviting expressions of interest (EoI) from experienced agencies for treating the wet waste. Kamat later told reporters that setting up of a 50 TPD biomethanation plant at Sonsoddo was decided by the high-powered oordination Committee (HPCC) on Sonsoddo at its last meeting held a few months back. “However, as work on the plant will start only after monsoons, what is urgently required is to put in order the mechanism to handle daily incoming wet waste at Sonsoddo until then. It was, therefore, agreed to handover the operations to a private agency for which an EOI will be floated by the MMC,” Kamat said. Tenders for the 50 TPD plant will be invited after monsoons, he said, for which GSPCB will guide the MMC. MMC , nonetheless, will go ahead with setting up the five TPD biomethanation plant at the South Goa PDA fish market that is being undertaken by the Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA), 50 percent work of which has been completed, Kamat said. “Depending on the working and performance of the first five TPD biomethanation plant set up by GSUDA, decision about the proposed other two such plants will be taken,” Kamat said. The GSPCB will certify the plant’s working and performance. Sardesai said that all cooperation will be extended to the MMC and the government to set up the bomethanation plant at Sonsoddo. “We are of the view that there should be no politics over Sonsoddo,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biomethanation-plant-only-way-out-for-sonsoddo-dump/articleshow/84103803.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Enforcement Directorate searches to track foreign funds in illegal conversions||NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: The Enforcement Directorate conducted searches at six places across Delhi and UP on Saturday in a money laundering investigation related to alleged ‘forced conversions’ in UP. The Anti-Terrorist Squad of the UP Police had earlier filed an FIR in the case and arrested six accused, including Umar Gautam and Mufti Qazi Jahangir Qasmi. On June 25, ED registered a case of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, against Mohammed Umar Gautam and Mufti Qazi Jahangir Qasmi and Islamic Dawah Centre (IDC) in Delhi’s Jamia Nagar. Both accused are in custody of the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad. The anti-money laundering agency claimed that Umar and Qasmi were involved in largescale conversions across India. The facts, ED said, have emerged during searches in their premises at Jamia Nagar in Delhi and other places in Lucknow and Sant Kabir Nagar in UP. ED was roped in after UPATS in its preliminary probe traced exhibits of illegal donations and funds transfers from abroad, particularly Gulf countries, in the accounts of Umar Gautam and a trust run by the accused — Fatima Charitable Trust. Al Hassan Education & Welfare Foundation in Malihabad, Lucknow, and its tertiary office in Hardoi came under intelligence radar after accused Umar Gautam was found to be its vice-president. He has since been sacked from the Trust. Sources in police said, another accused Salahuddin Jainuddin was a member of Guidance Education & Welfare Society in Sant Kabir Nagar. “Several incriminating documents were seized during Saturday’s searches, which reveals large-scale conversions carried out by Umar Gautam and his organizations across India. Documents also reveal receipt of foreign funds of several crores,” ED said. After the arrest of the sixth accused Salahuddin Sheikh, a Vadodara-based businessman, UPATS claimed corroborative evidence on Umar and his associates’ role in converting more than 1,000 people to Islam with lure of money, jobs and marriage. ED’s searches covered premises of Islamic Dawah Centre (IDC), residence of Umar Gautam and his aide, Mufti Qazi Jahangir Qasmi, at Jamia Nagar in Delhi. Offices of Al Hassan Education and Welfare Foundation and Guidance Education and Welfare Society located at Lucknow and Sant Kabir Nagar have also been searched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ed-searches-to-track-foreign-funds-in-illegal-conversions/articleshow/84105816.cms||Pradeep Thakur

---||Ahmedabad||Kin accused of forging papers, usurping land||AHMEDABAD: A Surat resident filed a complaint of forgery and cheating against three of his relatives after they allegedly tried to push him out of their realty business by falsely claiming that he had retired from the partnership. Rajesh Poddar filed the complaint with the detection of crime branch on Friday. He submitted that his partners Anant Poddar, Pramod Poddar and Ashish Poddar had forged a deed to show that he had retired. The deed was also used to transfer 33,000 yards of land in the name of Usha Vimal Poddar, Kantaben Raval and Kanu Patel. In the FIR, Rajesh stated, “My uncle Vimal Poddar, cousin Pramod Poddar and I decided to purchase land in Ahmedabad in 2009. We started a firm named Ashish Builders in January 29 that year. I had a 50% share in the company, while my uncle and cousin had 25% share each. Later in the year, we set up another firm, Abhay Developers. This time, my share was 33.33% while that of Pramod Poddar was 33.34% and cousin Anant Vimal Poddar was 33.33% respectively. We also set up Amrut Developers. In this, Anant Poddar, Ashish Pramod Poddar and I had 33.34% share each.” Rajesh said, “In April 2015, my partners in Abhay Developers and Amrut Developers tried to wrest away control of the two companies by showing that I had retired. The partners even opened a second account for the firms with a new bank.” Rajesh filed a complaint with CID Crime, Gandhinagar, on July 27, 2015. While they were investigating into the complaint, he also filed a complaint of cheating with the Ahmedabad police commissioner. The probe was handed over to the SOG. He said that he even filed a petition in the Gujarat High Court and an inquiry was ordered. He told police that his uncle Vimal Poddar challenged the order in the Supreme Court. “The government pleader sought the investigation report. The deeds of Amrut Developers were sent to the FSL. On September 12, 2017, FSL said that the printing of page 2 and page 5 and that of page 1 and page 6 were not in continuation. Even the punching holes were at different spots. Vimal Poddar later withdrew his case from the Supreme Court,” Rajesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kin-accused-of-forging-papers-usurping-land/articleshow/84101817.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Kodagu teacher builds treehouse class to overcome patchy internet||MADIKERI: As all classes went online due to the Covid-induced lockdown after the second wave in April, this teacher from Mullur Village, Somwarpet in Kodagu, about 250km from Bengaluru, found a unique solution to overcome patchy internet issues. C S Satheesha, a 37-year-old government schoolteacher, decided to build a bamboo platform atop a tree so that he could continue to teach kids from his high perch. Satheesha, who teaches students from Class 1 to 5 at the Government Lower Primary School in Mullur, says it took him two months to build his treetop classroom. “I spent about Rs 10,000 to build it, which included lighting,” he adds. The material required — bamboo, hay and gunny sacks — was acquired with the help of friends. Now, the platform is where he goes to hold classes in English, maths and Kannada. Minister seeks CM’s intervention to fix students’ network problemsThis out-of-the-box idea was inspired by the makeshift watchtowers (locally called “Atta-palli”) that villagers use during the harvest season to keep an eye on elephants and wild boars that could destroy their crops. Since it’s at a height of 20 feet, the problem of weak reception has been overcome. He also helped organise some extra smartphones for students while others were taught using conference calls. His students appreciate the effort he’s made. “Our teacher is really great. Because of his innovative mind, we did not miss any classes,” says Punya, a Class 4 student. Following his success story, Karnataka primary education minister S Suresh Kumar has taken up the issue of connectivity in rural areas seriously and has urged chief minister B S Yediyurappa and chief secretary P Ravi Kumar to intervene and get service providers to fix network problems. “I have written to the CM and the chief secretary explaining the situation in Malnad and other hilly areas and requested them to call a meeting of service providers to enable connectivity in these areas,” Kumar says. A retired senior official of the department of public instruction says: “We need teachers like Satheesha who go that extra mile to teach students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kodagu-teacher-builds-treehouse-class-to-overcome-patchy-internet/articleshow/84107233.cms||Rajendra G

The complaint was filed by Vasudeva Reddy, who claimed that certain pieces of land acquired for the IT corridor were de-notified for illegal gain under a government notification dated June 21, 2006 by Yediyurappa (arraigned as accused no. 2) when he was deputy CM and they were allotted to entrepreneurs. The investigating officer filed a final report stating that no offence appears to have been committed by accused no. 2. However, special judge Shridhar Gopalakrishna Bhat noted that the final report doesn’t instil confidence in the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/court-orders-fresh-probe-into-land-complaint-against-bsy/articleshow/84107234.cms||---

Complainant Kankuben Patni (58) told police that her son Poonam alias Laloo was murdered by one Dhawal Ravalon Saturday night. She said, “Poonam always slept in his rickshaw. On Friday, around midnight, my grandson Sachin saw a man approaching the area. He could hardly walk. Sachin rushed to help the person, but he collapsed. That is when he realized that it was none other than Poonam.” Sachin’s call for help brought other residents running to the rescue. They rushed Poonam to Sola Civil Hospital where the doctors declared him dead. Kankuben told police that Raval, who lived in the area, had been abusing people on Thursday. “Poonam objected to it and a heated argument ensued between the two. It is most likely that Raval killed my son,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-killed-by-abusive-neighbour/articleshow/84101863.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Smartphones make for easy pickings as street crimes up||PUNE: Street crimes, especially robberies, chain snatching and cellphone thefts, are on the rise. The city police have registered 143 robberies and 15 dacoities till June 25 this year. For perspective, the police recorded 170 robberies and 10 dacoities in the entire 2020. “We have taken action against criminals involved in robberies under the stringent Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities and Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, expressing confidence the crime detection rate will increase bring down the number of street crimes. While the stringent lockdown in 2020 had much to do with the lower number of cases last year, the figures this year are alarming as most of the past few months have been under stringent curbs. Police said they were doing everything to curb crime, while activists and legal experts believed factors like unemployment and economic distress caused by the pandemic were at the root and called for a compassionate approach. Many street crimes involved first-time offenders, prompting the police to take a closer look at the circumstances that caused their foray into a life of crime. “We are conducting a study on why such crimes, including those committed by first-time offenders, are on the rise and what can be done to curb them,” commissioner Gupta said. Rajas Parchure, director of the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, said there could be a link between economic situation and the increase in crime. “It is possible that people turn to street crime after facing job cuts, unemployment and other related reasons. We can make a definite conclusion after studying the profile of the offenders,” Parchure said. Human rights activist and lawyer Asim Sarode too blamed circumstances arising from the lockdown-like restrictions. “Many don’t have money to purchase smartphones and some snatch cellphones to fulfil their needs,” Sarode said. He further said it was difficult to track down phone snatchers as most victims don’t register a police complaint. “In some cases, the lesser value of the phone may not be worth the hassle. Robbers take advantage of practical problems faced by the police and people,” he said. Bharati Vidyapeeth’s New Law College professor Sukrut Deo agreed. “There is lot of frustration among people mostly residing in slums due to recession, unemployment and inflation. Many domestic workers are not allowed to enter many housing societies. They are unable to deal with their frustration and it leads to aggression on the streets,” Deo said. Anjali Pawar, director of the NGO Sakhee, said the trend of using minor boys — who cannot be punished as adults — was worrying. “If nothing is done about them, these boys will become hardened criminals as they grow older,” Pawar further said. She said government assistance to those worst-affected by the lockdown will go a long way. “Many are without income during the pandemic. The government has given financial aid to autorickshaw drivers and sex workers. It should similarly help other, impoverished sections of the society. It is disappointing to see youngsters begging and turning to crime because they have no other option to earn money,” she said. “The crime branch and police stations have solved 80% of the street crime in 2020 and 2021. We have made extensive use of CCTV cameras, technical investigations, emphasised collecting intelligence. Most cases involve mobile phone snatching, as it is easier to snatch and use the phone or sell it,” additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/smartphones-make-for-easy-pickings-as-street-crimes-up/articleshow/84101882.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Chandigarh||SKM seeks clarification on Pawar’s amendment suggestion||Bathinda: Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has questioned Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on his statement on the agriculture marketing laws. The farm stir required an unambiguous clarification on the former Union agriculture minister to be put out by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, morcha said. SKM said Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar could do what he wanted with Pawar’s reported suggestion for amendments in the laws, but it was not going to budge until their demand for repeal was met. Morcha warned the state government against coming under pressure from corporations or the Union government. All three parties of MVA had in the past supported the farmers’ movement, including a ‘Maha Padav’ from January 23 to 25, 2021 in Mumbai’s Azad Maidan. Recently, when a delegation of farmer leaders in Maharashtra had met Pawar, who had assured them of the government’s support, the farm body claimed. The reported statements and the subsequent clarifications are causing confusion, it added. The Morcha also said it stood vindicated with the central government imposing stock limits on pulses, for various players in the supply chain, to control surging prices. It claimed it possible only because the Supreme Court had suspended the implementation of the amendments made to the Essential Commodities Act. It said numerous contingents of farmers are reaching various protest sites. Farmers were expected from Shamli and Meerut at Ghazipur border. Many had left from different districts of Rajasthan like Kota, Bundi, Hanumangarh and Jodhpur for the Shahjahanpur protest site. A convoy led by BKU Charuni left from Chandigarh for Singhu border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/skm-seeks-clarification-on-pawars-amendment-suggestion/articleshow/84105903.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Brutal murder of democratic process, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Describing the conduct of the government machinery in Zila Panchayat chairman polls as ‘blatant misuse of power’, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said that the ruling BJP made a mockery of the people’s mandate in the polls to ‘brutally murder a democratic process’. SP candidates were declared winner on 4 out of 53 seats where elections were held on Saturday. Apart from Etawah where SP supported candidate Anshul Yadav won unopposed, party supported candidates were declared elected in Azamgarh, Ballia, Sant Kabir Nagar and Etah where polls were held. The party lost in traditional SP strongholds of Kannauj, Firozabad, Farrukhabad, Mainpuri, Badaun, Sambhal, Rampur and Kasganj. However the SP chief described the defeat of SP-backed candidates in these districts as a result of arm-twisting techniques adopted by the ruling BJP. “In Kannauj, the SP members were stopped from casting their votes despite 17 of the members appearing before the state election commission (SEC) on Friday night to vouch their support for the SP-backed candidate and seek protection from the commission. We appraised the commission about apprehensions that members will not be allowed to vote and that is exactly what has happened,” Akhilesh said. The SP chief pointed out that zila panchayat members supporting the SP candidate were first publicly attacked and then lathi-charged by the police. In Rampur, the leader of the opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary along with a host of SP MLAs and former ministers staged a sit-in outside the polling venue when two zila panchayat members were ‘kidnapped’ from inside the compound of polling. In Lucknow, zila panchayat members supporting SP’s Arun Rawat were kidnapped while the SP backed-candidate Vijay Laxmi was ‘held hostage’ at the office of the DM, Akhilesh said, reading out instances where, he alleged the election was tampered with. “In Prayagraj, BJP workers used electronic devices to make public the voting process which was essentially a secret ballot. In Firozabad, six members were stopped from casting their vote despite court orders and in Farrukhabad, Aligarh, Amethi and Shamli graduate and post graduate panchayat members were given helpers to cast their votes,” Akhilesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-brutal-murder-of-democratic-process/articleshow/84105906.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

In Mumbai, the police have arrested at least 10 people in a case that involves a gang that may have cheated dozens of citizens, from employees of a major bank to a housing society in the city’s Kandivli area. Police suspect the gang may have given some beneficiaries saline water instead of the actual vaccine. In Kolkata, police believe hundreds may have been administered amikacin sulphate, an antibiotic, at multiple fake vaccination camps that were organised by one individual. Investigations are ongoing. Civic bodies across cities, including Pune, have allowed companies and housing societies to tie up with private hospitals to hold Covid-19 vaccination camps. But the authorities have said that those interested in these tie-ups should first inform the local civic body or the police before holding the camps. Several posts, promising Covid vaccination camps, have been found circulating on social media. The Times Verified service, set up to verify and authenticate social media posts linked to the pandemic, has found that some of these offers to hold vaccination camps were not legitimate. Authorities have also asked citizens to be alert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/web-posts-offering-shots-can-be-bogus/articleshow/84101896.cms||---

This is how unemployment will be sweep out from #Uttarakhand,” wrote another. Unemployment rose from 1.7% in 2016-17 to about 11% in 2020-2021, according to thinktank CMIE. The state has about 7.8 lakh unemployed people. On Saturday afternoon, as the new CM-elect was announced, the microblogging site saw another jump in activity around Uttarakhand. At the time of filing this report, “Pushkar Singh Dhami” was trending with 12,400 tweets. Among many congratulatory tweets were snipes at the two-time Khatima MLA because of a video that was going around. In the purported video, shared by the Uttarakhand units of both AAP and Youth Congress, he is heard saying he has “not stopped corruption”, a possible slipup. Dhami has risen through the ranks with unemployment as a political pitch. “Uttarakhand is the first such state of country where even CM is appointed on ‘contractual’ basis,” said one tweet, referring to the pending case of 22,000 people who await regularisation of contractual jobs they got through Uttarakhand Poorva Sainik Kalyan Nigam Limited over a decade ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/new-cm-every-month-unemployment-hit-ukhand-floods-social-media-with-new-vacancy-tweets/articleshow/84100084.cms||Shivani Azad

A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni heard a PIL by Brijesh Arya, a member of Homeless Collective that BMC must continue relief of food, potable water and free access to public toilets. At a previous hearing, BMC was directed to say in what manner shelters would be made available, as directed in another PIL. The state’s advocate said Arya is a member of the monitoring committee, and has access to information on shelters. The judges asked if the home shelter scheme provides that “they [homeless] should also work for the country.” “It cannot be that after getting shelter they will loiter about... Everything cannot be provided by the government,” said Justice Kulkarni. Arya’s advocate Kranti L C said once the homeless are in shelters, it would facilitate employment schemes for them. “Only then will they work?

The hearing will be held in North Goa and South Goa on July 8 from 10am. So far, around 100 people in North Goa and around 500 in South Goa have registered to participate in the public hearing. On-the-spot registration is also allowed for those interested in participating in the hearing. Speaking to reporters, Cabral said that the state government has received a lot of representations to cancel the public hearing, and they have approached court. The matter is likely to come up on July 5. “We have not received any directions and we are going ahead with the hearing for CZMP with proper planning,” he said. He added that pandals have been erected keeping in mind social distancing “The Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA) is scheduling 15-minute slots for all those who have registered for the hearing,” he said. “On-the-spot entries will also be allowed to speak once the registered persons finish,” Cabral said. He also said that the hearing would be planned as a continuous one, so there’s no discussion and debate at the venue. When asked if the state is not concerned about the pandemic, Cabral said that it’s the people that have gone to court for the public hearing, not the government. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered Goa to hold the public hearings afresh, after norms for the hearings were not “followed in letter and spirit” by the state government. Goa Foundation had moved the NGT against the alleged deficiencies in the conduct of public hearings held by the state government on March 7.

A representation regarding this was sent to the state commercial tax commissioner, seeking to tax ISEs. The representation states, “The ISEs may be providing search results for free but the platforms not just record the personal information of users including their geographical location but also sell it to marketing and advertising firms. Therefore, they should be taxed.” According to the federation members, any company, irrespective of its location, which provides goods or services to Indian customers is liable to pay taxes in India. The representation has also cited multiple provisions in the GST Act through which transactions which are apparently non-financial in nature, can also be taxed. The representation has also cited the ‘MIS Report 3.11 of the GST System Module’ and stated, “No such company has paid a single penny in India. Even though the GST department has all the information about such ISEs operational, no action as yet as been taken.” A senior commercial tax department official said, “Even if the user information is sold to marketing firms, as alleged; unless there is proof of such transactions, the concerned entity cannot be taxed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-gst-body-wants-tax-on-ises/articleshow/84101919.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Kempty-Thatyur road construction threatens Mussoorie’s largest water source||MUSSOORIE: A new road to connect Thatyur and Kempty is threatening the largest water source of Mussoorie – the Jincy spring that accounts for nearly 25% of drinking water being supplied to the town. The road, for which cutting has already been done up to 100 meters away from the spring, is aligned in a manner that it would bisect the seven smaller springs that collectively form the Jincy spring. “We feel that the rock cutting, excavation and other activities for making this road might result in causing severe damage to the Jincy water source,” said K C Painuli, executive engineer of the water department. Painuli added that in the past his department has written several letters to the Public Works Department (PWD) informing them about the potential damage to the spring from this project and the need to change the alignment of the road. Notably, there are seven springs here which are collectively referred to as the Jincy spring. These springs together have a discharge of close to 2.5 million litres of water per day. Locals living in villages around Kempty have been demanding connectivity to Thatyur, which is the block headquarters. Right now, they have to go via Mussoorie to reach Thatyur. But a direct road between Kempty and Thatyur can reduce the current travel time of three hours by an hour. However, now they have realised how the project is hampering the local water resources. Residents of the nearby Jincy village have reported that road construction near their village has already damaged their water source. “A spring that provides water to our village has been submerged under debris from the construction and we are facing water shortage,” said a resident of Jincy who did not wish to be named. The road could potentially add to Mussoorie’s existing water woes especially during summer. Speaking to TOI, Rajnish Kumar, executive engineer of PWD pointed out that the alignment of this road had been decided in 2008 and requisite clearance from the forest department had also been obtained. “We cannot change the alignment of this road at this stage but we will try to ensure that road cutting is done in a manner that does not damage the springs. We have also told the Jal Sansthan that special precautions will be taken so that debris does not fall into the springs,” Kumar said. Environmentalists feel that the alignment of the road should be changed in order to avoid damage to this critical water source. “Jincy springs are a major source of water for Mussoorie and constructing a road through them is a very serious matter. But the PWD seems unconcerned about the welfare of the people. This whole thing has to be stopped and re-examined by hydrologists and environmentalists,” urged Hugh Gantzer, author and member of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee constituted by the SC for monitoring the environment issues of Doon Valley and Mussoorie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kempty-thatyur-road-construction-threatens-mussoories-largest-water-source/articleshow/84100116.cms||Anmol Jain

The government has instead allowed some warkaris to travel to Pandharpur in state transport buses, police said. Additional commissioner of police Ramnath Pokale of Pimpri Chinchwad police said, “Some warkaris decided to return to Alandi after we held a long discussion with them. However, Karadkar was firm on going ahead on foot. Thus, we took him to Karad in Satara district and dropped him there.” A police officer said, “Despite government orders, a few warkaris started walking towards Pandharpur from Alandi early on Saturday morning. Karadkar was walking behind a dhindi. When he started arguing with the police all of the warkaris were detained at a wedding hall in Dighi.” “The warkaris left Alandi around 5am and started walking towards Pune city. After two hours, they reached Dighi area, where the police stopped them,” an officer said. The situation turned tense when the warkaris gathered in large numbers in front of the wedding hall and started reciting bhajans and kirtans as a form of protest. However, the police authorities pacified them and allowed Karadkar to speak with them. On Friday, 23 warkaris had tested positive for Covid-19 ahead of the annual Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj palkhi rituals. Deputy CM and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar had expressed concern over the detection of positive cases and that it was crucial to remain more cautious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-detain-then-release-warkari-leader-and-others/articleshow/84101926.cms||---
---||Nagpur||With NMC nod, NCI runs vax camp with BJP||NAGPUR: In contravention of guidelines set by the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) issued a no objection certificate allowing the National Cancer Institute (NCI) — a private hospital — to run a Covid vaccination camp at the New English High School playground in Congress Nagar. Former CM Devendra Fadnavis, who is the area’s MLA, inaugurated the centre on June 26. Going against the spirit of the NOC, the BJP’s South-West Nagpur unit is registering new voters while running the vaccination camp. A visit to the centre, which was meant specially for those between 18 and 30, revealed violation of rules that have to be observed while running a vaccination centre. Covid-19 guidelines like social distancing, wearing mask etc too were not being followed. As per ministry guidelines, a private hospital can do vaccination at its centre or workplace of private corporate companies or industries. Inoculation can also be done at schools/colleges, housing societies, old age home, community centres etc but only for the elderly and differently abled person. An NMC official told TOI that the NCI procured doses of Covishield directly from Serum Institute of India (SII). “The hospital, which had authorisation to vaccinate at its Jamtha hospital, applied for permission to inoculate eligible people at the school. Hence, an NOC was issued.” At the school, NCI staff is administering doses to beneficiaries in two classrooms converted into vaccination rooms. BJP activists can be seen guiding people, collecting documents, doing registration etc. Flags and banners of BJP with photos of PM Narendra Modi, city MP Nitin Gadkari and MLA Devendra Fadnavis have been put up from the school entrance to the classrooms. A counter has been set for registration of new voters right inside a shamiana which serves as the vaccination centre. Seated on the stage are BJP netas without masks. The large number of people gathered near the shamiana for registration and vaccination were not following Covid distancing. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that the NOC was issued to NCI and not to any political party. “I will have to check about distancing and other conditions being followed,” he said. NCI director Shailesh Joglekar said the school was chosen as a centre so that more people can be vaccinated. “We are keen to vaccinate as many people as possible. We have organised the camp along with NGO Sevankur,” he added. Joglekar did not comment on BJP’s active participation in the camp. Corporator and president of BJP South-West Nagpur Kishor Wankhede said the party is “doing the vaccination with the help of NCI”. On Covid violation, Wankhede said as the camp is getting a huge response, “it difficult to comply with the guidelines”. “We had planned a camp for 18-30s but people from all age groups are thronging the centre,” he added. Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe said BJP “doing politics on vaccination was unfortunate”. “The party should ensure sufficient stock and inoculate all through NMC. NCI should procure doses for all eligible people of the city and hand it over to the NMC. What they are doing now is trying to get political mileage from vaccination and pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-nmc-nod-nci-runs-vax-camp-with-bjp/articleshow/84103964.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The Chatushrungi police on Friday booked the truck driver on the charge of negligent driving and causing grievous injury to the woman under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act. Senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchavre of the Chaturshringi police said on Saturday, “The woman, a homemaker, has been permanently disabled after the doctors treating her got her right foot amputated because the nature of her injuries was serious. We have taken serious cognisance of the accident and lodged a complaint against the truck driver. We have served him a notice, asking him to join the police in investigation. The driver was not arrested because he was booked under bailable offence.” He said, “We shall be helping the woman’s family members in filing a petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal for seeking compensation from the truck owner and its driver. We shall file a chargesheet against the driver on the completion of the investigation.” The injured victim’s son, construction worker Namdeo Mahapure (47), told TOI, “My mother left home to purchase vegetables from a place near Balewadi Phata. She started crossing the road after the signal turned red. When she reached the middle of the road, the signal turned green and she stopped. A truck heading towards Pune-Bengaluru highway ran over her right foot.” Mahapure said, “My mother started groaning in unbearable pain. The truck driver stopped to help my mother. I came to know about the accident after an autorickshaw driver called me from my mother’s cellphone and asked me to come to the spot. My mother was rushed to a private hospital, but we were told to deposit Rs5 lakh for performing surgery. We rushed her to two hospitals in Aundh and Pimpri because of our inability to pay such a huge sum, but the doctors advised us to shift her to Sassoon General Hospital.” He said, “The doctors at the Sassoon hospital amputated my mother’s foot. The truck driver expressed his inability to bear the medical expenses of my mother because of his poor economic condition. I then consulted my family members and registered the complaint against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/72-yr-olds-foot-amputated-after-truck-runs-over-it/articleshow/84101955.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Singh on Saturday tweeted, “A tourist of Gujjar reservation movement...goes to the BJP every time posing as the contractor of the Gujjars...tells the BJP leaders to raise their voice... the tourist remains silent for eight months.. When we raise our demand with the state government to execute the agreement (signed last year), the tourist sings a different tune. Youth, be careful.” “I have a question for the tourist of the Gujjar reservation movement. On October 15, 2015; May 19, 2017 and March 22, 2019, the Rajasthan government sent a proposal to the central government to include MBC reservation bill in the 9th schedule from the legislative assembly.. Modi government was at the centre..Still, why the tourist family in BJP?” Singh asked. Citing that MBC community has got majority in 16 Lok Sabha seats and 72 assembly seats in Rajasthan, Bainsla had said that the move will have an impact on the next Lok Sabha, assembly elections in the state and Uttar Pradesh elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/himmat-calls-bainsla-tourist-of-gujjar-stir/articleshow/84103966.cms||---

The study called ‘Status of Child Labourers and Legal Entitlements of Workers in Major Sectors in Rajasthan’, which saw participation of 543 parents and 317 children, showed kids are the worst sufferers of such work-borne ailments and there is high incidence of cough which is nearly 68%, respiratory diseases 43%, skin diseases 28%, muscle-related problems 29% and finger malformation 26%. The study found that malformation, strain on back and shoulders due to continuous work is also very significantly found among children in younger age. Many elder children start chewing gutka, paan and even country wine which adversely affects their health.“The workers along with their family members and children are largely dependent on government health facilities (88%) available nearby their worksites or dwellings. Though, in case of some emergency, they also go to private doctors (62%) and in some cases they even consult quacks (34%). It is also notable that unit owners or employers don’t take responsibility of such things even in case of emergency or accidents happening at the worksite,” said the study. More than two third of child labourers working in brick kiln (67%) complain of indulging in excessive physical work that, too, without any extra money paid for the extra work he or she does. Except in Jaipur workshops where physical work is relatively less, children working in stone quarry (30%) and agriculture (35%) complain of excessive physical work without getting any extra penny by the employers.Only one third (35%) of the working children admitted that they received sanitizers, masks, gloves etc., from employers, leaving them vulnerable to the pandemic The situation in brick kiln (58%) and stone quarry / stone mining (57%) was better than that of agriculture and Jaipur workshops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nearly-68-child-labourers-suffer-from-cough-study/articleshow/84103957.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Two more persons arrested in Nivedita Mukherjee murder case||DEHRADUN: In a new development in the Nivedita Mukherjee murder case, the police on Saturday arrested two persons – Anuj Narang and his father Chandra Prakash – who were eye witness to the crime. They also helped the murder accused, Ankit Chaudhary, in disposing of the body. According to the police, Anuj is Ankit’s friend. On the night of April 28 when Nivedita was murdered, both Anuj and his father were present at Ankit’s flat. Anuj also confirmed to the police that on the night of April 28, Ankit had a fight with Nivedita after which he pushed her down from the balcony. Anuj’s confession established the motive for the crime. “After the woman was pushed from the balcony, Ankit along with his friend went down to bring the woman back to the flat. When she died, he took his friend's car to dump the body,” said the police. However, the accused Ankit had told the police that Nivedita had fallen off from the balcony on her own. The father-son duo allegedly helped Ankit in disposing of Nivedita’s body in Kimari jungle on the Dehradun-Mussoorie highway. Ankit had used Anuj’s Hyundai i20 car to dispose of the body, said the police. Ankit, 31, a native of Saharanpur was arrested last week from Rajpur road for allegedly murdering his girlfriend on April 28. The deceased woman’s father had lodged a police complaint after his daughter went missing for two months. The accused who was about to marry Nivedita was the prime suspect in the case. After his arrest, the accused had told the police that he got scared after Nivedita died accidentally and had burnt her body in the forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/two-more-persons-arrested-in-nivedita-mukherjee-murder-case/articleshow/84100165.cms||---
---||India||Congress: PM must order JPC probe on Rafale||NEW DELHI: With the French media reporting that a judicial inquiry has been ordered in the country into the Rafale deal, Congress on Saturday claimed vindication and demanded that PM Narendra Modi order a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the fighter jet purchase. “Corruption in the Rafale deal has come out clearly now. The stand of Congress and Rahul Gandhi has been vindicated today after the French government ordered a probe,” AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, pointing to the investigation ordered by the French public prosecution agency. “When the French government has accepted that there is corruption in the deal, should a JPC probe be not held in the country where the corruption took place,” he asked, even as he added that the demand should not be seen through a partisan political lens but should be viewed as concern for national security. “Will the Prime Minister, like the French, now answer to the nation and tell when will he submit his government to a JPC probe into the Rafale scam,” Surjewala asked. AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted, “Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth, said Lord Buddha.” Pitching for a JPC probe, Congress said the parliamentary panel will be able to summon witnesses and top ministers including the PM, and also access the government files that the Supreme Court or the CVC could not peruse. He said the fact that the panel can ask probing queries and punish for perjury will be a big asset in unearthing the truth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-pm-must-order-jpc-probe-on-rafale/articleshow/84107340.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Plot like ‘Sherni’ plays out in Udaipur’s Zawar mines area||JAIPUR: A plot like in the recently released Bollywood movie ‘Sherni’ on man-animal conflict can be witnessed in the Zawar mines forest region of Udaipur. After an unidentified leopard allegedly killed four humans and injured several others in 10 attacks in the past six months, villagers and their representatives are demanding that the big cat be shot dead as it has become a danger to human life. The forest department on Saturday pressed into service an expert tranquilizer to dart and capture the animal. The villagers, however, have firmly demanded that the big cat be eliminated. Hari Mohan of Singatwara village said: “As the wild cat is on the prowl, we cannot go to our fields and take cattle out for grazing.” “The forest department should kill the animal as this is the only option to save villagers,” Mohan added. A forest department source said: “Villagers of Singatwara and Nelatalai are demanding that the animal be killed. After the recent attack, when the animal killed an elderly woman, furious villagers refused to cremate the body and demanded elimination of the animal. Following this, the local MP called the chief wildlife warden and forest minister to accept the demand of the villagers.” As a confidence-building measure, the forest department on Saturday released a leopard’s picture that was captured in a trap camera, suggesting that it was the same animal which was on the prowl. Green activists, on the other hand, insisted that without forensic and DNA tests, the forest department should not tranquilize or eliminate any leopard, whose population is only about 25-30 in the region. “On the basis of camera trap, how can the forest department identify that it’s the same leopard, which is attacking villagers,” asked green activist Anil Roger. The undulating terrain and valleys in the forest region have become a major challenge for the forest department to capture the animal. Udaipur district forest officer Mukesh Saini said: “Eight cages have been placed in the area but to no avail. After June 29, the leopard was not even captured in the trap camera. Now, we have started a drone survey.” As per the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) standard operating procedure to declare a big cat ‘dangerous for human life’, the forest department has constituted a committee comprising an NTCA member, a nominee appointed by the chief wildlife warden, a veterinarian and some public representatives. The committee will soon submit its recommendation. Roger, however, is not happy with the composition of the committee. “To maintain transparency in functioning, the forest department should have kept an animal activist in the committee,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/plot-like-sherni-plays-out-in-udaipurs-zawar-mines-area/articleshow/84104011.cms||---
---||Delhi||Transgenders take a big stride for a life of dignity, but still await parity||New Delhi: Seven years after the Supreme Court recognised transgenders as the third gender and ordered seat reservations for them in education and jobs and provide other amenities, they are slowly getting acceptance in society. Most transgenders say they want to live a life of dignity with proper jobs and aren’t interested in begging or dancing for a livelihood or taking to the sex trade.Manish, 30, for one, is happy and proud of his job as a sector leader in the Noida Authority. “I used to work as a sex worker, but what I actually wanted was a life of respect. I didn’t want to take up traditional occupations of our transgender community, so after graduation, I persevered even when initially facing difficulties in finding a job,” said Manish, who supervises the sanitation staff. “I found many firms were willing to hire transgenders.” That companies respond now to applications from transgenders is confirmed by Anisha, who works with a perfume manufacturer. Anisha said she earned Rs 25,000 a month and lives a dignified life. She is an example to Sheila, 24, a graduate who underwent a gender reassignment procedure last year. “I have applied to many firms and hope to find a job soon,” said Sheila. “I really need employment to be able to live an independent life. A growing number of people are accepting us in society and some of us can now fulfil our dreams.”After the landmark National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) judgment of 2014 in which the Supreme Court ordered affirmative action for the transgender community, many members feel that the road to parity with males and females is still a long one. Meena, 29, does odd jobs at a factory in Mayapuri. “Workers are aware of my gender and are nice to me,” she said. “But some people in my neighbourhood and the markets still treat me with disdain. When I am walking, passers-by often pass derogatory comments. It will take a long time for such things to stop.”Many transgender people said the government should make more effort to bring the community into the mainstream through quotas in education and employment as well as easy access to welfare schemes. Kavita, who is employed at the ticket recharging counter in a Noida metro station, said, “Only a few people belonging to the trans community are able to get a job. A majority are forced to take to begging or dancing to sustain themselves.” Ravinder added, “Reservation in educational institutions is yet to be implemented. The creation of separate toilets for transgenders in offices, schools and public places is a distant dream. The government should promote skill development for them, especially those who couldn’t finish their education. We do not want freebies from the government, only jobs to lead normal lives.”But most do concede that there is bigger acceptance of transgenders today. Ruby, who plans to take admission in an undergraduate course this year, said, “The government has indeed introduced some welfare schemes, but they haven’t reached many community members due to lack of awareness. The government must promote these schemes and help us complete our education.” She admitted she currently dances at marriage functions to support herself but is determined to complete college for better career opportunities.

---||Hyderabad||No high court relief for Telangana in title dispute over 40-acre land||HYDERABAD: Stating that state cannot unilaterally decide the title of land plots particularly when it is vying with its citizens over the same plot, the high court has directed Telangana government to go to a civil court to prove its claim of ownership over a 40-acre land in Lothukunta village in Malkajgiri mandal. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said this while refusing to accord any relief to the state government in respect of the title dispute over 40 acres in survey numbers 1 and 2 in Lothukunta. The judges also refused to interfere in the finding given by a single judge in the case wherein it was held that the state attempted an unacceptable magic trick to cause the disappearance of an entire village (Lothukunta) from Malkajgiri. They did not agree to nullify the Rs 1 lakh costs slapped by the single judge on the authorities for their ‘adventure’. The judges, however, stayed the order of the single judge for four weeks to enable the state government to approach a civil court while dealing with a writ appeal filed by the state government. A single judge earlier noted the depths to which the revenue authorities went to deny the rights over the land to the owners and dug deeper into the century old records of the land. He concluded that the owners of the land were very much there at the land for the last 50 years. “After many instances of the state and its instruments acquiring land from the same owners in the past, you cannot suddenly call them encroachers and you have no power to resort to the summary eviction remedy under the Land Encroachment Act in such cases,” he said. “Applying clandestine methods to cause the disappearance of an entire village from revenue records and to deny rights to the owners is unfair. This is no way to deal with them,” the single judge had said in his order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-hc-relief-for-t-in-title-dispute-over-40-acre-land/articleshow/84103995.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The Navy carries out similar practice firing on a routine basis. “The Naval coastal battery, Mormugao, will carry out practice firing of 105mm light field gun and 40/60 anti-air guns from Mormugao between 9am and 1pm on July 9,” said the Indian Navy in a statement. The naval guns are a part of the country’s shore-based defence and can fire four rounds per minute to strike attacking warships and aircraft which are over 15km out at sea. “The danger zone lies within an area bounded by 220 to 260 degrees from Mormugao Headland flag staff position, up to a distance of 15 nautical miles into the sea, and up to a height of 7,100 metres,” the Indian Navy statement reads. “For smooth conduct of the firing and also to ensure public safety; shipping, harbour craft, fishing and other vessels and the general public are requested to keep clear of the Naval coastal battery and the danger zone during the period of firing,” the Indian Navy further said in its statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/firing-drills-on-july-9-indian-navy-warns-vessels-public/articleshow/84104099.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Economic downturn stoking anxiety, depression’||AHMEDABAD: At Jeevan Aastha helpline (1800 233 3330), a 37-year old man called in the month of May. The caller was straightforward and told the counsellors that he wanted to end his life as he felt worthless and had no hopes that things would take a positive turn. “Upon talking to him, we got to know that his woes had started in 2020 when he had lost his job during the lockdown. In the past one year, the situation went from bad to worse as he had to feed a family of five on meagre earning. His wife is also seven-month pregnant now. Due to his economic condition, she was sent to her parents’ home,” said a counsellor. “We motivated him to keep looking for opportunities and never lose hope.” For the city-based counsellors, the story is repeated umpteen times in the past couple of months in different forms. The second wave of Covid-19 hit almost all families hard with loss of steady income, reduction in existing salaries and closure of businesses. Dr Chirag Parmar, a psychiatrist with the Government Hospital for Mental Health (HMH), said that they came across a 35-year-old person’s case. “He was a manager with a city-based restaurant. He lost job earlier this year and even after five months could not find work matching his experience or monetary needs. Thus, he had developed symptoms including loss of appetite, disinterest in all spheres of life and firmly believed that there was no point in living,” he said. “It is but natural to get anxious and even disheartened when nothing goes as planned – nobody could have anticipated what we have witnessed in the past one and a half years. But what we communicate to the patients is, they are not alone. Their nears and dears would stand by them and it’s an overall difficult time,” said Dr Deepti Bhatt, a senior psychiatrist with HMH. “The key to mental health in these trying times is to remain mentally agile, keeping a positive outlook, finding opportunities in adversities and keep communication channel open.” Experts said that the tell-tale signs of depression include loss of sleep, loss of appetite, pessimistic outlook towards the world and fear of the future. While in majority of the cases counselling does the trick, some patients need medication, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/economic-downturn-raises-anxiety-depression-in-citizens/articleshow/84102804.cms||Parth Shastri

A final decision in this regard is likely to be held by the state government in a short time. Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, state education minister said, “With the pandemic situation largely under control, the state government is planning to allow reopening of colleges and schools in a phased manner and by strictly following Covid control guidelines. A formal decision will be taken after consultation with experts by the state's core committee and the cabinet.” “We aim to open schools, once college exams get over after July 12,” he said. Gujarat Rajya Self-Financed School Management Association president Bharat Gajipara said that the state government has so far not consulted them regarding the reopening of schools. He said they will give their opinion to the government if asked for. Narayan Patel, president of Akhil Gujarat Rajya Shala Sanchalak Mahamandal said that Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board will conduct Class 10 and Class 12 board exams for repeaters from July 15. About 4.5 lakh repeater students are expected to take the test. Several schools will be engaged in conducting the board exams, he further said. The colleges and schools are likely to be reopened in a staggered manner. Jayvantinsh Sarwaiya, president of Gujarat State College Principal’s Association said they have twice approached the government recently to raise their demand. “We would also like to discuss the issue of reopening of colleges.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Max Covid waste in May, 62% rise in April from February||NEW DELHI: In the latest data revealed by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), the capital saw an increase of 62% in Covid-19 biomedical waste in April compared with February this year due to a surge in cases. At 4,50,346.9 kg, the highest biomedical waste was generated this year in May. The data was compiled after checking waste generation at isolation, quarantine, corona testing and sampling centres and testing laboratories. According to DPCC data of waste generated, collected and disposed of by two common biomedical waste treatment facilities (CBWTFs) in Delhi, Covid waste in the capital reported a decrease in quantity in February this year (1,23,444.15 kg) compared with January (2,01,012.13 kg). However, it rose by nearly 7kg in March and reached 3,25,770.07kg in April. “The highest quantity was recorded in May, when Delhi witnessed a rise in cases. However, the waste varied per day. On some days, it crossed 20,000 kg per day, but it reduced to around 15,000 kg on a few days,” a DPCC official said. Analysis of data showed that waste generated in May was 17% higher than the same month in 2020. A total of 34,73,258.04 kg Covid waste was generated in Delhi from January to December 2020. From January this year till May, the capital recorded 1,071,804kg of Covid-19 waste. Expecting a huge surge in Covid waste in the next 10 years, the proposed setting up of two additional CBWTFs will take longer as DPCC has extended the deadline for sending the expression of interest for the project due to the second wave. Of the two plants, one will cover East, North East and Shahdara districts, while the other will cater to West, South West and Central districts. Covid waste generated in Delhi are sent for disposal at two CBWTFs in west Delhi’s Nilothi with an installed capacity of 28.8 tonnes per day, and another in an industrial area near GT Karnal Road with an installed capacity of 34 tonnes per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/max-covid-waste-in-may-62-rise-in-april-from-feb/articleshow/84102039.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

They contended that they were the owners and possessors of 59 acres and after the state acquired a portion of their land, they are now in possession of 40 acres. They bought it from Lateefunnisa Begum, wife of Syed Hazmatullah Saheb, and acquired title over the land. The single judge, in his order, decried the methods deployed by the revenue authorities and called them unfair. He also slapped Rs 1 lakh costs on the authorities for their unacceptable actions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/single-judge-had-called-revenue-authorities-methods-unfair/articleshow/84104030.cms||---

The official added that Fortis Healthcare has received fresh supplies of Sputnik V, which will help it ramp up the inoculation drive.A hospital source said there had been some delay in vaccine supply and it could be linked to the increase in cases in Russia. Sputnik V uses two different viruses that cause the common cold (adenovirus) in humans. The two vaccine doses, given 21 days apart, are different and not interchangeable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/apollo-fortis-offer-sputnik-at-2-hospitals/articleshow/84102055.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: A pregnant pause before they decide to take the shot||NEW DELHI: The first day of Covid vaccination for pregnant women on Saturday drew a mixed response. City hospitals said they received numerous queries from expecting mothers about the injection, but the turnout remained low. Apollo Indraprastha Hospitals sources said only one pregnant woman turned up to take the jab. At Manipal Hospital and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, there were no vaccines administered for pregnant women on Saturday. “We’ve started counselling pregnant women to be vaccinated because the benefits outweigh the risks. We hope some expecting mothers will come for the vaccination soon,” said Dr Ruma Satwik, consultant, department of obstetrics & gynaecology at Ganga Ram. Pregnancy has been considered an independent risk factor for Covid progression, adverse outcomes and deaths, Dr Satwik added. The institute of obstetrics and gynaecology at SGRH has issued a statement saying maternal mortality rate during the Covid pandemic was approximately 23 times more than normal. “Also, as per our data, the mortality rate in pregnant women was 2.5 times higher than that in age-matched, non-pregnant women with Covid,” the hospital said. Covid vaccines have been administered to pregnant women in the US and Europe without reports of serious adverse events. On May 28, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation also said that the benefits of Covid vaccinations in pregnant women outweighed the risks. It, however, added that all beneficiaries should be fully informed that the long-term adverse reactions and safety of the vaccine for the foetus were not established yet. The new guidelines, issued on Friday, clearly state that all pregnant women should take the vaccine. “This is the right time to take the vaccine because the positivity rate is low and the risk, therefore, of getting infected at the vaccination centre is also lower,” said Dr Neerja Bhatla, professor and head of obstetrics and gynaecology, AIIMS. Dr Yashica Gudesar, head of obstetrics & gynaecology, Manipal Hospital, said some patients who are planning pregnancy wanted to clear their doubts regarding vaccination. “Before the third wave arrives, if any, I suggest all mums-to-be to get jabbed,” she said. In case a woman has been infected with Covid during the current pregnancy, she should then be vaccinated soon after the delivery, a health ministry advised stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-pregnant-pause-before-they-decide-to-take-the-shot/articleshow/84102071.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad shortlisted for freight smart city dvpt||Aurangabad: The city has made it to the list of 75 cities shortlisted from across the country that has been shortlisted to be developed as freight smart city.Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) commissioner and Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (ASCDCL) CEO Astik Kumar Pandey said the administration will reach out to the different stakeholders in the freight system — like the transporters’ associations and technical institutions — to prepare a comprehensive mobility plan (CMP) that would include the urban mobility plan along with the freight mobility plan under the guidance of the Centre and state government.The official said the latest development would help ease the issues caused due to freight transport by heavy vehicle movement and parking within the city. As per the guidelines given, each city should form a city-level logistics committee that will be chaired by the municipal commissioner and the municipal corporation will be the nodal agency. The nodal agency will coordinate with other agencies like transport, environment, state urban development, town planning and finance departments. The key actions performed by the committee will include data collection, barrier identification, demand forecasting, identification of solutions and measures, project financing, city logistics plan (CLP), and its implementation.The Union minister of housing and urban affairs, minister of state for and Industry, Government of India, and minister of state (independent charge) for civil aviation Hardeep Singh Puri was present in the meeting. The minister motivated the cities to partner with academic institutions and develop freight planning keeping the future in mind. The Centre has asked the states to nominate at least 10 freight smart cities.Special secretary, logistics (GoI) Pawan Agrawal started the meeting with his opening remarks on the concept of freight smart cities. Attendees were briefed about the importance of the inclusion of freight and logistic planning in the city development plan. Many cities are working on improving urban mobility and addressing issues related to passenger transportation, but commodity and goods movement/logistics is a neglected area. The first mile and last mile of freight cost 50% of the overall freight transportation costs.It was discussed that there is going to be a substantial increase in e-commerce and the cities must start preparing a freight mobility plan that would be efficient and look at low carbon emission practices.Technical institutes like School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi, GIZ, Rocky Mountain Institute-India, CEPT and TERI made presentations on various facets of sustainable transport and best practices in logistics planning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-shortlisted-for-freight-smart-city-dvpt/articleshow/84098401.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Out on bail, goon welcomed with hugs, held again||Mumbai: Nine days after a habitual offender from Deonar was released from jail, he was arrested on Friday after a video of his well-wishers welcoming him went viral. The accused, Shahabuddin Idrisi alias Babu Chaddi (45), was released on bail hours after his arrest. The video of his welcome shot on June 23 was shot after his release from Taloja jail. Idrisi faces 21 criminal cases. He had been convicted in a case of attempt to murder. He spent around 10 months in jail since his arrest in August last year. He was released on bail on June 23. The video, lasting a little over 2 minutes, was shot below Baiganwadi skywalkin Govandi. It shows a visibly happy Idrisi, clad in a white shirt and cargo pants, being greeted by his well-wishers who hug him, garland him, offer flowers, click photos with him and shower confetti. As loud music plays in the background, a young boy hugs him. Idrisi kisses the boy on the forehead and lifts him. Both Idrisi and the boy are then picked up by his well-wishers and escorted to a jeep adorned with flowers. His well-wishers halt traffic while Idrisi gets into the jeep. After the video went viral on Friday, the police, on the basis of a complaint by a cop Anil Karande, registered a case against Idrisi and over a dozen others for violating Covid guidelines, not wearing masks. “Chaddiwas arrested on Friday,” said Selvaram Agawane, senior inspector of Deonar police station. He was released on bail within hours. Idrisi, who has two children, got his nickname Chaddi from his business; he has a unit in Navi Mumbai where he stitches underwear and other garments. The Govandi resident was first booked in an assault and criminal intimidation case. He then graduated to bigger crimes like rioting, attempt to murder and extortion. He was convicted for five years rigorous imprisonment in 2007 in an attempt to murder case.  “He was on the run in an MCOCA case,” said Kishore Gayke, senior inspector of Shivaji Nagar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-out-on-bail-goon-welcomed-with-hugs-held-again/articleshow/84106073.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Ahmedabad||Students make the most of virtual internships||Ahmedabad: For Chintan Mehta, a student of MICA, the ‘virtual’ internship experience included fireside sessions with global leaders of Amazon, yoga and fitness sessions and even stand-up comic sessions. For Jai Shrivastava, another MICA student, it was a virtual gaming session as an ice-breaker at Sony Pictures. Like almost all aspects of campus life – from induction to placements – the internships have also gone virtual for the past two years for majority of the premier educational institutes. When it was almost impossible due to the pandemic, the institutes changed the requirement to fieldwork in the students’ surroundings or a project which could be assessed by an external expert. “Internship serves several purposes – it’s the first formal step for majority of the students in the industry. It also gives students to experience first-hand the challenges of their chosen field. The internships also forge bonds with seniors and peers that goes a long way in establishing careers and in many cases landing the first job,” said a senior faculty member at GNLU. But majority of the firms have also adopted to the new climate. Sources in the industry however said that compared to the physical presence of an intern, some drawbacks are also observed. “The students can be given limited exposure to the company as all work cannot be sent over internet. The things that only could be experienced – in fields of design or programming – with the seniors,” said founder of a city-based IT firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/students-make-the-most-of-virtual-internships/articleshow/84102776.cms||---
---||Dehradun||With 11 CMs in over 20 years, Uttarakhand has seen maximum political instability||DEHRADUN: Since its formation in November 2000, Uttarakhand has seen 11 CMs so far. Out of the 11, seven have been from BJP and three from Congress. Maj Gen BC Khanduri (retd), a BJP chief minister was CM twice. Interestingly, no BJP chief minister has completed his full tenure despite being voted to power with a good majority twice--first in 2007 and second in 2017. On the contrary, neighbouring state Himachal Pradesh, which is geographically and culturally quite similar to Uttarakhand, has seen only six CMs in the 58 years of its existence. Political instability in Uttarakhand started within the first year of it becoming a separate state. Nityanand Swami who was picked by the BJP leadership to head the interim government in November 2000, was replaced by Bhagat Singh Koshyari, minister in his cabinet even before he could complete the first year in office. Koshyari, after a four-month tenure as CM, could not secure victory for BJP in the assembly elections in 2002 and Congress emerged victorious with ND Tiwari, who had been the CM of undivided Uttar Pradesh thrice, becoming the CM of Uttarakhand. He completed his full five-year term and till date, remains the only CM of the state who could do so. In the 2007 assembly polls, BJP once again came back to power and Maj Gen B C Khanduri (retd), a close associate of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was sworn in to lead the government in Uttarakhand. In June 2009, he was replaced by Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, then a minister in his cabinet. Nishank was also subsequently replaced in September 2011, and Khanduri made a comeback as CM just five months before the assembly polls. It was a similar scenario when Congress took over in 2012. Incumbent chief minister Vijay Bahuguna was replaced by Harish Rawat in 2014. Doon-based political analyst Jai Singh Rawat terms infighting within both national parties, opportunism and lack of political ideology among the politicians as the primary reason behind political instability in Uttarakhand. "Rather than development and governance, issues like hill and plains, Kumaoni and Garhwali and Thakur and Brahmin have been sadly on the forefront Both national parties try to strike a balance on those lines only," he said. In a similar vein, social activist Anoop Nautiyal said, "The biggest casualty of political drama which has been unfolding quite regularly is the unfulfilled aspirations of the people of Uttarakhand. The state has failed to live up to the enormous potential it has due to the political instability.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-11-cms-in-over-20-years-ukhand-has-seen-maximum-political-instability/articleshow/84100245.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Hyderabad||University of Hyderabad team generates chemically stable n-DAP fertilizer||HYDERABAD: The researchers at the University of Hyderabad (UoH) in collaboration with the International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI), have developed an industrially-viable dry method to generate chemically stable and 5000 times smaller nano-diammonium phosphate (n-DAP) fertilizer. A team led by Rahul Kumar, assistant professor, Department of Plant Sciences, UoH—which consist of both material scientists and plant biologists from the varsity-—is said to have tested both types of fertilizers on tomato and wheat seedlings. They have demonstrated an extraordinary superiority of nano-DAP fertilizer over the conventional granular DAP (c-DAP). This work is recently published in Nanoscale Advances, a reputed scientific journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, United Kingdom. By testing four different procedures for the nano-DAP dispersal, the team even recommended the best method of its application. “In the labscale experiments, the reduced quantity of nano-DAP fertilizer input than c-DAP promoted the growth and development of the early seedlings in both crops. It also led to enhanced phosphate uptake efficiency in these seedlings,” said Kumar. Based on the results in the lab-scale experiments, the research team is now planning to test the efficacy of nano-DAP on tomato plants under field conditions. While several hurdles remain to be overcome before the real potential of nano-DAP can be realized under field conditions, the researchers think its application in reduced quantity may significantly cut down on the overall input of conventional Phosphorus (P)-fertilizers currently applied in agriculture. The n-DAP in reduced doses while meeting the plants’ optimum P nutrient requirement would also be preferred for better soil health and agricultural sustainability, said the researchers. They said that excessive use of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus(P), and Potassium (K) fertilizers over decades has affected the soil quality and that a concerted effort is required to cut down the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uoh-team-generates-chemically-stable-n-dap-fertilizer/articleshow/84104104.cms||---

All the accused belong to the same family and were selling the jewellery made by the complainant, Dushyant Kagdada, for more than a year. Kagdada in his complaint stated that he met Shobhna Raijada through a customer. Shobhna used to take jewellery from Kagdada and he used to get the payment for the same after the former sold it to the customers. Gradually, Raijada’s husband and other family members also joined in the business. In November 2020, Kagdada gave jewellery worth Rs 95.47 lakh to the Raijada family. According to the complaint, when Kagdada demanded the payment the Raijada family refused to pay and also threatened to kill him. The accused made a part payment of Rs 10 lakh after Kagdada filed an application with the police regarding the cheating. The cops registered an offence against Shobhna Raijada, Krushnasinh Raijada, Dilipsinh Raijada, Ilaba Raijada, Dhanrajsinh Raijada and Hirendrasinh Raijada under IPC sections 406, 420, 506 (2) and 114.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/six-of-family-booked-for-cheating/articleshow/84100343.cms||---

His son Hrishikesh has been asked to appear on Tuesday. Deshmukh had failed to turn up twice before the ED earlier. Around 8pm on Friday, while one team comprising three officials reached Deshmukh’s government-allotted bungalow Dnyaneshwari in south Mumbai’s Malabar Hill, another team visited his flat in Sukhada Apartment in Worli. It is believed that Deshmukh is in Delhi and may explore legal options for relief from any coercive action. His cell phone was also switched off, sources said. The ED is investigating a money laundering case against Deshmukh. Its investigation has now found over Rs 50 crore suspicious transactions in around two dozen companies associated with Deshmukh. The ED examined records of these companies to trace the source of the suspicious money. Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh in his complaint to the chief minister in March had alleged that Deshmukh had, as state home minister, demanded Rs 100 crore every month from (now-dismissed) assistant police inspector Sachin Waze and two other officers after asking them to collect it from bars in the city and other sources. Earlier, the ED had stated that Rs 4.7 crore in bribes collected by Waze, then heading the CIU branch of Mumbai police, was paid to Deshmukh. From that money, Rs 4.18 crore was transferred to Deshmukh’s Nagpur-based educational trust through shell companies with the help of Delhi-based hawala operators Surendra and Virendra Jain, showing it as donation. The ED last month arrested Deshmukh’s private secretary (additional collector rank government officer) Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde for helping Deshmukh and Hrishikesh with the money laundering. Palande and Shinde have been sent to ED custody till July 6. The ED stated that Palande had “admitted” that a meeting was held on March 4 with police officers, where discussions about Covid-19 restrictions on bars took place. The ED had alleged that Palande and Shinde had played an active role in money laundering. Palande had coordinated with Waze, DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil to collect money from ‘orchestra bar’ owners in Mumbai and handed it over to Shinde, it said. Waze, in his statement to the ED, had said he had collected Rs 4.7 crore between December 2020 and February 2021 (when the government relaxed lockdown conditions allowing bars to operate) and handed it over to Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-not-home-emailed-3rd-summons/articleshow/84106102.cms||Vijay V Singh

Eleven people have been arrested after a video of the incident went viral on social media. The woman, who was travelling alone by the rickshaw, took it from Ulhasnagar to go to her Dombivli home. She claimed that the diver kept asking for her phone number. “When I refused, he started misbehaving with me,” she claimed, adding that she had by then contacted two of her male friends from Ulhasnagar, and kept informing them of her location as the vehicle continued to move. “I told the driver to halt, but he refused until I threatened to jump out of the moving vehicle,” she said, adding that he stopped at Kathemanavli. By then, two of her male friends reached there. The woman said that the rickshaw driver, Sagar Mahatre (27), too had called a few fellow drivers at the spot. “The driver and his friends started assaulting me and my two friends,” the woman told TOI. Shocking: Mob thrashes woman and her two friends in KalyanA few onlookers gathered at the spot on hearing the commotion at that hour. A bystander shot a video of the alleged assault and posted it on social media, tagging the Thane police. The video shows the woman and her two friends being beaten up with a belt. It shows them urging the assaulters to let them go, but the assault continues. Thane police commissioner Jai Jeet Singh ordered officials of Kolsewadi police station to initiate action. Senior inspector Sahurao Salve of Kolsewadi police station’s team tracked down the three victim but the woman refused to lodge a complaint. The police then took down the complaint from her two friends and lodge a criminal offence, and later arrested auto driver Mahatre and 10 others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-auto-driver-10-others-held-for-assault-on-woman-2-friends/articleshow/84106986.cms||Pradeep Gupta

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt hospitals to get 13,700 ventilators before 3rd wave||AHMEDABAD: The state government, which has so far installed about 8,200 ventilators in government hospitals, is planning to add over 4,500 more for the possible third wave of Covid-19. Gujarat Medical Service Corporation Ltd (GMSCL) which is the central purchase authority for procurement of medical devices for government hospitals in Gujarat has recently floated tender for 500 ventilators. “There are about 8,170 ventilators installed by the state government after the Covid-19 pandemic forced a nationwide lockdown in March last year. The government has so far cleared plans to procure 4,500 additional ventilators and these numbers are expected to increase in coming days,” said a senior state government official in the know of the matter. Companies like BEL-Skanray, Max Ventilators and Schiller Healthcare India Pvt Ltd are expected to participate in the bids floated by GMSCL for ventilators, said sources. The 55% addition in the installed capacity that the state is expected to see in next few months does not include ventilators to be procured at a rate contract, he added. A rate contract is essentially related to a fixed rate. Within the period of currency of the contract, the manufacturer has to supply material at a fixed rate, irrespective of quantity. The state government recently held a pre-bid meeting with ventilator manufacturers for the third wave. “The demand for ventilators has nearly doubled in the second wave as compared to the peak demand in the first wave. The country was facing a shortage of about 50,000-60,000 ventilators representing roughly 50% of the country’s total requirement in May when the country reported the highest daily cases of Covid-19 infected persons,” said an industry expert. The third wave is expected to hit in the month of September and October according to some researchers and healthcare experts. Some experts claim that the third wave is likely to affect children more. While there has been some recent study to show that this may not be the case, the Gujarat government does not want to leave anything to chance, it seems. GMSCL recently ordered 39 paediatric ventilators from Schiller Healthcare India Pvt Ltd and plans to acquire more going further. “Many ventilator makers have an in-built facility in their ventilators so that it can be used both for adults and children,” a government source said. During the first wave, 18,000 ventilators were installed in ICUs at hospitals across the country. About 90% of them were imported. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, many Indian companies began producing ventilators and they added some 40,000 ventilators in the first few months, according to industry sources. The reason behind the change in demand-supply scenario between November and May was that the strain of virus in the second wave had a greater percentage of patients who required ICU care, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-hosps-to-get-13-7k-ventilators-before-3rd-wave/articleshow/84102782.cms||---

Moreover, nearly 18% of our total volunteers in 2-18 age group too had antibodies. This means, the kids had recovered without experiencing any symptoms,” said principal trial investigator Dr Vasant Khalatkar. Two-year-old children having antibodies developed without symptoms indicates that many kids in Nagpur had already contracted Covid and recovered too. This crucial data reduces the threat of infection to children in the projected third wave. The paediatric population has been divided into three age groups. Earlier, 10 of 50 children in 12 to 18 years of age group had tested positive in antibody tests. In younger age group (6-12), five of 30 children had antibodies while in the youngest age group of 2-6 years, 3 of 20 shortlisted kids had antibodies. According to Dr Khalatkar, 14 children were given the jab and that completed the target for the Nagpur trial site. “Now, these children will be observed for the next 208 days. Their second jab is after 28 days,” he said. Trial coordinator Dr Ashish Tajne said though the trial period is of 208 days, the emergency use authorization can come early. “The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will meet on the 56th day and see the initial results of the trials. These are phase II and III trials, which means the emergency use authorization can be granted in between,” he said, adding that Covaxin for adults was given authorization in a similar manner. Next two months are crucial and positive early results can bring vaccine for kids by October-November this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kids-had-antibodies-covaxin-trial-news/articleshow/84104133.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Madiga voters crucial in deciding Huzurabad victory||HYDERABAD: Madiga community is likely to play a crucial role in deciding the electoral prospects of the candidates in the Huzurabad bypoll. Scheduled Castes (SCs) comprise the highest number of voters in the constituency. Of the total 45,000 SC voters, nearly 38,000 are Madigas and the remaining are Malas. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s Dalit empowerment scheme could not have come at a better time for the ruling TRS, analysts said. The scheme poses a major challenge for the BJP and Congress as it would be difficult for them to woo the voters from the SC community. The scheme offers a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh per family with an initial budget of Rs 1,200 crore being earmarked for its implementation. Former MP and BJP in charge of Huzurabad constituency AP Jithender Reddy, who is camping in Huzurabad constituency, told STOI that Dalits were vexed with the ruling because of which KCR has come out with the Dalit empowerment scheme. The TRS has failed to fulfil its promise of distributing three acres of agricultural land to landless Dalits. Not only the SC community, but other sections of the society are just waiting to defeat the ruling TRS, he said. “The bypoll is not going to be an election between Eatala Rajender and KCR but a contest between the people of Huzurabad constituency and KCR,” Jithender said.However, TRS leaders brushed aside the BJP leader’s talk as “wishful thinking” and said the Dalit empowerment scheme was announced by KCR in the state’s annual budget itself. “KCR has been burning the midnight oil to come out with a scheme to uplift Dalits and this scheme is only the beginning,” a senior TRS leader said. Though Huzurabad constituency has a large number of voters from Munnuru Kapu, Padmashali, Mudiraj, Goud and Yadava communities, all of them are from Backward Classes community comprising over 1.20 lakh voters. The vote share of these communities has always been divided among various political parties. Political analysts said the selection of candidates by the ruling TRS will also play a crucial role as Eatala is a Mudiraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/madiga-voters-crucial-in-deciding-huzurabad-victory/articleshow/84102165.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Aurangabad||Article on Beed published in Columbia university journal||Aurangabad: The ‘Columbia Public Policy Review’ has published an article highlighting a case study of Beed district in a first of its kind article published by a journal of an Ivy League university.The topic — Policing a Pandemic in Rural India: From Enforcement to Engagement — has been penned by the 2013 batch IPS officer Harssh Poddar, who is also an Oxford-educated lawyer and Chevening scholar. He had served as the Beed district chief of police until October 2020.The article, published on Thursday, highlighted the impact of Covid on the vast rural hinterland and the mobilization of local law enforcement agencies in Beed. The article states how different means, including awareness videos by senior police officers, served as an authoritative source of genuine information, cutting through the fake news. During the first wave, with 48 cases being registered and 60 arrests, Beed recorded the highest number of police actions against fake news items.The article has touched upon the actions by the police, including border sealing, gram suraksha dals, contact tracing cells, geo-fencing of home-quarantined individuals and area domination of forces.“Despite the aggravating factors, Beed remained completely free of the infection until relaxations to the lockdown were announced. The overarching principles that have informed the police’s strategy are empathy, awareness, and firmness,” said the article. It noted how the police coordinated the return of 1.60 lakh workers, without any death, and how effectively the control room at the police headquarters coordinated the movement of workers through 19 designated border entry points.It described how the police stations were used as granaries to supply food to the families crippled by the lockdown. “Police officers, accustomed to visiting houses for searches and arrests, delivered life-saving rations,” the article added.The efforts made by Beed police in addressing the issue of domestic violence by starting a dedicated helpline were also noted. During the lockdown, police teams resolved 132 cases of domestic violence through mediation, legal action and educational home visits. The police acquainted perpetrators with legal consequences if violence or ill-treatment continued. The article disclosed how the police coordinated with religious leaders when the lockdown coincided with some of the biggest festivals and not a single congregation was held during the lockdown.While suggesting that rural communities need to play to their strengths in handling the contagion rather than emulating urban methods, the article concluded: “Relative availability of space, self-reliant consumption patterns, close-knit communities — aspects that define rural societies — can become some of the most impactful weapons we have in this battle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/article-on-beed-published-in-columbia-university-journal/articleshow/84098447.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Two Delhi civic bodies to add parking space for 5,000 cars in two years||NEW DELHI: In order to speed up execution of parking projects halted by the pandemic, the municipal corporations have set fresh deadlines for them. However, taking note of the fact that some of these projects were conceived a long time ago to minimise parking hassles, the civic bodies aim to complete work as quickly as possible. South Delhi Municipal Corporation wants to finish its six puzzle/shuttle parking projects at Adchini, Nizamuddin Basti, M Block Greater Kailash I, GK II, Amar Colony and Punjabi Bagh by 2023 and create an estimated parking space for 1,500 cars. Of these, the parking facilities at Nizamuddin and Adchini will be completed in a couple of months. “The six-floor puzzle parking at Adchini Village with space for 56 cars will be completed at July end and the one at Nizamuddin Basti with space for 86 cars likely to become operational by October-end,” said an SDMC official. In comparison, at GK I M Block where tendering will be allotted in a couple of months, the project will require 16-18 months. “It is an automated shuttle parking project with nine floors. Unlike puzzle parking, the civil work here will take longer because the entire external structure will be of RCC and internal of steel. Also, it is a bigger project with estimated space for 400 cars. The contract is likely to be finalised by September,” the official added. Regarding the parking project at Amar Colony, GK II and Punjabi Bagh cremation ground, the approval from SDMC’s standing committee has been sought. These parking facilities will cater to, respectively, 81, 238 and 225 vehicles. “While M Block Greater Kailash-II will be a tower parking lot, the other two will be puzzle parking. Once we get the final approval from the deliberative wing, tenders will be immediately called for and work started to finish in 8-10 months,” the official disclosed. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has similarly shifted the deadline by a month or two for some parking projects, now targeting the completion of its five major multi-level parking projects at Gandhi Maidan (Chandni Chowk), Qutub Road, Shiva Market, Nigambodh and Church Mission Road by June 2022. These will create a cumulative space for 3,315 vehicles. “Covid stopped work on the on-going parking projects. Because they were conceived of a long time ago, completing them on time is our priority. The multilevel parking at Gandhi Maidan, Chandni Chowk will provide space for 2,338 vehicles, while the one at Shiva Market will provide space for 500 and Qutub Road multilevel for 177 vehicles. All of these projects will be done by June 2022,” said a senior north corporation official. The stack parking projects at Nigambodh (space for 100 vehicles) and Church Mission Road (200 vehicles), however, are scheduled to complete in the next six months because not much construction work is involved here. “We only shifted their deadlines because work was halted by the pandemic,” said the north official. There are also four multi-level parking projects planned a long time back in Karol Bagh zone and awaiting tendering. “These are projects at Shastri Park, Bank Street, Pusa Lane and Rajendra Nagar with space for, respectively, 575, 500, 380 and 420 vehicles. “Most probably, tendering of these will be in August and work could begin by December. We hope to complete the projects in 24 months,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-corpns-to-add-parking-space-for-5k-cars-in-2-yrs/articleshow/84102188.cms||Vibha Sharma

A senior police officer said the decision to take the e-commerce website on record will be taken after obtaining a legal opinion.Similar cases were registered in the city in May 2018, after the police had cracked on the illegal procurement of sharp-edged weapons on similar pretexts from e-commerce websites. The probe had revealed that 24 people purchased sharp edged-weapons from the website.Then the probe had revealed that many suspects, who were part of the riots in the city, had obtained these weapons from e-commerce websites, which continue to sell them by tagging the products as artefacts and showpieces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-police-seize-5-swords-bought-online/articleshow/84098432.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The health department on Saturday issued directions along with the guidelines - ‘Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy’ issued by the Centre. “We will start vaccination for pregnant women, now they are also eligible to receive the jab. The Centre has already issued the guidelines on it,” said a senior health department official. During the second wave of Covid-19, a lot of pregnant women had died of the virus. In Jaipur’s Mahila Chiksalaya, 40 pregnant women died. They were all rushed to the hospital in severe condition. “Pregnant women are 2-3 times more susceptible to Covid than other women and more likely to be admitted in intensive care units and need respiratory support when compared with other women of the same age group. We have witnessed high rate of maternal morbidity and mortality along with premature deliveries, neonatal intensive care unit admissions and intrauterine deaths during second wave,” said Dr Shalini Rathore, Covid incharge, Mahila Chikitsalaya. Dr Rathore said, “Therefore, it is highly recommended that pregnant women should get vaccinated against Covid as soon as possible. It can be given in any trimester to safeguard the life of the mother and the baby.” Till now, pregnant women did not have any shield of protection against Covid as they were not eligible for vaccination. Every month, the health department reports more than 80,000 institutional deliveries. In 2020-21, the state reported 13.2 lakh institutional deliveries. “Since the day my wife conceived, we have had a fear of Covid in mind as she was not allowed to get a jab. Now, the government has allowed vaccination for pregnant woman, it gives us a sense of safety,” said Manish Kumar, a resident of Walled City. According to health authorities, symptomatic pregnant women are at an increased risk of severe diseases and it might affect the foetus too. Hence, the Covid vaccine is recommended for pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pregnant-women-to-be-vaccinated-from-tomorrow/articleshow/84102169.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: First antibody cocktail therapy done in RUHS||JAIPUR: Within days of the first Delta+ variant case being reported in the state, Jaipur’s RUHS Hospital has for the first time injected a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies into two Covid patients with the aim of preventing progression of the disease. It has been done at a time when experts are anticipating that a third wave may emerge in September-October. Doctors have started using it to find out if the therapy is fetching esired result. It is given to patients who are in the first phase of Covid when the virus replicates. It has also been administered at a private hospital to find out its efficacy. RUHS Hospital injected Casirivimab and Imdevimab, monoclonal antibodies (humanimmunoglobin antibodies), for blocking the virus from entering host cells. It is a one-time administration of the two drugs approved at a combined dose of 1200 mg (600 mg of each drug) administered by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous route. The two patients were given monoclonal antibodies after they tested positive for Covid through RT-PCR within 7 days of symptoms onset. “We have started using monoclonal antibodies in our Covid patients to stop the virus from becoming severe. We are giving it in initial phase (within one week) of Covid infection. The second phase of Covid (after one week of infection) is of inflammation. So, monoclonal antibodies are given in the first week of infection to prevent or slow down progression of the disease,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College, under which RUHS Hospital is working as a dedicated Covid hospital. The two Covid patients, who were given monoclonal antibodies at RUHS Hospital on Friday, were at high risk as the disease could progress into severe Covid. “The patients had comorbidities and they have a higher risk of getting severe Covid, which could require hospitalisation. We have given them monoclonal antibodies in the initial phase of infection for reducing the chances of progression of disease,” said Dr Ajit Singh, medical superintendent, RUHS Hospital. One of the two patients who received the monoclonal antibodies is a 68-year-old woman from Jatrapur of Cooch Behar in West Bengal. She has comorbidities and is at higher risk of disease progression to severe Covid. The second patient is a 55-year-old resident of Malviya Nagar of Jaipur. He also has comorbidities and at higher risk of developing severe Covid. Dr Singh said that the monoclonal antibodies were provided to the patients free of cost. A private hospital has also given monoclonal antibodies to two patients. “We have given monoclonal antibodies to two patients in our hospital. It is given to those Covid patients, who are not very sick but they are obese, diabetic, hypertensive and among those who have higher risk of getting hospitalised due to disease progression. Since not many Covid patients are coming to hospital, we may give it to patients if third wave emerges, depending on its result,” said Dr Sheetu Singh, director (Covid pulmonary rehab) at a private hospital. In the private hospital, the cost of monoclonal antibody therapy is around Rs 60,000. A patient can come to the hospital and get it. Doctors keep him under observation for an hour before allowing him to go home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-in-jaipur-get-antibody-cocktail-to-fight-covid/articleshow/84102145.cms||---

The order has asked that approximately Rs 13 lakh, which was taken additionally from over 200 patients, need to be refunded after the administration received a complaint regarding the same. A committee found the allegations to be true. Collector Namrata Vrishni told TOI, “The state government had fixed the price of treatment for Covid in private hospitals and we received information that a private hospital in Sanchore had charged extra for the same. Following this, a committee was set up to look into the matter and based on the findings an order for the refund was issued. This action was taken under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010.” The said private hospital had charged Rs 13,35,845 from 216 patients who were admitted for treatment between April 1 to May 3. After the order was issued earlier this week, a total sum of Rs 12,66,985 was deposited in the accounts of 204 patients while the remaining Rs 68,860 is yet to be given to 12 patients who could not be contacted, but the district health officials are trying to contact them at the earliest. Officials claimed that this is possibly the first time in the state that a private hospital has been asked to refund the extra amount charged to the patients. Last year in September, the Rajasthan government had fixed rates for coronavirus treatment at private hospitals, keeping the charges at Rs 5,000 to Rs 9,900 a day. According to a notification issued by the state medical and health department, the cost of treatment in hospitals not certified by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) has been kept at Rs 5,000 to Rs 9,000 a day. The treatment cost includes Rs 1,200 for a PPE kit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/district-admn-asks-pvt-hosp-to-refund-amount/articleshow/84102175.cms||---
---||India||BJP: Rahul Gandhi being used as pawn by rival firms||NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is being used as a “pawn” by competing defence companies to raise doubts on the Rafale fighter deal and claimed that the opposition party keeps raking up allegations of corruption in an attempt to “weaken” India. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said the reports pertain to a complaint by an NGO and more facts were needed, and criticised Congress for making corruption synonymous with defence deals when it was in office. Patra cited the CAG report and the SC verdict, which had found no wrongdoing in the defence deal, to reject allegations of Congress. “This is first time that the Gandhi-Nehru family has not been able to get any kickbacks…Obviously they are disturbed and making ungrounded allegations,” he said. “The way Rahul Gandhi is behaving, it will not be an exaggeration to say he is being used as a pawn by competing companies. He has been lying right from the beginning on the issue. Probably, he is acting as an agent or some member of Gandhi family has been doing so for a competing company,” Patra alleged. Citing several examples, Patra claimed that Gandhi had cited misrepresented facts and had to even tender an unconditional apology in the Supreme Court for coining the term “Chowkidar Chor Hai” while claiming the court’s observations confirmed his allegations of corruption. “There is a non disclosure clause about the pricing of the deal … However, details have been given to the SC and the CAG, which gave clean chit and said there was no wrongdoing in the procedure and acquisition of Rafale fighter planes,” Patra said and added, “It seems that there has been a deal between competing firms and Gandhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-rahul-gandhi-being-used-as-pawn-by-rival-firms/articleshow/84107498.cms||---

His aspirations have created a buzz within the political circles in Maharashtra. Different Maratha outfits too were quick to react. The Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) has criticised Sambhajiraje for allegedly seeking political mileage in the name of fighting for the rights of the Maratha community. “We don’t accept the leadership of such an opportunistic leader. We worship the seat of the Maratha kingdom, but not any of its descendants who is misguiding the community,” MKM state convener Kiran Kale said. Kale further alleged that Sambhajiraje was getting close to the ruling MVA government. “He recently canceled his agitations in support of the Maratha reservation after a formal announcement. We have a strong suspicion that Sambhajiraje is getting close to the MVA by softening his stand against the government over the failed legal battle in the SEBC quota matter,” Kale said. Meanwhile, Maratha outfit Sambhaji Brigade has said that Sambhajiraje should first step out of BJP’s shadow to get the desired support to become the chief minister. “We are ready to support him if he quits the BJP. We are ready to empower him if he joins us formally,” the outfit said. Maharashtra social justice minister Dhananjay Munde has also reacted to Sambhajiraje’s comment. “Any public issue is related to the masses. It is, therefore, wrong to eye any personal benefit while carrying out any movement for such an issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maratha-outfits-criticise-sambhajirajes-comment/articleshow/84098463.cms||---

Even regular netizens from Punjab are up in arms against the government on the issue. What’s more, known faces from incumbent Congress, like Gidderbaha MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, are taking on their party’s government on the issue. AAP and SAD have started sharing slides and posters on social media showing the outages as big failure of Congress government. AAP compared the power scene in Punjab with its Delhi model. SAD counted the failures of the Congress government, like shutting down of power plants and not adding any generation capacity. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said under the Congress regime the people were sweating out in worst form. The government did not show any foresightedness and never tried to add any generation capacity despite regular rise in demand. AAP farmers’ wing head Kultar Singh Sandhwa said right from the chief minister to ministers were more concerned in saving their respective chairs and least bothered about the miseries of the people. This government had left the people at the mercy of the rain gods without doing anything to provide them respite, he added. Congress MLA Warring, while tendering apology to the people for the power situation, said the government should have made prior arrangement for adequate power supply to save people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/oppn-goes-online-to-criticises-cong-over-power-outages/articleshow/84106168.cms||Neel Kamal

The LHP in Rajkot is being constructed with French technology of monolithic concrete construction using tunnel formwork to build houses that are affordable and more capable of withstanding natural disasters. In this technology the casting of walls and slab is done simultaneously enabling construction of three units in just one day. Last year the housing and urban affairs ministry had initiated the Global Housing Technology Challenge (GHTC)-India for speedier construction of affordable houses. Under the GHTC-India, 54 technologies from all over the world were shortlisted for their suitability to the Indian conditions. Out of that six different technologies were implemented for construction of LHPs at Rajkot, Lucknow, Rachi, Agartala, Indore and Chennai. The beneficiaries of Rajkot LHP will be given possession of the houses next year. The total project cost is Rs 118 crore and the units will be allotted to economically weaker sections of the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pm-reviews-rajkot-light-house-projects-progress/articleshow/84100400.cms||---

They advised Revanth to go through the anti-defection law before making any allegations against them and warned him to mind his language. On the TPCC president’s allegation that they were sold out to the TRS, the MLAs said the TDLP, in which Revanth was a member before he joined Congress, also merged with the TRSLP and added that merger of parties was not new.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-mlas-hit-back-at-revanth/articleshow/84102198.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||HC stay: Gujarat PSUs may miss audit deadline||AHMEDABAD: More than 10 state Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) are likely to miss the deadline of August 31 to submit the audit reports this year, but none of them will be held responsible for the default as the Gujarat high court has granted them this protection. The HC said that these PSUs should not be held responsible in case they are not in a position to submit audit reports under the provisions of the Companies Act. The deadline could be missed due to a high court’s order by which the ousted audit firm Pipara & Co LLP has been appointed again as statutory auditor of these PSUs. The HC said that it is conscious that its decision is going to cause some difficulties to the companies and the newly appointed auditors, but it has to set right the “illegality” and to set the clock back. This complexity arose after the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) raised objection to Pipara & Co’s work quality claiming that it had not pointed out the multi-crore scam in the Gujarat State Land Development Corporation Ltd (GSLDC) in 2018. The ACB warned the state government about the services of the audit firm. The government in December 2020 informed eight of its PSUs to hold thorough inspection of the audit firm’s work and blacklist it. Since the statutory auditor is appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), the state government informed the CAG to remove Pipara & Co and appoint another auditor. Accordingly, B P Bang & Co was appointed as statutory auditor for the Gujarat State Police Housing Corporation Ltd, which is one of the PSUs that were being audited by Pipara & Co for last few years. A sudden removal from the PSU brought Pipara & Co to the high court complaining that the state government and the CAG did not even inform the company before taking the decision. Not granting an opportunity of hearing is against the principles of natural justice. The CAG admitted to the mistake. After hearing, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Vaibhavi Nanavati quashed the CAG’s decision to remove the company from the position of statutory auditor of the PSUs and ordered to restore its status saying that the basic procedure was not followed. The HC has granted one month’s time to CAG to carry out the process once again. While Pipara & Co’s position has been restored, the HC has asked it not to undertake any audit work till CAG passes a fresh order on whether it is to be retained. The court has also stayed the new audit firm from its job in the meanwhile. As the audit work has been stayed, the HC said that this would cause problems for the PSUs and the new auditors, but it has to set the illegality right.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-stay-state-psus-may-miss-audit-deadline/articleshow/84102196.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Two ED officers remanded till July 7||AHMEDABAD: A special CBI court here on Saturday sent two Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers to custodial interrogation till July 7 after they were arrested on graft charges for allegedly demanding Rs 75 lakh bribe from a Surat-based businessman, whose firm is under probe for Rs 104-crore bank fraud. After producing ED’s deputy director Purna Kam Singh and assistant director Bhuvnesh Kumar for allegedly receiving Rs 5 lakh bribe through a middleman, the investigating officer of the CBI sought their remand for five days. In seeking their custodial interrogation, the probe agency submitted that the demand was for a huge amount and it is necessary to find out who other officers are who may be involved in this case. There appears a connivance of the accused with the angadiya firm, which is required to be investigated. Two other persons’ involvement in transaction of the bribe amount is also needed to be probed. The probe agency also submitted in the court that the accused persons were not cooperating. Moreover, there is a requirement to collect additional electronic evidences by recording specimen voice, handwriting and their fingerprints, for which the accused persons’ custody was needed. It was also submitted that there is a requirement to investigate into their properties, which might have been created from undue advantages received in the past. Singh’s advocate Amit Nair objected to the remand application by rebutting the charges. He argued that the complainant in the case has an axe to grind against the officer because his alleged bank fraud was under investigation by the CBI and the ED got into the picture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-ed-officers-remanded-till-july-7/articleshow/84102202.cms||---

The loading, which is around 55% more when compared to the loading of 18.4 MT recorded during April to June last year, has earned revenue worth Rs 2,468 crore, as per the official data. Ch Rakesh, the chief public relations officer of SCR, said the relentless efforts of the entire workforce saw the zone showing positive momentum in freight loading despite the pandemic situation. “The zone has emphasised on the availability of wagons so that the supply is sharply met on par with demand. During the current year, 4,830 wagons are being supplied in a day on an average, while 3,175 wagons per day were available during the last year,” he said. Among other loadings, freight loading of cement has shown an upswing across SCR. SCR general manager Gajanan Mallya said the movement of freight trains is being given due importance. Those were regularly monitored at all levels. “We could duly maintain the average speed of freight trains consistently between 47 km/ hour to 50 km/hour,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scr-surpasses-freight-loading-target-of-27-5-mt/articleshow/84098474.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Demand dented for office, retail spaces||AHMEDABAD: According to real estate industry sources, WFH, high inventory, deferral of expansion by corporates, territorial restrictions, and fewer footfalls in showrooms and malls have dented the demand for retail and office spaces in commercial projects. Building plans were revised in the case of three commercial projects in 2018-19 and the number stood at seven in 2020. However, the number shot up in 2021, said AMC officials. “Our commercial project was retail-heavy and the demand for retail spaces took a beating after the outbreak of the pandemic,” said Rajesh Vaswani, executive director, Venus Infrastructure. “The project location was good for a residential scheme. Hence, we made it a residential project.” A builder in Sanand moved a proposal for setting up a multiplex and a shopping complex. However, he changed the project into a twin bungalow scheme in the same area. The demand for residential housing also ensured some cash flow for developers. That factor has prompted many to convert their commercial projects, even those on the drawing boards, into residential schemes. “Converting a commercial project into a residential one, whenever it is possible, is an intelligent step,” said Balbirsingh Khalsa, national director, industrial and logistics, and branch director-Ahmedabad, Knight Frank India, a real estate consultancy in India. “On the one hand, vacancy levels in offices are high and rents are falling. The prospects for retail spaces continue to be clouded amid pandemic fears,” Khalsa added. “On the other hand, the demand for residential dwellings is good and the residential housing inventory is very low at present. Currently, it makes sense to switch to residential from commercial projects.” AMC and AUDA officials said that there was a rush for commercial projects in 2018 and 2019. The trend has changed in 2021. At present, about 80% of the building plans coming up for approval in both AMC and AUDA are for residential projects. The percentage was 60 over the past few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/demand-dented-for-office-retail-spaces/articleshow/84102206.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The incident happened at Macharam in Amrabad mandal on Friday when a group of forest officials reached the village to draw a base line between revenue and forest limits to take up plantation drives. Chenchu families in possession of these lands without Recognition of Forest Rights (RoFR) pattas, meanwhile, claimed that they were being falsely accused of the crime by officials. “When we saw the officials drawing a base line, we intervened and asked them to wait until we get the letter from the collector. We had already met him and he had asked us to come after five days to collect the letter. The argument began when the forest officials asked us to show proof on that very day,” said Udtanuri Alvela, a resident of Macharam village. He added: “One woman poured petrol over herself in the fear of losing her land. In the process, a few drops of petrol fell on one of the forest staff who was standing close to her. We did not intend to harm the officials. These are all false accusations.” This isn’t the first time that forest officials and Chenchus in the village clashed over land disputes. According to Y Ballaya, member of Poura Hakkula Sangham said there are regular disputes between the Chenchus and forest officials from past few weeks in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/complaint-against-7-chenchus-after-clash-with-forest-officials/articleshow/84102211.cms||---

The adjudicating authority under the Food Safety and Standards Act also imposed fines on three other establishments, including Khadi Bhandar, after their products were found to be of substandard quality. According to a statement issued by Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), health department officials had collected the samples of coconut ‘laddu’ from Om Gruh Udhyog in October 2015. The sweet was declared unsafe for consumption by the food analysts as it contained more than permissible amount of tartrazine colour, which is used to give a yellow hue to food products. The municipal court, on June 30, sentenced one month’s imprisonment to the owner Hiralal Rochvani and also imposed a fine of Rs 2,500 for selling unsafe food and operating a business without proper license. In another case, more than permissible iodine was found in the refined iodised salt sold by Taj Salt Suppliers.

---||Agra||Despite being in minority in Mainpuri, Firozabad and Mathura, BJP succeeds in winning top posts in zila panchayat chief polls||Agra: Despite being in minority in district panchayat elections in Mainpuri, Firozabad and Mathura, the BJP has managed to get its nominees elected as district council presidents in these three districts. The party has, in fact, managed to have 67 of its nominees elected across the state and this being touted by party leaders as a “prelude” to the victory in the 2022 assembly polls. Even in the Samajwadi Party bastion of Mainpuri and Firozabad, the BJP managed victory of its candidates— Archana Bhadauria and Harshita Singh. The BJP had won only eight of the 30 seats in Manipuri and SP had emerged as the single largest party with 13 seats. Similarly, in Firozabad, the ruling BJP had won only five of the 33 seats backed by the party, SP bagged a near majority with 16 seats. However, the BJP ‘stole’ the show by getting its candidates elected as district Panchayat chief. In Mathura, too, the BJP turned the tables on its opponents despite winning eight of the 33 seats. The BSP has a maximum of 13 seats. In Aligarh, BJP had won nine of the 47 seats. However, it was still the single largest party here as 21 independents had won elections in the district panchayat polls here. The SP, BSP and RLD had managed to get only 7, 5 and 5 seats respectively. BJP’s Kishan Singh elected district council chief from Mathura after getting 22 votes against his opponent from SP-RLD Rajendra Sikarvar who got 11 votes. In Aligarh, BJP’s Vijay Singh won with 30 votes from SP’s Archana Yadav as they received 38 and 8 votes respectively. On the victory of Vijay Singh, his relative and MP Rajveer Singh Raju said that this was expected and the opposition is making all sorts of allegations, as they have lost. Former Member of Parliament from Mainpuri Tej Pratap Yadav alleged that the state government used its machinery to manage the elections. “Our candidates were unnecessarily harassed and booked under various sections of IPC,” he said, adding that the administration openly helped the ruling party in this “fraud” and “overturning” people’s mandate. He alleged that the DM worked as a BJP agent. Echoing similar views, former Firozabad MP Akshay Yadav said, “District administration and police are working for the ruling party. They are pressuring our district panchayat members to cast votes in favour of a BJP-backed candidate.” State cabinet minister Ram Naresh Agnihotri said that the election in Mainpuri was very challenging but the party’s candidate registered victory for the first time in history. On being asked about allegations levelled against BJP, he said that the opposition always cries foul out of their frustration but the elections conducted by the administration were very “fair and transparent”. Former district panchayat chief from Mathura, Anoop Chaudhary, said BJP is taking advantage of being in the government. He said, “The election process should be changed for transparency.” SP-RLD candidate from Mathura, Rajendra Sikarvar, alleged that district authorities are helping the ruling party for the victory of its candidate. His supporters shouted slogans against the administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/despite-being-in-minority-in-mainpuri-firozabad-and-mathura-bjp-succeeds-in-winning-top-posts-in-zila-panchayat-chief-polls/articleshow/84100471.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||In primary, Delhi does not have enough teachers||NEW DELHI: Delhi has the second poorest pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) at 32.7 at the primary school level. Only Bihar is worse than Delhi in this respect, according to the government of India's Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) report for 2019-20. The report claims that while Delhi has 55,486 primary school teachers, this is not adequate for the city’s 18,11,723 primary class students enrolled in all the schools, government and private. Experts pointed out that skew in the PTR was due to the laxity in recruiting teachers over the past many years. The report, released by Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, provides data and information on schools across India. These relate to the number of schools, teachers, students and enrolment ratios, as well as infrastructure and facilities in schools. While Delhi fares well in most other aspects, it has a poor record when it comes to PTR. Delhi has a PTR of 32.7 for primary schools (Classes I to V), which means that there is just one teacher for every 32.7 students across schools, irrespective of whether the institutions are government or privately run or receive government aid. Delhi also does not do well with a ratio of 29.3 for upper primary (classes VI-VIII), 27.6 for secondary (classes IX-X) and 17.9 for higher secondary (classes XI-XII). According to the UDISE+ data, Delhi has 55,486 teachers for primary classes in which 18,11,723 students study. This PTR of 32.7 is the lowest but for Bihar, where the PTR is 55.4, or one teacher per 55.4 students. Sikkim is the best in this regard with a PTR of 6.7 for primary schools. Explaining the situation in Delhi government schools, Ajay Veer Yadav, general secretary of Government School Teachers’ Association, said, “The reason for this number is the guest teacher culture in government schools. The government has preferred to hire guest teachers rather than recruit permanent teachers.” This situation about government schools was reiterated by advocate Ashok Aggarwal, president, All-India Parents’ Association. “The persistence of guest teachers and the absence of proper recruitment are two reasons why the student-teacher statistic is so bad,” maintained Aggarwal. Despite repeated attempts, there was no response from representatives of Delhi government on this matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-primary-delhi-does-not-have-enough-teachers/articleshow/84102266.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Pune||100 Days of Bhakti: An ode to Sant Tukaram & noted women saints||PUNE: Chandrakant Redican, son of an Irish-Canadian father and a Dalit mother from Maharashtra, grew up in Jejuri and watched the Wari each year on its journey to Pandharpur. His parents exposed him to the abhangas (devotional poetries sung in praise of god Vitthal) of Tukaram and others, which planted the seed for his current project on social media. “While growing up in Jejuri, I saw the Wari pass by every year during the holy month. I used to volunteer to hand our food to them, and that was also the time when my father exposed my sister and me to the works of Sant Tukaram and Dnyaneshwar, and others, including the translations by Dilip Chitre,” Redican said, speaking about his current project — 100 Days of Bhakti. He added that the project largely served as a “coping mechanism” for him to get through the isolation. “I wanted to find out the roots of slam poetry. Abhangas are presented these days in semi-classical presentations, but these saints went from village to village and presented them in a very rudimentary kirtan format. I consider abhangas to be performance poetry, that challenged social norms,” he said. Starting on April 12, which was timed to be 100 days before the Wari reaches Pandharpur, Redican has been translating the abhangas of Sant Tukaram from Marathi to English, and posting them on his social media platforms. Redican said that his objective is to portray him in totality, with his flaws and imperfections. From the 50th day of the project, he has been translating the works of women saints of the medieval Bhakti movement, including Soyarabai, Kanhopatra, Muktabai, among others. His sister, Priyam, also translated one of the most acclaimed works in his series yet, a poem about menstruation by Soyarabai, who was a disciple of her husband Chokhamela.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/100-days-of-bhakti-an-ode-to-sant-tukaram-noted-women-saints/articleshow/84102284.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Mumbai||HC stays rejection of health policy of bipolar person||Mumbai: Bombay high court recently granted interim relief to a person suffering from bipolar disorder by staying rejection of his health policy by an insurer. The HC said, “If no suitable interim relief is granted in favour… he is likely to suffer grave prejudice, since he will be denied a health insurance cover altogether.’’ The HC posting the petition, challenging the insurance company’s rejection order, for further hearing on July 28 directed continuance of his existing policy for a suitable period. A petition was filed to challenge rejection of the petitioner’s policy proposal by an insurance company on the grounds that he suffers from bipolar disorder type II. The petition said under Section 21(4) of the Mental Healthcare Act, every insurer is bound to provide for medical insurance for treatment of mental illness on the same lines as a physical illness. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) had in August 2018 directing compliance of the provision by all insurers. The petition said IRDA had not intervened when the grievance was made, despite being empowered to act. An HC bench of Justices S C Gupte and M S Karnik, in its June 24 interim order, found prima facie merit in the petitioner’s grievance, and admitted his petition. IRDA(health Insurance) Regulations, 2016, permit not only porting of an existing policy but also an ad hoc extension of a policy, if so requested by a policy-holder, for at least a month on a pro rata premium. The HC passed its interim order to enable continuance of his existing policy after citing a recent Delhi HC judgment, which while considering an issue of entitlement of a person to get health insurance had observed that the crux of the provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act, and particularly Section 21(4) and a circular issued by IRDA, was that “mental illnesses cannot be treated differently from physical illnesses”. Insurance policies cannot discriminate between these two types of illnesses; every insurance firm has to comply with provisions of law and the IRDA circular, the HC noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-stays-rejection-of-health-policy-of-bipolar-person/articleshow/84107010.cms||---

And they even have a two-year-old child. After separation, the wife fell in love with her father-in-law and legally married him when she turned 18, police said. The RTI was filed by the son to get information about his father who had left the house and was "living elsewhere". The incident was reported from the Bisauli area of the district.The son was "married" to the woman in 2016. Both were "minors". They got separated due to a domestic dispute six months later. However, he tried to reconcile and bring back his wife. She refused and instead sought divorce. The man was alcoholic, police said.After the rude shock of his father marrying his wife, the young man lodged a complaint at Bisauli police station and both the parties were called for a meeting on Saturday.“The complaint is under investigation and police are taking action as per the law,” Vinay Chauhan, the circle officer, told TOI.According to police, they were aggressive and tried to attack each other at the meeting. Efforts for mediation will continue, the police said.Sub-inspector (SI) Rajendra Prasad told TOI, “The son filed an RTI at District Panchayati Raj Office to collect information about his father and found the latter had married his own estranged wife. He filed the RTI after his father had stopped giving him money and was living separately in Sambhal.”The girl claimed that she is very happy and doesn’t want to go back to her first "husband", Prasad said."We didn’t find any documents related to her first marriage. She was also a minor then. So, a case cannot be registered, as of now. Both the parties will receive notice for further sessions,” the SI added."This is a case of matrimonial discord."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-man-via-rti-finds-estranged-wife-married-to-his-own-father/articleshow/84098569.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nashik||Water level in Gangapur dam complex falls marginally||Nashik: The lack of rain in Nashik district has caused the water level in the dams across the district — except in the Igatpuri taluka — to fall. The water level in Gangapur dam complex, that provides drinking water to Nashik city, has dropped marginally from 2,735 million cubic feet (mcft) recorded on June 15, which is 30% of the capacity of the three dams, to 2575 mcft (26%) on July 2, as per the district administration records. “There is no significant rain across the district so far. This is resulting in the drop of the water level in Gangpur dam, though marginally,” said resident deputy collector Bhagwat Doifode. The average water level across the dams in the district almost remained stable, but the ones in the Gangapur Dam Complex have receded marginally and those in Darna tiver have increased. “There is a marginal drop in water level of Gangapur Dam complex, given that the Trimbakeshwar region is yet to receive significant rain. While the water level in Darna river has improved because of good rain in Igatpuri taluka,” said the sources from the district administration. The water levels in Darna Dam Complex rose sharply from 5135 mcft on June 15 to 6859 mcft. The water stored in the complex is largely for Aurangabad, Ahmednagar and some parts of Nashik district. The dams providing water to the areas in Nashik are yet to get water due to lack of rain. The rain in Surgana and around have contributed in maintaining the dam water level of Girna and other dams in , but that is not enough when there is no rain. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said there is no sign of good rain for at least a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/water-level-in-gangapur-dam-complex-falls-marginally/articleshow/84098568.cms||Abhilash Botekar

While Punjab has advised industrial consumers to take forced shut down for a few days, unannounced rotational cuts, load shedding and breakdowns have forced the consumers to sweat it out in Haryana. This is despite the fact that Haryana power utilities — Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) and Uttari Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) — claimed to have supplied 11,720 MW (over 2,500 lakh units) on Thursday. The authorities claimed to have made sufficient augmentation, but blamed undeclared loads and delayed rains as reasons for breakdowns or load shedding. “We don’t know what to say and whom to complain. There is nothing on record here. Industries with export orders have back-up arrangements which costs somewhere around Rs 15 to 20 per unit to meet commitments. While conditions in residential areas is even worst. People here are totally at the mercy of god as well as discom,” said Rupesh Bansal, a representative of industries from Faridabad. Chaudhary Bhupender, president of Rai Industrial of Sonipat, a hotspot where farmers too are sitting on an agitation, said, “It seems that the government has totally abandoned us or might be penalizing us for being honest taxpayers and bill payers. At a time when we are trying to cope with aggravated costs of production due to blocked roads by agitating farmers, rotational cuts in industries and unannounced cuts in the name of maintenance have hit us hard. The condition is even worse in the outer Sonipat area where multi-storey buildings have come up. These buildings are totally dependent on power back-ups which too work for certain period.” Similar were complaints from Jhajjar districts where Bahadurgarh industrial area was among the worst hit. It has been alleged that two particular pockets have not electricity supply for about six months. While domestic supply too has been taken a hit. P K Das, ACS power, claimed that there are sufficient supplies and backup arrangements as well. He, however, largely blamed undeclared loads and excess heating up of cables or overloaded transformers as reasons for breakdowns. “After supplying 11,720 MW on Thursday, which is Haryana’s record since inception of the state, I have an arrangement of 6,000 more Watts. But the system must be able take the load. I can say the breakdowns are largely caused due to overloaded cables due to undeclared loads. Load shedding, if any, is implemented just to prevent major damages. Else, we have sufficient supply hence there is no reason for power cuts.” Electricity connections Total electricity connections | 70,54,796 Domestic | 55,56,231 Non-domestic | 7,07,831 Agriculture | 6, 49,991 Industrial | 1,12,312 Peak Supply July 1, 2021 | 11,720 MW July 3, 2020 | 10,894 MW July 2, 2019 | 11,001 MW||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-pangs-haryana-too-feels-the-heat/articleshow/84106276.cms||Manvir Saini

The police nabbed Sachin Gajanan Rathod (22) and Sagar Ramrao Matre (23) from Dwarha in Yavatmal following a tip-off, which stated that they were looking for customers. A case under the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act has been registered against them with the Chakan police. A team of forest officials confirmed the authenticity of the horns after inspection. “The suspects installed barbed wires with electrical current at their agricultural land in Yavatmal district. Blackbucks would get entangled in these wires and die of electrical shock. They would then removed their horns with an intention to sell them in Pune,” the police said. The suspects currently reside in Shikrapur and work as helpers in a private firm on Pune-Ahmednagar highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-held-with-10-blackbuck-horns/articleshow/84102393.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Celebrating the gestures of humanity amid second wave||Fresh in the heat of lockdown 1.0 in March 2020, a refrigerator had materialised in the lobby of an upscale Versova building. Inside it, every day, residents would place home-cooked dishes that the not-so-privileged security guards could help themselves to when they felt peckish on duty. Such unprecedented gestures of humanity resurfaced in many corners of the city this year in the wake of the second wave when the city gasped for oxygen and hospitals ran out of beds. From setting up Covid care centres or quarantine spaces to creating oxygen cylinder or concentrator banks, from helping arrange for medicines to providing ambulances and groceries at the doorstep, many residents’ welfare associations and local colonies went way beyond their brief to help during the time of crisis. Given that such human endeavours run the risk of being overlooked if not forgotten, we at TOI want to insure these gestures against short-term public memory by recognizing and celebrating them. Which is exactly why we bring you #MySocietyPride. The premise of this initiative is simple. Tell us about the welfare measures that your society has implemented during the lockdown and we will feature the best ones in the Times of India. Scan the QR code or visit www.toi.in/mysocietypride to share the details. And while we would all be thrilled to welcome back the Mumbai we knew—a maximum city chugging on the adrenaline of enterprise, teeming with opportunities and forever steeped in the scents of street food—it looks like we will have to treat the journey ahead as a marathon and not a sprint. Meanwhile, the city’s societies can draw on the lessons learnt from the past year, so that the new normal can be just as joyous and promising as the old one. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-celebrating-the-gestures-of-humanity-amid-second-wave/articleshow/84106499.cms||---
---||Surat||Man caught with 17 pre-activated SIM cards||Surat: A team of special operation group (SOG) arrested a photographer for allegedly possessing 17 pre-activated SIM cards which he was trying to find customers under Udhna Kharwarnagar flyover bridge on Friday. Accused Ashish Metliwala told the police that he had purchased the SIM cards from an unknown person whom he had contacted over Telegram. He had bought the SIM cards for Rs 3,500. Faced with financial crisis after he did not get any photography work for the past few months, Matliwala planned to sell these cards to earn some money, police said. The SOG team got specific information about Matliwala’s movement and after he could not give satisfactory explanation or documents on how these cards came into his possessing, cops arrested him. An offence has been registered in Udhna police station. Preliminary police investigation revealed that Matliwala was a member of Telegram app’s Indian OTP Group. “One person dropped a message in the group offering pre-activated mobile phone SIM cards. Matliwala contacted the person over Telegram and purchased the cards for Rs 3,500,” said a police officer. The seller received payment through a mobile wallet and sent the pre-activated cards through a courier. The person on the other end told Matliwala that he is from Odisha, though police are yet to confirm his location. “Both the accused talked over Telegram app and shared details. The card seller got the SIM cards of Vodafone-Idea activated using documents of other people,” said the police. Matliwala was searching for buyers as he was jobless for the past few months and needed to earn some money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/man-caught-with-17-pre-activated-sim-cards/articleshow/84100580.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Bail plea of man accused of posting girl’s pics rejected||Prayagraj: While dismissing the bail application of a man who allegedly posted obscene photographs of a woman on social media and threatened her to accept a relationship with him, the Allahabad High Court termed the alleged crime as an ‘anti-social activity and a menace to the society’. While dismissing the bail plea of one Manav of Prayagraj on July 1, Justice JJ Munir observed, “There is also some kind of a CD, where the applicant is shown threatening the prosecutrix with dire consequences. There, by his words, he has dared the law of not being in a position to save the prosecutrix unless she accepts his proposal. This kind of conduct and the offence involved almost amounts to an anti-social activity and a menace to society.” According to the applicant, he and the girl were in a long relationship and after she went away to a foreign country for her education, she disowned the relationship. He submitted that the present case was a move on the part of the prosecutrix and her family to put a curtain on the past relationship between the parties. He further submitted that for the present, the applicant has in no way threatened her or posted any offensive or intimate photographs of her on the internet or Facebook. The court had earlier summoned the evidence collected by the investigating officer and after going through it, the court observed, “Prima facie, the allegations appear to have force because materials in the case diary show that obscene photographs of the applicant and the prosecutrix together have been posted on Facebook.” “A perusal of the entire material in the case diary indeed shows that though the parties were into a relationship at a certain point of time, the prosecutrix has withdrawn from it. But, the applicant has pursued her beyond the permissible limits of decency and into the forbidden territory of crime. He has prima facie ravished her and utilizing the obscene photographs that he has, he has posted them on Facebook,” observed the court while dismissing the bail plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bail-plea-of-man-accused-of-posting-girls-pics-rejected/articleshow/84106308.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Study says liver damage likely due to autoimmune response to giloy||MUMBAI: City doctors found at least six patients with a history of taking a concoction of the herb giloy who had suffered severe liver damage between September and December 2020. “We, for the first time, found severe liver injury, proven using biopsy, related to the herb tinospora cordifolia,” said hepatologist Dr Aabha Nagral, lead author of a study published in Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, an international peer-reviewed journal published by the Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver. Liver transplant surgeon Dr A S Soin, who wasn’t connected to the study, said he too had seen five giloy-related liver damage cases in his practice that spans Delhi to Mumbai. One of his patients, too, died. “Many took to giloy during the pandemic to boost their immunity and as an antioxidant. Unfortunately, many suffered liver toxicity due to it,” he said. Except for the deaths, the other patients made full recovery a couple of months after stopping the herb. Giloy is among the several alternative medicines recommended by the Ayush ministry as an immune booster against the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2. However, the patients included in the Mumbai study started consuming it without medical advice. Their liver biopsies revealed the liver damage was possibly due to an “autoimmune” response. Normally, the body’s immune system attacks foreign elements such as a virus and this is called an immune response. However, in people with certain disorders, the immune response attacks the body’s own healthy cells and tissues as well, called an auto-immune response. While giloy, said Dr Nagral, has immune-boosting properties, if taken in excess or in a “subset of patients” with auto-immune disorders, it triggers an auto-immune response. “In these six patients, giloy seems to have triggered an auto-immune response against the liver cells, causing severe life-threatening liver injury,” she said. A 41-year-old Chembur resident was the first patient with giloy-related “liver injury” identified in Jaslok Hospital. “After one of my colleagues got Covid-19, some of us started taking a brew of giloy every morning,” he told TOI. He found a giloy plant in the neighbourhood and took it for 45 days before developing jaundice. The other patients included a 38-year-old thalassemia minor patient who consumed a brew made out of three to four twigs of giloy in 15 ml of water every day for six months. Other patients had hypothyroidism. Dr Soin said patients who already have baseline liver damage due to diabetes or alcohol are more susceptible. “On biopsy, these patients exhibit features of DILI (drug-induced liver injury) and autoimmune hepatitis. Those with pre-existing liver damage may go into advanced liver failure,” he added. There is a need for regulatory authorities to put out a warning on giloy tablets and syrups about possible liver injury, said the doctors. “This herb grows in the backyards of people’s homes and is freely available and manufactured by pharma companies,” Dr Nagral said. “I am not an Ayush expert. There are many serious Ayush researchers doing good work, but the impression that Ayush drugs are harmless in terms of side-effects may not be correct,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-study-says-liver-damage-likely-due-to-autoimmune-response-to-giloy/articleshow/84104472.cms||Malathy Iyer

These two promises remain unfulfilled till date,” said Aamer Javeed. Neither the promise of making a Dalit as the chief minister nor distribution of three acres agriculture land to landless Dalit families or the construction of two mosques and a temple in the old Secretariat complex have been implemented so far. The Congress leader sought to know from CM KCR and the ruling TRS the reasons for the delay in taking the prestigious Metro Rail project to Hyderabad’s old city. “The infrastructure development in the old city has come to an almost standstill. Even the promise of giving judicial powers to the Telangana State Wakf Board remains unfulfilled till date,” Aamer Javeed said. He also charged the TRS government of having turned a blind eye to Eatala Rajender’s controversial land dealings until CM KCR decided to oust him. “Dalits, Tribals, Muslims, backward classes and weaker sections feel betrayed in the new state of Telangana,” Aamer Javeed said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fulfil-promises-made-to-dalits-minorities/articleshow/84102390.cms||---

The initiative was taken by superintendent of police, Shailesh Balkawade.  Balkawade said, “When a cyber fraud takes place, people get confused about where to register the case. To bring ease in registering cybercrime with the police station, to avoid bank accounts of the complainants being null and to coordinate between the complainant and local police station in updating technical issues, we have started a separate helpline number only for cybercrime complaints. Citizens are advised to contact on the above number immediately in case of any cybercrime.” .

Till now, Jitsi Meet web app was used for this purpose, which will be replaced gradually. Initially, it will be for five courts only but from the next week onwards, more courts would be added in the new system. Gradually, within one month all courts would be included within it, according to a release issued by HC registrar protocol Ashish Kumar Srivastava. There would be no video conferencing link henceforth for all those courts, which are connected with this new mode of virtual hearing, the notification added. One will have to feed one’s case number, right slash and name in the new web app. When your case comes, the bench secretary will connect you directly and you will be brought before the court. During the waiting period you can watch the court proceedings but you will not be able to participate. You will also not know as to how many advocates/people are watching. But you will certainly know as to whether your opposite counsel is present or not. (Of course you can chat with him privately). During the waiting period your device would remain automatically muted. But when you are brought before the court, you have to ‘unmute’ your device manually. The Webex would filter all noises like ‘kitni seety baji’, dog bark, phone ringing, etc. The detailed instructions would be available on the High Court website on Saturday evening. One can always give feedback to the court committee, headed by Justice SP Kesarwani directly about the working or problems or glitches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-introduces-webex-for-virtual-hearing-of-cases/articleshow/84106456.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The children — residents of Bhojpur, Pipalsaana, Thakurdwara areas, etc — urged the administration to take cognisance of the matter and ensure an uninterrupted power supply. Pictures of children holding placards with messages have gone viral on social media on Saturday. A placard held by a girl reads, “The electricity gets interrupted around 17 times in one hour in Pipalsana area of Moradabad.” A boy from the same area showed the message: “The power department should cooperate with its consumers when they are confined to their homes in the time of the pandemic. The supply is cut at least five times in 10 minutes.” Mohammed Ghazi from Bhojpur of Moradabad had written, “DM uncle, with no electricity during the night, I find it difficult to sleep. I’m sick.” Despite these pictures doing rounds on social media platforms and people tagging officials concerned, the district administration is yet to take cognisance of the matter. When contacted, PVVNL SDO, Bhojpur in Moradabad, Rahul Yadav told TOI, “The issue of power outages in these areas is in our notice. The power supply in these localities is interrupted by trees even after a brief spell of rain. A 132 kv power substation has been proposed in Jahangirpur area. The construction work will be taken up soon. Once completed, the sub-station will supply electricity to Bhojpur, Pipalsana, Jahangirpur, Bilari, among other areas. Chopping or pruning of trees is just a short-term solution. And thus, we want to fix the issue permanently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/holding-placards-kids-complain-to-admin-about-frequent-outages-in-rural-areas-in-moradabad/articleshow/84098669.cms||Maria Khan

It carried out inquiry with the college administration on Friday. The committee’s member-secretary and district social welfare officer (DSWO) A Thamim Munisha said the committee comprising six officers will be probing the complaint given by five girl students of MA Tamil Literature programme against the associate professor who was heading the department. These students were asked to appear before the committee on Saturday evening. The complaint was that the professor was using double entendre to explain the subjects during their offline classes in February. In the wake of the complaints, the college carried out a probe through a seven-member internal complaints committee (ICC) and placed the associate professor under suspension on June 30 after finding prima facie evidence against him. “Inquiry with the principal of the college is over. The committee has collected the copy of the complaint submitted by the girls. Suspension will not be a punishment for such offences. If the allegation is proved, legal action will be initiated against the associate professor,” said the DSWO. Even though the issue was brewing for the past one week, the issue was officially not communicated to the DSWO by the ICC. “ICC should have brought the issue to our notice but it did not happen. So, we have taken up the investigation suo motu for the inquiry,” Munisha told TOI. The fact finding committee comprised personal assistant (general) to the collector as chairperson on his behalf, DSWO as member-secretary, an officer from integrated child development scheme (ICDS) and members from NGOs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/probe-begins-into-alleged-sexual-harassment-by-prof/articleshow/84102421.cms||Gokul Rajendran

The hospital where she was taken to declared she had been brought dead. The giirl had approached police in February this year but the cops had allegedly refused to lodge an FIR under rape charges. They haven't made any arrest in the case in the past six months. "This forced my daughter to end her life due to delayed justice," her mother told TOI on Saturday. Senior superintendent of police Prabhakar Chaudhary said, “The girl had filed a complaint earlier in this matter, but the family alleged that proper action was not taken by the investigating officer (IO), who is an SSI-rank policeman. I have ordered his suspension. The matter is being reinvestigated and an FIR against the man under relevant sections has been filed.” According to police, the girl reached the police station and asked cops to arrest the accused. Before the policemen on duty could understand the situation, she started shouting out of pain, leaving everyone in the police station in a state of shock. The girl collapsed before she could be taken to hospital. The doctors later declared her dead on arrival. The girl’s mother said that her husband died a few years ago and since then she was working to run the family. She has five other daughters, three of whom are married. “One of our neighbours barged inside my house on a February afternoon and physically molested my daughter who was just 16 at that time. When she threatened to tell others about him, the man initially pacified her by promising marriage but later refused to do so. Betrayed and raped on multiple occasions, my daughter informed me about it and we reached the police station to lodge an FIR. The cops filed the FIR only under sections of eve-teasing and molestation but refused to include sections of rape, even when we got the medical done,” her mother told TOI.

The bus was subsequently taken to the state-run hospital at Ajanta where the baby’s umbilical cord was cut. The incident came to light on Saturday after Maya Shelke, a teacher who was travelling on the same bus, shared an emotional post on social media. Bus conductor Vithhal Pardeshi said the pregnant woman, her husband and mother-in-law — who hail from the Soygaon taluka — had boarded the bus at Sillod. “We left the Sillod bus stand. Soon, the woman went into labour. We could not increase the speed of the bus due to the ongoing road works. Before we could even reach to nearby taluka place, the woman had delivered the baby on the bus seat with help of female co-passengers,” he said. Pardeshi said the umbilical cord could not be cut on the bus. As the result, the new mother was not able to hold the baby. “The crying newborn was held by her grandmother. Meanwhile, other passengers made futile attempts to arrange for an ambulance. The baby kept crying for around 30 minutes before the bus could reach the hospital,” he said. The MSRTC depot at Shrirampur, in neighbouring Ahmednagar district, felicitated Pardeshi and bus driver Bharat Kolape for offering help to the pregnant woman. “It is a unique incident to have a baby being born on a moving bus. The event has moved all of us,” depot manager Rakesh Shivade said. The new mother could not be reached for her comments as her mobile phone was out of reach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/woman-delivers-baby-on-msrtc-bus-near-sillod/articleshow/84098651.cms||Prasad Joshi

There will be at least 10,000 flats in these 500 housing projects. Since there is a significant demand for housing in Nashik, we are sure the prospective home buyers will book these flats,” added Mahajan.According to him, all these projects will be launched in a phased manner beginning around Ganeshotsav and Diwali this year.“Like other sectors, the real estate sector in Nashik had been severely affected by the pandemic that broke out early last year. No builder could launch new projects in 2020 due to various constraints. However, with the administration easing restrictions last month, activities in the real estate sector have started picking up as customer inquiries and site visits have increased. Moreover, customers have also started booking flats,” said Mahajan.The real estate sector had some good news in June with over 300 flats, worth over Rs 105 crore, being sold in that month alone.According to Umesh Wankhede, the chairperson of the real estate committee of the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MACCIA), “With demand for homes gradually picking up, we are sure the realty sector will register significant growth in the near future.”“The site visits have increased over the past month. People are directly visiting the sites and the conversion of inquiries into business will start increasing during the festive season,” said Wankhede.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/over-500-residential-projects-to-start-in-nashik-city-during-festive-season/articleshow/84098634.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Chandigarh||Sukhbir alleges 200ft-deep mining excavations in Mukerian villages||Mukerian: Visiting mining sites in villages of Mukerian subdivision near Hajipur, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday asked chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and mining minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria to disclose rules which permitted excavations up to 200 feet to extract sand. He said land along several villages in this constituency had been ravaged by the sand mafia in active connivance with the district police and mining department. He said even though more than 10 villages had been ravaged by the mining mafia, the government was least concerned. “Even today, local police facilitated illegal miners by informing them about the visit in advance, so they could flee from the spot. The mafia is so brazen they dug trenches to ensure we could not reach the spot where illegal mining was being done. They even tried to prevent out exit from the area by digging a trench on a kutcha road,” he said, adding he walked around Dhamian, Sandhwal and Bringali villages to visit the mining sites. “Such tactics cannot stop SAD from exposing the mining mafia whose tentacles reach up to the chief minister as well as the All Indian Congress Committee (AICC),” he said. The SAD president said it was shocking that even though rules permitted excavation till 10 feet, the sand mafia had done excavations till 200 feet which had even resulted in the formation of a lake in the area with ground water seeping up. Badal said villagers who gathered at the spot told him that a Congress MLA’s son was carrying out illegal mining with the active connivance of another MLA, local police and mining departments. In a statement issued later in the evening, SAD claimed that Guru Nanak Welfare Society president Kirpal Singh Gera said the society had been complaining against the mafia for long, but the local police and civil administration did not take action. “Others on the spot disclosed that their land had been destroyed due to illegal mining and that even kutcha roads which helped in movement from one village to another had been obliterated. One complainant, Surinder Kaur, disclosed that her 25 acres had been excavated illegally by the mafia,” the SAD added. “Local truckers as well as those who operate in neighbouring Himachal Pradesh also reached the spot and complained that the mafia was charging ‘goonda tax’ from them. Operators from Himachal said despite the fact that this issue had been flagged by the Himachal Pradesh chief minister, no action had been taken on it and they continued to be charged goonda tax of Rs 10,000 per truck to get sand from Himachal into Punjab,” the party added. He said when he had exposed illegal mining at Beas two days ago, Punjab secretary (mining) Sarvjit Singh justified the activity. “I want to know if the secretary and the mining department will justify excavations of 200 feet.” Stating that the Congress government had presided over a loot of more than Rs 1,000 crore in illegal sand mining alone, Badal said, “Once a SAD-led government is formed in the state, we will recover this amount and register cases against the guilty.” Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia and youth leader Sarabjot Singh Sabi also accompanied Badal on this occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sukhbir-alleges-200ft-deep-mining-excavations-in-mukerian-villages/articleshow/84106410.cms||---

He said the TRS is a ‘secret ally’ of the BJP. “It is important for the minorities to come back to Congress fold with the ultimate aim of defeating the communal forces at the national level,” Revanth said while addressing a meeting of leaders from the minority communities organised by former minister Md Ali Shabbir at his residence here. He said the BJP had been polarising the elections by accusing Congress of Muslim appeasement. “The Muslim community has been supporting regional parties like TRS which are ultimately supporting the BJP at the national level. This trend has caused immense damage to the secular fabric of India. The Congress has never appeased any community and only ensured social justice,” he asserted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-is-bjps-ally-revanth/articleshow/84102468.cms||---
---||Goa||Mobile towers in Goa strictly monitored, radiation within norms: Telecom dept||PANAJI: Misinformation about radiation from mobile towers is “alarming” in Goa, the department of telecommunications (DoT) said on Saturday. It said that several studies have shown that mobile tower electromagnetic frequency (EMF) radiation has no adverse impact on people’s health. Officials from the Goa unit of DoT said that all mobile towers and their EMF radiation are being strictly monitored and that all the EMF from cellular towers in Goa are within Indian EMF norms. “Scientific research is testimonial to the fact that there are no health impacts of these radiations on human health,” Union health ministry advisor T K Joshi said. Joshi said that the EMF project of World Health Organisation (WHO), after two decades of extensive research has corroborated that there is no evidence to support the claim that exposure to low-level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health. The WHO has studied over 25,000 articles and reached the conclusion that there is no correlation between mobile tower EMF emissions and its hazardous impact on human health, Joshi said. Joshi was speaking on cellular mobile towers at an awareness workshop, which was organised the DoT’s Goa unit as part of its public advocacy programme to dispel myths around EMF radiation. DoT advisor Ashok Kumar Mittal said that mobile towers are vital for smooth connectivity not just in Goa but across the world. “Rising misinformation related to health concerns posed by mobile towers is alarming,” he said. The DoT has tested all the mobile towers in Goa for EMF radiation and all the towers have been found compliant with Indian EMF norms, said the DoT officials. “Citizens need not worry about the adverse effect of mobile tower EMF radiation as they are being strictly monitored and evidence from credible sources have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of any impending health hazards emanating from EMF radiations,” DoT Goa deputy director general S Sudhakar said. DoT officials said that mobile services and wireless broadband access are necessary not only for rapid growth and modernisation of various sectors of the economy, but also for success of key government initiatives related to education, health, finance, direct benefit transfer, e-KYC and other e-governance services. Telecom towers are critical infrastructure for providing mobile connectivity in all areas, including residential areas, Mittal said. In India, EMF radiation norms are 10 times stricter than the limits prescribed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and recommended by the WHO, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mobile-towers-in-goa-strictly-monitored-radiation-within-norms-telecom-dept/articleshow/84104587.cms||---

Apart from failing to enforce the mandatory facemask rule, access to sanitisers and social distancing inside cramped commercial establishments remain a matter of concern.Since June third week, fresh Covid-19 infections in Trichy city plunged to less than 100 per day. Taking advantage of the declining cases and the lockdown relaxations people are spotted commuting in large numbers unnecessarily. Traffic police personnel guarding Singarathope, Gandhi market, West Boulevard Road and Thillai Nagar said that families with children on two-wheelers, commute without masks. “We find parents bringing their children to buy vegetables in the market,” a constable said. Mobile phone service centres, pharmacies and bakeries were identified as establishments that record heavy crowding. Many shops are also operating with air-conditioners.“People on two-wheelers are not wearing masks. Officials aren’t penalising the violators especially at the crowded Cauvery bridge and Anna Nagar link road,” S Divahar, a resident of Melachinthamani said. With more relaxations to come into force, doctors involved in Covid-19 duty expressed their concern. Between June 22 and 30, fresh infections witnessed a marginal surge, and doctors attributed the trend to unlocking measures. They said that wearing masks and social distancing enforcement should be the priority. “We are penalising the offenders but the intensity of the drive is yet to be enhanced. Hotspots will be focussed to ensure the SOP adherence,” a source with the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/poor-enforcement-of-covid-19-sops-in-trichy-city-rings-alarm-bells/articleshow/84102463.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Call to protect hero stone near Thuraiyur in honour of bull||Trichy: Archaeology enthusiasts in Trichy have raised voice for protecting a rare hero stone (nadukal) erected for a bull near Thuraiyur and urged the authorities to redevelop the stone’s vicinity as a protected archaeological monument. Since a road widening project is underway close to the hero stone, local people expressed their concern that the centuries-old object will face destruction.Archaeologists said that usually a hero stone called ‘nadukal’ in Tamil was erected for men who died a hero’s death in protecting the village or people after displaying bravery. There were hero stones at many places to commemorate the honourable deaths of hunting dogs and cocks involved in cockfights. But, the hero stone in Nagalapuram was a rare one as it was erected for a bull. The hero stone identified near Perumal hills portrays a bull, possibly a bull used in jallikattu. The site below the stone is considered to have the skeletal remains of the bull as it was a practice to install a stone at the burial site. The hero stone recorded by archaeologists in textbooks has the insignia of sun and moon, with a man holding the bull. There is a separate stone that shows a man worshipping the bull. Meanwhile, as a road-widening project between Thuraiyur and Perambalur is underway near Nagalapuram, local people expressed their concern over the possible relocation of the hero stone. “The stone should be protected as it is a rare object. It shows how the ancient Tamils revered domesticated animals,” Ramesh Karupiah, an archaeology enthusiast, said. The hero stone is located on a government poromboke land and the villagers said that rainwater flowing from the road may damage the stone. There are also chances of it getting vandalized. People have approached archaeology minister Thangam Thennarasu to protect the monument. “Officials from the ASI have inspected the monument. We will fence the site and install an information board. The road developers have assured us that the hero stone will not be disturbed,” a revenue official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/call-to-protect-hero-stone-near-thuraiyur-in-honour-of-bull/articleshow/84102471.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Chandigarh||Punjab minister again rejects Sukhbir Singh Sarkaria’s claims of illegal mining||CHANDIGARH: Punjab mining minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria on Saturday once again rejected the claims of illegal mining operations in Hoshiarpur district made by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal. Sarkaria said it was nothing but Sukhbir’s desperate attempts to gain lost political ground in the state, which would never happen. The cabinet minister claimed the mining sites visited by Sukhbir in Hoshiarpur district on Saturday were auctioned by the SAD-BJP government and not the Congress. There were several attempts by some people to continue illegal mining but the mining department acted swiftly and imposed heavy penalties, Sarkaria said. When Sukhbir reached the mining sites, there was no machinery as well as illegal mining as claimed by the Akalis, minister said, adding the entire Punjab knew that the word ‘sand mafia’ originated in the Akali government. The Hoshiarpur mining officer said on Saturday that the mining quarries shown by Sukhbir were operational before 2016 and the mining department had taken action against these sites. He said that these sites were auctioned by the Punjab government between 2008 and 2011. “The department had served the recovery notices of Rs 14 lakh in Jiwanwal village, Rs 40 lakh in Bariana, Rs 2 lakh in Dhamian and Rs 2 lakh Sandhwal,” he said, giving recoveries made against these notices. Apart from these, the mining department issued notices worth Rs 5.36 crore, said the mining officer. The other mining sites visited by the Sukhbir had been allotted through e-auction to Prime Vision Industry Private Limited of Noida and no illegal mining and machinery was found from these sites, he added. Earlier on June 30, Sarkaria had clarified that the mining site visited by Sukhbir in Amritsar district was a legal site. It was clarified that the mining work was being executed by the concessionaire of mining block number 5 - Friends and Company at the legal auctioned site. The Amritsar police had even registered an FIR against Sukhbir and his party workers under various sections of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mining-minister-again-rejects-sukhbirs-claims-of-illegal-mining/articleshow/84106436.cms||---
---||Delhi||Make draft MPD webinar more detailed, citizen group urges DDA||New Delhi: A citizen awareness group has asked Delhi Development Authority for elaborate presentations with dedicated time in future webinars to deal with people’s queries regarding draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041. The group, Mai Bhi Dilli, expressed displeasure over the way the first session was conducted on July 1. The group shared a press statement and shared on social media, tagging agencies concerned. Mai Bhi Dilli aims to make planning in Delhi more representative and inclusive by engaging Delhiites. It has members from several NGOs, advocates, researchers, community leaders and individuals working in different sectors. Shalaka Chauhan, coordinator for the campaign, said that the DDA’s webinar aims to facilitate the general public to understand the draft plan better and give more constructive suggestions. “However, during the webinar, the audience was neither explained things properly nor given the liberty to ask questions,” she said. “The attendees were told to submit their queries online at the event that started 40 minutes late and saw participation by only 200-odd people.” The campaign has demanded the presentation be in both Hindi and English languages, and also disseminated in different mediums. “We have asked officials that the proceedings of the meeting be updated along with the video recording and key decisions/minutes and there must be involvement of local urban bodies and government departments, as it is mandated in the DDA Act,” said Aravind Unni of NGO Indo Global Social Service Society and member of Mai Bhi Dilli.

They, however, failed to secure a win in two prestigious fights - Baghpat and Etah. In Baghpat, after a high voltage drama that went on for a fortnight beginning with RLD-SP combine candidate Mamta Kishore joining BJP only to file nomination as RLD candidate hours later to withdrawal of her candidature by an "imposter" even as the real candidate was holed up in a Rajasthan based resort, the RLD-SP candidate eventually managed to win the seat defeating BJP candidate Babli Devi by five votes. Kishore got 12 votes and Devi seven. The collectorate witnessed unprecedented security arrangements. Notably, the UP election commission had also ordered a probe. "It is peoples' victory and my primary concern will be to work for their upliftment," Mamta Kishore said. RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary tweeted, "The consistent pressure maintained by people of Baghpat did not allow high-handedness in the election of district panchayat president." In Etah, the Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate secured an impressive victory. Twenty-four district council members out of 30 voted for Rekha Yadav. BJP backed Vineeta Yadav got four votes while two members' votes were cancelled. Rekha Yadav is the wife of former district council president Jogendra Yadav and sister-in-law of former SP MLA Rameshwar Yadav. The Yadav brothers were labelled “land mafia” by the district administration recently. The BJP won most of the other seats in western UP without much of a fight from the beleaguered Opposition. BJP candidate Manju Bhadoriya was elected unopposed in Agra. They clinched all nine districts of Bareilly zone. They won Kasganj, Firozabad and Hapur districts too. In Kasganj, BJP candidate Ratnesh Yadav defeated SP's Smarath Yadav by five votes while in Firozabad, Haristha Singh beat SP's Ruchi Yadav by six votes. In Bareilly zone, they were ahead in counting and expected to take Bareilly, Budaun, Rampur, Sambhal and Bijnor districts. While in Shahjahanpur, Pilibhit, Moradabad and Amroha, the ruling party's candidates won unopposed. SP's Sunita Shakya put up a fight in Budaun where BJP’s Varsha Yadav reportedly won. In once SP leader Azam Khan's stronghold Rampur, BJP's Khyaliram Lodhi went past SP candidate Nasreen Jahan by five votes. In the keenly contested Muzaffarnagar where Union minister Sanjeev Balyan's cousin Satender was up against BJP, the ruling party managed to make it a one-sided affair. Veerpal Nirwal, the BJP candidate, beat Satender Balyan, who was put up by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), by 26 votes. Muzaffarnagar has 43 zila panchayat members, in which 34 voted. Thirty of them gave their support to Nirwal while only four backed Balyan's cousin. Nine abstained. Later, Satender accused BJP members of "putting pressure on the local administration". BJP is now on course to win more than 60 out of 75 seats in the state. The SP is expected to come a distant second with a mere six seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-zila-panchayat-polls-bjp-sweeps-western-up-districts-sp-gets-etah-rld-wins-baghpat-after-high-drama/articleshow/84100708.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Based on her father’s complaint, a case was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, said police.

And, we could figure out that something wrong had happened with her. The accused, however, fled the scene threatening to kill our daughter if we disclosed the crime to police,” alleged the father. Superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand said, “The girl has been sent for a medical examination, and further proceedings are underway. We have, meanwhile, booked the boy and his mother under sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Pocso Act.” Police said the minor accused was detained for interrogation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-4-raped-by-minor-boy-in-ups-moradabad/articleshow/84098706.cms||Maria Khan

Aasiriyam tablets are rare documentations sculpted on stone tablets assigning a person or team as a custodian responsible to manage and take care of a temple or a waterbody or a village.According to A Manikandan, a research scholar in Thanjavur Tamil University, the three stone tablets were identified within a radius of 25km in Thirumayam town. The tablets were found in fragments and were written in readable Tamil script. The tablet recovered from a vacant land near Thevarmalai Sivan temple mentioned about Agamara Manickanar, who was appointed as custodian of the Sivan temple whose chief deity is identified as Nayagar Nambigal. During the years between the 13th and 16th centuries, the present day Pudukottai district was ruled by a number of small chieftains. They appointed reliable and able persons as Aasiriyam (custodian or protector) of the properties. The tablets serve as an official declaration made by the chieftain to let people know that the persons mentioned as Aasiriyam was in charge. “People recognised as Aasiriyam were more like present day’s village administrative officers who served as tax collectors and authority to resolve the grievances. They were considered as most trusted people of the chieftains and were appointed to protect the properties,” Manikandan said.In Panaiyur Kulamangalam village, the tablet found in a vacant land identifies one Bahuya Nayakkar as the Aasiriyam of the village. The tablet was estimated to be from the 14th century. Similarly, in Sevvalur village near Ponnamaravathi, a team named A Virutharaiyargal, probably a group of men, were appointed as custodians of the village. Karu Rajendran, president of the forum said that Pudukottai had served as a major trade route. “Traders travelling with valuables were also protected by the people recognised as Aasiriyam. The stone tablets had served as a declaration of appointment among the people,” Rajendran said. So far, only 67 Aasiriyam tablets were recorded in the state of which the majority were found in Pudukottai district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/3-aasiriyam-stone-tablets-unearthed-in-pudukottai/articleshow/84102490.cms||Deepak Karthik

The structures are being demolished as they pose possible threat to lives and properties around, especially during monsoon. Most of these structures were built using lime, mortar and mud, all of which can give easily give away and collapse as a result of rain. As per the report issued by the civic body, 10 such structures have in demolished over last ten days across Old Safilguda, Old Nallakunta, Lalapet, Tukaramgate Pan Bazar, Bholakpur, Ranigunj. “Notices have already been served for another 30 structures, which have been identified by GHMC engineering and town planning wings in Secunderabad, Begumpet, Musheerabad, and Amberpet circles,” informed an official of the GHMC engineering wing. “Occupants of such structures have been asked to vacate the premises for their safety in light of forecasts of heavy rain over the coming days. Few of them are vacating while few are not willing to vacate fearing they may lose ownership rights,” GHMC Secunderabad assistant city planner (ACP), N Krishna Mohan, told STOI. Meanwhile another ACP, G Pavani, informed that since special drive began, they have pulled down five dilapidated structures in Musheerabad circle and have identified and sought opinion over structural stability of a few more from experts at JNTU-H. The official said demolitions will proceed as per the expert report. Hayanthnagar ACP Md Ershad said that notices have been served to owners over nine dilapidated properties under LB Nagar jurisdiction. In some cases, civic body officials are facing difficulties from owners of such building who have been served notices. “Few owners say the property is ancestral and located in an prime area. As a result, they are not willing to have the buildings razed. In some cases, properties are caught in legal tangles and disputes within family members,” informed a senior official from the GHMC’s engineering wing . As most of these structures are built within residential areas, officials do other problems while demolishing them. Occupants of neighbouring buildings also raise objections stating that their buildings too face damage as a result of these demolitions, according to an official who has experienced such hurdles during the demolition drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-razing-dilapidated-bldgs-on-war-footing-despite-hurdles/articleshow/84103053.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Hyderabad||Tests cleared but job of Telangana's first ‘line women’ still eludes duo||HYDERABAD: Even six months after they successfully climbed an eight-meter pole to prove their mettle, the dream of becoming Telangana's first linemen (linewomen, rather) continues to elude this duo – V Bharathi and Babburi Shirisha. Reason: A pending a court order clearing the appointment, based on their place on the merit list. “It is very upsetting to see this is happening to us. When we have already passed the written test and completed the pole test -- as is mandatory for all male candidates -- then why are we not getting our appointment letters. What more do we have to prove,” asked a frustrated 32-year-old Bharathi, from her home in Warangal. Bharathi, a mother of two, in the interim has worked in the fields, taken up odd jobs and even sold her jewellery to keep her family afloat. That her husband, Mohan S Maloth, lost his job amid the pandemic has only made matters worse. He had to take up daily wage assignments to make ends meet. “I had really hoped that by now I would start working and our problems would get resolved. I trained very hard for it. I hope the court sees merit in our efforts and clears the path for our appointment soon,” Bharathi added. The starting salary of a lineman with the Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company (TSSPDCL) is roughly Rs 30,000 per month. “The money would help me take the burden off my ageing mother who is the sole breadwinner of the family,” said Shirisha from her home in Siddipet’s Markook mandal. “The wait is getting very frustrating now,” she added. Officials of the TSSPDCL said that the final results have been submitted to the court and that the department is waiting for its verdict to go ahead with the appointments. “It is true that both the women passed the pole test. Based on that and their written test marks, we have shared the merit list with the court. We will now act as per the court’s instructions. Hopefully, it should be done soon,” said G Parvatham, director (HR), TSSPDCL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tests-cleared-but-job-of-ts-1st-line-women-still-eludes-duo/articleshow/84103199.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

The historians found art depicitng a tiger, wild boar and hunting activities. “As of 2013, the number of rock carvings in Telangana was only 18. Today, the number is over 60 — 18 by archaeologists, 16 by others and 26 plus sites have been identified in the research by our group,” said historian Sriramoju Haragopal. He added that most rock formations contain rock carvings hence it was important to stop quarrying operations. Hanumannagari Vemareddy, a member of the Kotha Telangana Charitra Brundam, identified the site along with T Padmareddy and S Hanmanta Reddy. “The rock carvings depict deer, a hunting tiger, wild boar and two human figures. A moose image of deer is seen with large horns. Although such figures can be seen in many of the rock paintings in Telangana, this rock painting is unique. According to the style of painting, it is a pre-neolithic stone painting. Large tiger carvings have been found at Pandavulagutta, Goparajupally, Hastalapur and Vattimalla. Of these, Medikonda rock art depicts tiger hunting,” they said. The paintings found in Medikonda are medieval in style. “This means that these are the rock paintings that were painted under the basement of this monument tens of thousands of years ago,” the historians said. Rock Art Society of India members Bandi Muralidhar Reddy, Katta Srinivas, Vemuganti Muralikrishna and Haragopal assisted in the analysis and chronology of the inscriptions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/historians-discover-rare-rock-art-site-in-gadwal/articleshow/84103140.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Delhi||Unlock 2: 13,000 Covid challans in 2 days in Delhi||NEW DELHI: With the reopening of markets, cases of Covid norm violations are growing and it is not uncommon to find people without masks in public places. About 6,000-7,000 challans are being issued every day by teams of district enforcement officials deployed across the capital. After reports of violations were received from various markets, the authorities concerned have deployed more teams in markets and crowded places. Over 13,000 challans have been issued in two days and 149 teams are deployed across 11 districts. However, all the districts are currently under-performing in terms of targets given to them for enforcement. Each district is supposed to issue around 1,000 challans every day to create a better sense of responsibility among people. Among all, South East district is at the top with 1,055 cases of enforcement action, followed by Shahdara with 781 cases, North with 747 cases, North East with 703 cases, Central Delhi with 584 cases while South West is at the lowest pedestal with 363 cases of enforcement action on June 30. Delhi has permitted various economic activities in a phased manner. The unlock began from May 31 and in the first phase, the government allowed only manufacturing units in industrial areas and construction activities with restrictions. Markets, malls, restaurants, gyms and yoga institutes were permitted later. On May 24, the 11 districts together acted in only 3,833 cases of Covid norm violations, which grew to 6,643 on June 30. “The lifting of lockdown has led to crowds in the markets and the focus of the administration has shifted to strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said an official. As part of enforcement, officials issue challans and create awareness among people about following Covid-appropriate behaviour like properly wearing masks, not spitting in the public. The market areas have, meanwhile, witnessed significant improvement in the Covid situation in the past one month. On May 24, there were a total of 67 containment zones across the markets of the capital. The number of containment zones was reduced to only three on June 30. The East district administration recently shut down Laxmi Nagar market due to major Covid norm violations and barricades were put up in some markets to check crowd movement. “The shop owners are ensuring that the Covid-appropriate behaviour is strictly followed on their premises. They are also creating awareness at their own level, but they cannot be held responsible for violations outside their premises. It is the job of the district officials to ensure the norms are followed outside,” said Devinder Jain, general secretary, Federation of All India Vyapar Mandal (Delhi).

There have been complaints that civic workers have dug up pits and left the drains uncovered despite a monsoon action plan to avoid a rerun of last year’s floods that resulted in overflowing nalas, loss of lives, inundation of houses. “It has been weeks since the workers dug up a pit and left the drain uncovered in our area. The mud dug out of the pit is spreading onto the road. Rains make the entire stretch prone to accidents. We see two wheelers skidding and falling as the mud turns into a slush with every spell of rain,” said Parmeshwar Rao, a resident of Chintal Basthi. The situation is similar at Moosapet, Khairtabad, Banjara Hills, Charminar and other areas. At Charminar, civic authorities have dug up roads and left open drains exposed either side of the road across Laad Bazaar. Shop owners, from Charminar to Moti Galli, are being forced to lay wooden planks over these drains for over two months now. “Our customers risk their lives by balancing on these planks to enter the shop. They (civic body) dug up the road in April when there was lockdown. At the time, we were told that it will not take more than two months to complete the works, but they haven’t finished it,” said Osman Baig, a bangle store owner. Last month, Strategic Nala Development Plan wing of GHMC floated tenders for 22 work orders costing Rs 2.55 crore for small emergency works to avoid inundation. Despite this, the SNDP is lagging in planing and finishing projects. The government had also instructed SNDP to take steps to strengthen the existing storm water drain network and set up new ones to avoid urban flooding. “We have asked all government and private agencies to restore roads soon. GHMC has banned road cuttings from June 1 to October 31, including those that come under the comprehensive road maintenance programme. We will certainly take action if the work has been left pending,” said GHMC chief engineer for maintenance M Devanand. About the situation at Charminar’s Laad Bazaar area, the chief engineer said, “It is Charminar Pedastrianisation Project (CPP) work going on by projects wing and will most likely be completed by the end of this month.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monsoon-plan-in-action-open-drains-a-concern/articleshow/84103011.cms||Moulika.KV

They, however, failed to secure a win in two prestigious fights - Baghpat and Etah. In Baghpat, after a high voltage drama that went on for a fortnight beginning with RLD-SP combine candidate Mamta Kishore joining BJP only to file nomination as RLD candidate hours later to withdrawal of her candidature by an "imposter" even as the real candidate was holed up in a Rajasthan based resort, the RLD-SP candidate eventually managed to win the seat defeating BJP candidate Babli Devi by five votes. Kishore got 12 votes and Devi seven. The collectorate witnessed unprecedented security arrangements. Notably, the UP election commission had also ordered a probe. "It is peoples' victory and my primary concern will be to work for their upliftment," Mamta Kishore said. RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary tweeted, "The consistent pressure maintained by people of Baghpat did not allow high-handedness in the election of district panchayat president." In Etah, the Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate secured an impressive victory. Twenty-four district council members out of 30 voted for Rekha Yadav. BJP backed Vineeta Yadav got four votes while two members' votes were cancelled. Rekha Yadav is the wife of former district council president Jogendra Yadav and sister-in-law of former SP MLA Rameshwar Yadav. The Yadav brothers were labelled “land mafia” by the district administration recently. The BJP won most of the other seats in western UP without much of a fight from the beleaguered Opposition. BJP candidate Manju Bhadoriya was elected unopposed in Agra. They clinched all nine districts of Bareilly zone. They won Kasganj, Firozabad and Hapur districts too. In Kasganj, BJP candidate Ratnesh Yadav defeated SP's Smarath Yadav by five votes while in Firozabad, Haristha Singh beat SP's Ruchi Yadav by six votes. In Bareilly zone, they were ahead in counting and expected to take Bareilly, Budaun, Rampur, Sambhal and Bijnor districts. While in Shahjahanpur, Pilibhit, Moradabad and Amroha, the ruling party's candidates won unopposed. SP's Sunita Shakya put up a fight in Budaun where BJP’s Varsha Yadav reportedly won. In once SP leader Azam Khan's stronghold Rampur, BJP's Khyaliram Lodhi went past SP candidate Nasreen Jahan by five votes. In the keenly contested Muzaffarnagar where Union minister Sanjeev Balyan's cousin Satender was up against BJP, the ruling party managed to make it a one-sided affair. Veerpal Nirwal, the BJP candidate, beat Satender Balyan, who was put up by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), by 26 votes. Muzaffarnagar has 43 zila panchayat members, in which 34 voted. Thirty of them gave their support to Nirwal while only four backed Balyan's cousin. Nine abstained. Later, Satender accused BJP members of "putting pressure on the local administration". BJP is now on course to win more than 60 out of 75 seats in the state. The SP is expected to come a distant second with a mere six seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-zila-panchayat-polls-bjp-sweeps-western-up-districts-sp-gets-etah-rld-wins-baghpat-after-high-drama/articleshow/84098839.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||‘Local people need to be made stakeholders in conservation’||‘Wild by Nature’, the 150-page book penned by naturalist and ecologist Anirudh Chaoji (53), fondly called Ani Sir by many nature lovers whom he groomed through 18 years of running pugmarks (Pugmarks) and naturalist training courses, was recently released by Justice Sunil Shukre at the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court and PCCF (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar, who retired recently. Chaoji, who earlier worked with the Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) as an ecologist is presently chief naturalist with the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). Starting his career as a practicing landscaper to a Pugmarker to train people to pursue wildlife and adventure, Chaoji’s journey as a well-known naturalist is a long one. Apart from being a wildlife trainer, he is also a philatelist. An electronics graduate with a masters in marketing, he started with corporate jobs before changing track to adventure and wildlife as a career. TOI talks to him about his maiden venture.Excerpts...Q. How did you land up in such an offbeat field?A. My father was an Indian Air Force (IAF) officer. He never took us to movies and typical picnics. Our long weekends were spent in the old, dark bungalows and forest rest houses of Totladoh, Ranidoh, Navegaon, Nagzira and Tadoba. Passion for wildlife probably was in the genes. What I lacked in technical knowledge then was gained from the works of Salim Ali, Frederick Champion, George Schaller, AJT Johnson, Jim Corbett and Maruti Chitampalli. But the most important teachers have been the van majoors and forest field staff, some of my closest friends. And now, nature guides too.Q. What kind of a journey has it been?A. I started training the guides in 2000 informally. It was mainly with the intention of having a great pair of eyes with the support of field knowledge on the pugmarks and nature camps. I taught many guides from Nagzira, Navegaon, Melghat and Tadoba the art of communicating with the urban crowd. Today, they are the finest field naturalists. With former principal secretary (forest) Pravin Pardeshi’s support in 2010, I extended guide training to Bhimashankar, Kaas Plateau, Sahyadri and other places. When the initiative was taken to start community-based ecotourism in Tadoba, I got an opportunity to work with DyCF Gajendra Narwane and this was the turning point. Since then, over 500 youth from Tadoba buffer villages who were trained are today guides, drivers, activity personnel and employed in the tourism industry. Four years ago, I started a weekly training programme through social media for them all over Maharashtra in Marathi. Soon it was extended to my friends in English. Now it also goes out in Hindi and Odiya. Today, over 5,000 nature lover friends receive and further circulate these nature bytes. Friends like Jaydeep Das and Peeyush Sekhsaria gave the push needed to convert these bytes into the book.Q. What is so special about your book ‘Wild by Nature’?A. It took me four years to complete ‘Wild by Nature’. It started as an effort to hand-hold nature guides to provide their guests a good wildlife experience beyond tiger tourism. These guides predominantly belong to the Adivasi communities and are shy. The objective is to help them become good storytellers. The overall roadmap is to provide local youth with skills for non-extractive livelihoods. These will reduce their forest dependence and also probable conflicts with wildlife. The book will help create common man ambassadors of conservation. The 150 pages have interesting info bytes on birds, mammals, reptiles, aqua life, insects and environmental issues. The simple and non-technical language ensures that people are not put off by the excessive scientific terminologies. Besides, local beliefs and cultural connections help in relating to community understanding of issues. The intention of the book is not to make scientists but to make common people fall in love with the outdoors. It reminds people that there is so much to see and experience in a forest.Q. You must have motivated many to protect and conserve nature.A. Making people fall in love with nature and the outdoors has been my passion. But also inspiring many to follow education and careers in the field has been equally important. Many of these youngsters are taking their ‘wild’ passion to a logical end by learning in the country’s big institutes. I feel really happy to see young people like Pallavi Ghaskadbi collaring tigers and wild dogs. When I meet these youngsters, there is so much new learning for me.Q. There’s distrust despite hundreds of families benefiting from ecotourism. What’s the issue?A. A history of 5,000 years where people co-existed with their forests was suddenly altered by the British to lay a claim on the timber resources of the land. Ever-increasing people have been forcibly kept out of the forests. Maharashtra was fortunate in having forward-thinking officers who started getting local communities to benefit and partner in conservation. However, the distrust is almost 150 years old, since 1878, when reserved forests kept the communities out of their forests. Wiping it out in a decade or two is difficult. However, places like Tadoba are seeing different relationships between the department and the communities. Officials here have been instrumental in providing livelihoods to people in over 20 villages through 14 buffer safari gates. No other wildlife area in the entire country can boast of having 20 safari gates and over 12 other equally thrilling activities.Q. You have worked with the country’s biggest reserves and now you are with Tadoba. What are the challenges?A. While the process of jointly working towards conservation is happening at differing levels everywhere in Maharashtra, there are a few bad apples everywhere. Some set fires, others poach animals, few encroach upon forest land for agriculture, but these elements are in a minority. Most people are today seeing the benefits of conservation. Conservation cannot happen without the active participation of the forest neighbouring communities. This is a fact of life, the sooner people realize it, the better it is for the wilderness. Even tourism without communities is plain resort tourism and should not be confused with ecotourism as claimed.Q. What needs to be done for a peaceful co-existence?A. Local people need to be made stakeholders in conservation. Only when they too reap benefits, they will work to protect and conserve. Tadoba has shown that this can work in favour of conservation. Forest ministers, secretaries and officers from other states are regularly visiting Tadoba to study the model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/local-people-need-to-be-made-stakeholders-in-conservation/articleshow/84102647.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Dehradun||With one call, Pushkar Singh Dhami could gather thousands||DEHRADUN: The youngest chief minister of Uttarakhand had an early start. Pushkar Singh Dhami was just 15 when he joined ABVP. As he worked his way up the ranks, going on to head the BJP’s youth wing and then as vice-president of the party’s state unit, the 30-year-long path to power had one consistent characteristic -- he never forgot to amplify the concerns of the state’s youth. It was a biting cold morning in January 2005. The State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (Sidcul), holding out on the promise of employment, had been a disappointment for the young. “Thousands would gather upon one call by Pushkar,” his friend of over two decades, Vikas Sharma, told TOI. “That day, he made the call.” And thousands did descend upon the assembly with one demand — jobs. “He compelled the ND Tiwari-led Congress government to announce 70% reservation for local youth in industrial jobs,” Sharma, who is now president of the Devbhoomi Vyapar Mandal in Rudrapur, added. Son of an Indian Army subedar, Dhami studied law — he declared his profession as “advocate” in his election affidavits — and got a postgraduate degree in human resources from Lucknow University. He had already been initiated into the Sangh Parivar by then. Between 1990 and 1999, he held several positions in ABVP. He was noticed by Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, now governor of Maharashtra, who picked Dhami as his officer on special duty when he became CM in 2001. When Koshiyari’s stint was over in 2002, Dhami moved back to youth politics and became president of BJP’s youth wing, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha. “During his tenure from 2002 to 2008, he would organise huge rallies on youth-related issues. He was, and continues to be, popular among young people,” Sharma said. Within the party, his hold over the youth was a major factor behind the decision to appoint him CM. “He is an inspiration for lakhs of youth in Uttarakhand. Dhami participated in the statehood agitation and has an understanding of local issues. He will bring development,” BJP state president Madan Kaushik told TOI. Yet, until Saturday, he barely had a presence on the national political stage. Khatima, which he represents, is a small agrarian town near the India-Nepal border. He won his first election in 2012 from there by over 5,000 votes. In 2017, he won the seat again, this time by 3,000 votes. As a sitting MLA, his appointment as CM circumvents the problem that effectively made his predecessor, Tirath Singh Rawat, step down. “I thank the BJP high command for choosing my husband … I am sure he will live up to the expectations of the people and work hard for development,” his wife Geeta Dhami, a homemaker, said on Saturday. For his mother, Vishnu Devi, it brought up bittersweet memories. “I am happy I will see him as CM,” she said. “But I am also a little upset that his father is not with us on this day. He always used to say, 'Pushkar CM banega (he will be CM one day)'.” (With inputs from Aakash Ahuja)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pushkars-mela-with-one-call-he-could-gather-thousands/articleshow/84100758.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The animal was spotted several times around Milithane, Kerkambai and Indra Nagar villages in the past month. Based on complaints from villagers, forest officials set up a cage two weeks ago at Milithan to capture the animal. Finally, the sloth bear was caught inside the cage in the early hours on Saturday. Meanwhile, the bear damaged the cage in a bid to escape. The officials brought another cage and shifted the animal in it. “The sloth bear will be released into the Korakundha forest near Upperbhavani soon,” said Saravanakumar, assistant conservator of forests. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sloth-bear-captured-in-nilgiris/articleshow/84102635.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Colleges rush to hold internal online tests for HSC students||Mumbai: A day after the state government announced the evaluation criteria for HSC stude-nts, colleges held meetings on how to proceed with assessment work. The state has decided to evaluate HSC students by giving weightage to marks in classes X, XI and XII in a 30:30:40 ratio. Colleges that have not been able to evaluate students’ performance in class XII will conduct online tests and projects from Monday. Students in their hometowns since the 2020 lockdown are being telephonically contacted to get their assignments in order. College heads and students criticised the state for delaying the announcement of the evaluation process and coming out with a formula similar to CBSE. Most colleges had urged the state to give least weightage to class XI scores. With the assessment work, tabulation and uploading of SSC proceeding without mu-ch glitches, colleges are positive that HSC result work will also be done systematically. A webinar explaining how to enter and upload marks will be held next week. Results have to be declared by July 31 as per the SC order.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-colleges-rush-to-hold-internal-online-tests-for-hsc-students/articleshow/84107035.cms||---

Medical facilities in the Nilgiris are not the same as in larger towns and cities, and any help that we can bring here will hugely benefit the community,” said Radhika.Several individuals, mostly patrons of Café Diem run by Radhika, came forward to contribute to the initiative. The project was completed in a month. The vehicles will enable transportation of patients from remote villages with narrow roads as quickly as possible to the closest medical facility, the minister said. They have been attached to hospitals and organisations, collector J Innocent Divya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/6-auto-ambulances-to-provide-med-care-in-hilly-areas/articleshow/84102629.cms||---

---||Surat||Surat: 200 ‘stolen’ cars found within a month||SURAT: In first major economic offence investigation, Economic Offence Cell (EOC) of the city police recovered 200 cars worth Rs 4.5 crore that were sold by an accused after hiring these as taxis. Police said total 264 cars were stolen. Cops are now speeding the process to ensure that rightful owners get back their vehicles. The stolen cars were recovered in less than a month’s time. Police arrested accused Ketul Parmar from Botad on June 7, two days after an offence was registered against him. During investigation, police identified people who purchased these stolen cars and recovered them. The vehicles were sold in different districts of Gujarat and Maharashtra in less than half the actual price of the vehicle. So far 22 cars have been returned to their owners and 60 more applications are pending in the court to get cars back. Amar Patel, a resident of Bhathena, had lodged a complaint in detection of crime branch (DCB) on June 5. The investigation was handed over to EOC. In his complaint Patel alleged that the fraud continued since September 2020. The accused was booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code including breach of trust, cheating and forging documents. Both Parmar and Patel were cab service providers and had met each other a few years ago. They were in regular touch since then and Parmar informed Patel that he got a contract to supply cars on rent to a solar company. Believing him, Patel provided a car for a 10 days trial. After receiving payment of rent, Patel started providing Parmar more cars. Later his friends too started providing cars to Parmar. “The victims were paid as high as Rs 20,000 monthly rental for a car during the pandemic. Hence many known people of Patel got trapped. The rent was paid for initial few months and then the accused disappeared,” said police. Police are yet to arrest other accused Gopal Jograna, Kalu Bhuva Bharwad, Viram Gagji Bhuva, Bhola Sindhav, Vijay Chosla, Amit Satiya, Firoz alias Hukam Shaikh, Ishwar Chosla Malakiya and Sanjay Bharvad. “The accused took the original RTO registration certificate and insurance papers from the owners. They then used them to sell the cars,” said V K Parmar, assistant commissioner of police, EOC. “Recovering the cars was our priority since the victims are from poor financial background. If they don’t get the vehicles back they will be in bigger trouble. Hence, we recovered the cars on top priority,” said Ajay Tomar, city police commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/200-stolen-cars-found-within-a-month/articleshow/84100767.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Weekend rush leads to heavy tourist influx, long snarls in Mussoorie||MUSSOORIE: The weekend rush of tourists to escape the summer heat led to long traffic snarls in all parts of Mussoorie. Among the worst-hit locations were Mall Road, Picture Palace, and Gandhi Chowk, among others. The slow pace of traffic has increased the commute time for both locals and tourists. "We were caught in a jam for nearly an hour before we could reach our hotel," said Pushpendra Kumar, a tourist. When asked on the matter, Rajeev Rauthan, station officer, Mussoorie, said, “We have deployed traffic personnel at all major bottlenecks and are ensuring that vehicular movement is not interrupted. The pace of the traffic has certainly slowed down due to the tourist rush but there were no traffic jams.” However, the massive tourist influx has given the hoteliers a reason to cheer. A majority of the hotels in the queen of hills are recording 100% occupancy during the weekend. “After a long period of quiet, we are witnessing a good tourist footfall. Several hotels are recording a full house for the last two days. Given the hot and sultry weather in the plain regions, we expect good occupancy during the coming week as well,” RN Mathur, president of Mussoorie Hotels Association, told TOI. Meanwhile, the local traders have expressed happiness over the recent state government decision allowing tourist spots to open at 50% capacity. “We are glad to open our establishments after a long break,” said a shopkeeper from the Municipal Garden area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/weekend-rush-leads-to-heavy-tourist-influx-long-snarls-in-mussoorie/articleshow/84100773.cms||Anmol Jain

The chief minister hit out at environmentalists and NGOs for opposing various projects in the name of the environment, but not planting a single tree in Goa. Addressing the airport-affected people at Mopa, Sawant said that all projects related to the airport would be completed with their support. “It is not that only we want to complete the airport, we also want the development of Mopa village, Pernem taluka and the state, and the state (government) is working in this direction,” he said. Taking another dig at environmentalists for “not planting a single tree”, he said that the five lakh trees the government planted would also be nurtured by the government. “We have planted fruit-bearing trees so that it keeps the environmental balance,” he said. Sawant said that just the way Mopa has now become popular, the state government wants development for the people of Pernem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lost-50k-trees-at-mopa-but-govt-planted-5-lakh-sawant/articleshow/84104705.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Covid-19 in Maharashtra: Nine districts have positivity rates higher than state average of 4.5%||PUNE: State authorities on Saturday asked officials of nine districts with weekly positivity rates higher than 4.5% (the state average) to boost their testing levels, contact tracing and pace of vaccine coverage. Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Buldhana, Pune (rural), Palghar and Raigad have all recorded test positivity rates higher than 4.5%, according to the weekly (June 25 to July 1) report prepared by the state public health department. Kolhapur currently tops the state with a 10% positivity rate. Satara is second at 9.1%. State health director Dr Archana Patil said the nine districts have been asked to step up surveillance and vaccination coverage. "A five-pronged strategy will have to be followed by these districts, which will mainly focus on improved testing, contact tracing, identification of hotspots, ensuring there are no major gatherings and good pace of vaccine coverage," she said. The rest of the state's 26 districts are currently showing weekly positivity rates lower than 5%. But four of the ones with worrying numbers are within Pune division - Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Kolhapur. Deputy commissioner, Santosh Patil, from Pune division, said he has asked these districts to rely more on RT-PCR testing. He said, "Kolhapur and Satara have been asked to focus more on adequate containment and crowd control. These districts have also been asked to keep an 80:20 ratio of RT-PCR and RAT tests." He added that Covid-19 cases in Kolhapur rose slowly during the second wave. Its positivity rate in the first week of June was nearly 16%. State relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta said affected districts should ramp up lab capacities to boost RT-PCR testing. The weekly positivity rates are determined via RT-PCR testing data and Gupta said officials should shed over-reliance on rapid kits to get more accurate estimates of Covid spread in their jurisdictions. Data from the public health department shows that out of 14.74 lakh tests conducted in the week, 6.46 were via RT-PCR and 8.27 were done using rapid antigen kits (RATs). State Covid-19 task force member, Dr Shashank Joshi, said it's worrying to note that there are nine districts with high test positivity rates. “We have to increase testing, tracing of contacts and enforce public health policies more strictly," he said, adding that at least 30 contacts per positive case should be traced by authorities in these districts. Dr Joshi also said both genome sequencing and sero surveillance will have to be scaled up to keep an eye out for variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/9-districts-have-positivity-rates-higher-than-state-avg-of-4-5/articleshow/84111971.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Allahabad||BJP’s VK Singh beats SP’s Malti Yadav to be new ZP president in Prayagraj||Prayagraj: Dr VK Singh, candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would be the new Zila Panchayat president in Prayagraj. Dr Singh defeated Samajwadi Party’s Malti Yadav by a margin of 18 votes to bag the post, polling and counting for which was held on Saturday. Dr Singh bagged 51 votes while Malti Yadav could secure just 33 votes in her favour, losing the political contest. Yadav and Dr Singh were in direct contest with each other as these were the only two candidates in the fray. ADM (Nazul) Ganga Ram Gupta confirmed Dr VK Singh's victory in the election by a margin of 18 votes. Immediately after the declaration of the poll results, while the BJP supporters started bursting crackers, SP members levelled allegations against the BJP and the district administration of bias that led to SP workers raising slogans and entering into an altercation with the policemen at duty near Anand Hospital where they were gathered. The police had to use mild force to disperse the crowd. The voting to elect the new Zila Panchayat president kick-started at Zila Panchayat Bhawan at 11am. Additional Commissioner (Food and Civil supplies) Anil Kumar as Observer, district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Khatri and DIG Sarvshreshth Tripathi remained present at the Zila Panchayat Bhawan the entire day to ensure smooth polling and counting process. Till 11.30am, just one out of the total 84 Zila panchayat members eligible to cast votes had voted. At around noon, SP MLC Man Singh arrived at the voting site with 39 Zila Panchayat members and claimed that 10 more members were on their way to the Zila Panchayat Bhawan to cast vote in favour of the SP candidate. A little later, BJP leader Rekha Singh also arrived at the Bhawan with 12 Zila Panchayat members including five women. Unable to get the news regarding the goings-on inside the Zila Panchayat Bhawan resulted in SP workers growing restless near the District collectorate where they had been stopped with the help of police the barricading. They tried to pressurise the police officials to allow BJP MLC Man Singh and the party’s district president Yogesh Chandra to enter the Zila Panchayat Bhawan premises. They also claimed that BJP had fixed chips inside the masks of its members which was facilitating them to keep a tab of the proceedings taking place inside the Zila Panchayat Bhawan. Unable to get the police officials to yield to their demands, the SP party workers tried to pass the police barricading by force that led to the police using mild force to disperse and push them back. District election office informed that till the voting deadline of 3pm, all 84 eligible voters had exercised their franchise. Soon after the counting process kick-started and within one-and-a-half hours, Dr VK Singh was declared the winner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bjps-vk-singh-beats-sps-malti-yadav-to-be-new-zp-president-in-prayagraj/articleshow/84106578.cms||---

A detailed chart mentioning the weekly off should be prepared by the assist commissioners of police (ACPs) and sent to the respective DCPs. Cops attached to police stations, city armed reserve police and special units can avail the off from this month.”DCPs and ACPs could, meanwhile, take off on weekends with the officers in the same rank holding the additional charge.Tirupur city has 982 police personnel. “During the weekly offs, cops won’t be disturbed by anyone. They can spend the day with their family and children. They will get four off days in a month and it will help reduce their stress,” the Tirupur city police commissioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tirupur-city-police-to-get-weekly-off-now/articleshow/84102664.cms||---

---||Pune||Covid-19 in Maharashtra: Nine districts have positivity rates higher than state average of 4.5%||PUNE: State authorities on Saturday asked officials of nine districts with weekly positivity rates higher than 4.5% (the state average) to boost their testing levels, contact tracing and pace of vaccine coverage. Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Buldhana, Pune (rural), Palghar and Raigad have all recorded test positivity rates higher than 4.5%, according to the weekly (June 25 to July 1) report prepared by the state public health department. Kolhapur currently tops the state with a 10% positivity rate. Satara is second at 9.1%. State health director Dr Archana Patil said the nine districts have been asked to step up surveillance and vaccination coverage. "A five-pronged strategy will have to be followed by these districts, which will mainly focus on improved testing, contact tracing, identification of hotspots, ensuring there are no major gatherings and good pace of vaccine coverage," she said. The rest of the state's 26 districts are currently showing weekly positivity rates lower than 5%. But four of the ones with worrying numbers are within Pune division - Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Kolhapur. Deputy commissioner, Santosh Patil, from Pune division, said he has asked these districts to rely more on RT-PCR testing. He said, "Kolhapur and Satara have been asked to focus more on adequate containment and crowd control. These districts have also been asked to keep an 80:20 ratio of RT-PCR and RAT tests." He added that Covid-19 cases in Kolhapur rose slowly during the second wave. Its positivity rate in the first week of June was nearly 16%. State relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta said affected districts should ramp up lab capacities to boost RT-PCR testing. The weekly positivity rates are determined via RT-PCR testing data and Gupta said officials should shed over-reliance on rapid kits to get more accurate estimates of Covid spread in their jurisdictions. Data from the public health department shows that out of 14.74 lakh tests conducted in the week, 6.46 were via RT-PCR and 8.27 were done using rapid antigen kits (RATs). State Covid-19 task force member, Dr Shashank Joshi, said it's worrying to note that there are nine districts with high test positivity rates. “We have to increase testing, tracing of contacts and enforce public health policies more strictly," he said, adding that at least 30 contacts per positive case should be traced by authorities in these districts. Dr Joshi also said both genome sequencing and sero surveillance will have to be scaled up to keep an eye out for variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/9-districts-have-positivity-rates-higher-than-state-avg-of-4-5/articleshow/84102663.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Pune: Pregnant women in district to get separate vax centres||PUNE: Expectant mothers in the district will likely be offered separate Covid-19 vaccination centres when drives for them start in the next two to three days, officials said on Saturday. “We are planning separate vaccination centres for pregnant women to avoid intermingling with crowds. The separate hubs will also improve ease of vaccination for this group,” said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle. Pregnant women with Covid-19 infection are at increased risk of preterm birth and other adverse outcomes, including higher chances of neonatal morbidity. Public health experts have said that they should be offered exclusive Covid vaccination centres, to keep them away from crowds. Pune district has nearly 800 vaccination centres. Authorities said they plan to set aside at least five civic-run sites within PMC limits and three in PCMC for pregnant women. Rural Pune may get nearly 10 centres. “It is likely that antenatal centres will be selected to vaccinate this group. Most women come to these centres for prenatal check-ups. So the hubs are ideal for their Covid vaccination,” Deshmukh said. Out of the 800 vaccine sites of the district, nearly 350 are in PMC areas. The PCMC has 200 and the rest are in Pune rural. “We plan to have a higher number of centres for pregnant women in Pune rural because of the region’s more diverse population. Women visiting these centres will be told about the benefits of vaccination along with informaion on common side-effects they can expect,” Deshmukh added. Healthcare workers at the antenatal centres will also be trained to counsel pregnant women. Officials added that protocols of registration and generation of certificates will remain the same for this group as the general population. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, said, “Ever since the Union government said it's okay to give pregnant women the Covid vaccines, there has been a spurt in enquiries at city gynaecologists’ from pregnant women. Many want to know more about vaccine safety and when is it okay to get the Covid jabs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pregnant-women-in-district-to-get-separate-vax-centres/articleshow/84102693.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Tribals climb up trees to avoid getting jabs||It was pandemonium at the tribal hamlet of Sarkar Porathipathi near Chadivayal on the outskirts of Coimbatore on Friday when health officers arrived to vaccinate residents. Saying they would die if vaccinated, men climbed atop trees and the women folk ran to the nearby river, refusing to listen to the health officers. On Friday morning, medical officer Dr Kanagarani, junior doctor Hariprasadh and nurse Stella from Bouluvampatti primary health centre trekked all the way to the hamlet for the vaccination camp. “The minute they saw us, they fled. The women went to the river stating they had to fetch water, while men ran to the fields and forests. A few climbed up trees. We tried our best to get them to return,” Dr Kanagarani said. However, their efforts proved futile. Left with no other option, the team stood below the trees and attempted to create awareness. “But they asked us to leave them alone,” the medical officer said. The team, however, managed to inoculate 10 tribals. Officials said one resident had earlier informed the PHC that 50 were willing to take the jab. The 16 tribal hamlets at Bouluvampatti are home to 3,630. Of them, only 498 have been vaccinated so far. “Things are improving. In Mullangadu hamlet, many of the 700 residents have expressed willingness to get inoculated,” Dr Kanagarani said. Dr Senthil Kumar, deputy director of public health, said vaccine hesitancy among tribals wasn’t anything new. “Some NGOs have volunteered to create more awareness among them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tribals-climb-up-trees-to-avoid-getting-jabs/articleshow/84102706.cms||---

The duo, accused of Maoist links, are lodged at Taloja Central Prison, Navi Mumbai. Rama Teltumbde and Susan Abraham, in their petition submitted that such restrictions were against rights of prisoners and raised grievances that letters supposed to be posted, were withheld or posted belatedly and no response was received on letters written by them to the accused. The plea said the action was “deliberate and malicious’’. The superintendent “throttled basic rights of prisoners”, they said, so they were restrained to approach HC for relief. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar issued a notice to the authorities and will hear the matter on July 14. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wives-of-two-elgar-accused-seek-inquiry-into-jail-curbs/articleshow/84106629.cms||---

The company officials have submitted a detailed plan to the local administration, saying only post the trial run they would be able to inform about the actual date of production. “The company officials have informed the administration that they have completed the process of manpower deployment, such as recruitment of scientists and engineers, while their regulatory NOCs are in the pipeline. They are also checking all the mechanical installations at the unit,” said Deshmukh. The local administration has pledged full support to the plant and said they were in regular touch with the company officials to provide infrastructure support and ensure speedy clearances so that production could be started at the earliest. At a Covid review meeting a month ago, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said the unit would commence production by August end. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and collector Deshmukh had visited the plant at Manjari Khurd in mid-May and held detailed discussion with the Bharat Biotech officials.

---||Pune||Industries fret as pvt hosps’ stock depletes||Pune: Industries in and around the region, which have been banking on rapid vaccination of employees to reopen the sector fully, said they are not receiving adequate doses from their private hospital partners, even as they count on government and civic authorities to fill the gap. Many large companies, headquartered or based in the region, partnered with small and large private hospitals to organize on-site vaccination camps at their plants for their employees. Some also arranged for vaccination for their vendors’ employees and other local companies, most of which are MSME units. While such camps have had a good run over the past couple of months, the last few weeks saw inconsistent supply through private channels, according to some companies and industry representatives. “Some of our member companies said they had approached private hospitals for doses but were told that all shots were reserved for government orders only. We had approached a few hospitals for around 3,000 to 5,000 doses, but they were unable to meet this request. What is also happening is that because of the government’s announcement about free vaccines, those, who would otherwise be able to pay for their vaccines, are having second thoughts,” said Deepak Garg, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Pune Zonal Council, and the managing director of the heavy equipment firm Sany India. “The government supplies are not as much and there have been murmurs from some companies about private hospitals not being able to provide enough doses. The situation should improve in the next few days with more supply from the government and private hospitals,” said Prashant Girbane, director general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MCCIA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/industries-fret-as-pvt-hosps-stock-depletes/articleshow/84102734.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

City nutritionists have come up with various types of diets to nip this wave in the bud. They say adequate balanced and nutritious diets can become an immunity booster for the people, especially children. One of them even suggests to have a “Rainbow diet” having different colours of fruits and vegetables in it for providing varieties of nutrition apart from maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviours like wearing of proper masks, sanitization and importance of vaccination. Senior nutritionist Prof AN Radha said, “Flag diet can be a sound solution to build a healthy body system. Like the Indian tricolour, we can have orange representing the saffron colour, milk or butter milk as the white and leafy vegetables representing the green portion. The blue-coloured wheel or chakra can be represented in water which one should drink 24 hours (the 24 spokes).” The Nagpur chapter of Nutrition Society of India’s former president Nilima Joshi said, “Rainbow diets are sound combinations of various sources of nutrients, vitamins and minerals that generally builds up a healthy body system which may be a prerequisite to fight the third wave. Adequate proteins and gut microbiota (useful microorganisms in the gut) are key for building human immunity. They act like our soldiers for the body system while Vitamins A, B, C, D, K and minerals like Selenium and zinc (grains) are the weapons.” She said that Indians diet is highly protein deficient and the protein intake should be one gm per kg of the body per day,” she said. Joshi further said the Ayush ministry guidelines should also be followed in making one’s diet robust. “We consume turmeric (haldi) with milk for immunity. But, the secret is that we must also add a pinch of black pepper powder to it for better absorption of the medicinal value of the turmeric. Peperin in black pepper helps body to absorb Curcumin in the turmeric which is useful,” she said, adding curd each day is good for gut health, and eggs, chicken and mutton soups are more nutritious than their gravies. Another nutritionist Kavita Gupta said one should shun high fat, sugar and salt in their diets which is represented by HFSS. “Fruits, sprouts, pulses, legumes, green leafy vegetables, fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables are must in one’s diets along with lean meats and eggs. Nuts and oilseeds too are important,” she said and added that children must be given Chikki, Makhana chana, Mungfalli instead of chips and such types of junk foods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rainbow-diet-suggested-to-fight-3rd-wave/articleshow/84102780.cms||Soumitra Bose

The recently married couple, both working professionals, will be away from the city for just three days. “We got married a few months ago and the restrictions due to the second wave didn’t give us a chance to travel anywhere. Even now, we don’t want to go on a long vacation. There are chances that restrictions may be imposed again and we may get stuck. Hence, we decided to take a three-day break at a location that isn’t very far from the city,” said Deepak. Short trips to places near Pune and Mumbai are in great demand, with those involved in the travel business looking at almost 12 to 13 inquiries each day and almost as many confirmations. According to travel agents, rather than taking a long break to a place like Goa or Rajasthan, many people were opting for shorter trips for not more than three to four days, to places near the city so that they could be back homes in case another set of strict restrictions are announced. “While people want to travel, they are looking at locations near Pune and Mumbai. We are seeing many queries from people to go to places like Maval, Bhor, Mulshi, Lonavala, Khandala, Velhe, etc. They want to stay there for two to three days maximum. Hotels at these places are seeing a lot of traffic presently. We are looking at 12 to 13 bookings daily on an average,” said Nilesh Bhansali, director of Travel Agents Association of Pune. Another travel agent said that with monsoons underway, the hilly areas have become popular destinations. “Presently, you don’t require an e-pass or an RT-PCR report to travel within Maharashtra. However, with regulations changing very frequently, people don’t want to go on long trips and risk getting stuck. The number of inquiries and bookings have increased,” he said. A representative of Hotel Metropark in Lonavla said that apart from 100% reservations on weekends, weekdays are seeing almost 40% bookings. “During weekends, the hotel is fully booked. However, on weekdays, there are walk-ins as well as planned bookings,” the representative added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vacationers-in-need-of-a-break-scour-for-short-term-getaways-nearby/articleshow/84102736.cms||Joy Sengupta

Union minister of state for home Affairs G Kishan Reddy on Saturday said the Centre had sanctioned two testing laboratories — one at National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad under the department of biotechnology, another at National Centre for Cell Science, Pune. As of now, there are two vaccine testing labs in the country, one at Central Drug Laboratory, Kasauli, and the other one at National Institute of Biologicals, Noida. “Funds have been released from PM CARES on March 6 for setting up VTTs at two more places — Hyderabad and Pune. The commencement of operations of the VTT at Hyderabad is expected in the next one month,” Kishan Reddy said. Telangana industries minister KT Rama Rao wrote three letters to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan seeking a lab for Hyderabad. Rama Rao wrote to Harsh Vardhan in August 2020 and January and June 2021 requesting the Centre to establish a testing lab on a war footing. KTR, in his letters, said Hyderabad has emerged as the vaccination capital of the world as one-third of global vaccine supply was produced in the city. The minister even suggested that VTT could be set up at National Animal Resources Facility for Bio-medical Research at Genome Valley in Shamirpet. Incidentally, the Union health minister did not respond to KTR’s letters, but Kishan Reddy claimed the decision was taken in March 2021 itself and funds were released immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-gets-vaccine-testing-lab-to-be-ready-in-aug-kishan/articleshow/84104759.cms||Koride Mahesh

The body of the victim — Anant Gulab Gujar (44) of Akurdi — was found near the New Katraj tunnel late on Friday. “One of the arrested four persons is a woman named Saroj, Gujar’s wife. The other three are Ramesh Vilas Kumbhar alias Maharaj, Yash Nikam and Amol Badgam, all residents of Akurdi,” inspector Jagannat Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said. Kalaskar added, “Saroj had an extra-marital affair with Kumbhar alias Maharaj. The duo wished to be together and decided to eliminate the victim. They wanted to make the murder look like an accident so that Saroj could inherit Anant’s property.” The victim was currently unemployed but earlier used to run an office of a cellular company, which he shut down a few months ago. He had substancial assets in real estate. Kalaskar said, “The post mortem report and circumstantial evidence revealed that it was a murder and not a road accident. The victim was assaulted with a heavy blunt object in the head, leading to his death.” After assaulting the victim, the suspects put his body in an SUV car and dumped it in the Katraj ghat section. “Two of the suspects bought his scooter to the spot. They tried to arrange the body and the scooter to make it look like an accident. However, errors committed by them in doing so led us to their arrests,” Kalaskar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-held-for-murdering-a-44-year-old-man/articleshow/84102811.cms||---

With this, the BJP has kicked-off its move to reach out to maximum people in wards. Congratulating everyone on the appointment of all the newly-nominated Mandal presidents, Chandigarh BJP president Arun Sood said present nominations have been made according to the organisational structure of the new municipal wards of the city. BJP, which currently rules Chandigarh MC, wants to maintain its hold on the civic body authority. For this, the party has been trying to resolve maximum issues during MC meetings. On the other hand, the Congress has also been intensifying efforts to corner the BJP over prominent issues. In the past, Congress constantly organised multiple agitations and protests against the BJP over issues of hike in water tariff. Since the hiked charges were rolled back recently, this issue has become irrelevant.

This is to fight antimicrobial resistance that has become a major health nuisance with disease-causing bacteria and fungi turning intelligent to emerge as superbugs. This Covid-19 season has only hastened the revival of forgotten drugs to treat bacterial and fungal infections. Drugs used way back in 1940s are now being prescribed to attack the modern superbugs with the old medical bullets. Since the present-day germs are not accustomed to old antibiotics, they become susceptible and die. “Forgotten formulations have now emerged as modern saviours. The experiment with old antibiotics to beat antimicrobial resistance is paying rich dividends,” said Dr P Ranganadham, neurosurgeon, Sunshine Hospital, Gachibowli. He said from the times of penicillin, discovered in 1928, there have been numerous drugs that saved the humanity. But, overuse or abuse of these drugs led to antimicrobial resistance forcing doctors to search for new medicines. Even third and fourth generation antibiotics are not responding in certain cases. Stating that the antibiotics of the olden days come cheap and time-tested, Dr Ranganadham, who has seen evolution of drugs in the last four decades, told TOI that since some of these forgotten antibiotics like colistin and clindamycin could also develop horizontal spread of resistance, doctors should think of a combination therapy. “This has been proved in tackling AIDS and tuberculosis,” Dr Ranganadham said. According to Dr Shyamala Iyengar, senior consultant, internal medicine, Apollo Hospitals, Hyderguda, India has one of the highest rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents. “One of the strategies to overcome this is to use outmoded antibiotics like trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole for methicillin-resistant ‘Staphylococcus aureus’. For drug resistant gram-negative organisms, use of older antibiotics like polymeguin B has become a part of standard protocol,” Dr Shyamala said. Dr Gopi Krishna Yedlapati, consultant interventional pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospitals, said with all the third and fourth generation nano antibiotics development, new drug-resistant bugs are emerging. “With the ongoing pandemic, we have seen that some of the old and cheap antibiotics have contributed to helping sick patients come out of their plight of sepsis. They have saved innumerable lives,” Dr Gopi Krishna said. “Older and simpler antibiotics may have a crucial role in modern medicine,” said Dr J Anish Anand, consultant, internal medicine, Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills. “But it is more important not to use antibiotics for every fever or infection as antibiotics work only for bacterial infections and then only some. And, infections can be viral where antibiotics don’t work,” Dr Anish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forgotten-medicines-back-in-circulation-this-covid-season/articleshow/84100800.cms||Syed Akbar

On June 24, Vanasthalipuram police received a complaint from one Dhanavath Bujji claiming that her 21-year-old daughter Ramavath Kavitha’s death on June 18 might not be natural. Kavitha’s husband Ramavath Vijay informed her parents that she died of Covid-19. However, the family members grew suspicious when Vijay asked them not to touch his wife’s body. Despite that, her mother and a few other relatives wailed over her body. “The persons who touched Kavitha’s body did not get the infection, leading to suspicion. Her mother lodged a complaint,’’ Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said. Police said Kavitha’s body was exhumed and a post-mortem examination was performed. Meanwhile, police, during the investigation, came to know that the victim had tested negative for Covid-19 a week before she was murdered. On intense grilling, Vijay reportedly spilled the beans that Kavitha did not die of Covid-19, but he smothered her to death. “He smothered her to death with a pillow while she was asleep. Later, he shifted the body into his auto rickshaw, took it to his native place Nalgonda and completed the final rites burying it. He informed her family members that she died of coronavirus,” police said. When questioned about the motive behind the murder, Vijay reportedly said he suspected her character and killed her. He was arrested on Saturday and produced before a magistrate. In June, a 27-year-old software professional’s charred body was discovered in a remote place in Tirupati. Later, police arrested her husband for murder. He even tried to fool her relatives and neighbours by saying his wife had died of coronavirus and hospital authorities had cremated the body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/auto-driver-kills-wife-fakes-it-as-covid-death/articleshow/84104813.cms||---

The rural and Cantonment areas added more than 651 new patients, while the PMC and PCMC limits’ daily caseload increased by 344 and 392, respectively. Saturday was the fourth consecutive day for the region to record more daily infections than recoveries. A report released by the district health officer, Bhagwan Pawar, stated that among 1,345 patients recovered on Saturday, the highest number of discharges (647) came from the rural and Cantonment areas, followed by the PCMC limits (415) and the PMC areas (283). The tally of recoveries in PMR has increased to 10.26 lakh, while positive caseload has reached 10.54 lakh. The region’s active caseload increased to 10,309 in the last 24 hours. As many as 5,806 patients were being treated at various hospitals, while 4,503 were in home isolation. Daily death count of the region further dropped to 12 on Saturday, least since March 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmr-records-more-fresh-cases-than-recoveries-12-more-dead/articleshow/84111937.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Pune||Pune: Finally, efforts to connect Covid hospitals gain pace||PUNE: The district administration is gearing up to connect public and private Covid hospitals through an internationally recognized software framework for real-time tracking and sharing of data among themselves. The move follows the Bombay HC slamming PMC recently over its claim of efficient services relating to bed management for Covid-19 through the dashboard. “A meeting in this regard was held at the divisional commissioner’s office last week, in which it was decided to connect a few hospitals (with EMR) initially through HL7 to see how the system works,” said medical informatics expert Rajeev Joshi, who is advising the district administration in bracing the dashboard via the HL7. Health Level 7 or HL7 is essentially a set of standards (messaging formats) for the transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications being used by healthcare providers. Hospitals do not need to change their software to use HL7, they just need to add this free feature. An official from the divisional commissioner’s office said, “We aim to connect all Covid hospitals if the pilot is successful.” Currently, healthcare units have software not compatible with each other. This has led to islands of data that are not shareable. “Covid hospitals in the city need to increase connectivity among themselves so that patients, as well as bed availability data, are tracked in real-time without any lag. We have suggested hospitals to use the HL7 framework,” said Manisha Naik, PMC’s nodal officer for Covid bed management. The National Digital Health Blueprint of India, released in November 2019, had recommended HL7 as the de facto standard for healthcare interoperability in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/finally-efforts-to-connect-covid-hospitals-gain-pace/articleshow/84102766.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Multiple factors led to the exit of Tirath Singh Rawat||DEHRADUN: Although Tirath Singh Rawat tendered his resignation ostensibly to ward off a constitutional crisis since there was difficulty in him getting elected through a bypoll, sources say there were other factors which may have led to his exit. The spate of controversial remarks given by him soon after taking over had made many in the party uncomfortable. Also, the Kumbh testing scam had proved to be an embarrassment. Many in the party also felt he was “too simple” and not politically savvy enough to manage the ambitions of MLAs within the party and lead it successfully in the forthcoming polls, as per sources “Tirath Singh Rawat is a simple person and during his short tenure, did not show the skills required to handle the bureaucracy or the party cadre,” said Doon-based political analyst Jay Singh Rawat. “The controversial statements made soon after taking over, whether it was on women’s ripped jeans or equating Modi with god did not go down well with many. Also, it seems that the party was not fully convinced that going into elections under his leadership was a safe bet,” he added. Further, sources said that the indecision regarding finalising a seat for the bypoll well in time cost Tirath dearly. “Had he contested the bypoll in Salt, the present problem would never have arisen. His political advisors failed to alert him about the provisions of the Representation of People Act and the ramifications it could have. That was a grave mistake,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/multiple-factors-led-to-the-exit-of-tirath-singh-rawat/articleshow/84100788.cms||Kautilya Singh

For, the city has recorded zero deaths due to Covid-19 in the past seven days for the first time since March. Since June 27 no deaths have been recorded in the city. However, health officials claim that till the number of positive cases does not come down to zero, people should strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. On March 12, city had reported the first death due to Covid-19 in the second wave and the number escalated to shocking heights since then. During the same month highest four deaths in a day were recorded. It reached the peak of 28 deaths on April 19, as per the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) records. In month of May, the highest 18 deaths were reported on May 18 while in June highest two deaths were reported on June 1. In April, total 529 deaths were recorded by the SMC due to Covid-19. However, as per the civic body’s records total 4,795 deaths were registered during April. SMC officials claimed that the deaths were high due to Covid and also because of high number of patients from outside the city were admitted in city’s hospitals. After the peak in April, the number of cases and deaths started to decline gradually and in June one death was recorded on most days with a few days registering nil. Since March 1, more than 50 positive cases were reported per day during of second wave, which peaked to 2,321 cases on April 24. The per day cases too came down to less than 20 in last week of June. “The number of cases will not come down to single digit in current situation as the disease has not come under complete control yet. The cases have decreased and no death has been reported for past one week but people need to be careful and follow Covid appropriate behaviour strictly,” said an official in health department. SMC officials claim that various preventive steps are resulting into keeping the number of cases under control. “We are conducting 16,000 tests daily and also surveillance at entry points in city is on to ensure that the cases remain under control. People are also following Covid rules and situation is likely to remain under control,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-zeroes-in-on-good-news-seven-days-0-death/articleshow/84100830.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The combined reserve price of all furniture lots, including desk and chair, was between Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore. These furniture items were designed by Pierre Jeanneret, the cousin of city’s creator French architect Le Corbusier, according to auction house website. It was the 12th such auction of 2021. On June 23, a Belgium-based auction house had sold four heritage furniture items for Rs 1.01 crore. To stop the auction, Ajay Jagga, a member of Heritage Protection Cell, had written a letter to the Union minister for external affairs to look into the matter. The UT administration had prepared an inventory of as many as “12,793 heritage items” belonging to Chandigarh. The entities, including furniture, tapestry, drawings and other objects, which were designed, made and used by Le Corbusier, his cousin Pierre Jeanneret and others associated with the founding and planning of Chandigarh in the 1950s and 60s, come under the category of heritage items. Chandigarh has 12,793 heritage items designed by Corbusier or his team associated with the founding and planning of the city in 1950s and 60s. As per the report, there are 190 different categories of the heritage items, including drawings, murals, models, tapestries, chairs and tables among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-takers-for-citys-heritage-furniture-in-france/articleshow/84100809.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Reshma of Kalluvathukkal left her baby in a secluded area near her house soon after delivery for eloping with her new partner who had befriended her through Facebook but investigations have revealed that the partner never existed and that Reshma’s friends had created a fake FB profile to play a prank on her. The baby had passed away hours after it was found and rushed to a hospital. Reshma was arrested on June 22, and after a few days, the two relatives went missing and later their bodies were found in Ithikkara river. They had gone missing after they received a summons from police. Police said Reshma’s relatives Arya and Greeshma were playing a prank on Reshma using a fake ID. A male friend of Greeshma is also being questioned in connection with the case. Police said as Reshma’s husband Vishnu was against Reshma spending most of her time on social media, she was using a SIM card issued in a relative’s name. It was in the toilet outside her house that Reshma delivered the baby. She had managed to hide her pregnancy from her family members and even her husband. Though police investigations into the baby’s death led to Reshma’s arrest, they were in the dark over her so-called lover. But after the bodies of her two relatives were found in the river the investigators began to have doubts about the very existence of Reshma’s lover. Reshma had also told the police that she had never seen him though she went to Varkala and some other places after receiving messages from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-identify-mothers-lover/articleshow/84104853.cms||---

These new programmes would be introduced from the upcoming new academic session 2021-22. This is being done as the varsity’s commitment to comply with the new National Education Policy (NEP)-2020 and following the directives of the state government. Vice-chancellor of the state university, Prof AK Singh said, “As per plans, there will be a total of four such integrated programmes, including three in Arts faculty and one in Commerce faculty. The aim of these programmes is to shape the future of our students in such a way that they are trained for skill and entrepreneurship development besides getting prepared for competitive exams.” Public relation officer (PRO) of the state university, Dr Avinash Srivastava said, “After taking admission, a student will get certificate, diploma, degree, degree (research) which would depend upon the number of years he pursues in a given course and will be awarded PG degree after completing the entire course. There will be multiple exit and entry points and the syllabus will be based on choice-based credit system (CBCS) and semester system.” “In this integrated programme, a student will opt three major subjects, one may be from a different faculty also. In the first two years (4 semesters) and fourth year, the student will also opt for one minor subject which will be from a different department or faculty. Students will have to also opt one vocational course in the first fourth semester,” the VC said. In the first 6 semesters, there will be one co-curricular course in every semester, he added. These new age courses will be based on a credit system with evaluation of up to 25% being internal and other 75% by university. One semester will be of 23-25 credit and one year credit will be from 46-50. These courses will have a grading system. The VC said that the university will now also start the CBCS system in PG courses, which are presently running in 11 subjects, including geography, sociology, economics, defence, hindi, sanskrit, philosophy, ancient history, political science, strategic studies and social work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/prsu-to-launch-5-yr-integrated-programmes-in-arts-commerce/articleshow/84106648.cms||---

She said WHO was actively tracking all variants of SARS-CoV-2. She said, “It is important not to panic over any new virus mutation, which is an expected evolution of the virus. The Delta variant is one of concern because it is more transmissible than any of the other strains we have identified to date. We are tracking all variants, worldwide, to understand whether their characteristics are changing their ‘behaviour’ — whether they cause more severe disease, are more contagious (transmissible) and whether or not they are developing the ability to evade the vaccines we have.” She added, “The good news is that, to date, all the Covid-19 vaccines are proving effective at preventing severe disease and death in people, even where the variants are dominant.” Dr Swaminathan said the WHO is not using the term ‘Delta-plus’, which the Indian government had recently said is a ‘Variant of Concern’. “We are not using the term ‘Delta plus’. It is the Variant of Concern ‘Delta’ with an additional spike mutation. The WHO is tracking this variant (Delta-plus) as part of the Delta variant, as we are doing for other VOCs with additional mutations,” she said. Dr Swaminathan said that at present, the Delta-plus does not seem to be very common, currently accounting for only a small fraction of the Delta sequences uploaded to Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID). As for disease controls, the WHO expert said that India’s plans to tackle Delta-plus should be focused on good genomic surveillance, including ward-level sequencing. “We need good genomic surveillance and strategic sequencing at all levels so that we know which variants are increasing in the population in different parts of the country. India is a huge and diverse country so we need to understand well what is happening at the local level,” Dr Swaminathan said. She had recently stressed on the importance of genetic sequencing. “It helps us track the mutation itself. We know there are certain parts of the virus which are more critical like the spike protein and the receptor binding domain that are also the target for vaccines. So if major mutations occur in these domains, it might actually affect the development of vaccines,” Dr Swaminathan said during a recent WHO news conference. She added that because vaccines stimulate a broad immune response against the virus (that includes both antibodies and T cell responses), it was unlikely that single mutations could completely abrogate that response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/coronavirus-mutations-should-not-cause-panic-who-chief-scientist/articleshow/84102825.cms||Neha Madaan

Also, Covaxin is 93.4% effective against severe symptomatic Covid-19 disease and offers 63.6% protection against asymptomatic Covid-19, Bharat Biotech said revealing the final analysis of phase III trials that were conducted on 25,800 participants aged between 18 and 98 years pan-India. The vaccine also showed a higher efficacy of 79.4% in those aged below 60 years as compared to 67.8% in those aged 60 years and above. The results were published in preprint server MedRxiv, which publishes research work before it is peer reviewed. The company said the overall efficacy of 77.8% was arrived at after 130 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported among the trial participants, which included 24 participants who got both doses of Covaxin and 106 volunteers who received placebo shots. Pointing out that Covaxin was well-tolerated with no cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths being reported, it said: “The overall rate of adverse events observed in Covaxin was lower than that seen in other Covid-19 vaccines. Safety analysis demonstrates adverse events reported were similar to placebo, with 12% of subjects experiencing commonly known side effects and less than 0.5% subjects feeling serious adverse events." Bharat Biotech also said Covaxin was the first to report promising efficacy against asymptomatic infections based on qPCR testing, which will help in reducing disease transmission. “No licensed SARSCoV-2 vaccine has reported efficacy against asymptomatic infection in a randomised controlled trial based on qPCR testing,” it said. “The successful safety and efficacy readouts of Covaxin establish the ability of India and developing world countries to focus on innovation and novel product development. We are proud to state that innovation from India will now be available to protect global populations,” Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella, adding that Covaxin has been specifically designed to meet the needs of global distribution chains. Calling Covaxin an “effective vaccine of the highest international standards”, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr Balram Bhargava said its successful development has consolidated the position of Indian academia and industry in the global arena. Terming the Covaxin development journey as "exhilarating", Dr Priya Abraham, director, National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, said: “The making of this vaccine entirely on Indian soil is a matter of great pride to every Indian.” According to Dr Bhargava, who is also secretary of the department of health research, Covaxin would not only benefit Indian citizens but would also help protect the global community as it works well against all variants of the virus. Covaxin has been evaluated against several variants of concern through neutralizing antibody responses, with data being published in peer-reviewed journals, added Dr Abraham. These variants include B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P2-B.1.1.28 (Gamma). ICMR & NIV collaborated with the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker in the development of the inactivated virus vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-overall-efficacy-at-77-8-bharat-biotech/articleshow/84100813.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

At the state-run ENT Hospital alone, 20 such cases have been recorded so far. However, with cases of Covid-19 coming down substantially, cases of mucormycosis too have come down drastically with just 7 to 10 cases being reported per day at each of the nodal centres in the city. Recurrence in cases is being reported over a month after treatment and is being seen in patients who were already operated upon and have been on medication. The recurrence is being seen after switching medicines or stopping the antifungal injection liposomal Amphotericin B. “It could be that the medications were not adequate or there was some residual infection left, due to inadequate debridement. We are seeing patients who were operated upon elsewhere and on treatment but later ran out of finances. Such patients are coming with recurrence of the infection. Each day we are seeing 3 to 4 such cases in those who were operated outside,” said Dr T Shankar, superintendent, Government ENT Hospital. While several instances of patients running out of finances while under treatment at private hospitals has been reported in the last two months, cases of patients not being able to find the Amphotericin B injections could also be the reason behind inadequate intake of the medicine. “My uncle got a sinus debridement surgery in the month of May and was put on antifungal injections for a month. We required 45 injections in total but were not able to get them in the initial days when there was a huge shortage. Later, the medication was changed to Posaconazole injection and we were able to complete the course but around 10 days ago, similar pain in the face reappeared,” said Shaik Mustafa, the nephew of a patient who had to go back for a repeat surgery.

"We have introduced more channels and smarter solutions for retailers to get better insights about their customers and have also incorporated more facilities. The platform will also provide a free trial to retailers so that they can experience it first, and then engage with us," said Prit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fresh-funds-fuel-city-firms-global-dreams/articleshow/84102881.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government takes back 1,960 acres land from 65 firms||HYDERABAD: Cracking the whip on 65 industries for not setting up their units even after land was allotted for free many years ago, the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) has taken back 1,960 acres from them. The government now wants to reallocate the resumed land to industrialists who are ready to set up their units. The area of the resumed land ranges from one acre to 250 acres. Most of the land resumed was in the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) limits such as Fab City SEZ at Raviryala, Hardware Park at Mamidipally, IT Park in Nanakramguda, Automotive Park, IDA Nacharam, Pashamylaram, Patancheru, Biotech Park at Karkapatla, Adibatla SEZ and IT Park, Madikonda in Warangal. Officials said action was taken against a unit which was given prime land at Raviryal near Shamshabad airport by then AP government in 2007. Some of the firms have even approached the court against the TSIIC for cancelling the land allotment. Industries minister KT Rama Rao, a few months ago, had directed the TSIIC to review allotment of land to the industrialists — case by case — and take back the unutilised land. While 27,000 acres of land was allotted since inception of the industrial corporation in 1973 to till formation of Telangana in 2014, about 5,000 acres was allotted in the last five years since 2016. “Some 35,000 acres of industrial land is under development in various parts of Hyderabad. Allotment has begun in some areas, while development of infrastructure is in progress,” a TSIIC official said. In fact, the TSIIC set up an allotment tracking cell to see that the industries kick-start their operations after land allotment within two years unless there is any major problem. Officials recalled that when AP was united, there was no tracking system as some the industries did not start any operations even 10 years after the land was allotted for free to them. “Such cases are being dealt with seriously. We are adopting a two-pronged strategy for industrial development as the state has been receiving huge investments and there is a great demand for land. The government wants to ensure the allottees (industrialists) start operations and provide employment. Secondly, if they fail to take up any work, the government will not hesitate to resume the land and reallot it for those who are in need of it,” a senior TSIIC official told TOI. With TSIIC keenly tracking the progress of industrial units after the land allotment, several beneficiaries have started approaching the corporation for extension of time, citing the pandemic. Officials said they received nearly 200 applications in the past few months for extension of time for one to two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-takes-back-1960-acres-land-from-65-firms/articleshow/84104877.cms||Koride Mahesh

A 14-month-old girl abducted by her father from her Bhayander home on Thursday was rescued from Igatpuri in Nashik within six hours. The child resides with her mother in Bhayander (E). On July 1, the father came to see his daughter and took her away while the mother was in the kitchen. She registered a kidnapping case with Navghar police. The woman told police she was estranged from her husband, who may be heading to their native town in West Bengal with the baby. Police launched a search for the father at railway stations and tracked him down to Igatpuri. He had boarded a train to WB. The baby was handed over to the mother, while the father was booked for abduction. A one-year-old girl, abducted by a 30-year-old man from Shelar village in Bhiwandi, was traced by police within five hours and the kidnapper was arrested. Diplal Rai is a helper at a powerloom unit. Police said she was abducted from her home when her mother stepped out to answer nature’s call and her father was asleep. Senior inspector Ram Balsingh said, “When the parent did not find the child at home they searched the area and later approached us.” He said they found her abandoned near a temple. Police later reunited the child with her parents and are probing why Rai abducted the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-babies-abducted-rescued-within-hrs/articleshow/84106674.cms||Sandhya Nair

It was in July 1996 that a kidney was transplanted in a patient from a cadaver. Only two cities — Chennai and Delhi — had the facility then. Dr KS Nayak, senior organ transplant specialist, who conducted the first organ transplant in Hyderabad, recalled that it was a Herculean task to obtain the necessary permissions from the government to conduct organ transplant as there were no guidelines in those days. “We have completed 25 years of first cadaver organ transplantation in the undivided Andhra Pradesh in 1996. It was among the first three done in India and our efforts paved the way for the formation of Jeevandan subsequently,” Dr Nayak, who is currently associated with Virinchi Hospitals, said. He said there were no proper guidelines to define brain death during that period. Special permissions were obtained from the director of medical education, police and authorities concerned to proceed with the pathbreaking surgery. Two kidneys from a braindead donor were successfully transplanted into two patients with end stage kidney failure. Later, within a year, two more such transplants were done by Dr Nayak and his team leading to awareness among the public. The government streamlined the process and came up with the Human Organ Transplantation Act. Hyderabad has also the distinction of India’s first simultaneous heart and kidney transplantation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-celebrates-25-years-of-first-organ-transplant/articleshow/84100839.cms||---

The hospital was converted into the nodal centre along with Gandhi Hospital in May when a surge in mucormycosis cases was seen. So far, over 2,500 cases have been reported in the state, estimate state health authorities. Currently, the number of cases has, however, come down from 50 new admissions per day to barely 3-4 at ENT Hospital. With the conversion of the hospital to the nodal centre, out-patient as well as in-patient services were put on hold. The hospital authorities are planning to start regular ENT services. “We might be starting the regular services in the next few days as the mucormycosis load has come down and the number of surgeries required can be managed with one operation theatre, while the rest can be dedicated to regular surgeries,” said Dr Manish Gupta, ENT surgeon and associate professor, Government ENT Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ent-hosp-to-resume-regular-services-soon/articleshow/84100826.cms||---
---||Chennai||Rooting for a boxing centre, rail terminal at Royapuram||A bustling coastal constituency that is home to the nation’s second oldest railway station, Royapuram is one of the oldest assembly segments in Chennai. Thickly populated and home to a shopping hub, Royapuram’s main civic woes are narrow roads and lack of leisure spots. In an interview, the newly elected DMK MLA from Royapuram assembly constituency Idream R Murthy tells Yogesh Kabirdoss about his plans to get a leg up for basic amenities in the area. Q: What are your plans to resolve the traffic issues in Royapuram?If you travel from Royapuram towards Parry’s, there will be free flow of traffic due to a wider bridge that runs parallel to the Harbour, the bottleneck is the century-old bridge that connects Parry’s with Royapuram. We are looking at the possibility of constructing a broader railway over bridge replacing the old one to ease traffic congestion. A rail underpass at Bojarajan Nagar for the benefit of 10,000 people is also being explored. It will be taken up with the railways ministry through the Chennai north Lok Sabha member.Q: North Chennai, particularly Royapuram, lacks entertainment and sports facilities. How do you propose to address that issue?Royapuram was once a boxing hub of Chennai. We are planning to establish three state-of-the-art boxing coaching centres – one each for every two wards -- and use veteran coaches of Royapuram to train budding boxers. Indoor games such as carrom board and table tennis courts are also on the cards. This apart, the iconic Arignar Anna Park would get a facelift akin to Natesan Park in T Nagar. We will invite views of the walkers’ association and discuss with the Greater Chennai Corporation on what kind of facilities can be provided.Q: The textile hub of M C Road in Old Washermenpet does business on a par with T Nagar? But it is hit by traffic snarls and absence of parking lots for visitors? I agree. People cannot enter the road during festivals, as heavy crowds throng M C Road for shopping. A multilevel parking facility would be established in the locality. We need to discuss with the corporation whether it would be exclusively for four wheelers or could it accommodate two-wheelers too. A land parcel has already been identified for the purpose.Q:Royapuram is the second oldest railway station in the country? Any plans to revive the terminal proposal? Royapuram is best suited in north Chennai to create the fourth terminal, as it is easily accessible. It is one station from Beach railway station, having 63 acres of land and already has platforms to station long-distance express trains.Q: Your vision for the area? A food processing unit for fisheries is the need of the hour. About 20 acres of land parcel is available for setting up the facility, which will take care of micro-economy of about 2,000 people at Royapuram and its neighbourhood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rooting-for-a-boxing-centre-rail-terminal-at-royapuram/articleshow/84106653.cms||---

On July 1, the order for transferring 18 doctors between the departments in various medical colleges were issued. This order has come based on the KAT directive. A doctor with an MBBS degree join as assistant professor (lecturer) in any of the specialties and then secures post graduation (PG) in another discipline. This doctor then seeks a transfer to the new specialty where he or she has secured PG. Such doctors are given inter-department transfers. However, various associations in the medical education service are protesting against such transfers. They term it as irrational and it is a backdoor entry of doctors into several departments when there is existing PSC list. The doctors are of the opinion that for the entry cadre post graduation in a specialty should be made essential. Then this issue can be resolved. “These people are in fact losing the opportunity of the people who are waiting in the PSC list. Many departments have lost their posts due to such transfers. It is illegal and irrational doing inter-department transfers,’’ said Dr Ajith Prasad of Kerala post graduate medical college teachers’ association. The doctors claim that there were instances of doctors joining in different specialties when there are no vacancies in their respective disciplines. “These doctors seek for inter-department transfer later, which denies the opportunity of a deserved person in the PSC list. At times, even the reservation seats are filled through such appointments,’’ said a leader of Kerala government medical college teachers’ association (KGMCTA). In the latest order, the doctors who have joined in the lecture post of departments like anatomy, microbiology, neurology, general medicine, biochemistry, neuro surgery, anesthesia, pathology and general surgery have been transferred into other departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/inter-dept-transfer-of-doctors-faces-flak/articleshow/84104916.cms||---

Since the rule permits sale of only 14, 18 and 22 karat gold, such restriction is violative of Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution, the petitioner said.“The real objective of Indian standards is to ensure that a gold ornament sold as of 22 karat is of 22 karat. It can never prohibit selling gold which is more or less pure than 22 karat,” the petitioner said.Asserting that there cannot be any prohibition of better quality of goods, the association contended that the authorities have made a wrong interpretation of the statutory provisions.It added that the members of the petitioner association have fundamental right to carry out any business under the Constitution. There can be only reasonable restrictions against such rights. Moreover, it cannot be in the interest of the public to deny the right to purchase a better quality of gold.This apart, the petitioner also claimed that the infrastructure available in the country for hallmarking jewellery is woefully inadequate as there are more than 5 lakh jewellers in the country and in an average 1,000 crore pieces of jewellery need to be hallmarked. When the plea came up for hearing, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed the Union government to file its response by July 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/jewellers-move-hc-against-compulsory-hallmarking-rule/articleshow/84106675.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Ashok Nagar road under repair for 6 months||CHENNAI: Six months on and motorists travelling on Ashok Pillar Road continue to find it difficult to reach their destination as a part of the road, opposite the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board office, is dug to repair sewage pipeline. An official from the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board said, “The work was delayed due to the Covid-19, but we are nearing completion. However, it will take one month to complete.” Butresidents and motorists are losing patience. They claim that everyday travel or even taking a walk on the road has become difficult. A resident of the area Jaya Naidoo said, “If you notice, the dugout part occupies almost half the road and it is risky to walk here as vehicles are moving. The pavements too are damaged. There is no place for us to walk.” “This road is congested in the morning as many come to buy groceries and vegetables from the stores here. And this point of entry leads directly to Ashok Pillar, but due to the repair vehicles come from all sides and causes a jam,” said T K Sivan, an auto driver. To avoid traffic many were forced to take the other route via P T Rajan Road, which is longer, he added. “They had cordoned off this entire stretch for repair during the complete lockdown. We thought the work would be completed, but now they have opened the road and it’s getting chaotic,” said Sivan. “This road connects to the 100 feet road and is highly used by commuters. The officials should have completed the work during the complete lockdown,” said Manickam V, a resident of Lakshmanaswamy Salai. Motorists opined that a few two-wheelers had also skid while trying to cross the first street to reach the main road. “It’s risky. They should either block entry from this point or finish the repair work at the earliest. The number of such incidents might only increase if it is left like this,” he said. However, officials from metro water said the work might take close to a month’s time. “The pipe was laid more than 30 years ago and required urgent replacement. We have replaced the cement pipe with a cast-iron one. Hence it’s taking time. But we will address all grievances and take steps,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pending-road-repair-work-in-ashok-nagar-irk-residents-commuters/articleshow/84106672.cms||---

On remedial measures in place, he said that with the imposition of power regulatory measures on industrial consumers, there has been no power cut in areas under the Mohali division. Power supply in rapidly developing areas such as Nayagaon, Kansal etc has significantly improved owing to work of augmentation of transformers and bifurcation of feeders, he said. Besides, damaged transformers are being augmented before being replaced and replacement activity is being carried out in a few hours, he said. Damaged cables are also being replaced with higher sized cables to ensure uninterrupted power supply. Categorisation of feeders of Mullanpur and Seonk has also been upgraded on the pattern of Mohali city, ensuring that no power cuts are imposed. The spokesman pointed out that many residents have got ACs installed but do not have them regularised. He also said that PSPCL appealed to its consumers to declare proper load so that the system could be improved. Residents can register complaints on 1912, 9646115973.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cuts-due-to-technical-snag-pspcl-assures-adequate-supply/articleshow/84100844.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Local people need to be made stakeholders in conservation’||‘Wild by Nature’, the 150-page book penned by naturalist and ecologist Anirudh Chaoji (53), fondly called Ani Sir by many nature lovers whom he groomed through 18 years of running pugmarks (Pugmarks) and naturalist training courses, was recently released by Justice Sunil Shukre at the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court and PCCF (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar, who retired recently. Chaoji, who earlier worked with the Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) as an ecologist is presently chief naturalist with the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). Starting his career as a practicing landscaper to a Pugmarker to train people to pursue wildlife and adventure, Chaoji’s journey as a well-known naturalist is a long one. Apart from being a wildlife trainer, he is also a philatelist. An electronics graduate with a masters in marketing, he started with corporate jobs before changing track to adventure and wildlife as a career. TOI talks to him about his maiden venture.Excerpts...Q. How did you land up in such an offbeat field?A. My father was an Indian Air Force (IAF) officer. He never took us to movies and typical picnics. Our long weekends were spent in the old, dark bungalows and forest rest houses of Totladoh, Ranidoh, Navegaon, Nagzira and Tadoba. Passion for wildlife probably was in the genes. What I lacked in technical knowledge then was gained from the works of Salim Ali, Frederick Champion, George Schaller, AJT Johnson, Jim Corbett and Maruti Chitampalli. But the most important teachers have been the van majoors and forest field staff, some of my closest friends. And now, nature guides too.Q. What kind of a journey has it been?A. I started training the guides in 2000 informally. It was mainly with the intention of having a great pair of eyes with the support of field knowledge on the pugmarks and nature camps. I taught many guides from Nagzira, Navegaon, Melghat and Tadoba the art of communicating with the urban crowd. Today, they are the finest field naturalists. With former principal secretary (forest) Pravin Pardeshi’s support in 2010, I extended guide training to Bhimashankar, Kaas Plateau, Sahyadri and other places. When the initiative was taken to start community-based ecotourism in Tadoba, I got an opportunity to work with DyCF Gajendra Narwane and this was the turning point. Since then, over 500 youth from Tadoba buffer villages who were trained are today guides, drivers, activity personnel and employed in the tourism industry. Four years ago, I started a weekly training programme through social media for them all over Maharashtra in Marathi. Soon it was extended to my friends in English. Now it also goes out in Hindi and Odiya. Today, over 5,000 nature lover friends receive and further circulate these nature bytes. Friends like Jaydeep Das and Peeyush Sekhsaria gave the push needed to convert these bytes into the book.Q. What is so special about your book ‘Wild by Nature’?A. It took me four years to complete ‘Wild by Nature’. It started as an effort to hand-hold nature guides to provide their guests a good wildlife experience beyond tiger tourism. These guides predominantly belong to the Adivasi communities and are shy. The objective is to help them become good storytellers. The overall roadmap is to provide local youth with skills for non-extractive livelihoods. These will reduce their forest dependence and also probable conflicts with wildlife. The book will help create common man ambassadors of conservation. The 150 pages have interesting info bytes on birds, mammals, reptiles, aqua life, insects and environmental issues. The simple and non-technical language ensures that people are not put off by the excessive scientific terminologies. Besides, local beliefs and cultural connections help in relating to community understanding of issues. The intention of the book is not to make scientists but to make common people fall in love with the outdoors. It reminds people that there is so much to see and experience in a forest.Q. You must have motivated many to protect and conserve nature.A. Making people fall in love with nature and the outdoors has been my passion. But also inspiring many to follow education and careers in the field has been equally important. Many of these youngsters are taking their ‘wild’ passion to a logical end by learning in the country’s big institutes. I feel really happy to see young people like Pallavi Ghaskadbi collaring tigers and wild dogs. When I meet these youngsters, there is so much new learning for me.Q. There’s distrust despite hundreds of families benefiting from ecotourism. What’s the issue?A. A history of 5,000 years where people co-existed with their forests was suddenly altered by the British to lay a claim on the timber resources of the land. Ever-increasing people have been forcibly kept out of the forests. Maharashtra was fortunate in having forward-thinking officers who started getting local communities to benefit and partner in conservation. However, the distrust is almost 150 years old, since 1878, when reserved forests kept the communities out of their forests. Wiping it out in a decade or two is difficult. However, places like Tadoba are seeing different relationships between the department and the communities. Officials here have been instrumental in providing livelihoods to people in over 20 villages through 14 buffer safari gates. No other wildlife area in the entire country can boast of having 20 safari gates and over 12 other equally thrilling activities.Q. You have worked with the country’s biggest reserves and now you are with Tadoba. What are the challenges?A. While the process of jointly working towards conservation is happening at differing levels everywhere in Maharashtra, there are a few bad apples everywhere. Some set fires, others poach animals, few encroach upon forest land for agriculture, but these elements are in a minority. Most people are today seeing the benefits of conservation. Conservation cannot happen without the active participation of the forest neighbouring communities. This is a fact of life, the sooner people realize it, the better it is for the wilderness. Even tourism without communities is plain resort tourism and should not be confused with ecotourism as claimed.Q. What needs to be done for a peaceful co-existence?A. Local people need to be made stakeholders in conservation. Only when they too reap benefits, they will work to protect and conserve. Tadoba has shown that this can work in favour of conservation. Forest ministers, secretaries and officers from other states are regularly visiting Tadoba to study the model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/local-people-need-to-be-made-stakeholders-in-conservation/articleshow/84102909.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Put off release of films on OTT till October, exhibitors tell producers||HYDERABAD: The Telugu film industry is heading for a bitter battle with theatre owners crossing swords with producers who are opting to release films on OTT platforms without waiting for the theatres to open. The exhibitors have gone to the extent of warning the producers that they will be constrained to chalk out their own course of action if release of films on OTT platforms is not put off till October. “This could mean boycotting the films of such producers or stars who have acted in films that release on OTT,” a theatre exhibitor told STOI after a meeting of exhibitors was held here on Saturday. It may be mentioned here that though the Telangana government lifted the lockdown on June 20, theatre owners on their own have chosen not to screen films immediately. The exhibitors have decided to pursue with the government to issue necessary GOs on their long-pending demands which had been agreed upon. Some of these include waiver of electricity bills for the lockdown period for last year and this year, flexible ticket pricing and also increase and liberty to increase number of shows every day. According to sources, the exhibitors made attempts to have a meeting with cinematography minister T Srinivas Yadav but it did not work out. While the exhibitors will continue to pursue on their demands, the Telangana Film Chamber of Commerce feels there is a grave threat to theatres from OTT if producers choose to release their films on the platforms. “If theatres do not open by October, producers can opt for OTT release,” a member of Telangana Film Chamber of Commerce said. A general body meeting of the exhibitors will also be held at the Telugu Film Producers Council hall on July 7 on the issue. Ex-president of chamber of commerce M Vijendar Reddy also pointed out that it was natural for film producers to look for release of films simultaneously in both AP and Telangana. “Since lockdown has not been completely lifted in AP, there is also reason to wait for things to normalise there,” he said.

Urging the KRMB to conduct the meeting after July 20, Telangana also asked the board to include contentious issues like ‘illegal’ projects constructed by AP in the agenda for the meeting. The CM, who chaired a high-level meeting with chief secretary Somesh Kumar and special chief secretary (water resources) Rajat Kumar on Saturday, resolved to continue with hydel power generation at Srisailam, Jurala, Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala projects. Reminding the KRMB that there were no agreements between the two states on hydel power generation, KCR said: “This year onwards, Telangana will utilise 50 per cent of Krishna water(405.5 tmcft). Of the total 811 tmcft of water in Krishna, Telangana gets 299 tmcft and AP 512 tmcft. The meeting rejected the present 66:34 water sharing formula between AP and Telangana respectively. The CM said hydel power was required for the state for lifting of water from various irrigation projects and also drinking water schemes such as Mission Bhagiratha and to meet Hyderabad drinking water needs. The meeting also reminded the Centre’s circular to generate 51 per cent of clean energy as thermal power energy is leading to pollution. “It is ridiculous that AP is complaining to the KRMB on hydel power generation. The neighbouring state is constructing Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP) in the name of holding surveys,” the meeting said. The CM said the government would not compromise on the rights of Telangana people and farmers and will go to any length to fight the KRMB, tribunals and even the Centre. While stressing that both the RLIP and Pothireddypadu project on Krishna river were illegal, the meeting said Telangana would not recognise them as they were taken up without allocation of a single drop and without environmental clearances. “Despite a stay by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), works are taken up. These issues will be raised in the upcoming KRMB meeting,” officials said. Rejecting AP’s campaign that water is going waste into sea because of Telangana’s hydel power generation at Pulichintala, the meeting advised AP to utilise water from Prakasam barrage to meet requirements of Krishna basin districts and reduce costs of lifting Godavari water via Pattiseema project. The meeting also resolved to fill the tanks and lakes under Jurala left and right canals. The recently completed Samakka barrage and Sitamma Sagar projects would henceforth be called as irrigation and hydro-electrical projects. Meanwhile, the chief minister said that security deployment at Srisailam and other projects should continue and directed officials not to allow visitors, except TSGenco staff having ID cards at the project sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-will-use-50-of-krishna-water/articleshow/84104920.cms||Koride Mahesh

Teachers said that a few schools have not started online classes even for the high school students and are not using the services of teachers. “Since the last one-and-half year, I have no income. Even when the school conducted online classes during the last academic year, they did not call us. Even now, I have not received any communication from the management,” said Charanya R, a mathematics teacher, who used to get Rs 7000 as salary. Charanya said she is now completely dependent on her parents and added that the situation will not change unless schools start using the services of all teachers. They said that several schools are using apps instead of teachers to deliver online classes. “My management has tied up with an app to deliver online classes. They are not using services of even a single teacher and all are left to fend for themselves,” said Bhagya Lakshmi D, a Telugu teacher working in a private school. The private budget schools, meanwhile, said that about 3,000 to 4,000 schools are not in a position to use the services of even one teacher. “We don’t have any budget to pay teachers. Parents are unwilling to send their children for online classes. What are managements supposed to do? At least 4,000 schools have not asked their teachers to resume duties,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognised School Management Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-schools-using-app-for-online-classes-teachers-left-in-the-lurch/articleshow/84100869.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Police said five suspects were taken into custody on Saturday. On Friday evening, 10 persons went to the store of Mohammed Aril Aktani and seized wooden logs, which were earlier supplied by suspects, LB Nagar police said. Apart from the stock, the accused also took Mohammed Aril Aktani with them by forcing him into their car. “The suspects came to the store in a DCM and a car. After taking away the victim, he was abandoned at Medchal, where he was made to board a Nagpur-bound bus. The victim is a native of Nagpur,’’ LB Nagar inspector Ashok Reddy said. When the victim’s assistant brought the issue to the notice of police, they contacted him on the phone. Based on the details collected from him about the suspects, five persons were traced. The victim is on the way to the city. LB nagar police said they have registered a case on the charge of kidnap, and further investigation is under way in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bizman-abducted-for-payment-default-5-suspects-in-custody/articleshow/84104891.cms||---

Around 3.38 crore shots have been given in the state since January 16. In Mumbai too, daily vaccinations rose to 1.02 lakh after four days, including a day that BMC had no stocks to vaccinate people. The highest single-day turnout in Mumbai was 1.54 lakh on June 26. “Maharashtra once again saw a record high performance in corona vaccination campaign today. With 7,96,738 citizens vaccinated till 8pm, a new record was set. The number of vaccinations will go up to 8 lakh by the time final figures are released. This is the most vaccinations given in a single day,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health). Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state health minister Rajesh Tope lauded the record-breaking performance. Maharashtra has been at the helm of the country’s vaccination campaign, with the previous single-day high on June 26 of 7.38 lakh shots. No free vaccination drive will be held in Mumbai on Sunday, with only paid vaccination available at some private hospitals. Saturday’s huge turnout was possible because BMC had got fresh stocks of 1.25 lakh vaccines from the state. It vaccinated 63,306 people on Saturday, as against 35,446 vaccinated in the private sector. “We hope to carry out huge numbers on Monday, provided we get more vaccines,’’ said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-missing-vax-target-for-4-days-a-new-record-in-state/articleshow/84104922.cms||---

In a meeting held with the bankers on Saturday, chief secretary Somesh Kumar suggested proactive measures from the former towards increasing economic activities in the state for accelerated growth of the state’s economy. He also asked the bankers to organise loan ‘melas’, open counters in shopping malls, offer additional interest rebates on sales, simplify loan process and documentation, introduce new schemes for extending loans and fast-track decision making to boost consumption. Earlier, the chief secretary held discussions with stakeholders of retailers, shopping malls, tourist operators and hospitality sector in the state and sought their suggestions for revival of the economy.

This comes against the backdrop of the ongoing ED action as part of its probe into the alleged Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) scam. ED has attached the Rs 65-crore Jarandeshwar Co-operative Sugar Factory in Satara which is leased to a company related to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and his wife Sunetra. Patil, in the letter, claimed that the sugar factories were auctioned away at throwaway prices to relatives of the directors of the MSCB for wrongful profits. Most of these factories are run by MVA leaders. Recently, Patil had written to Shah demanding CBI action against Pawar and transport minister Anil Parab over the corruption allegations levelled against them by dismissed cop Sachin Waze. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/want-ed-probe-into-sugar-mills-sale-in-mumbai-bjp-to-shah/articleshow/84107083.cms||---

A Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) official said the safety teams have been alerted to inspect all the sites and provide safety nets for preventing construction material from falling on the roads. The contractors have also been told to carry out daily checks and train the workers in safety practices. A cement block recently fell on the road near the Metro’s Pimpri site, followed by a similar incident at Fugewadi. The contractors have been penalized in both cases. Metro work is going on the Pimpri-Shivajinagar-Swargate and the Vanaz-Karve Road-Civil Court-Pune Station-Ahmednagar Road stretches. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR) at MahaMetro said, “We have taken serious note of the recent incidents and instructed the contractors to be more alert. MahaMetro also has its safety team that inspects the work sites. The team has been told to conduct regular checks and step up the safety measures, especially on the elevated stretches so that the construction material do not fall on roads.” Another MahaMetro official said, “The contractors are directed to provide necessary safety training to the workers. Besides, MahaMetro, along with the city traffic department, is initiating traffic diversions and road closures to reduce the commuters’ hardships.” Daily travellers said MahaMetro should ensure adequate arrangements of lights on road stretches where Metro work was on. Suresh Shinde, an autorickshaw driver, said, “The slabs of the stations and viaduct often obstruct the street lights. There has to be adequate illumination and barricading at the work sites.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mahametro-to-install-safety-nets-at-work-sites/articleshow/84102965.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Hyderabad||With payment still due, teachers in Hyderabad stay away from preparing digital content||HYDERABAD: Be it due to the pandemic or because of the low honorarium paid to teachers to prepare digital content, not many writers and presenters are said to be coming forward to prepare content for the state government. They said that even Rs 200 honorarium and travelling allowance and dearness allowance that they are paid to write scripts and record digital classes is not paid on time. About 150 teachers, who recorded videos last year, are still waiting to get paid for the content they made during the last academic year since September 2020. “Many of us use private vehicles to come to Hyderabad and record lessons during the pandemic. But, we are offered only a little over one rupee per km instead of the vehicle charge,” said a teacher who recorded lessons for English medium students. The teacher said they are not expecting the education department to pay them thousands of rupees as they are making content out of passion, but added that the least officials can do is pay them enough to cover their expenses. Teachers, who have been making digital content, said that it takes about a week to 10 days to research, prepare content, write content, shoot and edit a video. A few said that many are opting out of making digital content as they are being overburdened and there is zero recognition. “We were not even given an appreciation certificate for risking our health during the pandemic to make these videos. Further, the officials are overburdening those coming forward to make content,” said a mathematics teacher. Teachers in charge of getting writers and presenters to make the digital content said that it has been very difficult to find the required number of teachers. “I called up more than 20 teachers for making digital content, not even half of them agreed to come,” said an official. The State Institute of Educational Technology (SIET) has till now made about 240 videos for the bridge course and will be continuing to record bridge course videos until July 15 . A Krishna Rao, director, SIET, said that they have the required budget to pay teachers who made digital content but are waiting to get clarification. “We are ready to pay teachers as per rules, but many came in private vehicles and want us to cover the fare. We are waiting for the department to respond and will pay as soon as we get a response,” said Rao, and added that they have the required number of teachers to make content.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-payment-still-due-teachers-stay-away-from-preparing-digital-content/articleshow/84100893.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Ahmedabad||Industries to step up production with signs of demand picking up||Even though many curbs were imposed to control the spread of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat, industries remained exempted from most restrictions. But, as the second wave hit in March-end, industrial units across most manufacturing sectors faced a new demand slowdown, leaving production capacities underutilized. With the markets reopened now, and business for most industries almost back to normal, domestic demand has begun picking up across most sectors. Industry stakeholders state sales are improving in sectors like real estate, engineering goods and even ceramics, whereas clock-makers, apparel manufacturers, and gems and jewellery sector continue to wait for better days. Price fluctuations, low buyer confidence affect jewellersAmonth after curbs on retail eased after the second wave, gold jewellery sales have failed to revive. This is despite the decline in the price of the yellow metal at least over the last one month. Gold price stood at Rs 49,200 per 10 gram on Friday, down from the peak of Rs 50,900 on June 1. "After the second wave of Covid-19 infections, people have begun saving and are cutting down on unnecessary expenditures. Overall consumer confidence has weakened and people’s spending capacity was also impacted as many lost their jobs or even earning members of their families. Moreover, weddings have also been deferred for a long haul over a hovering threat of the third wave. Various such factors work to dent demand for gold jewellery," said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). Investment demand in gold has also slowed due to the recent price fluctuation; as a consequence of which overall gold demand took a hit. This is clear with a meagre 0.85 metric tonne of fresh gold import in June 2020. Exports provide cushion to the apparel sector Even though retail outlets and malls have resumed since over a month in Gujarat, the sale of apparel and garments is yet to pick up the pace. "Domestic sales have not completely revived as expected. The pent-up demand due to two months of restrictions did open up a bit, but we are yet to see a clear revival in sales. The production capacities at clothing manufacturing units remain 50% unutilized," said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor, Clothing Manufacturers’ Association of India (CMAI). Exports on the other hand are cushioning manufacturers in a big way. Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat state council, said, "Orders have begun pouring in from export markets, particularly in US and Europe. This is helping to keep the garment and made-ups industry afloat. Meanwhile, in the run-up to the festive season, even domestic demand will resume shortly." Real estate sees action with more site visits, closed dealsAfter having come to a grinding halt, the real estate sector has seen tractions with increase in site visits and deals getting finalized. "Overall sentiment has improved now. People have started visiting sites. Visits had completely dried up during the second wave of the pandemic. This shows that there is a demand and willingness to purchase property," said Chitrak Shah, vice-president, CREDAI-Ahmedabad GIHED, a body of city-based real estate developers. "The real estate market had come to a standstill from mid-April to mid-May. However, the market slowly started picking up. The second half of June was quite better, and now we are back to almost normal with site visits and sales happening, token amounts being paid for the bookings," added Rajesh Vaswani, a city-based real estate developer. Developers are also hopeful of the situation getting better with the drop in Covid-19 cases. Domestic situation better, but exports hit a roadblock for ceramic makersThe second wave brought the demand for ceramic tiles in the local markets to a standstill, so much so that several manufacturing units of wall tiles in Asia’s largest ceramic-making cluster at Morbi were forced to cut production. That apart, many more were compelled to shut units temporarily, according to sources. However, with the easing of curbs, domestic demand is slowly picking up pace with real estate inquiries and sales witnessing a surge; however, exports have hit a roadblock. Nilesh Jetpariya, president, Morbi Ceramic Association, said, "Wall tile making units are picking up pace in production, as demand has improved now. However, exports have hit a roadblock due to high freight charges and a shortage of containers. We are selling at lower prices than Italy and Spain, but if the importer adds increased freight charges, our costs are on par. This impacts our competitiveness, thus denting demand." Timber stands firmer as real estate slowly regains lost footingAs the real estate demand has gradually begun to resume, the demand for processed timber has begun to grow. 70% of timber wood imported into India is consumed in the timber-making cluster at Gandhidham and Kandla. Thanks to the second wave, the demand for processed timber, which is widely used in making fixtures and furniture and even particle and plywood boards and toys, declined by 25%, according to industry players. Navneet Gujjar, president, Kandla Timber Association, said, "As markets have resumed normalcy, demand has begun picking up well. Even though we have increased prices of timber due to the rise in freight charges, customers are willing to shell out more. We expect the sales will return to the level of March in another month."

---||Nagpur||Record jabs on Sat, but no vax at NMC centres today||Nagpur: Covid-19 vaccination resumed at all the government centres in the district on Saturday and city registered record number of beneficiaries. There will be no inoculation again in the city on Sunday due to lack of doses. After a gap of four days, vaccination resumed at 138 NMC centres administering Covishield. Covaxin jabs had continued at NMC’s four centres. Of the 10 private hospitals administering vaccines, seven continued the drive. Record vaccination of 30,694 was registered in the city on Saturday. Of them, 27,608 took jab at NMC centres and 3,086 at private centres. Previous high was 30,313 doses given on June 26. Later, the number of beneficiaries in the city had dropped to below 3,000. The demand increased manifold since resumption of vaccination of 18-44 age group on June 23. The government had supplied 26,000 doses of Covishield to the NMC on Friday. All these doses were reportedly consumed on Saturday. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said there would be no vaccination in the city as no fresh stock has arrived. Sources from the NMC said vaccination is also unlikely on Monday as the government is likely to supply fresh stock on Monday. The ZP resumed vaccination in rural parts of the district after gap of two days. 11,781 took the jab. Thus, the district recorded 42,475 vaccination on Saturday. The ZP is likely to continue vaccination on Sunday as left with some doses. Wockhardt Hospital has announced a mega vaccination camp on Sunday in association with Rotary Club of Nagpur Elite wuth a target to inoculate 5,000 people. Camp will be organized at Sai Sabagruh behind the hospital. The club said prior registration can be done on 0712-6624100/0712-6624799. The hospital will facilitate both doses of Covishield and Covaxin. “A recent study has forecasted that the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic is likely to hit India around July 15. As predicted by the experts, ramped vaccination strategies can cut Covid cases during peak of third wave by 85%. Thus, it becomes important to get vaccinated and give vaccinations on a large scale. This mega drive being organized by the hospital focuses on covering a large number of people in a single day to ramp up the scale of vaccination and to increase population which has received at least first dose of the jab before the forecasted third wave hits,” said Ajay Patil, executive secretary, Rotary Club of Nagpur Elite. “We are conducting this drive to cover a huge number of people in a single day.

---||Delhi||Plea filed in Delhi HC for refund of CBSE fees||NEW DELHI: A plea has been filed in Delhi High Court seeking refund from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for the classes X and XII board examinations, which were cancelled this year in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. The plea filed by a lawyer stated that parents paid a fixed amount to the board as examination fee for students to appear in the examinations. Taking note of the prevailing Covid-19 situation across the country, the boards for Class X were cancelled on April 14, those for Class XII were cancelled on June 1. Urging the court to intervene so that parents could get refunded, the plea gave a break-up of the examination fee levied and argued that it was meant for expenses incurred by CBSE in conducting a physical examination, such as payment to invigilators, organising examination centres, etc. Since the examinations had been cancelled, the board did not have to incur any of these expenses, the plea argued, saying that the money should be refunded. It also pointed out that, since lakhs of students were slated to take the two board examinations across the country, the money collected by CBSE ran into crores, which it has kept without any justification. The plea also wanted CBSE to have a clear refund policy when examinations were cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances or emergencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-filed-in-hc-for-refund-of-cbse-fees/articleshow/84102970.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Elephant Guruvayur Madhavankutty dies||THRISSUR: Elephant Guruvayur Madhavankutty belonging to the Guruvayur Devaswom died on Saturday. According to Devaswom records, the tusker was aged 57. But veterinarians who examined it said it must be older by more years. With the death of Madhavankutty, the number of elephants belonging to the Guruvayur Devaswom shrunk to 44. The tusker died just within two days after the Devaswom started the annual ‘Sukhachikitsa’ (rejuvenation therapy) for the elephants being reared at the ‘Aanakotta’ of the Devaswom. Madhavankutty appeared to be well on July 1 when the Sukhachikitsa for the elephants began. However, his condition turned worse on Friday and it breathed its last on Saturday morning. The elephant was donated to the Devaswom by Kunnatheri Naryanan Nair on February 3, 1974. As per records, it was 11 years of age then, according to Ramayyar Parameswaran, the former manager of Devaswom. Former deputy administrator Sivadas Moothedath, who had earlier worked as the livestock supervisor at the Aanakotta, said Madhavankutty was one of the oldest elephants of Guruvayur Devaswom. Aanakotta manager A K Radhakrishnan said the carcass of the elephant was taken to Kodanad near Malayattoor for postmortem and cremation. The team was led by chief veterinary officer Dr Usharani and forest veterinarian Dr David Abraham. The veterinarians said preliminary findings indicate that the elephant had died due to suppurative bronchopneumonia and age-related weakness. Samples from the elephant are being sent for chemical analysis at State Institute for Animal Diseases, Thiruvananthapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/elephant-guruvayur-madhavankutty-dies/articleshow/84105042.cms||---

Phugewadi is the second station, after the one at Sant Tukaramnagar, to be ready on the Pimpri-Dapodi priority route. MahaMetro plans to start full-fledged service between these two stations in the initial phase. The officials said most of work in the interior of the station was complete — including the construction of platforms and cabling. Work on the exterior, foot overbridge and stairs is under way. Initially, the station will have two staircases from the footpaths on both sides of the road. More entrances will be set up at a later stages as needed, officials said. “We have expedited the work at the Phugewadi station. The work of the exterior will be completed soon. Various agencies are working in coordination at the site,” an official from MahaMetro said. The official added, “The station will have two levels. The first will house the concourse where commuters will be able purchase tickets or swipe their card. The platform will be on the upper level. The station will also have escalators and a lift to provide easy access to the concourse and platform. There will be a waiting lounge and direction boards as well.” Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR) at MahaMetro, said, “The MahaMetro has already completed the construction of the viaduct on the Pimpri-Dapodi route. Now, the construction of stations is the priority. Other stations — Pimpri, Nashik Phata, Kasarwadi and Dapodi — are also at an advanced stage. The construction of a station is the most critical work of the Metro project as it involves a lot of complicated work, such as setting up of control rooms for signalling, track monitoring and commuter facilities.” MahaMetro said the work on the viaduct crossing the Mula river at Harris bridge has started. The Metro will travel towards Khadki after crossing the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/phugewadi-metro-station-nearly-90-complete/articleshow/84103008.cms||Sarang Dastane

Five of them have been arrested by the police and remanded to judicial custody on Saturday. The student of class IX, who had been missing since June 15, was reportedly found to be "pregnant" when she returned home on July 1. She had also "converted to Islam". The victim’s father told police that a youth who had introduced himself as "Nikki Yadav", whose real name is Kasim Qureshi, had befriended his daughter over phone and had started coming to their house with his mother and sister. On June 15, the youth’s sisters again came to their house and took the girl with them on pretext of shopping. When the girl did not return home at night, her family started searching for her. They then went to the youth’s house in Dayalbagh and came to know about their real identity. The minor girl’s father stated in the FIR that family members of the accused told him that his daughter had tied the knot with their son and "had accepted Islam as her religion and her name had been changed". He claimed that the suspects threatened him that he will not be able to meet his daughter ever, if he informs the police. Fearing for his daughter’s life, he initially remained quiet. BJP MLA Purshottam Khandelwal said that local residents had contacted him and after hearing their version, he took the family to the police station for registering the FIR. Police said besides the main accused Kasim Qureshi and his friend Shibu, his father, mother and two sisters have been remanded to judicial custody. Talking to TOI, superintendent of police (City) Rohan Botre said that an FIR has been registered against seven persons under sections 363 (kidnapping), 376 (rape), 420 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and sections 3, 4 of Pocso Act, besides the state's anti-conversion law. Five of them have been arrested and the main accused and his friend will be nabbed soon, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/5-of-family-2-friends-booked-under-ups-anti-conversion-law-in-agra/articleshow/84099164.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Delhi zoo to manage stress levels in caged animals||NEW DELHI: Stress is a common reaction among humans, but animals in captivity away from their natural habitat may also be living a stressful life. The authorities at National Zoological Park have decided to conduct a stress assessment of animals staying away from their natural habitat. A memorandum of understanding has been signed with Nanaji Deshmukh Veterinary Science University in Jabalpur for it. The researchers will study the cortisol hormone levels in the faeces of the animals. According to an official, factors like temperature, food and space in enclosure play an important role to make animals comfortable. Ramesh Pandey, director, National Zoological Park, said that the zoo makes enrichment plans to make animals active and reduce their stress levels. “There are two ways to check the impact of enrichment on the animals. Firstly, estimating the time budget of an animal, like how much time an animal spends on walking, sitting, pairing, eating and how much area it occupies. The time budget of an animal helps in understanding if it is active or not,” he said. “The second method is evaluation of stress levels. The study of faeces helps in determining the cortisol hormone level of animals, which helps in detecting the stress levels. Only a few zoos have done this study,” said Pandey. In the first phase, only a few major species, like elephants, lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars and hyenas will be checked for stress levels. A zoo official said the staff will collect the faeces of these species and send it to researchers in Jabalpur for the study. “After the report is out, we will intensify the enrichment exercises. After a gap of some months, we will again check the cortisol levels to see if our efforts are making any difference,” said Pandey. TOI had earlier reported that zoo authorities have taken many steps to keep animals active and engaged. The diet of animals has been updated considering the change in weather.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/zoo-to-manage-stress-levels-in-caged-animals/articleshow/84105025.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Kochi||Malayali to be top cop of US suburb||KOTTAYAM: Michael Kuruvilla, a person of Indian descent, is set to become the chief of police department of Brookfield, a Chicago suburb in Illinois state in the US, on July 12. Kuruvilla, 38, whose parents hail from Kerala, joined the department in 2006 after obtaining a master’s degree in social work. He is currently the deputy chief there. Speaking to TOI from Chicago over the phone, Kuruvilla said that his educational background has been an invaluable asset to his law enforcement career. Kuruvilla had completed his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in social work, both from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Kuruvilla’s father hails from Manganam in Kottayam and mother from Kollakadavu in Alappuzha. “My father came to the US as an adult, as three of his siblings and their respective families were already here, therefore providing a means and way to immigrate to the United States. My father sought and obtained his degree in accounting, and worked as an accountant for a number of companies. My mother also came to the US as an adult, right out of high school, as her mother had immigrated to the US as a nurse, and then brought the rest of the family here along with her. My mother sought and obtained her degree in pharmacy,” said Kuruvilla. “My parents were introduced by their respective family members here, and they got married in the US, and grew their family. I travelled to Kerala as a child approximately every 4-5 years as a kid. But as I reached adulthood and am now raising my own family, unfortunately the time and opportunity to return to India in general has been limited. The last trip I made to India was with my wife, Sibil, and our eldest son, Samuel, back in 2013. I hope to take my whole family there again at some point,” Kuruvilla added. “I have been leading in my current role of deputy chief alongside my current chief of police. My hope in taking over his role is to continue the culture of professionalism, integrity, and honour in increasingly substantial ways. The implementation of body-worn cameras (BWCs) has been my project from day one. We are now ‘crossing the finish line’ so to speak, and I am incredibly proud of my police department and the village of Brookfield in the ways that they have truly embraced and encouraged this evolution in policing so well,” he said. Kuruvilla’s wife Sibil hails from Mattakkara in Kottayam district. Located just 13 miles west of downtown Chicago, Brookfield is a close-in suburb combining the best of city and suburban living.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/malayali-to-be-top-cop-of-us-suburb/articleshow/84105106.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Mumbai||Fifth Covid-19 sero survey in Mumbai to start from mid-July||MUMBAI: The BMC will start its fifth sero survey across the 24 civic wards to determine the level of antibodies to the Covid-causing SARS-CoV2 virus among Mumbaikars. The survey is likely to begin on July 15 or 16, almost a year after the first-ever sero survey was conducted in the city. Mumbai has so far seen two waves, affecting 7.2 lakh people since March 2020. “Also, we have given at least one shot of the anti-Covid vaccine to over 50% of the city’s population,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. In this backdrop, Kakani said there is a need to know how many have been exposed to the virus already. “Such information, right down to the ward level, will help us plan strategies for the third wave that many experts have predicted,” he added. Vaccination plans for the public too can be drawn on the basis of sero results. Roughly blood samples of 4,000 people will be collected from the 24 wards. Last week, the BMC’s first paediatric sero survey showed that over 50% of the children have antibodies to Covid-19. The previous surveys have shown higher exposure levels among slums than non-slum areas. While the first sero survey showed that 57% from slums and 16% from non-slum areas had antibodies, the second survey done a month later showed 45 % from the slums and 18 % from non-slum pockets had antibodies. The third survey conducted in March 2021 in all 24 civic wards showed antibodies in 36.3% samples. Seropositivity in slum areas was 41.6% and non-slum areas 28.5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/5th-covid-19-sero-survey-in-mumbai-city-to-start-from-mid-july/articleshow/84105120.cms||---

The Pune cantonment court on Saturday sent suspect Azmuddin Pathan in magisterial custody remand for 14 days. He was later sent to the temporary jail at Yerawada. Sub-inspector Bolenath Ahiwale said, “Pathan instructed his 35-year-old wife Asma to leave his residence following a dispute between them. After his wife refused to leave, Pathan, in a fit of anger, attempted to kill her by throttling her neck, but she survived.” Ahiwale said,“Asma had filed a complaint against her husband with the Wanowrie police in 2007 for subjecting her to ill-treatment. She had also filed a petition in 2017 claiming maintenance from her husband. The couple later settled their dispute and started living together since 2018.” “The relations between the couple turned sour after Pathan started harassing his wife over trivial reasons,” he added. An FIR has been registered under section 307 (attempt to commit murder) of the Indian Penal Code. 4 held, minor detained on charge of attempted murder The Hadapsar police on Saturday arrested four men and detained a minorboy on the charge of attempting to commit murder of two men by brutallyassaulting them with sharp weapons at Saikar vasthi here over a previousdispute on the night of June 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mandap-decorator-held-on-charge-of-attempting-to-kill-wife/articleshow/84103039.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Builder ordered to pay Rs 69L interest for late possession||Mumbai: Ruling that if a builder is unable to give possession of a flat within the agreed time, then he is liable to pay interest to the purchaser until the handover, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission ordered Runwal Homes to hand over a 1,215-square-foot Nahur flat to a Kemp’s Corner family and also pay them around Rs 69 lakh interest on the amount paid so far. The commission said the builder may adjust the interest amount against the family’s balance payment for the flat. “It was imperative for the opposite party (the builder) to complete the construction and obtain the completion certificate and hand over possession to the flat allottee till March 2016. From the additional evidence... it is proved that the Building Completion Certificate was issued on July 17, 2019. Neither any allegation nor any proof has been filed to show that due to force majeure or for the reasons mentioned... in the agreement, the construction could not be completed within the stipulated period,” the commission said. The builder had terminated the agreement after the complainants, Arun Kedia and his family, who had already paid Rs 2.3 crore of the total value of Rs 2.5 crore until August 2015, did not want to pay further until the builder assured possession after the March 2016 deadline lapsed. “Due to lapses on the part of the opposite party (builder), the complainants are suffering a loss. The agreement for sale has been cancelled illegally and is mala fide,” the commission said. The commission pointed out the agreement fixed reciprocal liabilities upon both the parties. It said, “If the opposite party (the builder) has not abided by the terms of the agreement and committed a serious breach, then it cannot blame the complainants that they have not deposited the instalments well within time or within seven days of the issue of the letter of demand.” The commission further said there was nothing on record to prove the letters demanding the instalments were actually issued to the flat owners before March 2016. It said, through the letters issued in February, March and September 2016, excessive demands were made. “Thus, the allegation that the complainants have committed default in payment of instalment for which the agreement was cancelled, is not proved,” the commission observed. It said the agreement required that the flat buyers be given 30 days’ notice in writing before terminating the agreement. “No such notice was issued... Cancellation of agreement, of which the intimation was given through a letter dated March 15, 2017, was illegal,” it said. The complaint was submitted in 2017. The Kedias had entered into the agreement with the builder on June 5, 2013. The possession was to be handed over in March 2016. The Kedias, a joint family, wanted to move into a bigger home and had availed of a bank loan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-builder-ordered-to-pay-rs-69l-interest-for-late-possession/articleshow/84100167.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Nagpur||After wet June, met dept predicts dry July||NAGPUR: While June has been a good month for the region which received good rainfall, July might be comparatively drier, as per the forecast by met department. According to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Nagpur, Central India, particularly Vidarbha, is expected to receive less than normal rainfall in July — which is usually the wettest month of the monsoon season. “While rainfall is expected to be overall normal in the country, the region might receive less rains — light to moderate rainfall in small pockets. This will continue in first two weeks of July after which the quantity of rainfall is expected to improve,” said Mohanlal Sahu, deputy director general of RMC, Nagpur. TOI had earlier reported that Vidarbha is expected to receive normal and above normal rains this monsoon. Met officials are hopeful that this prediction will come true for the region, considering the overall monsoon season. “At present, the monsoon current is weak but it is expected to get active post second week of July. The region will overall receive good rains,” added Sahu. The data of June shows that most parts of the region received sufficient rains. The overall percentage of rainfall in Vidarbha was 19% more than normal last month. In Nagpur, it was 34% more. “Apart from Akola, all the other districts in Vidarbha recorded nearly 30% and more rainfall than the normal,” said Sahu. The Southwest monsoon rainfall over Central India is likely to be 106% of the Long Period Average (LPA). Southwest monsoon rainfall over the country is expected to be normal — 96 to 104% of the LPA. As reported by TOI earlier, this May was the coolest ever in last 10 years for Nagpur. The highest maximum temperature recorded this time was 43.9 degree Celsius on May 29, which was the lowest maximum temperature that the city has seen in the last 10 years in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-wet-june-met-dept-predicts-dry-july/articleshow/84103092.cms||Manka Behl
---||Pune||Building permits fetch Pune Municipal Corporation Rs 278 crore during second wave||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has registered a 14-fold jump in revenue from building permissions — from Rs20crore from April to June, 2020, to Rs278 crore during the same period this year. Applications for building permission have also increased substantially from 30 between April and June last year to 175 during the same period this year, civic officials said. A total of 1,551 permissions for building construction were given last fiscal. In the last three months, 175 permissions have been granted for building new properties, a PMC official said. Permission from the authorities allowing construction activity to go on in places where workers can be lodged in-situ has helped in giving a boost to the realty sector in the second wave, said officials. “The applications for building permissions have come from core city areas as well as from the fringes. Permissions have also been sought for redevelopment projects in good numbers along with new constructions,” said a senior PMC official. He said that 11 villages were merged in the municipal limits and developers from these areas have also submitted proposals, seeking permission. Along with individual building permission, applications for construction of apartments have also been received. “Our target is around Rs1,100 crore for this financial year, out of which around 1/4th has been achieved in the first quarter. We are hoping to achieve the target by the end of this financial year,” said Bipin Shinde, a senior PMC official. As per civic data, around Rs800crore is collected on an average every year from building permissions. The civic body collects revenue from building permission fees as well as development charges and premium fees. Around 4,500 building permissions are given annually. The civic body receives applications and processes them using an automated system called auto DCR. “Developers are utilising the facility to make payments for paid floor space index (FSI) premiums in instalments, with applicable interest, since cash flows are badly affected. This facility has come very handy for developers in these tough times. There are a few cases where the developers are taking advantage of 50% concession on premiums, where stamp duty is borne by developers instead of flat buyers. However, due to ambiguity in this rule not many developers are opting for it,” said Anil Pharande, president, Credai Pune Metro. There are many applications for revision of plans to cater to the new revised Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulations rules, and these might not be new sanctions but revised ones. Concessions on stamp duty announced by the state government last year, reduced selling rates by developers and low interest rates by banks on home loans resulted in sudden spike in sales and much of the unsold inventory was sold. This could also be the reason for applications for sanctions, said an official. “We hope that such sops are extended again to the real estate segment for its revival,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/building-permits-fetch-pmc-rs-278cr-during-second-wave/articleshow/84101010.cms||---

As per the complaint submitted by the joint chief electoral officer, the data of 2.67 crore voters were leaked. The complaint has been given as per a directive from the Election Commission of India. In the complaint the commission has demanded for the identification of the source from which the list was leaked before it was published. The crime branch has registered the case under Sections of the IT act, conspiracy and theft. The agency has deputed its superintendent of police A Shanavas to probe into the complaint. While commenting on the election commission’s complaint, Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said it was a gross injustice from the part of the election commission to register a complaint. Instead, it should have looked at how irregularities crept into the electoral list, he said. He said the voters’ list was not leaked and that got the list from the website of the election commission. It was a public document and anyone can download it from the website, he said. “It is the duty of the commission to ensure a free and fair voters’ list. But it failed in it. Instead of finding out how it has happened, the commission is now targeting those who have pointed out the mistakes. It is strange,” said Chennithala. It was the former opposition leader who had brought out the list of bogus names in the voters’ list ahead of the assembly elections. The allegations about bogus voters had sparked a huge controversy and the election commission had to admit the fact before the high court that there were widespread irregularities in the list. Chennithala had approached the high court alleging electoral fraud and had produced a list of four lakh bogus voters before the court. However, the commission was of the view that it was a matter of duplication of names. He had sought a directive from the court to delete the fake and voters with multiple entries from the list before the election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/crime-branch-to-probe-into-voters-list-leak-complaint/articleshow/84101008.cms||---

The project aimed at drawing 10MLD water from Malampuzha reservoir and should have been commissioned in February this year. Kerala Water Authority (KWA) laid a 16km pipeline for the Rs 32-crore project till Kanjikode. But to reach the industrial park it has to pass through the service road of NH-544 from Kinar stop to Government High School Junction and towards Walayar. The difficult portion, the NHAI road, has been crossed at Kanjikode High School Junction through the trenchless method. Earlier, NHAI permitted laying the pipeline in the utility corridor which KWA says is not possible as it will affect drinking water supply and other services in the area. “There is hardly any space to lay 600mm pipeline in the utility corridor. It is already full with existing water supply lines feeding Pudussery panchayath up to Walayar, Vadakarapathy panchayath, and telecommunication cables, electric supply lines, posts, etc,” said engineers with KWA. Kinfra officials said that the delay in commissioning the water supply scheme is affecting the industrial area which has nearly 800 units. The most affected are the new mega food park and the integrated industrial and textile park. They are presently depending on borewell water, which is not suitable for food processing due its heavy fluoride and iron content.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/industrial-water-supply-scheme-hit-as-nhai-denies-approval/articleshow/84105183.cms||---

The bridge was constructed at a cost of Rs 24.96 crore. Along with the bridge, a 1,200 metre connecting road too has been constructed. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, district guardian minister Nitin Raut, Rajya Sabhha MP Dr Vikas Mahatme, deputy mayor Manisha Dhawade, city BJP president and MLC Pravin Datke, corporators Virendra Kukreja and Gopichand Kumre were present. Kumre told TOI that Vandevi Nagar would be cut off from rest of the city due to overflowing of Pili river over the bridge. “During 2013 monsoon, 18 people had been washed away in the submerged bridge,” said Kukreja. They had been saved. “In monsoon, Vandevi Nagar residents used to struggle due to the submerged bridge,” said Kumre. Residents said they had met Congress leaders but in vain. In 2014, north Nagpur residents approached former MLA Dr Milind Mane demanding a bridge over the Pili river. Dr Mane submitted a proposal with ex-chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari. Gadkari in 2018 sanctioned the bridge from the central road fund. The state’s PWD carried out the work. The construction was completed some six months ago. Vandevi residents had already started using the bridge. On Saturday, Gadkari formally dedicated the bridge to public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/50m-bridge-over-pili-river-inaugurated/articleshow/84103149.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The incident took place outside the Rajiv Gandhi colony on Mohammadwadi Road on the evening of July 1. Assistant inspector Jaywant Jadhav said on Saturday, “Suspect Rohan Kamble from Taravade vasthi approached vendor Nayum Bagwan (39) fromSayyednagar and demanded Rs 2,000 for consuming liquor, but he refused to meet his demands.” Jadhav said,“Kamble, a criminal on record, again demanded money from Bagwan and told him that he will have to meet his demand if he intends to do business in the area and threatened to kill him, but the vendor refused to offer him money.” “Kamble, in a fit of anger, picked up a bamboo stick and attacked Bagwan on his head, vandalised his tempo, ransacked the vegetable stall, tore plastic sheet affixed on the stall and took to heels. Bagwan has suffered loss to the tune of Rs12,000,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/criminal-held-on-charges-of-extortion-vandalism/articleshow/84101063.cms||---

Otherwise, such inspections should be avoided – this is the stand of our government. Regarding this issue, the chief minister will convene a meeting of various ministers and secretaries on Monday,” Rajeeve told a news conference. Meanwhile, the LDF government is pursuing a political vendetta against Kitex Group, alleged BJP state president K Surendran.  “This is because Kitex hadn’t yielded to the demands of CPM. Continuous inspections and mental torture – these are the tragedies that happen to the investors in Kerala. There are instances of investors committing suicide after investing their entire savings. CPM and the government are the culprits for Kitex backtracking on their investment plans,” Surendran said. “The UP chief minister has called and offered help to set up business there and other states are following suit. However, what position the Kerala Government is taking in this issue? Crores of rupees were spent on organizing Global Investors Meet and Loka Kerala Sabha, but how many investors have you got. Even chief minister’s daughter has opted Bengaluru for setting up a business,” Surendran said. Meanwhile, the Telangana government has reached out to Kitex to invite them to their state. “I wanted to personally reach out to you to present Telangana as the next destination in Kitex’s growth journey. I am confident that the combination of policy offerings, infrastructure and ease of doing business that Telangana offers will enable Kitex to seamlessly set up and operationalize a new base outside Kerala. My principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan can take you through a detailed presentation of our strengths and offerings. Please advise how we can take this forward with you and your team,” wrote K T Rama Rao, minister for industries, Telangana, in his email to Kitex Group MD Sabu M Jacob.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/if-kitex-reviews-decision-govt-will-support-minister/articleshow/84101058.cms||---

The civic chief wants the company “blacklisted”.Terming the action “irresponsible and erratic amounting to stealing of government’s property and affecting the monitoring of crime, traffic and handling the pandemic situation”, Radhakrishnan has sought “legal and penal action” against the company by the state government. The connection was restored after high court intervention.“First, the company breached the contract by not transferring ownership to the purchaser. Then, it restricted access of services without having any right. L&T used unethical and illegal tactics to make the government listen to their demand by holding the city of Nagpur to ransom. The company’s act is not such that could be ignored,” wrote Radhakrishnan on July 1. Kumar, in his letter to Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL), mentioned about the “hindrance in detecting crime of robbery and stabbing, purse snatching of an old lady which occurred in the city”. “It became overall difficult to maintain law and order in the city and caused serious implications on monitoring crime. Traffic police was not able to generate e-challans on traffic violators and also caused chaotic situation in the city,” Kumar added.Radhakrishnan further said that the variable message display boards across the city did not function properly. “It affected the ongoing advertisement traffic flow and revenue. Software credential of the police department and the NSSCDCL users were disabled, which affect the day to day work. All the smart strip component services were affected,” he said.Stating that the contractor’s “act cannot be justified”, the civic chief said, “It is worth noting that there had indeed been a substantial payment made to L&T Ltd by Maha IT for providing the services. Though part payment may be due, at no stretch of imagination the services contracted to be provided gains the right of ownership.”An L&T Construction spokesperson said, “We would like to refrain from commenting on the issue as it is sub judice.”The state had approved Safe and Smart City Project in 2016. Maha IT was appointed as nodal agency and the NMC and police department were assigned as user agencies.

---||Kochi||Director, scriptwriter and producer Antony Eastman dies||Thrissur: Antony Eastman, who was revered as a multi-faceted personality in the film field, passed away here on Saturday following a cardiac arrest. He was 74. Eastman had ventured into the film field as a still photographer, and later made significant contributions as director, producer and scriptwriter. Eastman is credited with the introduction of popular star Silk Smitha, music director Johnson Master and script writers Kaloor Dennis and John Paul. His debut directorial venture was ‘Inaye Thedi’ (1979), and it was also the debut work for Smitha and Kalashala Babu as actors and Paul as script writer. Eastman was originally planning to cast national award winner Sobha in that film. However, he had to explore alternative options following the death of Sobha. Financial considerations forced him to rely on debut artists. He wanted Devarajan Master to be the music director of the title song of his film. However, Devarajan had a tight schedule then, and Eastman decided to pick up Johnson Master for the job. He had directed six films, including ‘Mridula’, ‘Ice Cream’, ‘Vayal’ and ‘Varnatheru’. His last film was ‘Ambada Njane’. He has worked as a still photographer for 13 films starting from P A Backer’s ‘Manimuzhakkam’, authored stories for nine films, and wrote script for one film. He had also acted in a film. Filmmaker Sathyan Anthikkad recalled Eastman as a committed and remarkable still photographer in the early years, and he was ready to capture the snaps for all kinds of functions and artistic events. “In fact when I had decided to elope with my lover Nimmy and conduct our marriage ‘clandestinely’ at Chottanikkara, Eastman had volunteered to take our wedding pictures. He was a very helpful person to all those known to him, Anthikkad said. “Eastman was always brimming with the urge to do something new and had the energy to implement them. Even two weeks ago when we spoke he was saying we must do something. He had found time to write a novel in his early days when he was working as a busy photographer. He had written another novel two years ago based on the rather unknown period in the life of Jesus Christ,” Paul said. Antony was born at Chowannur near Kunnamkulam in 1946, and had started his ‘Eastman Studio’ in Ernakulum in the mid-1960s, which gave his fond name ‘Antony Eastman’. He had shifted to the house of his son at Thumboor near Mala about 10 years ago. He was actively associated with organizations like ‘Gramika’ at Kuzhikattussery near Mala. He leaves behind his wife Mary, son Ganji and daughter Mini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/director-scriptwriter-and-producer-antony-eastman-dies/articleshow/84101034.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Mumbai||As she turns 90, Mumbai’s first woman Olympian revisits divided skirts, other hurdles||MUMBAI: In 1950s Bandra, every time someone would ask Francis Sequeira how he met or rather "caught up" with his wife Mary D'Souza--who could run an 80-metre hurdle race in less than 13 seconds--the oil firm employee would say: "I waited for her at the tape." Outpaced by her husband only in wit, D'Souza, a track-and-field athlete and field hockey champion who met Sequeira at a picnic years after she became one of India's first four women Olympians in 1952, was his equal in marriage. Leaving her household in the care of a full-time maid whose name incidentally was also Mary D'Souza, the railway sports recruiter travelled widely with her first love, the hockey stick--a sort of freedom that eluded her as the seventh of 12 children of a train driver who would say if she needed exercise she "should sweep the floors instead of running around like a mad woman". As she turns a nimble 90 this month in the obscurity of US' Atlanta, D'Souza--who stays up to play online bridge--feels age is catching up. Mumbai looks like Manhattan to her now and Bandra, too, has lost its Goa-like charm. Leaping over memories of divided skirts and divided convent school classrooms--in which Anglo-Indian children never mingled with regular Indian kids--the veteran pines for the rental bungalows, beaches and song-and-dance picnics of the suburb in which she grew up in 151 Hill Road--a building with an Irani restaurant. "We could walk to the railway station and play hockey on the municipal ground behind our building," says D'Souza, who earned her stripes in field hockey by being the only girl who played the sport with the boys. While seeing her sprint in the wings during a hockey game, her cousin had suggested track-and-field. He told her he would enter her in a track meet. "But when I went, he had not signed me up so I wasted a year. Another cousin signed me up the following year. I tried it out and did okay," recounts D'Souza, who darted her way coach-less into the nationals, got selected for the First Asian Games in Delhi in 1951, broke the national record in the 200-metre hurdle race there and, just like that, at age 20, made it to the list of eight athletes meant to represent India at the Olympics in Finland's Helsinki in 1952. Apart from West Bengal's Nilima Ghose, bindi-sporting D'Souza was the only female track athlete in the chartered flight from Dum Dum airport to Helsinki. "Sadly, no one really cared," says D'Souza, recalling the tepid reaction of her bigger-than-a-hockey-team family to her selection and performance at the 100 meter and 200 meter races at the event. "Although they did nothing worth mentioning, they improved upon their performances in India," Moinul Haq, chef-de-mission of the Indian Olympic contingent, had said about the women athletes who returned with lifelong friendships. "People were taken up with us Indian women, especially in our saris," says D'Souza, recalling American legend Harrison Dillard aka the "world's fastest man" asking where her starting blocks were during practice. "I had none, so he gave me his blocks." What D'Souza had were stumbling blocks. Unlike the rich West Bengal, Bombay--then a state under the watch of CM Morarji Desai--did not sponsor its athletes. This almost killed the Olympic dream for D'Souza as her father could not afford the per-person participation fee of Rs 5,000. Her friends chipped in. "They organized a dance and a whist (card) tournament to raise money," recalls D'Souza. This, along with the centre's decision to provide funds, helped her board her first flight. Money wasn't the only invisible hurdle. At the time, World Hockey Federation's rules dictated that women athletes wear divided skirts and convent school modesty meant that St Joseph's student D'Souza had to run track, too, in divided skirts. "It was ridiculous," says D'Souza, recalling that her sister Rose would invariably hit the bar while jumping in them. Later, D'Souza--who used to secretly jump over the wall at night to St Andrew’s, the neighbouring boy’s school, to practice as her school did not have a ground--would switch to shorts for track. "Spectators came more to see women in shorts than us run or play!" "You can't eat your fame," D'Souza would tell her daughter, Marissa, a gifted runner, to distract her from the sporting world that had given the Olympian fame but very little cash. Later, the fame, too, disappeared until Marissa's efforts would lead to D'Souza receiving the Dhyan Chand award in 2013. "Athletes and not power hungry people should be in charge of parent bodies," says 90-year-old D'Souza, who dreams of winning a Padma Shri before reaching the tape of her life. Recently when she wrote to the national Hockey Federation proposing her name for the prestigious award, the ball came back into her court: "They wrote back to ask the Athletic Federation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-turns-90-woman-olympian-revisits-divided-skirts-other-hurdles/articleshow/84106715.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

The unscrupulous traders have managed to thrive despite repeated action by different law enforcing agencies like food and drug administration (FDA) and the police department. As per an insider, these traders have managed to grow their pan-India network of supplies from Nagpur as the authorities prefer to turn a blind eye to their activities after some mere eyewash raids for the record. The issue of substantial tax evasion by some betel nut traders came into the limelight last week when the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court had asked the CBI to conduct a probe into the allegations. Though the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) too claimed before the court that it had conducted raids and investigating into the illegal activities of betel nut traders, the bench decided to hand over the probe to the CBI. Following the court order, the CBI had lodged an FIR in March this year and also raided different places last week. “Nagpur’s betel nut traders are the chief suppliers to the various cities of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and also different parts of Telangana like Hyderabad,” said a source. “These racketeers prepare fake documents to produce them on demand by agencies like RTO, police and others on the roads as proof of their so-called authentic transaction with compliances of government duties,” added the source. According to FDA joint commissioner Sharad Kolte, action was taken against betel nut traders. “FDA had conducted some raids in the past too,’ he said. Sources stated that several traders like the ‘Mama-bhanje’ duo, Vicky, Agrawal, Anil, Asif, Raju, Haru and many such players are now under the scanner of the investigating agencies after CBI initiated action. Some international agents, who co-ordinate with their Indonesian and Myanmar counterparts like Zakhir and Shamim too are under surveillance. According to a social worker, who now intends to intervene in the PIL which is in the court domain, said betel nuts are being mostly sent either in small pieces after ‘chana cutting’ or in sweetened form flavoured with tobacco which is banned. “There are around 14 types of supari available which includes at least 10 varieties of local ones. The ones coming from Indonesia are the cheapest but they are sub-standard which is used after fumigation with Sulphur oxide that is learnt to cause cancer,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unfazed-by-fda-betel-nut-traders-spreading-tentacles-across-nation/articleshow/84103116.cms||Soumitra Bose

The funds are part of an overall Rs129.84 crore grant-in-aid released by the ministry’s Directorate General, Defence Estates (DGDE) to 48 of 62 cantonments across the country. The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) has received the highest share from the ministry, considering its monthly expenditure and number of military establishments in its limit. “The central grant, along with our own local revenue sources from vehicle entry tax and property tax, will enable us to pay salaries of our permanent and contractual employees. In fact, we had sought Rs27 crore from the ministry, considering the monthly expenditure. The sanctioned grant would help us cover the expenditure for the next three months at least,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune Cantonment Board. Dehu Road Cantonment Board (DCB) CEO R Haritwal said the grant of Rs4.5 crore would be sufficient to pay pending salaries of contractual workers. “We will be able to make salaries and provide basic civic amenities. Our monthly expenditure is Rs3.5 crore, but with local revenue resources we will be able to function without hassle at least for the next couple of months,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-dehu-road-cantt-boards-get-crucial-mod-grant/articleshow/84101048.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Kochi||Kerala: ‘Summons a bid to digress from gold smuggling case’||KOZHIKODE: BJP state president K Surendran said on Saturday that a notice, which was served on him directing him to appear for questioning in the Kodakara highway heist case, was an attempt to divert attention from the gold smuggling issue. Surendran hinted that he may not be appearing before the police on Tuesday as there was a state office-bearers meeting scheduled that day. “I have to attend the meeting as I have to preside over it. We have not decided yet on whether to appear on Tuesday or not. State office-bearers meeting was scheduled before this notice was served. Whatever has to be done legally would be done,” said Surendran, adding that he was not expecting justice from the present government. Responding to specific questions on whether he would appear before the police as per the summons, he said that the notice was served for taking a witness statement, and there was no law that dictates that he has to appear on the particular day. He said that it was yet to be decided which day to appear as the notice was only served on Friday. Surendran said that the investigation into gold smuggling incidents and the robberies connected with it were all leading to CPM leaders. “Government has been on the defensive. Arjun Ayanki is saying that Kodi Suni was behind all these. Hence, it is sure that AKG Centre has links. Since some leaders of CPM are on the defensive as more details of gold smuggling and robbery are surfacing, they need a diversion. Hence, they decided to give me a notice,” he said. He reiterated that BJP never runs away from such investigations. “We never fake illnesses or falsely say that we are Covid positive to get away from such cases. Even after knowing that these are false charges, we have always cooperated with the rule of law,” he said. Surendran said that CPM was executing a well-planned move against them using the police and that the crime branch had taken a case suo motu after realizing that they had no other way to go ahead with it. “Personally, I am not taking any of these seriously. As far as the party is concerned, we would strongly fight it politically and legally,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/summons-a-bid-to-digress-from-gold-smuggling-case/articleshow/84105250.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MVA to table three farm law amendment bills in legislature||Mumbai: The Maha Vikas Aghadi government will table three farm law amendment bills in both Houses of the state legislature on Monday, during the two-day monsoon session. “We have carefully studied the central legislation and after taking into consideration views of all sections of the society and farmers’ organisation, we have drafted the amendments. Once passed in the legislature, the amendments will be submitted to the President for assent,” a senior cabinet member told TOI. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik said all constituents of the MVA—Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress—have opposed the ‘anti-farmer’ legislations enacted by the Centre last year. “NCP chief Sharad Pawar was never in favour of the laws, the BJP is misleading the farmers,” he said. Malik claimed that a resolution will be passed during the monsoon session to oppose the central farm laws. In September 2020, the NDA government, had enacted three legislations: Farmers Produce, Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities Act and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act. After strong protest from all sections of the farming community, the Maharashtra government set up a high-level cabinet sub-committee, headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to suggest amendments. Later, a committee led by revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat drafted the amendments. The Essential Commodities Act empowers the Centre to control production, supply and distribution of essential commodities, and regulate supply of food stuff under extraordinary circumstances and stock limit of agricultural produce. But the Maharashtra government has taken the view that it is a ‘state subject’ and certain powers must be given to the state government to regulate the production and supply of essentials and protect consumers from black marketeers. In the trade Act, the state has proposed a penalty for errant traders. It recommends that if a farmer is not paid within seven days of the transaction, the trader would face up to three years’ jail or fined Rs 5 lakh or both. The central legislation provides for redressal of grievances before the SDO, while the state governm-ent has proposed it before the competent authority. The central farm law provides that a trader can use a PAN card to purchase agriculture commodities, while the state has proposed that only a person registered with the APMC can trade. For empowerment and protection of farmers, the state government has proposed that any dispute over payment of minimum support price should be resolved within 30 days and the competent authority can’t give its verdict against the farmer if the agreement is not in keeping with the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mva-to-table-three-farm-law-amendment-bills-in-legislature/articleshow/84106736.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Citizen groups cautious in wake of fake vaccine camps||Admins of citizen groups in the city can't decide whether it was providence or presence of mind that helped save residents of their area from falling prey to the new face of fraud — fake vaccine camps. Madhu Poplai, secretary of the Pali Hill Residents Association, got a call from a young man last month offering to set up a vaccination camp for 1000 Pali Hill residents on behalf of a well-known spiritual institution. “The letter was drafted under the institution’s letterhead with a detailed plan of how they’d be conducting the drive. I'd started collecting money from residents when the person suddenly called and cancelled, citing pressure from local politicians. I called the institution directly to find that they had not planned such a drive nor issued a letter,” recalled Poplai. Rahul Daga, secretary of Friends of Wadala East, quickly sensed something odd when he got a call, earlier in June, from Manish Tripathi, key accused in the Kandivli fake vaccination scam. “The first thing I asked him was which hospital they were tying up with. It sounded vague and I immediately declined,” said Daga. With a fresh breakdown in trust after an upscale housing society got gypped, combating vaccine skepticism will require safeguards and effective communication, say resident welfare associations (RWAs). BMC laid down new rules for private vaccination camps on June 29, putting the onus on housing societies to inform the ward office and police who have to ensure there is a cop present at the drive and digital certificates are downloadable immediately after the jab. While RWAs have welcomed the guidelines, they said individual housing societies are less inclined to organize off-site camps. “In May and June, we saw at least three vaccine camps every week in different housing societies in Wadala. Now it’s down to zero. People want to go to either BMC centres or private hospitals,” said Daga. Poplai agreed. "People are opting for government-aided vaccine centres than privately organized ones,” said Poplai, who recently negotiated with a Bandra corporator to accommodate “at least four walk-ins everyday from the Pali Hill area for a jab at the local BMC vaccine centre.” The expenses are another deterrent. “Organizing space, furniture, ambulances and manpower for a vaccine drive in the colony itself is a massive task. On top of that, given the complex protocol and risks of a con job, it's more hassle free for housing societies to go for a direct tie up with a medical service provider,” said Mukul Mehra, secretary of Nepean Sea Road Citizens Forum, adding that he is making sure every hospital volunteer carries their ID. "We physically drop off the cheque at the hospital to ensure it's in the right hands and tag the hospital’s social media handles so that residents know it's genuine,” said Mehra. Although BMC banned political ads and hoardings from vaccination sites last month, “face value” of local leaders organizing vaccine camps in their ward could help lend credibility to the cause too, said Daga. Matunga corporator Nehal Shah agreed: “Public representatives — be it corporators, MLAs or MPs — are accountable to their constituency. So they’d be very careful in ensuring that the hospital or team of doctors are reliable”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citizen-groups-cautious-in-wake-of-fake-vaccine-camps/articleshow/84105227.cms||Mohua Das

With this, the country can expect commercial manufacturing of ‘one-step RNA extraction buffer’ – an innovation of Neeri, soon. The innovation was developed by Krishna Khairnar, scientist and head at environmental virology cell, Neeri. As reported by TOI earlier, Neeri has prepared a special buffer medium in which the collected sample is mixed. The sample is then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and subsequently heated for six minutes at 98 degree Celsius which gives a reasonably good RNA template for direct RT-PCR. This innovation eliminates the need for conventional RNA extraction method which is costly and time-consuming. Now with DCGI’s approval, Mumbai-based HiMedia Laboratories Pvt Ltd is expected to start manufacturing of the Neeri-designed one-step RNA extraction buffer. “DCGI’s nod is a recognition of Neeri-developed protocol and also an approval for commercialization and production of the technology. Various tests including stability, safety, etc are checked before giving the approval,” said officials. HiMedia has also been manufacturing the saline gargle sample collection kit. Following the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) nod, the commercial manufacturing of sample collection kits had begun. Apart from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zila Parishad Nagpur, private laboratories too have started implementing this process for RT-PCR collection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeris-gargling-test-kit-gets-dcgi-nod/articleshow/84103217.cms||Manka Behl

Forest officials have concluded that the same bear was involved in both the attacks as the area where the attack took place falls in the neighbouring compartments of two ranges. Official sources said that shepherds Vilas Pendor and Sitaram Madavi, both from village Satara Tukum, had taken their herd to compartment number 436 of Chichpalli territorial forest range in the morning. A sloth bear present in the area attacked both the shepherds, injuring them seriously. They somehow managed to scare the bear away to save their lives. The same bear then targeted another pair of shepherds, namely Prafull Sidam and Rupesh Kulmethe, in compartment number 435 of Chichpalli FDCM range after a couple of hours. Both the shepherds were critically injured in the attack. Foresters of the both the ranges rushed to the spot and took the injured shepherds to Chandrapur civil hospital for treatment. Officials claimed that two of them are critically injured and battling for their lives. The forest department has sounded an alert in the area following the incident and has warned the people against going into the forest where the marauding bear is present. The department has also increased patrolling in the area and installed camera traps to identify the problem bear. Sources said that yet another shepherd was injured in a bear attack around 12 days back in the same area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bear-mauls-four-in-chichpalli-forest/articleshow/84103212.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Third wave may have shorter peak, say experts||KOLKATA: While the sharp drop in positivity rate signifies the dying out of the second wave — it has dropped below 3% — the numbers could start spiralling in just over a month-and-a-half, fear experts. And the wave could spiral very quickly, similar to what had happened during the second wave and drop just as suddenly if right measures were taken, they predicted. Vaccination, they pointed out, will act as a more effective shield this time and may ensure a mild disease and fewer patients. The state could be heading for the third Covid wave between August and October, albeit with fewer being affected and a shorter ‘peak period’ than the second wave, they felt. “Like the second wave, we will perhaps have a sharp rise, an even shorter peak and a quick decline in numbers. This could happen due to two factors — vaccination and the fact that the virus needs enough new strains to strike and affect a large population. Even though strains like Delta and Delta Plus have surfaced, they are no longer fresh ones,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. Vaccination will protect a vast majority of the population or will restrict the disease to a mild one, he said. Numbers should remain low for at least another month till the third wave strikes, said CMRI director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “While we would receive more than a dozen patients everyday till a month ago, now we get one every 48 hours,” he said. Dhar added the cases may start spiralling slowly towards end-July and early August, reaching a peak by September. “While the third wave could be mild with a far lesser number of cases than the second wave and consequently fewer deaths, it will still continue for a couple of months. The pattern will be similar to the previous waves except for the fact that this could be the mildest one,” added Dhar. More children, however, could be affected during this wave, warned experts. “They are the largest un-vaccinated section of the population now and hence most vulnerable to the virus. But the more we vaccinate, we will create a shield around our un-vaccinated children that will help to save lives,” said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. According to a study, just 2% of the affected were children in the first wave but the percentage climbed to 12% during the second. “We have new strains now and we don’t yet know how effectively vaccines are going to work against them. But since people are more cautious now, transmission will be checked which should ensure a shorter wave,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences intensivist Sauren Panja. The possibility of the third week striking earlier than August can’t be ruled out, though, warned Chaudhuri. “Delta and Delta Plus may not be the only new strains. Over the next few weeks, more could surface against which we have no resistance yet. That could hasten and prolong the wave,” said Chaudhuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3rd-wave-may-have-shorter-peak-experts/articleshow/84101136.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

In a rejoinder, which was published on Saturday, the school said that a committee has been constituted to look into the lapses which led to the controversy. The notice read, “Due to an inadvertent error, some items were left out from the tender notice. A committee has been constituted to look into the lapse. A fresh tender is being released for the leftover items. The school tenders an unconditional apology if it has hurt the feelings of any individual/community. It had absolutely no intention of doing so.” Meanwhile, a fresh tender advertisement was published by the Welham Boys’ School in a classified newspaper on Saturday. It invited sealed quotations from reputed suppliers of six items, including ‘Meat and Poultry Products (Jhatka).’ The other items in the tender notice were batteries, printer cartridges, material used in construction, and others. Speaking to TOI, Mahesh Kandpal, vice-principal of the Welham Boys’ School, said, “The tenders for both halal and jhatka meat were supposed to be issued together. However, two separate tenders were issued to accommodate some leftover items.” On Friday, a few officials of the school management had also met SSP Dehradun to discuss the matter. Meanwhile, the police have started an investigation in the case and are recording the statements of the people involved. Earlier, the police had booked three school officials under section 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code for “promoting enmity between groups”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tender-ad-row-welham-boys-school-issues-unconditional-apology/articleshow/84099302.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Kolkata||Saving space: Christian family chooses cremation||KOLKATA: A Christian family has converted the grave space it had for two bodies into a special “home” that can hold all 12 members so they can rest together. Instead of traditional body burial, there are 12 heart-shaped stones, underneath which ash-laden urns can be placed. The first ash burial of the family — that of 84-year-old Ritendranath Sarkar who died of Covid — happened on Saturday. The family cremated him at Nimtolla burning ghat and brought the urn of ashes to the Bhowanipore Cemetery for burial. Bishop Paritosh Canning, who heads the East India Charitable Trust (a wing of the Kolkata diocese of the Church of North India) that runs this cemetery, said, “This is the first time that a family has pledged mass ash burial. I am glad people are becoming conscious of saving grave space at a time when space across Christian graveyards is a serious issue.” The service of this unique ash burial was conducted by the bishop. The stone under which the 84-year-old’s ashes are buriedThe deceased’s son, Ritesh, said all remaining 11 members of the family will also be cremated and their ashes brought here. “We hope to spread the message of saving grave space. In our case, the space that would have sufficed for two body burials can now hold the entire family,” he said. Sarkar passed away on May 18 and his ashes were preserved in an urn. Explaining why it took so long to finally bury the ashes, Ritesh said, “We had to re-design the grave space and bring in the 12 spots where the urns would be buried. The rains delayed the work.” The Kolkata diocese also runs other cemeteries in Dum Dum, Maniktala and Thakurpukur, and there is space crunch everywhere. “However, we are yet to find willingness among people to go in for ash burials, which are gradually becoming popular in the West,” said Sanchita Biswas, secretary of the Maniktala cemetery. A K Biswas, secretary of the Christian Burial Board that runs the cemeteries on Lower Circular Road, South Park Street, Tollygunj and Kidderpore, said, “Space is an issue, but other than the very early Covid deaths, when burning of Covid bodies was mandatory, no family has shown willingness to go for ash burial. Luckily, at St Stephen’s cemetery in Kidderpore and at the Tollygunj cemetery we still have some space left and are following a system of burial in old graves.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/saving-space-christian-family-chooses-cremation/articleshow/84101166.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Losing one eye to a rare fungal infection post-Covid is likely to have prompted the personnel, Pramod Merguwar, to take the extreme step.Merguwar was on sick leave for the last three months and had lost right eye vision to a rare fungal disease ‘endogenous endophthalmitis’ as per his treating doctor, an ophthalmologist at Alexis Multispecialty Hospital. “It was not mucormycosis or black or white fungus but a rare but aggressive fungal disease endogenous endophthalmitis,” he said. “After going through a procedure in Hyderabad, he used to have an agonizing headache for which he was being treated. We were hopeful of saving some sight in the left eye and told him to have patience,” said the doctor adding that Merguwar had diabetes and was administered steroids during Covid treatment. It’s learnt the doctor had shared his diagnosis with Merguwar on June 28, stating there were some patches spotted in the left eye which may need yet another surgery. The same day, Merguwar had summoned a friend asking for help to go to police headquarters to deposit a fine but had returned with a 9mm pistol, which he reportedly used to shoot himself.Sources said Merguwar and his family had to rush to Akola in March after a relative met with a fatal accident. The family after returning tested positive for Covid. Merguwar recovered in April but was later diagnosed with a rare fungal disorder. “He had at least five surgeries but did not recover,” said a family member.Merguwar, a head constable with Nagpur rural, had been serving in SPU on VIP duty since 2016. It’s unclear as to how he convinced police headquarters armory to hand him over his service weapon despite being on leave and partially blind. The head constable stuck his weapon inside his mouth before pressing the trigger. His body was found on the bed with an exit wound behind the skull. Police have recovered an empty case from the place.Family members said at around 12.15pm there was a loud noise like a cracker from the first floor where Merguwar was resting. They thought it was due to some construction work or a burst cooker. After half an hour, Merguwar’s nephew noticed that the door was locked from inside and there was no response despite knocking. They family open the door to discover Merguwar’s body. Cops from Mankapur police station have registered accidental death. Merguwar is survived by wife and two teenaged children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/partially-blind-after-covid-infection-head-constable-shoots-self/articleshow/84101173.cms||Soumitra Bose

In a statement, Muraleedharan said it was ridiculous that the state government wanted to question the BJP leader in search of evidence in the criminal activities carried out by CPM-controlled goonda gangs. “Kerala Police should clarify the relation between highway robbery and BJP. The state government is doing all this to cover up the awkward position it has plunged into after the CPM links in the money and gold heists have come to the fore. The CPM which complained of political witch hunts by central agencies are in fact using its agencies for settling political scores against BJP,” he said. The state police, he said, have been reduced into a docile force that functions only at the will of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. They have not been able to raise a finger against the culprits involved in the illegal felling of trees worth crores of rupees. The current fuss is because the Karipur smuggling case is inching towards the CPM party office in Kannur,” the Union minister alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-govt-on-political-witch-hunt-union-min/articleshow/84105297.cms||---
---||Dehradun||At 45, Pushkar Dhami is new Uttarakhand CM||DEHRADUN: Pushkar Singh Dhami, two-time MLA from Khatima in Udham Singh Nagar, emerged as the dark horse in the chief ministerial race on Saturday. Giving preference to youth over experience, the BJP named the 45-year-old as the 11th chief minister of Uttarakhand, replacing Tirath Singh Rawat who was in the saddle for just four months. Dhami will be the youngest to take over the CM’s chair in the 21-year-old history of the Himalayan state. Sources said that by naming Dhami, the saffron party has tried to strike a balance between two key factors in Uttarakhand politics – Thakur-Brahmin equation and the Garhwal-Kumaon factor. “Both Tirath Rawat as well as state BJP chief Madan Kaushik represent Garhwal. With the two key posts having been in Garhwal's kitty, BJP has now preferred a leader from Kumaon area to strike a balance and send a message to the electorate in Kumaon,” a source said, adding that the choice also balances the caste dynamics as Kaushik is a Brahmin while Dhami is a Thakur. "The choice of Dhami is intended to keep Thakurs – who comprise a large chunk of the electorate -- happy ahead of the forthcoming polls." Dhami’s name was proposed in the BJP legislature party meeting in the afternoon by outgoing CM Rawat. Kaushik extended support to the proposal and it was unanimously approved by the ministers and MLAs. The oath-taking ceremony of the new CM is likely to take place on Sunday evening. Dhami said he was ready to take on the challenge. “I am aware that I have limited time but I want to assure everyone that I will make all possible efforts to work for the welfare of people. Our party has taken some major decisions in the last four years and I will continue the good work of my predecessors,” he said, adding that he has been a part of youth politics and his focus would be on youth welfare. The new CM, political observers said, will have his work cut out trying to work in tandem with senior party leaders, many of whom were in the race for the CM’s post. Having had no experience of working as a minister, he will have to quickly learn the ropes and also strike a rapport with party leaders as well as cadre in Garhwal region, where he is relatively unknown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pushkar-dhami-is-new-ukhand-cm-at-45/articleshow/84099318.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Nagpur||8-day-old comorbid boy dies, docs clueless of Covid infection source||Nagpur: An eight-day-old baby boy suffering from complex congenital heart disease passed away on Friday afternoon at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) after testing Covid positive. Though the mortality hasn’t been attributed to Covid-19, doctors are clueless regarding the possible source of infection as all high risk close contacts, including the mother, of the deceased baby have tested RT-PCR negative. The GMCH’s paediatric department has forwarded the baby’s samples to its microbiology department for genomic sequencing to look for possible mutations. Head of the paediatric department, Dr Dipty Jain, told TOI that the baby had two holes in the heart. “The death was probably due to heart ailment as he was symptomatic of the disease since birth. It was probably not due to Covid though the child was positive,” Dr Jain said.Health officials said this is probably the second death of a neo-natal – 28 days period from birth – in the region. In August last year, a 16-day-old boy, with multiple complications of heart and brain, had died of Covid at GMCH. The boy was born on June 20. His mother, belonging to Seoni in Madhya Pradesh, had tested positive in RT-PCR in her sixth month of pregnancy which is said was in April. Doctors said as per protocol, the mother was tested before C-section on June 19 and she tested negative in RT-PCR. “As the mother was not positive, Covid test of the newborn was not needed. The child was 2.3kg preterm and shifted to NICU where he was put on ventilator,” they said.There were three more kids in the NICU who also tested negative after the 8-day-old’s death. All doctors and sisters working in the NICU too have tested negative. Dr Jain said the newborn developed fever on the 5th day and Covid test done on the 7th.day came positive.With the two holes in heart, the newborn’s survival chances were poor as he was on ventilator since birth. Physician and paediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari said, “We still don’t know if at all the virus gets transmitted, how long can it survive and infect the baby and when it will manifest. These questions still remain unanswered. There is still a probability that it was hospital acquired infection. If it was only single test, this could be a technical error too. Having said this, we still need to know the disease process during pregnancy,” he said.Dr Deopujari said it is a rare possibility or hypothesis that mother had viremia and the baby got infected. “This is known with viral infections and babies present with infection after birth,” he said. On whether it is correct to call it a Covid death, Dr Deopujari said unless any other cause is proved, it has to be counted as Covid death. “Detailed study including postmortem is mandatory to prove the root cause,” he said.Theories about infection- Newborn got infected in the womb- But mother tested negative before delivery- If baby was positive inside womb then mother should have tested positive - She was Covid positive in sixth month of pregnancy- Doctors feel virus may not have survived for over two months- There was technical error and the baby tested positive- Hospital acquired infection- But all high risk contacts tested negative- Three more newborns in NICU also negative||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/8-day-old-comorbid-boy-dies-docs-clueless-of-covid-infection-source/articleshow/84101209.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||After govt orders inquiry, MSMC halts agency’s work||NAGPUR: A day after the state government ordered an inquiry, the Maharashtra State Mining Corporation (MSMC) on Saturday halted work by private agency Rukhmai Infrastructure from city till further decision from the government. Considering the complaint of MPCC president Nana Patole, industries minister Subhash Desai on Friday appointed one-member inquiry committee of divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma. The government has set deadline of one month for submitting the report. Desai ruled out government role in the tender citing agreement was done between MSMC and Mahagenco. Patole had alleged irregularities in tendering process by MSMC in appointment of Rukhmai Infrastructure for beneficiation (washing) of 2 million metric tonne (MMT) coal per annum. MSMC general manager Premchand Tembhare told TOI that letter of intent was issued to the company in the first week of June. “The company has been asked not to start work till further decision from the government,” he said. The Mahagenco had asked MSMC to lift 22 MMT coal per annum from mines of WCL, SECL and MCL, wash it and supply to seven thermal power stations (TPS) — Chandrapur, Koradi, Khaparkheda, Nashik, Bhusawal, Parli and Paras. On Saturday, activist Prashant Pawar alleged irregularities in appointment of Hind Energy and Coal Beneficiation Ltd (Bilaspur) and ACB (India) Ltd (Gurgaon) by MSMC for beneficiation of 17.58 MMT coal in November 2019. Actual work started in March this year. “Mahagenco used to get coal washed from private agencies. Now, Mahagenco has asked MSMC to do it ,which is fishy,” he said. According to the activist, MSMC revised conditions of tenders to give contract to these companies. “Reject coal of 15% was allowed without any analysis. Agencies have been permitted to use reject coal at Rs310-610 per metric tonne whereas price in open market is around Rs3,000 per metric tonne. Five types of works were clubbed into one instead of separate tenders,” he said. Refuting all allegations, MSMC chairman Ashish Jaiswal said, “Courts and also committee of the government has given clean chit to these tenders. If anyone has any objection, they should lodge complaints with appropriate forum or file case in court. We have started the work in larger interest of the government, power sector and environment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-govt-orders-inquiry-msmc-halts-agencys-work/articleshow/84103282.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Chandigarh||Missing POWs: She heard husband's voice on radio a year after the war||Amritsar: Kanta Kumari was all of 17 when she was told that her husband, sepoy Ram Das, had been killed in the line of duty while fighting Pakistan on the eastern border on November 14, 1971, but she still feels he is alive. Her son, Shiv Kumar, says his mother heard his voice on the radio in 1972. “On January 25, 1972, she heard someone on Pakistan radio whom she recognised as her husband’s voice. That man also said my mother’s residential address,” he says. Sepoy Das is among the many untraced Indian prisoners of war (POWs) who went missing in the Indo-Pak 1971 war, says Jas Uppal, a UK-based rights activist and advocate who has been actively taking up the issue of POWs and person who went missing in action (MIA) through her NGO, Justice Upheld. She says the official figure of 54 PoWs could be higher. Kanta had married Das in 1970. Shiv, a Punjab Police official, says nothing substantive had been done to trace PoWs from Pakistani camps. His father, a gunner with 943/940 Nentan Regiment, was posted on the eastern border as part of the Mukti Vahini during the conflict. He says his mother was pregnant when she received the telegram informing her that her husband was killed. Uppal says her BGO had been contacted by many families of Indian POWs and one family from Pakistan. Jas says evidence suggests there are more than 54 Indian PoWs. However, she claims, they had details from families of POWs who were not included in the official list of missing PoWs. In 2012, Uppal says, a man claiming to be an Indian sepoy and a POW captured during the 1971 Indo-Pak war surfaced in Oman. When asked about their current status, she says, “It is not inconceivable that some of them may be alive. Even if they have died, families need to know if was it because of their injuries, torture or natural causes,” she says. Not ensuring humane treatment to POWs under international legislation and conventions amounts to war crime. Missing POWs? Evidence of untraced PoWs has in the past been submitted to the government by The Missing Defence Personnel Relatives Association. Major Ashok Suri was mentioned in the Punjabi Darbar programme of Lahore on January 6 and 7, 1972. On December 26, 1974, his father R S Suri received a handwritten note dated December 7, 1974. Later, on August 13, 1975, he received another letter from Karachi jail, stating that he was in a Pakistan jail along with 20 other officers of Indian defence services. On December 27, 1971, Times magazine had carried a photograph, claiming the man in it to be an Indian prisoner in a Pakistani POW camp. This photograph turned out to be that of Major A K Gosh, who was not repatriated along with some PoWs after the Shimla Agreement. Similarly, Flight Lt V V Tambey’s name was published in the Pakistan paper Sunday Pakistan Observer on December 5, 1971, as Flt Lt Tombay. It said five Indian pilots had been captured till then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/missing-pows-she-heard-husbands-voice-on-radio-a-year-after-the-war/articleshow/84105322.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Day after marrying girl in Aligarh, boy held for ‘forced’ conversion||AGRA: An 18-year-old boy was arrested for “unlawful conversion” of a girl, a minor, he had married a day ago in Aligarh. The FIR was lodged on the basis of a complaint by a former BJP mayor, who alleged the “Hindu girl” had been forcefully converted to Islam. The girl, who has been handed over to the Child Welfare Committee, said she had converted because she wanted to do so. The boy used to work at a clothing store in Noida. She lived in the same area. “That was where I met her and we got into a relationship,” he told the media. When the girl’s family found out, the girl said, they objected. “I wanted to study but my father wanted to marry me off because I was in a relationship with a Muslim man,” she said, adding that she is not yet 18. They decided to get away and, two months ago, eloped to Aligarh, where the boy was from. “We got married in a nikah ceremony on Friday,” the boy said. Before that, the girl had been converted to Islam. “I changed my name before the wedding and adopted Islam as my religion. No one forced me to do so. I have been here of my own free will,” she said. Former BJP mayor Shakuntala Bharti had a different narrative to share. She said she had received information that a “minor girl from the Hindu community” had been brought to Aligarh and was marrying a Muslim boy after religious conversion. She said she informed the police, who then “rescued” the girl. SP (city) Kuldeep Singh Gunawat said an FIR has been lodged. The boy, his mother and two others have been charged with unlawful conversion, attempt to murder and under sections of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act. “The girl’s family has been contacted but they are yet to reach Aligarh,” Gunawat added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/day-after-marrying-girl-he-eloped-with-boy-18-arrested-for-forced-conversion/articleshow/84099371.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

They tested positive following their return from Kolhapur, which is among the seven districts in the state where the delta plus variant has been detected. The civic body is also keeping an eye on travellers from pockets that are reporting rise in daily cases or where the new variant was detected.Impressed with the CSIR-NEERI’s speedy delivery of genomic sequencing results of 8 Umred family samples, the NMC requested the institution’s environment virology cell, led by Dr Krishna Khairnar, to examine these six cases too.The saline gargle RT-PCR samples of only five were collected and handed over to the Neeri team. Of these, only two tested positive whose sequencing quality RNA extracts were prepared by Neeri and forwarded to CCMB Hyderabad. The result is expected in next seven days, civic officials said.Neeri, in association with CCMB Hyderabad under the aegis of INSACOG, has been performing genome sequencing of samples collected from NMC’s RPTS swab collection centre since October last year. It was the first institute to detect Delta variant (B1.617.2) or the double mutant in January this year.Last week too, Neeri-CCMB found delta variant in the eight Umred samples. A mutated form of Delta, the detection of Delta Plus (B1.617.2/AY.1) variant in 12 states, had forced revision in movement control norms last week and also necessitated the NEERI-CCMB study.On Friday, state health minister Rajesh Tope had announced that 100 samples from each district would be studied for possible mutations.However, top civic health officials said samples for the study announced by state government would be collected by medical colleges and forwarded to NIV Pune.“We preferred Neeri as it delivers results in shortest time and also shares the findings,” officials said.The added that the genome sequencing is a part of active surveillance and containment measure in the wake of Delta Plus variant spread. “All six patients are asymptomatic and are doing well at the MLA hostel CCC,” they said.Besides the six persons at MLA CCC, five positive patients are admitted at Pachpaoli CCC and two at VNIT CCC. Civic officials and centre officials said they don’t have isolation facility at home and hence were admitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-sends-5-samples-for-genomic-sequencing-to-neeri/articleshow/84101228.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

This year, more than 10,000 entries were received from 130 countries for this section. According to the official website of Cannes, 1,500 of them have been shortlisted for screening.“We received the official correspondence today. Our movie will be screened on July 6, the very first day of the festival. It’s a great honour for a film made in Nagpur,” said Jiwane. The team has been invited to France, but it’s not possible for them to visit due to the travel ban. The movie is an on-screen adoption of the Marathi play of the same name written by Jiwane. Inspired by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s life message that ‘Pen is mightier than the sword’, this play portrays the struggle of a mother to educate her child in a crime-ridden and anti-social environment of slums.Despite her husband being a pick-pocket, a murderer, and a bully, she never lets his evil shadow fall upon her son. It was first staged in 1991 in Nagpur. Jiwane and his team organized several shows of the play during the next seven years. It was quite a popular play then and had won many awards too.“When we decided to make a movie on it, I made it a point to have all artists, and locations from Nagpur. We conducted workshops and did shooting at Bhide Girls High School, Dhanwate National College, Kachipura and many other locations,” Jiwane recalled.

---||Rajkot||Traffic to Alang shipyard thins over price differences||Rajkot: Alang, the final destination for retired ships, is seeing less traffic for the past few months beginning from February. While the sector was bullish during the peak of the global lockdown, the recent slack is owing to price differences between India and the neighbouring countries. High freight charge and container charges are discouraging ship owners to scrap old ships in Alang as Pakistan and Bangladesh are paying higher price than India. The ship dismantling hub generally gets 25 ships every month for dismantling which went down to around 12 to 15 between February and May. Alang witnessed huge inflow of old ships during the peak Covid period as owners were retiring old vessels for cash. The picture has, however, changed now. Besides the container crisis, shipping freight has increased manifold worldwide with the economy picking up. “Some offshore ships, passenger ships and those who need Hong Kong convention certified ship breakers are only coming here,” Haresh Parmar, secretary of ship recycling industries association of India, told TOI. Nearly 50 percent units of total 120 are idle as there is no ship to dismantle while those working have old stock, Parmar said. During the peak of second wave, the sector had to remain closed for around 50 days sans availability of oxygen as the government had diverted all industrial oxygen for the use of medical purposes at that time. According to ship breakers, the price of a ship has increased by 50 percent in the last one year and with Pakistan and Bangladesh offering more price, they are snatching India’s business. The reason behind this is that both these neighbouring countries use 60 percent recycled steel in construction and various other industries and the remaining steel they export. Steel price in international market has been very high for the past several months and this is why these countries attract more ships. While in India, only three percent recycled steel is used in the construction industry. Rohit Agrawal, a consultant at Alang, said, “Indian ship breakers are paying top price and it has reached a saturation point. Bangladesh and Pakistan are paying $15 to 20 more per tonne. India has various sources of steel, while Bangladesh is totally dependent on ship recycling and import of steel. They do not have mines like India and so, they are paying more price for ship dismantling.” “The sector also bore losses during the lockdown while it remained closed for almost two months during the second wave. GMB has increased charges by three times following some mandatory changes we made in plots considering safety and environment concerns. This is a big burden on this labour-intensive sector at this time,” Parmar said, adding that he slack period started because of tough competition. “We demand that Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) should waive fixed charges for the stressed period.” Parmar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/traffic-to-alang-shipyard-thins-over-price-differences/articleshow/84099400.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

A police team at Bodinayakkanur checkpost stopped their car and, on confirming their identity, alerted Madurai city police.City police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha told TOI that a team has been dispatched to Theni to bring the accused to the city by Saturday night. They had got a tip and alerted police units across the state. Sivakumar ran a hospice for terminally-ill people in a building belonging to Madurai corporation in the Armed Reserve police ground for a year. He has been into elderly care for the past 14 years and had become popular a year ago when he rescued hundreds of people from various places in the city who were stranded during the first lockdown, with the help of Madurai Corporation and city police.Already seven people have been arrested in connection with the child trafficking case which include two childless couples who bought two babies after allegedly paying Rs 2 lakh and Rs one lakh for a boy and girl. A senior police officer said that the trust was maintaining an account with City Union Bank which has been frozen. Only Rs 10,000 was available in the account. An inquiry was under way to check whether the accused maintained any other account to run the trust.“The accused would be produced before a judicial magistrate on Sunday evening. An inquiry will be conducted with them until then. They will probe them to ascertain whether they have been involved in sales of any other children.

---||Madurai||Call to bring in reforms in police, prison depts||Madurai: Human rights defenders have called on DGP Sylendra Babu to take steps to bring in much needed reforms in the police and prisons departments. People’s Watch Tamil Nadu executive director Henry Tiphagne, who made representations to the DGP through a virtual session on Saturday, said that he was making the representation on behalf of all the human rights defenders in the state.“Human Rights defenders are the friends of the police and not against them as conveniently labelled,” he said. The caste, or creed system which was prevalent in the police department, where persons of a certain caste or religion concentrated in a particular police station, should go, he said.There should be a zero tolerance to torture in Tamil Nadu under the new DGP and encounters should be a bygone era, he has said. “Put up posters saying torture is a crime in all police stations and give appropriate contact numbers at all the police stations,” he has said, adding functional CCTVs should be a must in all police stations.“Put an end to the so-called special camps where people who had completed their trial or imprisonment were kept, especially Sri Lankans, as these special camps do not have any facilities,” he said.Other representations included appointing the non-official visitors to prisons, with academicians and human rights defenders being a part of it. The advisory board of prisons should meet periodically and premature release of prisoners should also be periodical and not on special days like birth anniversaries of leaders he added.“Also, start at least one correctional home for prisoners like the correctional home in Cincinnati in the US which would prove that the Tamil Nadu Prisons department believed in correction of people,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/call-to-bring-in-reforms-in-police-prison-depts/articleshow/84103330.cms||---
---||Madurai||3 illegally adopted sisters rescued||Madurai: Madurai city police on Saturday rescued three daughters of a woman, given away in illegal adoption to three separate couples in the last three years. Five people including two couples have been arrested while two others are absconding. The incident came to light after an unidentified person alerted the district child welfare committee (CWC) about the illegal adoption of a two-and-a-half-year-old girl by a couple in Thiruvalluvar Nagar in Palanganatham.When a CWC team and police visited the couple, Balachandran and Kalanidhi, they produced a birth certificate and Aadhaar card for the child identified as Varnika Pandi. For a moment the police thought that the girl was the couple’s own child and the alert could have been a hoax. However, a check with the Madurai corporation found that the certificate was taken using fake documents. One Saravanan had helped the couple secure the certificate to show as if the child was born in a private hospital though it was born in Government Rajaji Hospital. Inquiries revealed that the childless couple adopted the baby when it was just three days old and that they had paid Rs 20,000 to get the certificate.Further inquiries revealed that the actual mother of the child was M Chithra, 38, a homeless woman living in Avaniyapuram. She told the police that she had given birth to five children including a boy which however died during delivery. Her husband Murugan died three years ago. The first baby was stolen by someone soon after her birth and a complaint in this connection was lodged with the city police. The boy was born next, but he died during delivery. Thereafter, she gave birth to twin girls four years ago and christened them Harisri and Sanjanasri while a fifth girl child was named Varnika Pandi.Chithra’s relative G Suganya gave away Harisri and Varnika Pandi and kept Sanjanasri for herself. Police said there is no information yet on whether Suganya has received any money from the couples for the illegal adoption. Suganya told the police that she gave away the child since the mother was not in a position to raise them.B Pandiaraja, member of child welfare committee, said L Shanmugam, another member and Dr Vijaya Saravanan, chairman, lodged a complaint with Avaniyapuram police on behalf of the committee. “We have received the rescued children and sent them home. Since the children were less than five years old, they have been sent to an adoption agency located at SS Colony,” Pandiaraja said.A police officer said a case was registered against the couples Suganya-Ganesh Kumar, Balachandran-Kalanidhi and Selvi-Samaya Sanjeevi as well as Saravanan under various sections of IPC and Juvenile Justice (care and protection act). All of them were arrested except for Samaya Sanjeevi and Saravanan, who have gone underground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/3-illegally-adopted-sisters-rescued/articleshow/84103331.cms||V Devanathan

---||Mumbai||Restoring Esplanade: Heritage panel to consider plan, HC told in Mumbai||Mumbai: The civic heritage committee will consider a proposal for restoration of Esplanade Mansion at Kala Ghoda in Fort, which the landlord will soon submit, the BMC informed the Bombay high court on Saturday. Once the heritage committee gives its nod, the landlord, Sadiq Ali, can submit the proposal to Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) for approval and after it is cleared, it will be sent to the BMC for final sanction before any work can start, senior counsel Anil Sakhare, representing BMC, said. Cherag Balsara, counsel for the landlord, said he was agreeable to Sakhare’s submissions. When asked by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni by when would the proposal be ready, he replied two to three weeks. Balsara sought permission to be allowed entry by Mhada for architects to draw plans for the proposal and also for protective work to be done on the heritage structure for monsoon, but made it clear that no other work would be undertaken till the restoration plans are approved by the BMC. Mhada lawyer Prakash Lad said it had no objection as it would eventually recover the expenses of any protective work from the landlord. Called Watson’s Hotel when built in 1869, Esplanade Mansion is India’s oldest surviving cast-iron building. Occupied mostly by lawyers’ offices, the building was vacated pursuant to much litigation and court orders a couple of years ago. Balsara also submitted that following 2020 HC order, Rs 20 crore of the estimated Rs 50 crore for the restoration work, has been deposited by the landlord in court and an undertaking would be given that the money would be used only for the work, once it starts. “The money would be good for first nine quarters,” he added. To a query from the HC on the building, Balsara said, “It was the best hotel back then in Bombay, with a view of the sea on both sides. However, it had a board affixed to it which said dogs, cats and Indians not allowed. Legend has it that Jamshedji Tata was shown the door which lead him to construct the Taj Mahal Hotel.” The bench said it would pass an order on Monday.

---||Nagpur||Not in my footsteps: Docs fear their children too will suffer in medical field||Even as Doctor’s Day was celebrated on July 1, a social media post went viral which claimed that rising violence against doctors is discouraging young students from pursuing medical education. TOI asks second and third-generation doctors whether they will advise their children against joining MBBS and why...Nagpur: “Doctor, you are God”, “Doctor, you arrived just like an angel for us!”. We might have often come across such words of gratitude for doctors around us. It always feels great to see a doctor relieving someone of agony with empathy and compassion. But such praise comes after many sacrifices — sleepless nights, lack of me time, immense studies for years together, the long struggle for settlement, cut-throat competition and so on. Above all, there is always a threat of getting beaten up by an angry mob at any point of career. During the Covid-19 period, such incidents increased to such an extent that doctors started advising young aspirants not to prepare for medical course. But the increased violence against doctors is just a small reason. “Major change we have noticed over the years is that the doctor-patient relationship has been ruined. The nobility, respect this field used to enjoy has been lost somewhere in the corporate struggle. Society has started treating doctors like service providers,” said Dr Saurabh Mukewar who grew up seeing work of his father Dr Shrikant, one of the veterans in gastroenterology in Nagpur.“Once he was the only one from this super specialty in Nagpur. Today, hundreds of postgraduates are coming out from colleges every year specializing in the same field. It’s not at all easy for them to earn success like the earlier generation doctors,” said Dr Saurabh. “If it’s your passion, no one can stop you from doing medicine. But if you are joining the field for financial success, it is a strict ‘No’ from my side. I won’t advise my kids to join this field,” he said. Dr Amar Amale, a second-generation doctor, also said he will never suggest his children to take up medicine as career. “When our friends were getting high packages, we, as residents, were struggling to raise our basic stipends. This shows the apathy of the government towards the health sector. We have to practice under tremendous stress which has brought down the average life expectancy of doctors. Since there is hardly any silver lining, I don’t want my kids to suffer the same agony,” said Dr Amale.Dr Mukul Deshpande is still in medical college and experiencing the struggle of doctors first-hand. “I have seen many singers including my father getting lost in responsibilities and not pursuing what they were really good at. So, if my kid sees me and really wants to give it all for the field, I’ll help him. But I won’t suggest him to take up this field,” he said. “If you talk about money, there is no easy money for doctors. Engineers easily earn more. Money is never a motivation for most of the doctors,” he said.Young doctors from government medical colleges said that they lose peace of mind and standard of living too. “Most hostels in government medical colleges are not worth staying for even a single day,” said another resident doctor from GMCH in Yavatmal. “If the patient survives, they say God has saved the patient. And if he dies, it’s the doctor who killed him,” he said.For interventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat, another second-generation doctor, medical professionals still command a lot of recognition and respect in society. “If my son Noam decides to become a doctor, I will never discourage him. It’s a profession which lets you serve the people. The pandemic has highlighted the need for more doctors and specialists,” he said. Major Dr Vaibhav Chandankhede has served in the Armed forces and he thinks the other way. “Looking at the changing outlook of society towards doctors, sometimes I feel to advise the youngsters to opt for an easy and less complicated choice for their career and avoid all the mental and physical pressure,” he said. He served as a Medical Combatant in Armed Forces. “It gave the pleasure of serving the nation by saving lives and healing the fighting troops in tough situations. Hence, I will prefer to suggest medical profession as a career choice to youngsters,” he said.Why ‘No’ to medical education - It’s a long way to become a specialist- Years of preparation, hard work, failure, frustration despair, and finally some success - Poor health infrastructure increases frustration - Long years of struggle for settlement even after a degree - Extreme competition in the field - No respect for anything you do- Often judged by unqualified people - The struggle phase kills creativity, enthusiasm to do anything else in life- No me time, no free time during a crucial period of life - And there is angry mob, petty politicians, pressure groups and weak legal provisions||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-in-my-footsteps-docs-fear-their-children-too-will-suffer-in-medical-field/articleshow/84101342.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

They also get a good price for the good quality of the saplings. The nursery owners, who have now started cultivating sandalwood plants have a stock of about five lakh saplings ready to be sold in the northern states. Suresh Kumar of A Vellodu, a nursery owner, said they get the sandalwood seeds from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. ``Seeds start germinating in about 25 days, and regular watering with good sunlight makes them reach a height of about two to three feet in about six months,’’ he said and they sell these saplings for about Rs 20 each.The ban on individual cultivation of Indian Sandalwood, (Santalaum album), was banned till 2002 in India. However, individuals are now poermitted to grow them in their personal gardens with a condition that it must be felled without any commercial purpose. The saplings are transported in lorries to these northern states. Farmers said, the governments in northern states seem to encourage people to grow sandalwood. Once the saplings are planted, their roots can even adapt to new surroundings and will not need a lot of care. They will grow to a height of about 30 feet if there is enough space, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/eyeing-north-indian-market-dindigul-nurseries-grow-sandalwood-saplings/articleshow/84103341.cms||---

In some parts, a spell of intense rain accompanied with gusty winds of 50kmph was recorded on Saturday evening. The Met department said the onset of monsoon was unlikely to happen in the next five days, but light rain was expected on Sunday too. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), Safdarjung — Delhi’s base station— recorded 19.2mm rainfall till 8.30am, while “trace” rainfall was observed from 8.30am to 5.30pm. Narela station recorded 22.5mm rainfall from 8.30am to 5.30pm. Several parts of Central, East, South and South West districts witnessed rain in the evening. The maximum temperature dipped to 38.6 degrees Celsius— two degrees above normal— on Saturday, while the minimum settled at 24.1 degrees — four notches below normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 84% and 43%. The forecast of the Met department said rain was expected in parts of the capital for the next six days. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist, IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “Though there are no favourable conditions for further advance of monsoon in Delhi for the next five days, subdued rainfall activity is likely to continue for the next few days. There is less possibility of rain on July 5 and 6, but the intensity is expected to be more on July 8.” The heatwave conditions has abated from the plains of northwest India, he added. The maximum temperature is likely to rise slightly from Sunday and may hover around 40 degrees Celsius from July 5 to 7. The rain also helped in cleaning Delhi’s air. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) improved from 245 in the “poor” category on Friday to 139 in the “moderate” on Saturday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, the forecasting body under Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Rain received at a few places in Delhi has led to an improvement in air quality through the aerosol wash out process. Surface winds are moderate and southwesterly. Dust long-range transport from western dry arid regions and local emissions are expected to continue in the coming days. AQI is expected to remain in the ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ category for the next three days. Dust (PM10) will be the lead pollutant for the next three days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-again-but-monsoon-not-close/articleshow/84103431.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three officials of barge company held for not discharging duty properly||MUMBAI: Yellow Gate police, probing the sinking of barge Paapa 305 (P305) during Cyclone Tauktae, on Friday arrested three persons, including the director of Paapa Shipping Co Pvt Ltd, for not discharging their duty properly. As many as 261 crew were onboard when the barge began sinking on May 16 in the Arabian Sea. While most were rescued by INS Kochi and INS Kolkata, 71 died. “Eight employees of P305 are still missing,” said a source. Those arrested were Nallasopara resident Nitin Sinha (32), a director at Paapa Shipping, Akhileshwar Tiwari (49), technical superintendent, and Prasad Rane (46), manager. The three were arrested for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Esplanade court remanded them to police custody till July 8. Yellow Gate police, a Mumbai Port zone police station, has its jurisdiction up to 200 nautical miles at sea. Its jurisdiction is spread up to Daman on the west coast, to Sawantwadi (Ratnagiri). While its sanctioned required staff strength is 692 personnel, the police station has only 150 personnel. Police had registered an FIR on May 20 against P305’s captain, Rakesh Ballav, and several others for capable homicide not amounting to murder. Ballav had died in the mishap and his body was claimed by relatives three weeks later. Paapa 305 was anchored near a rig in Heera oil fields, around 35 nautical miles west of Mumbai. Police said it was owned by Durmast Enterprises Ltd, and leased to Afcons Infrastructure for work at ONGC. Afcons had entered into agreements with companies and arranged for accommodation for the employees at P305. Paapa Shipping was the technical manager of P305 barge. Coastal police stations in Maharashtra, Goa, Daman and Gujarat have been told to search for missing personnel, Mumbai Police said. Complainant Mustafizur Shaikh, a survivor and chief engineer, had alleged that he had repeatedly requested the captain to give a distress call signal but Ballav delayed it for more than 10 hours. Many crew jumped into the sea. Investigators, who recorded statements of survivors, said at 11.30pm on May 16, the barge began drifting during the cyclone. It sank by May 17 evening. Police investigated 63 accidental death cases connected to the incident. Investigations found that Ballav had on May 14 sent a WhatsApp message to his company that they had moved the barge 175 meters away from the platform, and it was safe, said a police officer. Investigators collected emails from the barge to base office after May 14, and WhatsApp messages, survey reports of the barge when it left Mumbai in September last year. Police also sought satellite phone details from the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-officials-of-barge-co-held-for-not-discharging-duty-properly/articleshow/84105449.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: 70-year-old sole inhabitant of Tuticorin’s ghost village||TUTICORIN: A vast emptiness pervades Meenakshipuram in Tuticorin district, typical of the few barren villages from where people have migrated en mass due to loss of livelihood and difficult living conditions. Yet, diehard sons of the soil like Kandasamy Naicker refuse to leave come what may. Today, the 70-year-old is the sole inhabitant of this village in Sekkarkudi panchayat, 35 kms away from Tuticorin, which faces the threat of being wiped out from the map. Time was when Meenakshipuram used to teem with agricultural activities. According to the 2001 census, there were 1,269 people living there, but many started leaving when the rains failed the region consistently. People had to travel five kilometres to collect water while lack of public transport made them walk miles to take a bus. Kandasamy says there were five families in the village till 2015 when they too left. The septuagenarian has been living alone in his dilapidated house ever since his wife passed away five years ago. His two sons and daughter want him to come and live with them, but Kandasamy is adamant that he will die on his own soil. A rope cot, a mixie, a big drum of water, a television and aruval are his only belongings. A rekla cart, which he used for racing in Sekkarkudi, the village famous for bullock cart races, rests in his backyard. A cat and a dog keep him company. “My father and grandfather were born here and I too will die like them,” says he. Loud winds howl through the village, which Kandasamy attributes to the absence of green cover and trees. There is an overhead tank and a street tap with a hand pump in the village but water comes only once in ten days. Kandasamy feels the village would have lived had the government given them proper water facilities. The road has not been laid for decades and is full of potholes. Neighbouring villages are three to four kilometres away where agricultural activities still go on. Kandasamy has a two-wheeler to fetch groceries from neighbouring Sekkarkudi with the Rs 2,000 his son Bala gives him every month. He buys his ration from Sekkarkudi and is a regular voter having voted in the recent assembly election by travelling to Chokkalingapuram, 3 kms away. The village comes alive during the Adhiparasakthi temple fesival in May when people come and put up tents, but they return the next day. There is a gleam in Kandasamy’s eyes hinting at an optimism that this village would come to life again and people would return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/70-yr-old-sole-inhabitant-of-this-village/articleshow/84103418.cms||---

It will roll out the new plan for these residents once the police investigating the cases confirm that all of them were indeed given fake vaccine shots or point out those who got genuine doses. These residents may have to undergo antibody tests before they get a genuine jab. Additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani said the BMC would eventually give these resident the option to get genuine doses. The BMC stated around 2,000 recipients of fake vaccines have been identified so far. “We have asked our health staff to be in touch with all these residents. The secretaries and other office bearers of these housing societies are in touch with doctors from the BMC’s health check posts and their health status is being monitored. We are also checking if they have any comorbidities and their other parameters and have asked them to get in touch with the BMC in case of any health issue. We are checking if they have had any side-effects so far. The police have custody of all the accused and so we are waiting for them to tell us if any of the residents were given genuine doses or if all were fake,” he said. Civic officials said once police share details of the genuine and fake doses given during these fake vaccination drives, the BMC will conduct antibody tests of the residents. “We will carry out antibody tests of those residents who are willing to get tested to check if they have developed any antibodies. We will approach housing societies that were victims of fake drives for this,” Kakani said. Police probe has so far reportedly revealed those running the scam sourced used vaccine vials from Shivam Hospital and refilled them with saline water.  “Once we are sure that all the jabs given were fake, we will write to the Centre’s health department and tell them to nullify these certificates generated via CoWin so we can give the residents new jabs and generate new certificates for them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-draws-plan-for-fresh-shots-for-fake-drive-victims/articleshow/84101437.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Preparing to meet 8,500MW peak power demand next year: Delhi CM||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said Delhi government has successfully been able to meet the growing power demand so far and was supplying 24x7 electricity to all residents. Next year, the government plans to meet over 8,500 MW peak power demand, which, so far, had been 7,323 MW. Kejriwal convened a review meeting with the officials of electricity department and power distribution companies and discussed in detail the status of supply in Delhi amid the increasing peak demand. He also directed the officials to identify areas in need of transformers and insulate or make high-tension wires underground for the safety of the people. Power minister Satyendar Jain, senior officials and CEOs of all power distribution companies, and officials of power department were present at the meeting. “Had a review meeting with the officials of electricity department & power distribution companies today. Discussed in detail the current status of power supply in Delhi amidst the peak demand for electricity in the capital,” the CM tweeted later in the day. Deliberating on the current power situation, Kejriwal said, “Every year, Delhi see an 4-5% rise in power demand due to increase in consumption by new customers and increased prosperity. We have successfully been able to meet the growing demand and supplying 24x7 electricity.” He added that the companies or discoms facing issues in fixing transformers in certain areas due to lack of space should intimate the government about the locations. The government shall then assist them in fixing the transformers in those areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/preparing-to-meet-8500mw-peak-power-demand-next-yr-cm/articleshow/84103456.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Corona & inflation take toll on common man’s budget||LUCKNOW: Sharp rise in prices of cooking oils and edibles coupled with drop in income due to the pandemic has derailed the budget of many families in the city, forcing them to cut down on food items and revise menu. Take the example of the Verma family whose monthly expenditure on food items was Rs 1,500 till four months ago, but now has increased by Rs 3,000. “The pandemic had already taken a toll on my catering business resulting in huge losses. Now, the price rise by 10-30% in the past few months has come as a double blow, leaving no scope of savings,” said Avinash Verma, head of the family. As prices of edible oil have increased, we have cut down on ‘puris’ and ‘parathas’ in breakfast, replacing them with bread and semolina” added the Shaktinagar resident. Families whose members contracted Covid-19 said that the huge cost of medicines has also drilled a hole in the pocket. Petrol prices hike and rise in overall inflation due to it has also hit people hard. Murarinagar resident Sunil Bisht, working in the private sector, said, "We are a family of four. My wife contracted Covid in mid-April. Around Rs 50,000 was spent on her treatment. Earlier, I used to buy rations in bulk for a month, but now I maintain a weekly budget depending on the income." Three family members of Ankur Srivastava, a government employee, recently recovered from Covid-19. "Due to no increase in Dearness Allowance (DA), rising prices of edible oils and more expenses on medicines, we have reduced intake on oily food and prefer boiled vegetables once in a day. It's healthy as well," added the Gomtinagar resident. Homemaker Vandana Shukla of Indiranagar said that her family has cut down on branded and packaged food, even reduced tea consumption in accordance with the budget. Whereas Sadhna Sharma of Alambagh, said, "Due to high inflation, one has to think twice before inviting guests for dinner and lunch nowadays.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/corona-inflation-take-toll-on-common-mans-budget/articleshow/84105469.cms||---

This is the 12th such case in Mumbai Metropolitan Region.  Turbhe MIDC police lodged an FIR against Dr Manish Tripathi and his student Karim Ali—both key accused in most other FIRs—and an unidentified individual. The accused had organized a “vaccination drive” for Atomberg Technologies Pvt Ltd, a fan manufacturer located at Shirawane MIDC, Nerul, in April and charged it Rs 4.3 lakh. Dr Tripathi is the director of KCEP Group, a training and placement institute that functioned out of Shivam Hospital in Charkop, Kandivli. Police said the accused claimed they were giving Covishield shots at the drive conducted in Navi Mumbai on April 23. The company’s administration manager, Kalpesh Patil (29), stated in the police complaint that after giving the shots, Dr Tripathi sent them a bill on KCEP Healthcare’s letterhead. The bill mentioned Rs 4.3 lakh for the vaccines and Rs 8,700 as transportation charges. The bill was sent on WhatsApp to the company’s human resource department manager Nipun Agrawal on April 24. The company transferred Rs 4.2 lakh to a bank account number of KCEP provided by Dr Tripathi. The next day, when vaccination certificates of employees were not generated on the CoWin platform, Agarwal questioned Dr Tripathi who allegedly “made excuses” citing technical issues. On June 9, the vaccination certificates of only two employees, Kiran Jangam and Lakshmikant Jawale, were generated on CoWin. They, though, mentioned Nanavati Hospital in Vile Parle as the vaccinator. The vaccination date was given as June 9 instead of April 23. When questioned, Dr Tripathi said everybody was being given similar certificates. As Dr Tripathi said he had procured vaccines from KCEP Healthcare, Agarwal called up their office to inquire about batch numbers of vaccine vials, but he did not receive a satisfactory reply. Suspecting the drive to be fake, the company lodged a complaint at Turbhe MIDC police station. After a preliminary probe, the FIR was registered on July 2. Senior inspector Rajendra Awadh said, “Dr Tripathi and Ali have been arrested by Kandivli police for a similar offence. Only an antigen test can confirm whether Covishield was administered to even a single employee.” The accused have been booked under relevant IPC sections, the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-kvli-doc-named-in-1st-fake-vax-fir-filed-in-n-mum-too/articleshow/84107909.cms||George Mendonca

---||Jaipur||65% schools in Rajasthan didn’t have Net before pandemic hit: Survey||JAIPUR: Nearly 65 per cent of schools in the state did not have an internet connection during the academic year 2019-20 right before the pandemic, says the ministry of education report released recently. It exposes the state government’s tall claims about reaching out to every student through online classes when only 36% of schools have basic internet connection. Primary and upper primary schools have been closed since March 2020 and are relying on online modes of education. Experts have drawn conclusions from the UDISE 2019-20 report that a vast majority are unable to attend online classes considering that just 30% of schools have computers when the pandemic started. Out of 1,06,420 schools in the state, 46,965 have computers and 38,651 have internet connection. Hindu Singh Tamlore, sarpanch of Tamlore village in Barmer, said the village has a senior secondary school with a strength of 350 students with just one computer lying in a storeroom. “Internet comes with a phone connection with a minimum charge of Rs 300 against 1GB data per day. It is a bit expensive for the families here who come from low-income families. If we can have a computer lab in the school, students would have taken online education here,” said Tamlore. State award winner Girdhar Singh, principal of a government school in Malpura, is fortunate enough to have computers, internet and electricity connection in his village. “Several schools in nearby areas don’t have any of the facilities and have been struggling to carry on with online classes,” said Singh. The report says 23% of schools don’t have a power connection, forget about any other facilities. Educationist Damodar Goyal argued that the state should treat schools the way they are prioritising hospitals. He said, “Just as hospitals are being prepared for the third wave, schools should also be upgraded to at least run in a similar situation. Ramping up healthcare like purchasing oxygen concentrators, building oxygen plants etc should be complemented by providing computer labs and broadband connections in every school. If medical equipment will save lives, upgrade of schools will minimise the damage on learning.” Goyal said the government has to allow schools to open in a staggard manner considering that online education is a farce and would be the biggest injustice with students in low-income schools. The state has, however, made significant gains in the gender parity index only in the primary section with 101 girls for every 100 boys while it goes down in the upper primary with 94 and further goes below to 89 and 87 in the secondary and higher secondary levels. The concerted efforts have narrowed the gap between the secondary and higher secondary level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/65-schools-didnt-have-net-before-pandemic-hit-survey/articleshow/84103547.cms||Shoeb Khan

The council is planning to publish the results by the end of this month. JAC chairman Arvind Singh said, “Although the compilation of marks will take time, we will try our best to publish the results this month.” According to the standard operating procedures issued by JAC, 80% weightage will be given to Class IX results and Class XI results for students of Class X and Class XII, respectively. For science students, their practical exams’ marks will account for the rest 20%. Most of the schools are done with their practical and those that haven’t yet conducted them, will need the state disaster department’s permission before doing so. For students of other streams like commerce and humanities, the 20% weightage will be given to their internal exams, model test paper-based examinations, their attendance in classes IX and XI and their overall performance in exams. A committee comprising the respective school’s principal, a senior teacher, a teacher of the nearest school and an observer of the district education officer would determine the marks. The JAC guidelines stated that students dissatisfied with their results can apply for the cancellation of the results with the condition that that he or she will accept the marks attained during an examination held at a later date. A JAC official said that under the prevailing situation, holding class IX and XI exams has become an advantage. He added, “Since examinations of the base years have been held by JAC there is no issue of standardization of marks among the schools.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jac-asks-schools-to-submit-class-ix-xi-marks-by-july-13/articleshow/84101486.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Over 2 lakh Kolhan traders welcome Centre’s move to include them in MSME category||Jamshedpur: The over two-lakh traders of the Kolhan division welcomed the announcement of the Union government to include wholesale and retail traders in the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) category. Many traders' associations have said the move of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government would help the Covid-ravaged traders restore their business by availing necessary finances from banks and other financial institutions under the Priority Sector Lending (PSL) category, enjoyed by only MSMEs, so far. Suresh Sonthalia, the national secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said, "The announcement has come at an appropriate time. It would help eight crore wholesale and retail traders, including over two lakh traders of Kolhan who are hit by the Covid pandemic, revive their businesses by availing necessary finances from banks." He added that interest on loans availed under PSL is generally lower, ranging from 1% to 1.5% as compared to the interest charged on regular loans. Notably, traders were recognised under the MSME sector in the past but in 2017 the Union government excluded them on the ground that this sector did not contribute to the manufacturing activities. Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) general secretary Bharat Basani said, "Sustained campaigns and several representations to the government in the past four years by the trading community eventually yielded the encouraging result in the form of the inclusion of the wholesale and retail traders in the MSME sector." He said the benefit of the MSME tag is that every bank is under obligation to give 6% of its total loan amounts to the PSL category. A Jamshedpur Vastra Vikreta Sangh (JVVS) functionary, Anil Modi, said with retailers coming under the MSME ambit, they would now be eligible for the Pradhanmantri Mudra Loan Scheme. "Beneficiaries can avail loans up to Rs 10 lakh without any collateral security under the mudra loan scheme," Modi said. School books and study materials retailer, S N Pathak, said the government's announcement is positive but it remains to be seen whether they can also get the benefits from the banks without any hassle. He said normally, only recognised enterprises have access to bank finances in the past. "Banks have limited funds for PSL category loans. Therefore, we have to wait and see whether small applicants would get equal access to the funds or the existing traders alone would get them," Pathak added. A city-based ancillary unit owner said the competition for loans under the PSL category would intensify in the coming months. "Banks prefer to give loans to less risky ventures and retailing is less risky than setting up an ancillary unit. Hence, there is an apprehension that the traders might take away a chunk of the loans under the PSL category," the entrepreneur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/over-2-lakh-kolhan-traders-welcome-centres-move-to-include-them-in-msme-category/articleshow/84102890.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren announces Rs 2 crore for gold in Tokyo Olympics||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government will provide cash rewards of Rs 2 crore, Rs 1 crore and Rs 75 lakh to players who won gold, silver and bronze medals respectively in the Tokyo Olympics, chief minister Hemant Soren announced on Saturday. Interacting virtually with the players ahead of the Games scheduled later this month, Soren also announced Rs 50 lakh for archer Deepika Kumari for her golden stint in the recently concluded Archery World Cup Stage 3 in Paris, both in team and individual events while Rs 20 lakh each will be given to her two other teammates — Komolika Bari and Ankita Bhagat. Another Rs 15 lakh will be given to archery coach Purnima Mahto, who played a pivotal role for the gold-winning archery team in Paris. Soren further announced Rs 5 lakh each for hockey girls, Nikki Pradhan and Salima Tete, who are in Team India in the Tokyo Games as a token of appreciation and encouragement for putting up a good show. All players who received the rewards, the three Olympians and the coach were connected online during the interaction with Soren. Appreciating the players’ contribution, Soren said, “All of you are the pride of our state and the country and we are pinning great hopes on you again in the upcoming Olympics. The state government is committed to promoting sports and players and will do all that is possible in this regard.” Soren also informed them that the new sports policy prepared by the state focuses on the overall promotion of sports and players with a special focus on developing games from the grassroots. “We are working on the creation of facilities to groom players at the panchayat levels,” he added. Talking to TOI over the phone, Deepika hailed the government’s move and said they were encouraged by the chief minister’s appreciation and support. “It was a great interaction before the Olympics. I will do my best this time to clinch the gold,” she said, adding that such interactions often help in coping with pressure. She, however, refused to speak about her preparations for the Olympics and other topics, citing the code of conduct before the mega event. The troika of archers — Deepika Kumari, Komolika Bara and Ankita Bhagat — clinched the gold in the recently concluded stage three world cup in Paris in the women’s recurve category. Deepika also became world number 1 following her hat-trick of gold medals during the event in the individual category. On the other hand, Nikki Pradhan will be in the Indian Olympics team for the second time while Salima Tete will be taking part in the Games for the first time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/soren-announces-rs-rs-2cr-for-gold-in-tokyo-olympics/articleshow/84102930.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: ‘Want free milk? Shout a slogan’||VADODARA: Activists, who have also dabbled in politics, are coming up with novel ways to protest against the spiralling prices. They are distributing the commodity whose prices rise for free. Though, that is a common practice among political parties, the activists are carrying out the protests in a way that would embarrass the ruling BJP. The group ‘Team Revolution’ — that has so far raised voices against civic issues and worked extensively during situations like floods or Covid — has come up with unique agitations that are generating quite a bit of attention. The team distributed free petrol worth Rs 100 each to 310 persons. The only rider was that they had to be either BJP workers or someone who had voted for the BJP. “The price of petrol at that time was around Rs 95 per litre. Many people who took the free petrol admitted that they were supporters of the BJP. While most of them admitted that they had voted for the BJP,” said Shwejal Vyas who heads the group. With the milk prices going up, the group has immediately came up with a novel way of protest, by distributing free milk packets. The catch this time is that the number of bags a person gets will depend on his proximity with the officials of the ruling party. On Sunday, if a person chants ‘Ab ki baar mehngi sarkar’ he will get one packet. Selfies taken in the past with corporators, MLAs, CM and PM will make people eligible for two, three, five and 10 packets of milk respectively. Vyas said that the group decided to take up the issue as many in the ruling party were arguing that inflation seems to be affecting only those who are in opposition parties. “We want to show that people and even those who supported the BJP are affected by the rising prices,” said Vyas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/want-free-milk-shout-a-slogan/articleshow/84100414.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Lockdown, vaccination drive help bring down active caseload by over 7,140||RANCHI: After recording a steep surge in Covid-19 cases in the past few months, the number of cases has gone down in Jharkhand with the active caseload going down by 7,140 last month. As per the state health department data, Jharkhand had witnessed 8,054 active cases on June 1 which reduced to 914 on June 30. The fresh infection graph too has come down as state had reported 609 infections on June 1 and 85 on June 30. Experts believe that the strict lockdown and the vaccination drive helped Jharkhand overcome the second wave. Talking to TOI on the issue, professor of critical care and the in-charge at the trauma centre at the state-run Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, said, “The infection rate as well as the mortality rate came down last month and the lockdown is responsible. Also, people’s overall awareness regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour contributed to this well.” He added, “The patient inflow has also reduced to a minimum and we are keeping the Covid wards on standby. There was a time when people had to wait for hours to get a bed in ICU. Now we hardly have any Covid patient in ICU.” The virus was at its peak in Jharkhand between April 15 and May 15 as new variants were confirmed through genome sequencing of Covid-19 samples from the state. As per the state IDSP’s cell data, Jharkhand had reported the maximum number of active cases - 59,673 - on May 4. A few experts also believe that the decline in the transmission rate is a result of the high infection rate experienced during the second wave. “It is in the nature of any virus to mutate and it becomes more infectious after mutation which is why we saw an increase in the death rate during the peak of second wave. Even now there is an undercurrent transmission and people who haven’t been infected can be at risk. But the decline is a result of the vaccination drive as well as the lockdown s and if we are to experience a third wave this experience will be very helpful for the community,” public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rims, Dr Dewesh Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lockdown-vax-drive-help-bring-down-active-caseload-by-over-7k/articleshow/84102851.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand: Lockdown, vaccination drive help bring down active caseload by over 7,140||RANCHI: After recording a steep surge in Covid-19 cases in the past few months, the number of cases has gone down in Jharkhand with the active caseload going down by 7,140 last month. As per the state health department data, Jharkhand had witnessed 8,054 active cases on June 1 which reduced to 914 on June 30. The fresh infection graph too has come down as state had reported 609 infections on June 1 and 85 on June 30. Experts believe that the strict lockdown and the vaccination drive helped Jharkhand overcome the second wave. Talking to TOI on the issue, professor of critical care and the in-charge at the trauma centre at the state-run Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, said, “The infection rate as well as the mortality rate came down last month and the lockdown is responsible. Also, people’s overall awareness regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour contributed to this well.” He added, “The patient inflow has also reduced to a minimum and we are keeping the Covid wards on standby. There was a time when people had to wait for hours to get a bed in ICU. Now we hardly have any Covid patient in ICU.” The virus was at its peak in Jharkhand between April 15 and May 15 as new variants were confirmed through genome sequencing of Covid-19 samples from the state. As per the state IDSP’s cell data, Jharkhand had reported the maximum number of active cases - 59,673 - on May 4. A few experts also believe that the decline in the transmission rate is a result of the high infection rate experienced during the second wave. “It is in the nature of any virus to mutate and it becomes more infectious after mutation which is why we saw an increase in the death rate during the peak of second wave. Even now there is an undercurrent transmission and people who haven’t been infected can be at risk. But the decline is a result of the vaccination drive as well as the lockdown s and if we are to experience a third wave this experience will be very helpful for the community,” public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rims, Dr Dewesh Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/lockdown-vax-drive-help-bring-down-active-caseload-by-over-7k/articleshow/84111501.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Noida||Two die as car rams parked truck on Yamuna Expressway||GREATER NOIDA: Two persons were killed and six others injured, among them four minors, after their Ertiga crashed into a stationary truck on the Yamuna Expressway near the Jewar toll plaza in the early hours of Friday. Police suspect the one driving the vehicle dozed off at the wheel and failed to spot the truck parked along the Agra-Noida carriageway of the high-speed corridor, leading to the fatal crash. The accident occurred around 5am when Manoj Kumar and his family, along with their two friends, were returning to their home in Faridabad from their native Darbhanga district in Bihar. The impact of the accident was so severe that rescuers had to cut the mangled remains of the vehicle to pull out the two bodies trapped inside. While Manoj, his wife Sanju (38) and their four sons — Sachin (17), Prem (16), Chandan (11) and Vijay (5) — sustained injuries in the crash, his two friends — Amit, who was driving the Ertiga, and 60-year-old Suresh seated in the front — lost their lives. Manoj, an AC repairman, and his family have been staying in Faridabad for the past 10 years. Jewar SHO Umesh Bahadur told TOI that the Ertiga hit the parked truck from behind possibly because Amit had fallen asleep at the wheel due to the long drive. “The Ertiga crashed into the truck and then jumped the divider of the expressway near the Jewar toll plaza. The vehicle seemed to be travelling at a very high speed,” he said. In fact, the crash was so severe that the Ertiga was inseparable from the truck till the rescue team officials of the expressway had to cut off parts of the vehicle to remove the bodies of Amit and Suresh from inside. The others on the back seat of the vehicle too had to be pulled out with a lot of effort. The victims were rushed to Kailash hospital in Jewar, where Amit and Suresh were declared dead on arrival. Jewar police claimed to have seized the truck whose driver had parked it aside to take rest but did not put any precautionary barricading around the vehicle. “The driver was nowhere to be found. We are trying to identify him as well as the owner of the truck. An FIR has been lodged against the unknown truck driver,” SHO Bahadur said. In another accident, a speeding car fell into a ditch resulting in three persons suffering injuries in the Deri Maccha village of the Badalpur area of Greater Noida on Friday evening. “The three are undergoing treatment at a hospital,” a local police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/two-killed-after-ertiga-hits-stationary-truck-on-yamuna-e-way/articleshow/84103860.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Goa||Green body wants inventory, annually updated list of structures in CRZ areas||Panaji: After receiving frequent applications from Goa seeking action against CRZ violations, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in an order has asked the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) to prepare an inventory of structures in CRZ areas. The Tribunal has asked the coastal authority to carry out an independent annual survey and update these list of structures existing in CRZ areas. The NGT has said that the GCZMA cannot only work based on complaints, which can lead to only selective action against violations. “GCZMA appears to be working only on the basis of complaints against illegal structures and large number of illegal structures continue to exist inspite of directions of the high court. It may be desirable to have an inventory prepared in respect of such structures based on an independent annual survey, to be updated periodically to avoid selective action against the violations of the CRZ,” the NGT has ruled. The GCZMA has been asked to come out with a monitoring mechanism for CRZ violations. “An effective monitoring mechanism needs to be set up by GCZMA to advance the rule of law,” the Tribunal has ruled. The NGT was hearing an appeal filed by the owner of a restaurant in Betalbatim, against who GCZMA had issued an order of demolition for an illegal construction. The Tribunal found that the Betalbatim structure existed in violation of laws in CRZ area, where it was constructed post 1991. “There is nothing to show that any authorised structure existed previously. All the documents relied upon have been found to be post 1991. In the survey plan prepared in 2014, no structure was found in existence. In the sale deed of 1992 and 2010, in respect of the property in question, no structure was mentioned. Documents relating to a temporary structure, relied upon by the appellant, were not from any authorised authority, but by village panchayat,” the NGT noted. In the order, the Tribunal also cited its orders against previous such cases of violations in CRZ areas in Goa. The high court of Bombay at Goa has been monitoring action against illegal structures in the CRZ area. Based on an order passed by the high court, the GCZMA constituted an inquiry committee on whose findings action was initiated against illegal constructions falling in CRZ areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/green-body-wants-inventory-annually-updated-list-of-structures-in-crz-areas/articleshow/84103895.cms||---

---||Goa||Nadda likely to visit state next week||Panaji: With fewer than seven months to go for the state assembly elections, BJP president J P Nadda is likely to visit the state next week to take stock of the political situation in Goa, and to define the contours of the party’s election strategy. Even as opposition parties are rallying against the government for its mismanagement during the pandemic, BJP too has been caught in a fix, with internal rebellion between senior functionaries and newcomers, as well as environmental issues. Nadda will arrive on July 11 or 12, said state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade. Here, he is likely to discuss the issue of pre-poll alliances with like-minded parties, as well as BJP’s own functionaries. He is also likely to meet booth-level workers, attend mandal and office-bearer meetings. While BJP may not face a direct challenge from the opposition, Nadda is likely to review the strength of the challenger parties and discuss how to counter them. TOI has earlier reported that the party’s state executive committee decided to contest the next assembly election independently (on its own strength) but also to “keep the gates open”. Even so, this decision is likely to be discussed with Nadda before a final call is taken. In 2012, when BJP contested election in alliance with MGP, it resulted in an absolute majority. However, in 2017, when BJP went it alone, its strength in the 40-member house dropped from 21 to 13. Union Ayush minister Shripad Naik has said that the party can think of forging an alliance for the next assembly elections. After Nadda tested positive for Covid-19, his two-day visit to the state has been postponed. He was scheduled to arrive on December 20 as part of his nationwide visit after taking over as president of the party. At its state executive meeting, which was held last week, BJP focused on boosting the morale of the cadre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nadda-likely-to-visit-state-next-week/articleshow/84104319.cms||---
---||Goa||‘BJP’s new entrants doing fine job’||Margao: National general secretary of BJP in-charge of Goa C T Ravi on Saturday dismissed the probability of the party suffering reverses in the 2022 assembly polls on account of resentment among voters over the party’s move of inducting 10 Congress MLAs into its fold. “All the new entrants into our party are doing a fine job. For the first time, BJP has won all the local elections – zilla panchayats, municipal councils, panchayats – by winning most number of seats,” Ravi said exuding confidence that the issue of defection will not have any adverse impact on the party. Ravi made these statements while speaking at a press conference held at the party’s South Goa district office, Margao, before the commencement of the party’s district executive committee. State party president Sadanand Tanavade, general secretary Narendra Sawaikar, deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar and Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar,were among those present on the occasion. To another query over whether the defectors would be awarded tickets by the party to contest the 2022 polls, Ravi said that it would be decided by the parliamentary board based on the party’s internal system to assess the strength and popularity of the prospective candidates. “Once a person joins our party, he belongs to our party; there’s no question of any other party,” he said in a bid to suggest that the Congress turncoats have been thoroughly assimilated into the saffron party. To a query over the party’s poll preparedness, Ravi said that winning elections wasn’t the party’s be-all and end-all. “Making the country strong is our ultimate goal, power is only a means towards that end,” he said. Answering a question over rising fuel prices, Ravi said that the Modi government was exploring various options to make India “atmanirbhar” in petroleum products too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjps-new-entrants-doing-fine-job/articleshow/84104367.cms||---
---||Goa||AAP launches ‘Lets clean Goa politics’ drive||PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday launched a ‘mega’ political campaign ‘Lets clean Goa politics’ to mark the month two years ago when 10 Congress MLAs defected to BJP. Calling it the “biggest betrayal in the history of Goan politics”, AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chaddha launched the campaign and asked the people to boycott Congress and BJP at the 2022 assembly elections. Asked whether AAP would accept politicians from Congress or BJP, Chaddha said that the party only accepts people who are upright, who don’t have any corruption charges or criminal background. “We don’t want people who work for their own and their family’s welfare. However, there may be some very good people in those parties also who are also doing social work and not just working for themselves. These people whose ideology matches with ours and who are ready to work, are certainly welcome into the party,” he said. Asked whether AAP will admit any of the 40 MLAs, he said that he will “not comment on individuals as a matter of policy”. “We are commenting on a larger malice, a disease that is plaguing Goan politics,” Chaddha said. He also declined to comment on strategies and alliances the party is considering. While launching the website letscleangoapolitics.org, Chaddha said there are two types of people who feel betrayed by the defection of the 10 MLAs – those who voted for Congress and those who voted for BJP. “Today, voting for Congress is equal to voting for BJP and therefore the people have come together to pledge that they will not vote for Congress,” he said. “They are also pledging to defeat BJP in the next election because BJP stole their democracy, their Constitution and destroyed by indulging in horse trading, the legacy of Jack Sequeira, Manohar Parrikar, of Bhausaheb Bandodkar and today people of Goa are going to pledge that we will not even vote for BJP. We will show them their place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-launches-lets-clean-goa-politics-drive/articleshow/84104423.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala government ‘review’ of Covid deaths mere eyewash, say experts||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government is still shying away from reviewing all deaths that occurred during the pandemic period. The health department has decided to only review all Covid deaths declared by district administrations since there were reports that they varied from the state data. Experts insist the review of Covid deaths recorded by district health administrations alone will not be sufficient. “The issue is not about not reporting Covid deaths but it is about excluding deaths from the list,’’ says Dr Anoop Kumar A S of Baby Memorial Hospital, a public health expert. There were widespread allegations that there are vast differences in Covid deaths reported by districts and state daily. Now, the health department has asked all DMOs to submit this list within three days. “There is no point in demanding this list. The basic issue is the state is not following ICMR and WHO guidelines. There is a clause in ICMR guidelines that a fatality can be declared as ‘probable Covid deaths’ if the patient is not positive but has all possible Covid symptoms. Can the state government show a single death which has been declared in this manner,’’ asked Dr Arun N M, an internal medicine expert who has been tracking Covid deaths in the state. Treating doctor must declare death, says experts Health minister Veena George had claimed that to bring in more transparency, now deaths are being determined at the district level itself and not by the state-level committee. “The appointment of the state-level committee to determine deaths itself was against ICMR guidelines. Nowhere in the guidelines, it is mentioned that a committee has to be set up to declare deaths. The fatalities have to be declared by the treating doctors,” said Dr S S Lal, public health expert. Dr Lal is of the opinion that the entire list of deaths that has come before the state committee will have to be published to know whether there was any transparency in declaring deaths. “The government is shying away from the review since the addition of thousands of deaths will put the government in a fix. The government will have to face the wrath of people for covering up thousands of deaths. So they will not be ready for it,” he said. However, Dr Anoop Kumar is of the view that every treating doctor or the hospital has given a death certificate or a treatment certificate in which it would have been clearly mentioned whether it was a Covid death. “When it comes to getting compensation if the family goes with this certificate, then the government will be in trouble,” he said. If a patient goes to court with this certificate, then the government will be forced to review all deaths. The minister is now claiming that there are no complaints. The complaints will come once you announce compensation, Dr Lal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-government-review-of-covid-deaths-mere-eyewash-say-experts/articleshow/84107794.cms||---

But when Bandish Shah learnt that a winged guest had made its abode right on the top of the bungee jumping platform in the resort, he took an unusual step. Shah, a nature lover, decided to shut the bungee jumping platform for all the visitors. “An Indian pitta couple has made a nest on the corner of the platform. If I keep it open for the adventure sports lovers, the nest would have got damaged or the movement would disturb the birds. After giving it a thought, I closed it down a month ago,” Shah told TOI. “The Indian pitta first has a courtship period and once the male and female come together, they build a nest. I noticed the nest coming up on the 50-feet high platform a month-and-a-half ago when we were preparing to throw open the spot for adventure lovers,” said Shah, who is also a sitting councillor from Vadodara. And to his joy, the Indian pitta has laid six eggs in the nest. “With second wave of Covid ebbing, visitors have begun flocking our place. But we will open bungee jumping only after in August when the birds will fly away with their babies,” 57-year-old Shah said and added that another Indian pitta couple is building a nest near their Tyre Tumble ride in the resort. “We have closed it down too,” he said. “Indian pitta usually builds nests only on trees. It rarely makes nests on such man-made platforms or poles,” said Kartik Upadhyay, an avid bird watcher. When asked about incurring losses, Shah said, “I started this place for eco-tourism and not just for business. I can always earn profits from these rides later. My resort is spread over 130 acres out of which only 11 acres has construction. The rest of the land is covered with dense trees where about 155 species of birds have been recorded.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/for-indian-pitta-nest-resort-shuts-bungee-jumping/articleshow/84099309.cms||Tushar Tere

On Saturday only second dose of Covaxin was being administered in the state. There were a total of around 3 lakh people who had taken the first dose of Covaxin and were eligible for the second dose of the vaccine. Vaccination was carried out at around 2,000 centres and an aim of vaccinating around 3 lakh people was set. As per the official sources around 2.65 vaccine doses were administered till the information available at around 8 pm. However sources said that a total of around 2.72 lakh people were administered doses of the vaccine on Saturday as in some places there was no network connectivity, vaccination records were maintained offline and entries were being made till late in the night. Sources said that on Sunday Covid-19 vaccination will not carried out at government facilities and on Monday vaccination of the second dose to the eligible beneficiaries who have already been administered with the first dose of Covisheild vaccine will be carried out in the state. Around 5 lakh vaccine doses will be available and the target will be to administer, second dose of Covisheild vaccine to between 4.5 lakh and 5 lakh beneficiaries, said sources from the health department. Due to the shortage of vaccines and also due to the pressure of administering second dose to the beneficiaries, government is now focusing on administering the second dose of vaccine to the eligible beneficiaries too, so specialised drives are being carried out for administering second dose, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/2-65-lakh-vaccinated-in-madhya-pradesh-in-a-day-drive-for-second-dose-from-monday/articleshow/84107825.cms||---
---||Mumbai||In April-May, 54 lakh left Maharashtra in trains, less than 50% came back||MUMBAI: As many as 54.4 lakh people left Maharashtra by rail in April and May when the state was under lockdown-style curbs, according to data with the state labour commissioner. In June, when the state government started lifting the restrictions, 26 lakh people returned till the 22nd of the month—less than half of the number that had left in the summer months. Although migrants may not account for all the passenger movement, the numbers provide an indication of the migrant exodus and return. Officials said the return in June may be slow because sectors, like hospitality and retail, have not opened completely. The labour department received details on passenger exit and entry into the state from the Indian Railways. Of the 54.4 lakh people who left the state in April and May, the largest share of 18 lakh or 33% were bound for Uttar Pradesh, followed by 6.4 lakh for Bihar, 5.2 lakh for Gujarat and 3.8 lakh for West Bengal. Of the 26 lakh people who returned between June 1 and 22, 8.4 lakh were from UP, 3.3 lakh from Gujarat, 2 lakh from Bihar and 1.6 lakh from Rajasthan. “Typically, a large number of people leave the state for their home states in the summer months because of school holidays and weddings. The return is not yet in the same number possibly because of curbs both in other states and in Maharashtra,” said additional labour commissioner Shirin Lokhande. “The migrant return may also have been affected because of concerns about a third wave. People may be worried that they would have to return home again if there are new restrictions,” he added. Sectors like manufacturing and construction were functioning throughout the lockdownlike restrictions. In the construction sector, most migrant workers are back. “Roughly 30% of migrants left for their hometowns as they do each year in the summer. Around 90% of them are back because work in this sector has not stopped,” said Deepak Goradia, president of the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry. However, the retail and restaurant trade is waiting before calling migrant workers back. “We are functioning with a staff strength of 40%, mainly workers from the city...Our sector is not fully open and we cannot afford to pay for additional staff,” said Viren Shah from the Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association. Restaurant and bar owners in the state too are operating with just 20% staff strength and are reluctant to call their workers back from their hometowns, said Shivanand Shetty, president of the Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association. “We are in touch with our migrant staff who are willing to return from their native place, but with all the operational restrictions on the industry, there is a huge cloud of uncertainty,” Shetty said. He further said that the hotel trade is facing a shortage of unskilled workers who have taken up work in the construction sector or other odd jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-april-may-54-lakh-left-maharashtra-in-trains-less-than-50-came-back/articleshow/84107844.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Kochi||MVD survey identifies 134 obstructions on Ernakulam district roads||KOCHI: Motor vehicles department (MVD) has identified as many as 134 obstructions which affect the view of motorists on 12 roads in Ernakulam RTO limit. The obstructions were identified after an audit by six squads. Each squad of motor vehicle inspectors studied two main roads in their limits. The audit was conducted based on a Kerala high court order in 2018 directing authorities concerned to remove all obstructions causing threat to road safety. Of the total obstructions, 85 are thick vegetation on roadsides. Other obstructions identified are medians at eight locations, electric transformers at 18 locations, electric poles at 22 points, concrete debris at eight points. Besides these, five locations require signal lights and sign boards, and road surface and median need to be rectified at 15 locations. Vegetation have been noticed mostly on highways. Though local bodies are entrusted with the task of clearing the vegetation on roadsides, MVD officials feel that LSGDs are not taking the matter seriously. “The survey to identify the obstructions was conducted along 12 road stretches, including Varapuzha Junction-Vyttila flyover, Kalamassery-Vyttila Metro station, Thoppumpady BOT Road and Palluruthy Road towards Fort Kochi. There is no footpath along Palluruthy Road. There is no space for constructing one along the stretch. Four locations on the 300m stretch between Palluruthy police station and Veli ground are accident prone. As both sides of the road are crowded with shops, land acquisition is not possible to widen the road. We can only propose construction of footpath along the stretch as no immediate measure is possible,” said Ernakulam RTO Shabeer. Varapuzha Junction has many issues, including thick vegetation. Transformers are jutted out into the road at Palarivattom and Alinchuvadu junctions. Pookkattupady Junction and Metro pillars 369 and 383 are some of the locations where electric poles pose threat to smooth movement of vehicles. Motor vehicle inspectors say in the survey report that two intersections along the road between Paravur and Varapuzha bridge is highly dangerous due to thick vegetation and it is difficult to drive even during day. Motorists are unable to see vehicles entering the main road from the two intersections. MVD will place a detailed proposal before road safety authority for taking decision on measures to be taken to undertake road safety measures. Respective departments will also be intimated on removing the obstructions. The survey on remaining roads will also be conducted later. It has been noted that the obstructions will be much severe on interior roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mvd-survey-identifies-134-obstructions-on-ernakulam-district-roads/articleshow/84107928.cms||T C Sreemol

As the number of cases dip in the city and restrictions imposed on markets and transportation ease, these couples are looking for alternative dates in the coming few weeks to tie the knot. They are in touch with the vendors and venues they had earlier booked to renegotiate the deals. Pallavi Vasandani and Samay Singhania were to get married on June 4 but had to call off the wedding at the last minute as cases surged. They will now take their vows on July 7. While Samay is fully vaccinated, Pallavi has received her first shot. Most of their guests, too, have received at least the first dose. “The invitation cards had gone out and we had done our pre-wedding shoot. It was a very difficult decision to cancel the wedding as everything was ready. Even now, many of our close relatives from other cities and countries will not be able to attend but we have decided to go ahead with the wedding as the situation is uncertain and health experts are saying a third wave might hit us anytime,” said Pallavi. Srijita Roy and Soumik Ganguly of Lake Town were to tie the knot on May 29 but had to call off the ceremony when several members of both their families got infected. They have now decided to get their marriage registered on July 11 and thereafter host a family lunch. A party has tentatively been planned for December. “Only 24 people from both the families will be attending our wedding. Some have just recovered from Covid while others have been vaccinated. Both of us have also received our first dose. It will be a simple ceremony with registry marriage followed by a family lunch though we would have loved to create more memories on this occasion. A wedding gala is being planned in December,” said Soumik. Oindrila Bhol and Anshuman Bhattacharya have had to cancel their wedding several times since March 2020 when the country went into a lockdown. They were thinking of tying the knot earlier this year, but the second wave struck. “Now we are trying to go ahead and get married before the third wave hits. I do not want to postpone it further,” said Oindrila. Shashi Ahluwalia, who is getting married on July 24, cannot have a big fat wedding since the government guidelines permit only 50 guests but has decided not to cut down on ceremonies like mehendi and sangeet. “We will have all the ceremonies but with separate sets of guests so that everybody can come and bless us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-couples-race-to-tie-knot-before-3rd-wave/articleshow/84103705.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Trinamool delegation to meet President for removal of solicitor general||KOLKATA: A Trinamool Congress delegation is likely to meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday seeking the removal of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, whose reported meeting with Bengal opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari, the party claimed, “reeks of impropriety”. The delegation is also likely to submit a memorandum signed by MPs Derek O’Brien, Mahua Moitra and Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, who had earlier written to PM Narendra Modi on the same issue. The developments coincided with an RTI application also being filed with the legal affairs department seeking to know whether Mehta met Adhikari and if video footages had been called for after the three TMC MPs wrote to Modi. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on Friday, responding to Mehta’s statement that he didn’t meet Adhikari, had asked for CCTV footage, attaching a video to his tweet showing Adhikari driving into Mehta’s residence. Moitra also harped on this issue, tweeting: “Narada accused enters home of SG (who is also Special PP, CBI in Narada case) in vehicle, is checked & waved inside by security guards & exits after 30 mins. They say nothing happened. Yeah, right.” Ray said, “Can an accused go to the solicitor general’s house without any intimation? Does Tushar Mehta-ji offer tea to people involved in criminal cases at his residence?” He added: “A delegation of TMC will be meeting President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday at 12.30 pm. We will discuss our issues with him and submit a memorandum.” A senior MP, refusing to be named, said: “Apart from being the constitutional head, the President is also a distinguished lawyer.” The MP also said, “TMC will raise this issue in Parliament, which is likely to convene in two weeks.” Mehta had on Friday denied meeting the BJP leader and clarified that Adhikari had come to his residence “unannounced”. Adhikari, too, claimed he had gone to the Mehta residence but could not meet him. To this, Moitra had tweeted, “Z category BJP protectee enters high security official residence of Solicitor General of India “uninvited”, waits 20 mins over a cup of tea & apparently leaves without a mtng. CCTV footage to back your version, Mr. SG? Truth never been your forte!” In the letter to the PM, the three MPs wrote the meeting “curiously” took place subsequent to Adhikari’s deliberation with Union home minister Amit Shah. “The meeting between Adhikari and the solicitor general not only reeks of impropriety, there is a direct conflict of interest and also taints the position of the second highest law officer of the country, the Solicitor General,” it read. “We have, therefore, reasons to believe that such a meeting has been organised to influence the outcome of matters where Suvendu Adhikari is an accused, using the high offices of the Learned Solicitor General,” the letter stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-delegation-to-meet-president-for-removal-of-sg/articleshow/84103235.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BJP protests in Kolkata over fake vaccination camps||KOLKATA: The Bengal BJP is stepping up heat on the Trinamool Congress government over fake Covid vaccination camps, particularly after the health ministry sought a detailed report from the state. BJP workers on Saturday took out protest rallies and staged demonstrations in Kalighat, Victoria Memorial, Birla Planetarium, Elgin Road, National Library, Alipore Zoological Garden and Rabindra Sadan areas of the city. The party’s Yuva Morcha has planned yet another demonstration in front of the KMC headquarters on Monday afternoon. Leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari and BJP’s Hooghly MP Locket Chatterjee had called on Union health minister Harsh Vardhan earlier this week to complain about “irregularities” in the vaccination drive. Chatterjee had claimed that people were being charged a premium at “these unregistered camps”. Vardhan said the Centre hadn’t authorised the state government to launch a separate digital platform for vaccination. “Over 90 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses will be made available to Bengal in July, out of which 67.5 lakh shall be free of cost under the Government of India channel,” the minister tweeted. The health ministry also noted that vaccination camps in the state were being organised without following mandatory guidelines on the correct inoculation procedure, data recording and issuing of certificates. “The Trinamool would have passed on the blame to the Narendra Modi government hadn’t its party MP (Mimi Chakraborty) spotted fake vaccines by mistake,” state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-protests-in-kol-over-fake-vax-camps/articleshow/84103126.cms||---

Home ministry under secretary Sanjeev Kumar has written to AP chief secretary Adityanath Das, referring the letters written by the MP against Sunil Kumar, who is the chief of AP CID. He also sent copies of the letters and the video clips sent by the MP, who has alleged that the IPS officer was spreading communal hatred in the state by attending prayer meetings of one faith and speaking against other faiths, and sought action against him. Krishnam Raju wrote three letters to the home ministry in June this year, after he was released on bail following his arrest in a sedition case. He was arrested by the CID headed by Sunil Kumar, on the charge of sedition that the MP was speaking against the government and instigating communal unrest in the state. The MP alleged that he was beaten up by CID cops while he was in their custody, and showed some injuries to his legs. After his release on bail, he wrote letters seeking action against the CID chief. The home ministry has asked the chief secretary to “take a decision in the matter as deemed fit” and send the action taken report (ATR) to the ministry at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/home-ministry-refers-rebel-mp-kanumuri-raghurama-krishnam-rajus-complaint-against-cid-chief-to-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/84108002.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: 14-year-old girl gangraped for months by three minors and a 21-year-old||BHOPAL: A 14-year-old girl in Bhopal was gang-raped by three minors and a 21-year old man for months, and the horror came to light only when she got pregnant and couldn’t hide it from her parents any longer. Police have taken all the accused -- including the schoolboys aged 14-15 -- in custody. Investigators have found that one of the minors saw her talking to a youth and began blackmailing her into gangrape on the threat of defaming her in the locality. The girl, a class 9 student, has told police that she used to chat with a youth who worked at a construction site near her home in October last year. According to her complaint, one of her neighbours, a 14-year-old, saw them together and began threatening to ‘spoil her name’ unless she gave in to his demand for sexual relations, investigation officer SI Sanjeev Dhakad said. He took her to her grandmother's house, where he raped her. Three to four days later, he brought a friend along and the two gangraped her. This continued under blackmail all through October, said Dhakad. Under pressure, the girl didn’t tell her family about the torture she was going through. In November, the first two boys forcibly took the girl to the house of one of their classmates, where a 21-year-old man was also waiting, and the four of them took turns to rape her. One of the schoolboys would stand watch as the others raped her, says the complaint. The four gangraped her repeatedly after that, said SI Dhakad. The sexual assaults stopped only when she got pregnant. They threatened to post videos of her rapes on social media if she told anyone about it. For months, she hid it from her family. It was only a few days ago that the parents noticed changes in her body, and took her to a doctor. They were shocked to know she was six months pregnant. On Friday, they approached Ratibad police and filed a complaint. Dhakad said the boys were remanded in a juvenile home, and the 21-year-old has been sent to jail. The survivor has undergone a medical examination and is being counselled.

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: TP Chandrasekharan murder convict’s house searched in Kannur||KOZHIKODE: Hinting at a link between T P Chandrasekharan murder case convicts and the Karipur gold smuggling case, the headquarters preventive unit of the Customs department probing the smuggling of gold through the Karipur airport on Saturday held evidence collection at houses of TP murder convicts Kodi Suni and Muhammad Shafi. The searches were conducted as part of the evidence collection along with prime accused Arjun Ayanki in Kannur as per his statements. Sources said that Ayanki had given a statement before the Customs that Suni and Shafi had helped him rob smuggled gold in the past. He also reportedly claimed that they helped him to stay at large. A notice has been issued to Shafi to appear for questioning based on the statements. The officials had first gone to Shafi’s house in Chokli and subsequently to Suni’s house. A laptop, pen drive and a digital camera and memory cards are learnt to have been seized from Shafi’s house. A metallic star symbol, usually seen on uniforms was also found from the house. However, the house of Suni was found to be locked and no search was conducted there. Suni is presently lodged in prison while Shafi is out on parole. During the evidence collection, Ayanki corrected his earlier statement that he had lost his phone while trying to shift his car. Instead, he had told the officers that he threw the phone in the Valapattanam river. His correction came following the evidence collection at Azhikode. Customs sleuths conducted evidence collection from the area near the river where he claimed to have disposed of his phone. The team also visited the premises of the factory where a car, suspected to have been used for transporting smuggled gold, was found. Customs also searched the house of Ayanki at Kappakadavu, Kannur, and seized ATM cards and documents. They asked questions to his wife and has summoned her for statement collection, sources said. A notice of summons has been issued to Yusuf, a friend of Ayanki, as well. Ayanki remained in a car outside while the search progressed at his house. Sources said that more arrests are likely in the case. Although Ayanki, sources said, was admitting to robbing smuggled gold in the past, he was yet to give a statement that he went to Karipur on the day of the crime to collect gold. Ayanki was summoned by Customs through a notice under the Customs Act on Monday and his arrest was recorded after a detailed statement collection. The case pertains to the arrest of one Mohammed Shafeeque with 2.3kg of gold worth around 1.11 crore on June 21 at Karipur airport. He had given a statement to Customs, detailing the involvement of Ayanki. The involvement of Ayanki had become sensational due to his alleged links with members of CPM. Soon, after Shafeeque was intercepted by Customs, another gang which had assembled with the aim to rob gold brought in by a person who was arriving from abroad at Karipur had met with an accident at Ramanattukara, in which five were killed. The accident reportedly happened when the gang was chasing a car due to a misunderstanding that the passenger they were waiting for, went to Kannur in that car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/tp-murder-convicts-house-searched/articleshow/84103812.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Higher education department to promote digital LMS in colleges||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The higher education department is on a mission to pivot on the devastating Covid-19 pandemic to recast the way academic transaction and evaluation of students and teachers takes place in higher education institutions in the state. As a first step towards ushering in change in the sector, the government has taken an in-principle decision to encourage the use of customised and computer-based Learning Management System (LMS) in all higher education institutions. At least 300 colleges, irrespective of the government/aided distinction, would soon be given access to the computer-based learning system that would hopefully stave off the adverse impact of rote learning system entrenched in the academic discourse. “If we really want to address the quality erosion in the higher education sector, we would need to explore the possibilities of technology-enabled teaching-learning mechanisms. We have started working out a strategy in consultation with several other governmental organizations and agencies. We will go ahead with the plans by taking all stakeholders into confidence,” said higher education minister R Bindhu. The minister had on Friday held talks with a panel of experts on how to go ahead with the initiative. Sources said the higher education council has agreed to take forward the initiative to make customised LMS available to at least 300 select colleges on a pilot basis. It would also ramp up the teacher training process to help college/ university faculties to learn how to use the digital medium for mentoring students. “The online education, practised in its current form, is hugely distorted. Speaking into the microphone alone doesn’t do justice to the concept and potential of online learning. The focus should be on students and there should be mechanisms to evaluate the academic growth of students and the success of teachers. Unless the deviations are addressed, it would set a bad precedent,” said higher education council vice-chairman Rajan Gurukkal. In the customised LMS to be hosted in the computer network cloud of higher education council, there will be a number of options to enhance the quality of academic transactions. “The system would have a mechanism enabling students to rate the mentoring capabilities of their teachers. Only such an open approach could salvage higher education,” he said. The higher education council has already given training to several higher education faculties and is about to impart such lessons to 800 more teachers. “The lack of LMS is not the only problem. There are connectivity and gadget issues. We need to address the issue holistically,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-higher-education-department-to-promote-digital-lms-in-colleges/articleshow/84108034.cms||B S Anilkumar

---||Bhopal||Masks vanish, distances blur as Covid SOPs in Bhopal get a risky bypass||BHOPAL: Like after the end of the first wave of Covid-19, masks have disappeared from faces in Bhopal. This may invite another wave of Covid, experts fear. Bhopal has seen a sudden drop in the last few days but the way people have come out of homes after unlocking began, without following Covid protocols. After witnessing hundreds of deaths due to Covid-19, the situation in the past couple of days has remained under control. The state government too has also allowed the reopening of several works except educational institutions. However, with the unlocking, people wearing masks and that too covering the nose, are now seldom seen on the city streets. Whether it is a market or any other public place, the majority of the people could be seen without masks. Such is the situation that people even start fighting if someone asks them to wear masks. “Covid has left. I am not saying it but it is the data which suggests that the positive have come down to even in single digit. Let me take fresh air,” said a woman at Piplani market when she was asked why she was not wearing a mask. The rule of not allowing entry in shops to anyone not wearing a mask, is also been sidelined. When asked why shopkeepers are selling the products to those who are not wearing masks, shopkeepers said that they can’t bear more losses. “What do you expect from us? We have incurred huge losses after the second lockdown in the past two months. In such a situation, is it possible for me to start saying no to customers if they are not wearing masks? I do have to feed my family,” said Kishan Lal, a shopkeeper in Kolar. Even those who could be seen with the masks are for the hack of formality only. “I have seen even the police have stopped fining people. Earlier, a helmet was hanging in the hands of the riders instead of their heads, now it is a mask which is available with everyone but they only wear it when they see there is police checking,” said Om Prakash, a retired bank officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/masks-vanish-distances-blur-as-covid-sops-in-bhopal-get-a-risky-bypass/articleshow/84108114.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Nod for prosecution of seven in Muslim trader attack||CHANDIGARH: Almost four years after a Muslim trader from Uttar Pradesh was slapped by right-wing Bajrang Dal activists outside the Hisar mosque for not chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai,” the Haryana coalition government led by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar finally accorded sanction to prosecute the seven accused. The Haryana home department, which is headed by Anil Vij, recently granted sanction to prosecute the 7 accused, Bhupender, Joginder, Kapil Vats, Mohar Singh, Amar, Anil Kumar and Prem. As the charges against these accused included Section 295-A (hurting religious feelings), permission under Section 196 of CrPC was required from the state’s home department to start the prosecution. The case was registered against these right-wing activists on July 11, 2017 and the prosecution agency in Hisar had sought sanction from the home department on August 19, 2017. Court seeks status reportThe trial of the case has been at a standstill since 2017 and now we have been informed that the state government has granted sanction to prosecute the accused, and the trial would now start,” said advocate Vikram Mittal, the counsel for the complainant in this case. He said that now the trial court has sought the status report to confirm whether the accused in this case had joined the investigation and if any issue regarding the accused was pending before the Punjab and Haryana high court. The Haryana government had filed the prosecution sanction in the case before the local court in March when the courts were hearing cases on a restrictive mode due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the petitioner’s side came to know about the sanction on Friday. On July 11, 2017, Mohammed Haroon Kasni, a trader from Uttar Pradesh, was allegedly slapped when he refused to repeat “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” during a protest outside the city mosque by Bajrang Dal activists in Hisar against the attack on Amarnath pilgrims in the Kashmir Valley. The trader from Saharanpur had come to the mosque to offer prayers at the same time when the Bajrang Dal activists were protesting. A case was registered for rioting, unlawful assembly, hurting religious feelings, promoting enmity between groups, assault, and criminal intimidation at Hisar police station. As per the complaint by Abid Hussain, the caretaker of the local mosque, a mob of 100-150 persons raised slogans outside the mosque and hit the gate of the mosque, pelted stones. They also attacked a person who had come to the mosque to offer namaaz. The police had later arrested Anil Kumar and Kapil Vats. Both were, however, released on bail by the HC in October 2017. Later, the arrest of the other accused was also stayed by the HC which also directed them to join the police investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nod-for-prosecution-of-7-in-muslim-trader-attack/articleshow/84108068.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh government to make fresh bid for disposal of Carbide waste||BHOPAL: After its unsuccessful moves the the past, the gas relief and rehablitation department has decided to float fresh tender inviting bids for disposal of the toxic Carbide waste lying in the deserted Union Carbide factory. The move comes amid raging controversy over state government’s proposal to dispose of 337 metric tonne of toxic waste stacked and to subsequently start work on converting the plant site into a memorial, It may also add a clause saying if any additional chemical waste is found on the Carbide premises, the company concerned would be liable to dispose of that, too. Director, gas relief, Basant Kurre, told TOI,” We had floated a tender in April this year inviting proposals for disposal of 337 metric tonne of waste, but the response was not very good. So, we are going to float a fresh tender for the purpose. In view of the apprehensions expressed that there could be toxic waste buried under the soil of the premises as well." Kurre, however, suggested that this apprehension expressed by the NGOs may not be true as the issue was examined by prestigious institutions like NEERI that submitted opinion in the court. NGOs working among the gas victims pointed out that, NEERI in its report, had admitted that toxic waste was buried at 21 places on the Union Carbide premises and residual toxic waste was also there at the solar pond site, where Union Carbide factory used to dump its waste at some distance from the unit. The chemical waste on the soil of the premises and the solar pond could be in thousands of tonnes, they argue. "The packaged waste lying in the premises is harmless. Even if it's not disposed of and kept there safely, there is no problem. Clean up of the Union Carbide site involves a comprehensive study on the amount of toxic waste lying in the Carbide premises and the solar evaporation ponds and then taking up remediation of the site. NEERI didn't say that there is no chemical waste in the soil of the Union Carbide premises or it's not contaminating the underground water but its study was not comprehensive. It didn't measure the length and depth, where chemical waste from Union Carbide plan could have reached," said co-convener of Bhopal Group for Information & Action (BGIA), Rachna Dhingra. Dhingra further pointed out that the supreme court intervened to get clean top water supply in colonies adjacent to the Union Carbide plan because of the contamination of underground water due to chemical waste left behind by the Union Carbide company on the premises and the solar evaporation pond. The colonies initially were 12 and have now gone up to 48 by now, she said. "We go by the records. We don’t have any mechanism to find out whether the soil or water is contaminated or not. But, institutions, which have the know-how to say anything with definiteness on the issue, have given their opinion to the supreme court and if need be, the additional chemical waste would also be disposed of. We are not going to dispose of only a fraction of the waste and allow the bulk of waste to remain there. But, we assume that even if chemical waste was there is the soil, 36 years after the gas tragedy and closure of the Union Carbide plan, it must have become ineffective," Kurre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-government-to-make-fresh-bid-for-disposal-of-carbide-waste/articleshow/84108147.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh’s public-participation model appreciated by PM Modi, says CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday said there is immense potential in cooperatives. He said, “Cooperatives give the feeling that work can be done together and for the good of all and our good is in the good of all. Be it managing the challenges of corona infection or establishing livelihood of people, the principle of cooperation leads to solution”. Chouhan was addressing a programme titled ‘Better Rebuilding through Cooperatives’ on the occasion of Cooperatives Day, organised at the Samanvay Bhawan here on Saturday. Chouhan digitally dedicated 55 godowns and laid foundation stones of 144 godowns approved by the Marketing Cooperative Federation and Housing Cooperative Union. The cost of these works is about Rs 77.75 crore. Cooperatives and public service management minister Arvind Singh Bhadoria, MLA Krishna Gaur, agriculture production commissioner K K Singh and additional chief secretary (cooperatives) Ajit Kesari were also present on the occasion. Chouhan said that the history of cooperatives in Madhya Pradesh is very old. “The Cooperative Bank was established in 1904 in Jabalpur. Successful efforts have been made in the field of cooperatives in the state. Primary cooperative societies are the biggest support of farmers for fertilisers and seeds. Farmers have got a lot of relief from the facility of zero-percent loan”, he said. Chouhan said that corona control in the state was also possible through cooperative. “The public-participation model made in the state is a form of cooperative. Crisis management committees formed from city to village and ward-level took over the responsibilities. The whole world saw the results of coming together for any work. The public-participation model of the state has also been appreciated by PM Narendra Modi”, he said. Chouhan said that the efforts of one person in cooperatives have taken such a huge form and it was proved by the ‘White Revolution’ started by Verghese Kurien. “Today, an organisation such as Amul is giving competition to the whole world. The Sanchi brand of MP has also made its mark. The forest produces and herbs of the state have many possibilities, including Malwa’s oranges, Neemuch’s garlic, Burhanpur’s bananas, Amarkantak’s gul bakawali and Dindori’s kodo-kutki", he said. Chouhan said that self-reliant India will be built only through cooperative movement. “Cooperatives have an amazing ability to connect and give direction to people. Cooperation can pave the way for better reconstruction during calamities. Conducting activities on a cooperative basis in areas such as transport, fish production, house-building, rural tourism and wildlife tourism will create new employment and business opportunities. In this regard, new ideas will have to be worked on by including experts”, he added. Chouhan told the officers and representatives associated with cooperatives to innovate and create history. He said, “I am with you”. Chouhan said that activities conducted under cooperatives should not be misused and continuous monitoring is essential. “Cases of plot-grabbing have come to the fore in the housing societies formed on the principle of cooperative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradeshs-public-participation-model-appreciated-by-pm-modi-says-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan/articleshow/84108163.cms||---

Political parties in Tamil Nadu condemned the Karnataka government for ‘unilateral’ construction of the dam and urged the state government to take up legal action to remove the structure. In a statement, Duraimurugan said the Central Water Commission had reviewed the work in 2017 itself, and the Karnataka government too informed that it had built a dam of 0.5tmcft capacity to meet the drinking water needs and to recharge the water table. In 2019, the Karnataka government announced that it had almost completed the dam. “TN government continuously opposed it. It had filed a petition in May 2018 and an interim application. The Supreme Court in November 2019 ordered the constitution of a tribunal and Tamil Nadu has been urging the Centre on this,” the minister said. About 870 hectares of agricultural land in Krishnagiri taluk alone would be affected by the dam, he added. Duraimurugan said a solution would be found through the tribunal. “The state government will take appropriate measures to safeguard the interests of farmers, people, and the rights of Tamil Nadu,” the minister said. Farmers in Krishnagiri district said fertile land in five districts would turn barren and expressed fears of Karnataka releasing only the surplus from the dam as the structure didn’t have shutters. K P Periyasamy, 55, of Kuppachiparai village in Krishnagiri district, said villagers of Kuddapalli and Beemandapalli villages were totally dependent on the Pennaiyar river for drinking and irrigation needs. “Bore well too has dried up in the past few years due to lack of rain,” he said. In a statement, PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss said the river was covered by the inter-state agreements of Madras-Mysore governments in 1892 and Karnataka would have to get approval from the lower riparian state. “The unilateral act of Karnataka amounts to defying the tribunal,” Anbumani said. The Centre had set up a committee which held talks twice last year before reporting to the Centre in July to set up the tribunal. MDMK leader Vaiko said the BJP government in the Centre had not taken any decision on the tribunal and betrayed Tamil Nadu. “TN government should immediately act and establish our rights,” Vaiko said. CPI secretary R Mutharasan said the government should act legally against Karnataka since it acted against court orders and principles of water sharing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/karnataka-dam-issue-tamil-nadu-to-urge-centre-to-set-up-tribunal/articleshow/84108162.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Working group formed to study feasibility of Andhra Pradesh petrochemical project||VIJAYAWADA: The central government has formed a working group to study the feasibility of setting up a petrochemical complex in the state. The project was part of the AP Reorganisation Act and was proposed to be set up on Kakinada coast in East Godavari district. The working group would be headed by joint secretary (refineries) in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas. The government has also asked Engineers India and SBI Capital Markets to rework the financials in view of the recent regulatory changes in corporate tax and interest rates to take forward the strategic project in AP. As per section 93(4) of AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, the central government was supposed to examine the feasibility of establishing a greenfield crude oil refinery and petrochemical complex. Accordingly, the feasibility of setting up a one million metric tonnes per annum capacity cracker complex at Kakinada with an investment of Rs 32,900 crore was carried out by a HPCL-GAIL consortium. The consortium sought the state government’s support in terms of viability gap funding for the project. The government, in reply, said viability gap funding was not required for the project due to reduction in corporate tax and interest rates by the central government. Initial talks for the project were held between Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on June 10, following which the central government agreed to go ahead with the project without seeking viability gap funding by the state government. Another meeting was held with senior officials of petroleum ministry, which was attended by state industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy and chief secretary Adityanath Das, resulting in the constitution of the working group to take forward the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/working-group-formed-to-study-feasibility-of-andhra-pradesh-petrochemical-project/articleshow/84108198.cms||Gopi Dara
