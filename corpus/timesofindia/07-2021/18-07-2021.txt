Namma Metro has been operational since 2011 but its users have been complaining about the poor frequency of BMTC feeder services. The corporation used to run 173 Metro feeder buses before the pandemic; the number has dipped to 39. “Most of these services are running under loss, so it is difficult to increase the frequency. Demand has also reduced after Covid. If BMRCL provides Viability Gap Funding, we could operate more services,” said a senior BMTC official. BMRCL had earlier tied up with rental scooter companies like Bounce and Yulu at some stations, but only a few locations have the facility now. Several firms such as Loca Rides (cab sharing) and electric auto services like PepRide and HAIL App by Namma Auto have wound up operations. Metro Phase 1’s daily ridership was 5 lakh in February 2020. Following the pandemic and work-from-home concept, it has dropped to 1.2 lakh. A 2016 survey by World Resources Institute found that 70% of potential Bengaluru Metro users cited poor first-and last-mile connectivity as a reason for not using it. The ridership shortfall was attributed to a lack of comprehensive first-and last-mile solutions to connect homes and offices with Metro stations. Horamavu resident Aswathy S said: “There’s a shortage of bus services from Byappanahalli Metro Station to Horamavu and Ramamurthynagar. I’m not comfortable riding a two-wheeler with a stranger, so I don’t want to use bike taxi. Electric shared autos would have been helpful for many people.” A BMRCL official said: “We have provided bus bays at new Phase 2 stations and had tied up with firms like Bounce and Yulu. We are not in a position to provide VGF to BMTC since we have also incurred losses. BMTC is operating buses based on their traffic survey. We are open to working with different stakeholders to improve first-and last-mile connectivity.” Need more support from BMRCL, say companiesGirish Nagpal, CEO & founder of Metroride, which operates electric autos, said: “We have deployed 40 e-autos at two stations: Konanakunte Cross and Yelachenahalli. Services will start at Indiranagar and Rajajinagar soon. We are charging a minimum fare of Rs 10. The response from Metro users has been good, but we need more support from BMRCL for pick-up and drop-off points and also for creating awareness among passengers.” A startup which used to provide last-mile connectivity said: “It was not viable to run the service, especially after the pandemic. But BMRCL neither provided a parking space or its ridership data, nor created awareness at Metro stations.” BMTC officials said there are no bus bays at most Metro stations. “We are planning to induct 90 non-AC midi electric feeder buses from next month,” said an official. With most stations not equipped with parking facilities, regular Metro users say BMRCL should encourage electric shared autos, electric midi buses and prepaid auto counters. Implementation of common mobility card will also help, they add. E-rickshaws, shared autos in Delhi, ChennaiOther Metro operators offer better first-and last-mile connectivity. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation operates feeder buses and passengers can use the same card for both trains and buses. DMRC charts bus routes and synchronises them with Metro timings. Commuters can also use cycle rickshaws and e-rickshaws. The e-rickshaw facility can be availed at 29 stations at a fare of Rs 10 for the first 2km and Rs 5 for every additional km. DMRC is planning to induct 100 lowfloor AC e-buses from next month. Chennai Metro Rail Limited has roped in shared autos at a flat fare of Rs 10. Kochi Metro Rail Limited has invited tenders for 115 e-autos.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/decade-on-namma-metro-yet-tobridge-last-mile-connectivity-gap/articleshow/84510017.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

At a recent webinar on ‘Redefining masculinity; parenting tips for raising gender equitable boys’, experts discussed the role that patriarchal gender norms play in raising boys and how parents can counter norms and raise them to promote gender equality and non-violence. The event was organised by Bangalore International Centre. Lekha Naidu of BIC said: “Boys will be boys is an adage that is often used to pass off lewd and discriminatory behaviour towards women and girls. The underlying premise is that boys are ‘hard-wired’ in this way and the course of nature cannot be altered, so one has to accept that boys will always be discriminatory towards women and girls. This reasoning is not only deterministic and flawed as it completely negates the role of socialisation in this process, but also very detrimental to society at large.” On the importance of educating young boys and men, Sujata Khandekar, founding director & secretary, CORO India, said she has worked extensively and intensively on violence against women and realised that men need to be educated about their role in the power dynamics. “We observed that when women break cultural silence and become more vocal, the backlash and violence increases. We realised we had to also address men who were on the other side of the dynamics. We were not educating them enough about their role, social justice and equality,” she pointed out. She said apart from families, media and peers are also important in making impressions of masculinity among young men. “Young men who were perpetrating physical and mental violence did not see it as wrong, but as a norm,” she said. Experts said the change will begin with parents making the change themselves: From doing housework, breaking gender norms and walking the talk. Viiveck Verma, coach, mentor, investor & philanthropist, said it is not just about words but also action. “Our conversations must also change, and we must progress with the world. I am learning so much about gender from my younger daughter.” Parmesh Shahani, author, Queeristan, agreed. He said media and movies are helping shift the narratives on how parents’ love could transcend societal barriers. “Families need to act better, and parents must learn to educate themselves. There is no excuse anymore – there are books, movies, social media that will help check your biases. We need better allies at homes and outside,” he said, adding that children must not be forced but allowed to make their choices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/norms-play-key-role-in-raising-gender-equitable-boys-experts/articleshow/84510055.cms||Farheen Hussain

The inspections were carried out at Ola’s office in Koramangala and at Uber’s office in Murugeshpalya starting Friday by special teams from the department. While the two companies are yet to make any formal statement on the inspections, transport department officials maintained that they visited the premises following complaints pertaining to non-compliance to the Karnataka On-Demand Transportation Technology Aggregators Rules, 2016. Both Ola and Uber received their licence from the department to operate taxis in the city from 2016 to 2021 and are due for renewal this year. N Shivakumar, transport commissioner, told STOI: “Both aggregators are supposed to file quarterly reports with details about the number of vehicles and the drivers attached to their fleet. In fact, we had issued a notice to both of these aggregators to comply with the rules. Our officials conducted raids to verify their documents”. He added they have been acting on complaints from drivers about low earnings. “We also wanted to check the records of fare collected from the passengers and also the wages disbursed to the drivers. They haven’t furnished any documents. In fact, the address of these companies which was submitted during the time of obtaining license has also changed without intimation,” he said and added: “We will soon issue a show-cause notice to both firms. We will suspend their licence if they don’t comply with the rules” he said. TOI reached out to both Ola and Uber but did not receive responses till the time of filing this story.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dept-inspects-ola-uber-offices-in-city/articleshow/84510068.cms||---

Karnataka will be the first state in the country to adopt the new Act recently cleared by the Centre. “The model Act looks favourable for both tenants and landlords; however, there are certain areas of concern,’’ said Suresh Hari, chairman, Credai Bengaluru. He said, the cap on the security deposit might turn out to be problematic for landlords, if the tenant defaults on rent payment or damages the property. In these cases, a two-month security deposit may not cover the landlord’s expenses of repair/losses due to non-payment of the rent, he added. Farook Mahmood, chairman, Emeritus and founder-president- FIABCI India, said the two months’ rent as advance may not be enough to cover damages, especially considering that many tenants don’t pay previous month’s rent before vacating the premises. Quoting one of the clauses in the Act, Mahmood said if one tenant defaults on rent in an apartment or commercial building, the authorities concerned will disconnect the utility for the entire property. “This may become a nuisance with apartment culture growing in all big cities,” he added.  Despite the Karnataka Rent Control Act - 1999 being in place, both tenants and house owners in the city violated rules often. “Landlords and tenants were not having written agreements and preferred cash payment to avoid taxes. There are many who are not ready to give PAN card details. The new law will make it compulsory for both parties to enter into a written agreement; they now need to inform the rent authority within two months of signing it. This might unsettle several landlords,” said V Bhaskar, a rental consultant. As the Act also proposes to set up rent tribunals and rent courts in each district to resolve disputes, he said there may be too many cases registered. As each state is free to change the Act before implementation, Hari and Mahmood said the state should address these issues before adopting it. Despite acute housing shortage, revenue minister R Ashoka said over 2-3 lakh homes are lying vacant in urban areas and it was mainly due to absence of a good rental policy. With lack of adequate supply, rental rates in cities, mainly Bengaluru and Mangaluru, have skyrocketed over the years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tenancy-act-govt-may-face-teething-troubles-say-experts/articleshow/84510093.cms||---
---||India||Srinagar civic official, lawyer & cleric among 5 held for intimidation through Pakistan-sponsored blog||SRINAGAR: The secretary of the Srinagar Municipal Corporation, a senior lawyer from Poonch and a cleric were among five suspects arrested in J&K on Saturday as part of a crackdown on an intimidation network linked to a Pakistan-sponsored blog and targeted at journalists, activists, politicians and even government officials. Civic official Muhammad Akbar Sofi, his daughter Nazish Yasrab Rehmani and son Tabish Akbar Rehmani allegedly worked together with the suspected kingpins, Peerzada Raqif Makhdoomi from Batpora in Hazratbal and Poonch-based lawyer Javed Khalid, IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said. The accused had been running the blog "Kashmirfight.wordpress.com", which J&K police claim is sponsored by Pakistan's ISI, from "war rooms" spread across properties in Srinagar's Sanat Nagar and Raj Bagh, Batpura in Hazratbal, Poonch in Jammu and Arihal in south Kashmir's Pulwama. "It is worth mentioning that Kashmir fight.wordpress.com was being run by a white-collar militant syndicate whose task is to prepare a strategic hit list of government officers, journalists, social activists, lawyers and political functionaries who were assessed to be responsible for harming the overarching objectives of furthering and sustaining the Pakistani-supported militant programme, with the eventual aim of secession of Jammu and Kashmir from the Indian Union and its eventual annexation with Pakistan," IGP Kumar said. Armed with search warrants, police teams raided all the suspected premises and seized scores of mobile phones, digital storage devices and computing platforms. "In one house alone, 32 mobile phones, a tablet, two laptops, four hard disks, seven memory cards and one dongle were confiscated," Kumar said. In 2018, shortly after journalist Shujaat Bukhari was shot dead, the blog had mentioned the names of several senior scribes working for national print and television channels and also published their pictures in an alleged attempt to incite terror outfits to target them. While Sofi's daughter and son were arrested from the family's recently purchased house in Sanat Nagar, the municipal corporation secretary was picked up from the Raj Bagh residence of his second wife early Saturday. Lawyer Khalid was engaged to be married to Sofi's daughter Nazish after Eid al-Adha or Bakra Eid later this week. The police expect the seized laptops and storage devices to provide clues to the conspiracy behind the murder of journalist Bukhari, advocate Babar Qadri, and Satpal Nischal, a 65-year-old jeweller who had acquired a domicile certificate last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/srinagar-civic-official-lawyer-cleric-among-5-held-for-intimidation-through-pakistan-sponsored-blog/articleshow/84510681.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Pakistan said city police had launched an investigation as soon as news of the disturbing incident surfaced on Friday and that “such incidents cannot and will not be tolerated”. The ambassador’s daughter, Selsela Alikhel (27), was returning home in a rented vehicle from Islamabad’s Blue Area on Friday after “buying a gift for her younger brother” when she was kidnapped, an Afghan embassy statement said. “She went to the Blue Area in a taxi from her house in Sector F-7/2… when she took a cab to go back home, another man entered the vehicle after a few minutes,” the Afghan embassy said, adding that when she protested to the driver, “the passenger started beating her and said that her father is a communist and they will not leave him”. “She lost consciousness and can’t recall anything after that,” the embassy said. According to the statement, she regained consciousness at around 5 or 6pm and a passerby told her that she was in F-7 sector. “It was some road with no shopping or residential area nearby. She took a cab for the F-9 park as she knew that landmark,” the statement read.

---||World||15 Chinese investigators included in Dasu terror attack probe||ISLAMABAD: Fifteen Chinese investigators have been included in the probe into the recent terror attack on a bus in northern Pakistan’s Kohistan district, in which 13 people, including nine Chinese engineers, were killed. “The 15-member team of Chinese investigators arrived on Friday and visited the attack site with security agency officials,” Pakistan interior (home) minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed said at a press conference in Islamabad on Saturday. The probe, now in its final stage, is being handled by the highest institutions of Pakistan, said Ahmed. “Now, Chinese officials have also been included in the investigation,” he said, adding that the Chinese government is being updated about the developments in the ongoing inquiry. “We reassured the Chinese government that these culprits, hidden hands and enemies of CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) and China-Pakistan friendship will never be forgiven,” Ahmed said, adding that several arrests had been made from Lahore in connection with the attack. He said prime minister Imran Khan had instructed foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to visit China while the interior ministry had directed security agencies to increase the protection of Chinese workers in Pakistan. Earlier this week, nine Chinese nationals, two Pakistani soldiers and a civilian were killed and 28 others injured in a blast on a bus carrying workers to a hydroelectric project on Indus, in the remote Dasu area in Kohistan region in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. While the Foreign Office had initially said that the bus plunged into a ravine after a mechanical failure caused an explosion due to gas leakage, the government later claimed that it was a terror attack as traces of explosives were found at the explosion site. Following the bombing, Beijing had announced to send a team to Pakistan to deal with the aftermath of the attack. “Today, China will send a cross-departmental joint working group to Pakistan to help with relevant work,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian had said at a media briefing in Beijing on Friday. The interior minister claimed that the Dasu attack had been planned days before a meeting of the Joint Coordination Committee of CPEC — originally scheduled on July 16. The meeting was subsequently postponed in the attack’s aftermath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/15-chinese-investigators-included-in-dasu-terror-attack-probe/articleshow/84511159.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Gabriel F Nazereth said he built the temple on his ancestral land in the memory of his parents, Fabian and Sabeena. “I have dedicated the temple to my parents. I have friends who will manage the temple activities henceforth,” he said. Gabriel built the temple next to his house at an estimated cost of Rs 2 croreThe pandemic delayed the inauguration of the temple. Various rituals, including Prathishta Mahotsava and Bramhakalashotava, were performed from Wednesday to Friday. Palimaru mutt seer Sri Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami visited the temple on Thursday. “Gabriel is thrilled on his wish being fulfilled,” said his friend and journalist Pundalika Marathe.

After doing odd jobs for a few years, he set up a factory manufacturing blocks and moulds. He lived in Mumbai for nearly 55 years and his worship of Lord Ganesha comes from that connect. He remains a Christian but also believes in Lord Siddhivinayak, who is most revered in Mumbai. On returning to his hometown about a decade ago after winding up his business in Mumbai, he decided to build the temple.” Gabriel built the temple on nearly 20 cents, next to his house, at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore. “He liked a Ganapathi gudi (temple) at the Ammani Ramanna Shetty Memorial hall in Udupi and wanted a similar structure. A 36-inch Ganesha idol has been installed and the temple has all facilities required to perform religious rituals,” said Marathe. A house for the temple priest has also been built alongside.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: 1.2 lakh vaccinated staff on duty for SSLC exams||BENGALURU: Officials on Saturday began preparations for the SSLC exams scheduled for July 19 and 22. This is the second year that they are being held amid the pandemic. More than 8.4 lakh students are expected to appear for the papers across the state, and nearly 1.2 lakh school staffers and officials will be on examination duty. Primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar said that all those on duty had been vaccinated. “At all levels, only vaccinated officials and staff have been roped in for the work,” he added. Kumar shared details about the arrangements with the media during visits to government schools and exam centres in the city and Doddaballapur. Instead of a week-long calendar, the SSLC exams are being conducted in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format over two days this time. The first paper will be on core subjects such as science, mathematics and social science, and the second will be on languages. Each subject will carry 40 marks, with the total being 120. Drills were held at many schools in the state on Saturday. School staffers, officials, health teams and volunteers from Scouts and Guides demonstrated how things would proceed. “The preparations are even better than what we did last year,” said Kumar, who visited centres in Malleswaram, Sadashivanagar, Dasarahalli and Peenya, among other places. He explained that all exam centres would be sanitised before and after the papers. The number of centres has been doubled to 6,000, while rooms have increased by three times. Only 12 students — one per bench — will be seated in each room. There will be special rooms for candidates with symptoms like cough, cold and fever. Each centre will have a health check-up counter and everyone will be screened there. The counters are equipped with thermal scanners, pulse oximeters, first aid kits and masks. An emergency treatment vehicle will be deployed in every taluk. “The examination staff members have been directed to maintain social distance at all times. They can also wear face shields if required,” the minister said. There are Covid care centres in every taluk, where students who have tested positive for Covid-19 can appear for the papers. Even students whose family members have tested positive or are isolated can take the exam there. Kumar said that 14,929 high schools had registered their students for the SSLC exams and their headmasters had already downloaded the hall tickets. “Students who have faced any difficulty can contact their DDPIs or BEOs to get the matter sorted. A district nodal officer has been appointed for this purpose,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/1-2l-vaccinated-staff-on-duty-for-sslc-exams/articleshow/84513795.cms||---

A woman approached top cop Kamal Pant during an online police-public interaction on Saturday, asking him who can register FIR if an inspector is not present at the police station. Any officer of the rank of head constable and above can do so, he replied. “If they (cops) still refuse to accept the complaint, please bring the matter to notice of higher-ups through social media or by visiting their offices and we shall take action,” he said. Another participant drew Pant’s attention by saying police officers on the field sometimes behave rudely and should be educated. The commissioner said he will speak to his force on the issue. During the one-hour interaction, Pant fielded many queries pertaining to lockdown norms like Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) not allowing domestic helps to enter apartments. He reiterated that RWAs can decide on matters related to domestic helps. When asked what one should do to bring his/ her family members from other states to the city, he said people should have a genuine reason to do so. “All this while, you have waited patiently. Please wait for some more time,” Pant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/head-constable-can-register-fir-says-top-cop/articleshow/84513797.cms||---

The central leaders asked me to continue and strengthen the party. There’s no question of leadership change,” he said, dubbing his Delhi visit a success. He said neither did the party high command ask for his resignation nor did it come up for discussion during his meetings with PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. Instead, he said, they said there was no discussion of leadership change. Yediyurappa has convened the BJP legislature party meeting on July 26, the day he completes two years in office, and there is speculation about the purpose of the gathering. It has been almost a year since Yediyurappa convened the legislature party meeting despite vehement appeals from dissident MLAs in the party. Discussed development of BJP in state: BSYYediyurappa met Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh and BJP president P Nadda on Saturday, a day after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said that discussions revolved around developing and strengthening BJP in Karnataka before elections and ensuring the party comes back to power in the state. Denying any discussion on alternative leadership, he also emphasised that there’s no dearth of leaders in the BJP. He said he’ll work to strengthen the party by taking everyone along. “We discussed the development of the party in the state. The PM asked me to give special emphasis on bringing BJP back to power in Karnataka,’’ he added Earlier in the day, a section of media in Delhi reported that Yediyurappa has been asked to make way for the new chief minister in the interest of the party and was asked to make a formal announcement soon after completing two years in office. Yediyurappa had gone to Delhi on Friday in a chartered flight accompanied by his son BY Vijayendra, grandson Shashidhar Mardi and MLC Lehar Singh besides personal secretary Girish Hosur. Order to set up Vokkaliga board The state government on Saturday issued an order to set up Vokkaliga Development Corporation. "The corporation is being set up for the overall development of the Vokkaliga community. The board will be registered under the Company Act," said the order. The CM had announced setting up of the corporation for Vokkaligas and setting aside Rs 500 crore for the purpose in the current budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-question-of-leadership-change-says-yediyurappa/articleshow/84513804.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Cauvery fighter G Madegowda passes away in KM Doddi||MANDYA: Veteran politician G Madegowda, 94, whose name has been synonymous with the Cauvery agitation for nearly four decades in the district, passed away at his son’s hospital in KM Doddi on Saturday. Madegowda was suffering from age-related illness, and he had been hospitalised for the last three weeks. Though, he was a seasoned politician, having been elected as an MLA thrice from the erstwhile Kiragavalu assembly segment, and twice as an MP, in 1989 and 1991, and once served as forest minister in then chief minister R Gundurao’s cabinet, he was the face and main driving force for the Cauvery agitation. In 1994, when then PM PV Narasimha Rao directed the state to release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu, Madegowda tendered his resignation as an MP, and took part in the agitation. His role in convincing then chief minister S Bangarappa in bringing an ordinance to overcome the interim award of Cauvery Dispute Tribunal (CWDT), is considered to be a heroic achievement of Madegowda, by thousands of farmers and his admirers. When CWDT passed the final award in 2007, he was instrumental in holding the Cauvery agitation for more than 100 days in Mandya district, and could be seen sitting at Silver Jubilee Park, throughout the agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cauvery-fighter-madegowda-passes-away/articleshow/84513807.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP kanwar bodies call off yatra after state government appeal||LUCKNOW: Kanwar associations in Uttar Pradesh decided to call off this year’s kanwar yatra on Saturday in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and experts’ warning about a third wave in the coming months. The move came after talks with state government representatives, sources said. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal confirmed that the yatra was called off for the second consecutive year after an appeal by the UP government. Undertaken annually by devotees of Lord Shiva to bring water from sacred rivers — mainly the Ganga in Haridwar — to offer it to the deity in the month of Shravan, the yatra was cancelled last year by both UP and Uttarakhand because of the pandemic. This year, too, Uttarakhand cancelled it after drawing flak over holding Kumbh early this year. However, UP wanted to organise it in accordance with Covid protocols. The Supreme Court then took suo motu cognizance of the issue and served a notice to the UP government. On Friday, a Supreme Court bench led by Justice RF Nariman had directed the UP government to reconsider its decision to allow the annual religious yatra, scheduled to start from July 25. Advising the UP government against allowing even a symbolic yatra in light of the pandemic, the SC went on to say that if the government did not call it off, the court would be forced to pass an order. To this, the government had said that “if” the yatra took place, it would happen in accordance with Covid-19 protocols and “with the consent of kanwar associations”. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath subsequently instructed additional chief secretary Awanish Awasthi and DGP Mukul Goel to talk to Kanwar associations to reach a final decision before the government filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court on Monday. Uttarakhand was earlier forced to suspend the Char Dham Yatra after the high court had pulled it up for allowing the Kumbh Mela in the middle of the second wave.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh accepts Navjot Singh Sidhu as PCC chief, with caveat||CHANDIGARH: Even as Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh reiterated his “acceptance” of Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s decision on his leading critic Navjot Singh Sidhu being made state Congress chief, he underlined that he remains miffed at how the issue was handled and said Sidhu should issue a public apology for derogatory tweets against him. The CM made it known that he would not meet Sidhu until the apology is delivered amid indications that the stage has been set for Sidhu’s appointment. The CM is understood to have been given a free hand in ministerial changes and the appointment of a deputy CM as also a "working president" under Sidhu. Sidhu, meanwhile, went into overdrive to garner support of ministers and MLAs by holding a series of meetings with senior leaders, including current state chief Sunil Jakhar. The CM reportedly expressed annoyance on these counts to Congress in-charge Harish Rawat, who came to meet Amarinder Singh on the state government’s helicopter on Saturday ahead of a formal announcement of the Punjab Congress revamp. Sources said Amarinder told Rawat that he was unhappy at “not being taken into confidence” during the deliberations regarding Sidhu's elevation in the midst of “media leaks” and interviews. At the same time, the CM is believed to have said that the appointment of the new state chief was the prerogative of the Congress president and whoever she appoints will be acceptable to everybody. Yet when Rawat wanted to call Sidhu for a meeting, the chief minister said he will not meet him until he publicly apologises and regrets the “150-odd personally derogatory tweets” against him. Sidhu had hit out at Amarinder on the issue of alleged inaction on the sacrilege case and electricity pacts. Where the turn of events pointed to a resolution of the long-pending revamp of the state unit, there are also signs of continuing unease between the CM and Sidhu. Amarinder’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted the CM’s statement, “Had a fruitful meeting with Harish Rawat. Reiterated that any decision of the Congress president will be acceptable to all. Raised certain issues which he said he’ll take up with Congress president.” Rawat thanked Amarinder for reposing faith in party chief Sonia Gandhi and reiterating his previous stand that her decision about Punjab Congress chief would be acceptable to him. “Thank you for your great statement,” Rawat tweeted after reaching Delhi. Sidhu had also met Congress Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo on Friday in Delhi. He tweeted his pictures with them (and one with him and Jakhar) with the caption, “Seeking the guidance of presidents of the illustrious Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee … Conversations with wise men, worth months of education !!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-chief-minister-captain-amarinder-singh-accepts-navjot-singh-sidhu-as-pcc-chief-with-caveat/articleshow/84513876.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Bengaluru||Amid talk of his quitting, Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa may call MLAs’ meet||NEW DELHI: Speculation on Karnataka CM ’s continuance in office continued with suggestions that he might consider calling a meeting of party MLAs towards the end of the month. The objective of the meeting might be to announce his stepping down though several BJP sources said he had not been asked to do so. It is understood that the veteran leader may have suggested such a course of action to the party leadership. The possibility of a change of guard may have figured during the meeting between the CM and PM Modi on Friday. It was also said the meeting touched on a reshuffle in the Karnataka ministry, reports Mohua Chatterjee. The grounds of “ill health” are being mentioned as a possible reason. This comes after BJP restored faith in the Lingayat leader after deliberations with state leaders. BJP functionaries had said there will be “no change” of leadership, amid factional feuds within the party that led to a section demanding that he be replaced. Some accounts said the CM had communicated his willingness to step down to the PM through an emissary. He had wanted to meet home minister Amit Shah and to BJP chief J P Nadda, according to party sources. It is however for PM Modi and the central party leadership to take a call on whether the chief minister’s resignation should be accepted now. The 78-year-old Karnataka chief minister, it is learnt, intends to step down at a time when “there will be no pressure on the government” in Karnataka, since no elections are coming up in the state soon. Since he will turn 80 in the next two years, the central party leadership is keen to nurture the next in line leader in the state, as BSY cannot be repeated for another term for his age, according to sources close to him. Incidentally, the Lingayat leader continues to be BJP’s best bet in the southern state, where the party formed its first government beyond the Vindhyas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/amid-talk-of-his-quitting-karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappa-may-call-mlas-meet/articleshow/84514009.cms||---
---||India||Sharad Pawar- PM Modi meet triggers buzz, NCP rules out alliance with BJP||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A meeting between Sharad Pawar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an hour on Saturday on the veteran Maratha’s reservations about the amendments to the Banking Amendments Act set off speculation leading the NCP to claim that they can never align with BJP. The one-hour closed-door discussion, which came in the wake of squabbling among Maharashtra’s ruling coalition members, Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, triggered political chatter suggesting hidden motives behind the wily satrap calling on the BJP leader. A recent one-on-one by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with Modi had raised a similar storm, and was dubbed an attempt by Shiv Sena to send a message to the MVA allies about its willingness to explore political options. While the PMO tweeted about the meeting with a photograph of the two leaders, Pawar wrote on a micro-blogging site, “Met the Hon’ble Prime Minister of our country Narendra Modi. Had a discussion on various issues of national interest.” The speculations generated by the meeting was serious enough for NCP spokesman Nawab Malik to call a press conference in Mumbai and debunk reports that the Pawar-Modi meet had implications for the state government. Malik said NCP and BJP were like two ends of a river, which can never meet because they are ideologically opposite. He also said that Pawar had informed CM Thackeray as well as Congress leaders about the proposed meeting a few days ago. “It was a scheduled meeting. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and AICC general secretary H K Patil were also aware about the meeting. Prima facie, Pawar knocked at the doors of the PM to express concern over the amendments to the banking regulation act and creation of the ministry of cooperation led by Amit Shah. Pawar has written a comprehensive letter to the PM,” Malik said. “First Pawar spoke to the PM on the anti-bank amendments, but then PM felt that it will be better if there is personal discussion. Accordingly, Pawar met Modi,’’ Malik added. Later, Pawar tweeted a letter he wrote to the PM about the amendment in the Banking Act. “I wish to point out certain inconsistencies and the resulting legal inefficacy of normative provisions of the Act that are in conflict, most specifically with the 97th Constitutional Amendment, State Cooperative Societies Acts and with the Cooperative Principles. “I reiterated in the letter that the aims and objectives of the amended Act are well-intentioned and many provisions are necessary. Erring board and management must definitely be acted upon strictly and the depositors’ interests should be protected, but at the same time it should be ensured that while doing so, the cooperative principles laid down in the Constitution are not sacrificed at the altar of over-zealous regulation,” Pawar tweeted. NCP also said Pawar expressed his reservations about the newly constituted cooperation ministry headed by Amit Shah, arguing that the cooperatives sector was a state subject. “The NCP can never join hands with the BJP because both the parties are ideologically different. The BJP and NCP are two ends of a river that cannot come together as long as there is water in the river,” Malik said. In his letter to Modi, Pawar pointed out that while incorporation, regulation and winding up of cooperative societies have been earmarked as state subjects, the RBI on the basis of newly introduced impugned provisions, can directly intervene into the functioning of the cooperative banks. “In my opinion, the new provisions are unconstitutional and ultra vires, for having been passed without legislative competence,” Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sharad-pawar-pm-modi-meet-triggers-buzz-ncp-rules-out-alliance-with-bjp/articleshow/84514174.cms||---

The Supreme Court in October last year granted bail to Sudhir, who was arrested in February 2017 and subsequently suspended in the case. The officer, whose suspension was later revoked, reached the SC/ST police station in Patna on Saturday to lodge an FIR alleging that he had been implicated in the case fraudulently. Though his FIR was not lodged despite spending 4 hours at the police station on the grounds that it was in English, Sudhir said he was given a receiving of his complaint. When asked by the media his complaint was against whom and whether CM Nitish Kumar and senior IPS officer Manu Maharaaj were included, Sudhir said “yes”. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said Kumar’s application has been received. “It’s of 50 pages. The content is not known to me. It would be decided only after an inquiry if any action is needed to be taken or not,” he said. Meanwhile, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said, “One can imagine the level of autocracy in Bihar. A senior IAS officer reaches the police station with all documents and evidences to lodge an FIR against the CM and a few of his officers, but could not do so.” When contacted, JD(U) chief spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said he was not aware about the contents of the complaint. “How can I comment on that. Everyone is free to approach the police and lodge a complaint,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/i-was-framed-in-bssc-paper-leak-case-ias-officer/articleshow/84508380.cms||Debashish Karmakar

As per the rainfall forecast for the next three days, light to moderate rainfall is expected in the catchment areas of Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Adhwara, Kamla, Kosi and Mahananda in Nepal. In effect, this might worsen the flood situation in the districts falling in the basins of these rivers in Bihar. At present, of the major rivers, only the Burhi Gandak is flowing above the danger level in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Khagaria districts. The fresh round of rainfall, which began from Saturday, may worsen the situation. While the water discharge through Valmikinagar barrage across Gandak on Saturday afternoon was 1.63 lakh cusecs, it is expected to increase in the next 72 hours due to rainfall in Nepal. Similarly, the water discharge through Birpur barrage across Kosi was 1.27 lakh cusecs, but north of it in Nepal in the 100km vicinity heavy rainfall has been reported. This, in turn, may lead to increase in the volume of water flowing through Kosi, and consequent flood along the downstream right up to Kursela in Katihar district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flood-scene-improves-but-expected-rainfall-in-nepal-a-big-worry/articleshow/84508162.cms||---

BSUSC interviewed the applicants for the appointment of three assistant professors of Angika in Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University on Thursday and uploaded the list of successful candidates to its website on Friday. BSUSC chairman Rajvardhan Azad told this newspaper on Saturday that the appointment of assistant professors of Puran in Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University would also be notified soon after the interview of shortlisted candidates on July 27. Only three teachers are to be appointed in the subject. Azad said the appointment of assistant professors in 25 subjects in different universities of the state would be notified in the next three months. And, if all goes well, the appointment of all the 4,638 assistant professors in 52 subjects in 13 universities as per advertisement issued in September last year would be notified by the commission within a year, he said. He further pointed out that interview in a subject is fixed only after the preparing a merit list of applicants and declaration of cutoff score. Usually, there is a four-tier screening of applications before the finalization of the subject-wise merit list and the number of candidates called for interview is usually three times the vacancies in a subject. The merit list in about 15 subjects has been prepared and the work is going on in other subjects. Now the commission would be holding interviews in at least two subjects in a week, he said. Last time, the Bihar Public Service Commission could not complete the appointment of 3,364 assistant professors in different subjects in all the universities of the state even in five years’ time for one reason or the other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-assistant-professors-appointed-next-day-of-interview/articleshow/84508714.cms||B K Mishra

The Covid-19 pandemic, which led to the shutdown of schools for more than a year now, disrupted his career path after he got a pay cut of 50%. Mehta earned Rs 30,000 per month but found himself struggling with a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 now. A father of two daughters, he decided to sell life insurance. Realizing that people were spending only on home products and medicine, Mehta started selling home cleaning mops with handles preferred by housewives especially during lockdowns when maids were not allowed for fear of spreading infection. “I had thought of retiring as a principal but Covid pandemic altered my plans. Fortunately, business is good and I earn more than my salary as a teacher. For my love of teaching, I take part-time English lectures now,” said Mehta. Post pandemic, teachers serving in private schools have been one of the most adversely affected professionals. Schools have been practically shut barring exceptions of few days when Covid-19 cases were few between first and Diwali surge. Experts say that the majority of teachers have been served 35-50% pay cuts. Nearly 40% private school teachers have been laid off across Gujarat by school managements who cite fee-cut and defaults in fee payments for being cash strapped. In Ahmedabad, Preeti Sadavarde, a pre-primary teacher since 10 years, has started a misal-pav selling joint in south Bopal. A 50% pay cut ever since the pandemic which cut her salary to Rs 9,000 per month forced her to look beyond teaching as a profession. “With schools mostly shut, it was apparent that pay cuts would be for a long haul. I, along with a friend, decided to start this Maharashtrian snack venture in July,” said Preeti. She says that teachers have become the most financially vulnerable professionals in this pandemic. A case in point is Rakesh Dave, a drawing teacher in Maninagar in Ahmedabad, who was let off by the school immediately after the pandemic citing financial crunch, has been struggling to remain afloat. He used to get a monthly salary of Rs 25,000 but can earn only Rs 5,000-6,000 per month doing online tuitions. He started a namkeen (fried snacks) business during lockdown which did well for a few months but when restrictions were lifted, the customer base started drying. “I was left with 120 kg of unsold namkeen which I had to throw away. Not able to absorb losses, I am struggling. Government needs to announce some support for teachers like us” said Dave, who has a wife, daughter and parents in the family. For many, the shift has paid off. In Sanand, economics teacher Raju Prajapati, 32, has started a grocery store in nearby Kuvad village after he got a 30% salary cut. “People were primarily spending on groceries and medicines. I started small but now have a monthly turnover of Rs 2.5 lakh. I am happy with the switch. In fact, many teachers in my group are also inspired to start their own business,” said Prajapati. In Rajkot, Anil Bhatt, 52, teaching English in a private school had to resort to selling vegetables when he got a 50% pay cut in his Rs 32,000 monthly salary. “It was tough, my vegetable cart was taken away twice by Rajkot municipal corporation officers. Now I have started supplying bulk orders to hotels in the morning and take freelance lectures,” said Bhatt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/reeling-under-pay-cuts-teachers-learn-new-trade-lessons/articleshow/84511806.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Upholding the line of B R Ambedkar, who, as far back in 1938 had said in his essay that “without education, population control is impossible”, Singh said CM Nitish Kumar has adhered to the approach and stressed on mass education of women to check fertility rate. Singh said several states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha and Haryana have been the first in having their separate population control laws. “So far, no review and assessment has been made to ascertain to what extent the laws have been effective in population control in these states,” Singh said, adding that the Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan, in fact, changed the law in 2018, as it proved to be ineffective in population control and there were also protests from people and government employees against the provisions of the 2000 Act. National Family Health Survey (NFHS) Report -5 on Bihar has pointed out that in 2015-16 the percentage of tenth-pass women was 22.80%, and their fertility rate 3.4%. But in 2019-20, the XII-pass women accounted for 28%, while their fertility rate was 3%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/edu-of-women-key-to-controlling-population/articleshow/84508431.cms||Abhay Singh

The deceased were identified as Ch Surekha, her daughter Ch Susana (9), and her sons Ch Sarveen (6) and Ch Siril. Araku Valley police said Ch Sanjeev, who is Surekha’s husband, and Surekha had been having disputes for a long time. On Friday night, when Sanjeev was out, neighbours and relatives noticed Surekha hanging from a ceiling fan and the children lying unconscious on a bed. They informed Araku Valley police, who rushed to the spot. No suicide letter was found in the house, police said. Police shifted the bodies to the primary healthcare centre (PHC) at Araku Valley. A case has been resgistered under sections 302 (murder) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC. Sanjeev has claimed his wife poisoned their children and then hanged herself. He did not disclose a specific reasons for the deaths. Locals said that there were disputes between Sanjeev and Surekha for the past few weeks and the two had a heated argument on Friday. Relatives of the victim also alleged that Sanjeev was in an illicit affair. They claimed that though Surekha had warned him several times, he failed to mend his ways. Meanwhile, Surekha’s father Lakshmaiah alleged that Sanjeev was behind the deaths because of disputes between the couple and was trying to make them look like a suicide pact.

The two months also recorded exceptionally high overall mortality for the state, according to primary data collated by Health Management Information System (HMIS) of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of India. According to the data, the state recorded 26,050 deaths in April and 29,690 in May. To put the figures in perspective, the first three months of 2021 had recorded an average 8,164 deaths. Compared to that, April and May months recorded a three-fold rise. What’s more, the data revealed that 88% or nearly nine in every 10 deaths were recorded in rural areas of the state, according to HMIS figures. The rural areas recorded 22,927 deaths in April and 26,455 in May this year. While the report did not specify Covid-19 as a separate category of death, 12,938 deaths in April and 14,904 in May were attributed to ‘causes not known.’ It accounts for about 50% of the total deaths. Other major causes for deaths in April included chronic disease (3,500), heart disease/ hypertension (2,296), and acute disease (1,546) among others. Prof Chinmay Tumbe, a faculty member at IIM Ahmedabad, took to social media recently. “How bad was the recent Covid wave shock on rural India? Very Bad. Important clues emerge from recently released death data through facilities-based Health Management Information system (HMIS)… HMIS is different from CRS in that it is more rural, has less coverage and is facilities-based. Hence, noisier time series. Excess mortality for April-May period, relative to average of 2018-19 baseline is high. You can take trend growth into account, use different baselines and it’s still well past 100% for these states,” mentioned his post. When approached, Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (health & family welfare), said that he cannot comment on the data till he studies it. A senior health department official said that the data is provisional in nature and needs adjustments. “The verified data till 2019 is uploaded, and work on 2020 is going on. Nature of the data is raw, and it’s not right to jump to conclusions. However, there’s no doubt that mortality was high due to both Covid and post-Covid complications, the quantification is yet to take place,” said an official. Experts pointed out that the state has so far recorded 10,075 deaths attributed to Covid-19 pandemic. However, there could be manifold deaths due to post-Covid complications, ranging from lung collapse to cardiac arrest and blood clotting to multi-organ failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-saw-all-cause-deaths-rise-3-fold-in-apr-may-21-goi-data/articleshow/84511733.cms||Parth Shastri

It’s been more than two decades since Abdul shifted to Johannesburg from Limbayat. His brother and other family members are spending sleepless nights here ever since riots broke out across South Africa after the arrest of former president Jacob Zuma. Like Patels, many families in south Gujarat are worried for the well-being of their loved ones who had moved to South Africa. Worried Adam Patel with his wife Zubeda and son Asif talking on a video call to his other son Abdul, living in Johannesburg of South Africa.Many Gujarati businessmen settled in that country, especially those hailing from the southern part of the state, have suffered heavy losses after rioters targeted their establishments. As riots spread across cities like Johannesburg, Durban and Phoenix, the Gujarati expatriate bore the most brunt of it. In Durban, which has a population of over 10 lakh people of Indian origin, several business establishments owned by Gujaratis have been targeted by the rioters. Abdul’s brother Asif runs a grocery shop in Limbayat. Asif said that his elder brother has been forced to stay locked inside his house along with his wife and two children for the past one week. “They can’t even go out to buy food,” said Asif. Afroz Patel had started his automobile service and spare parts business a few days ago. His parents Saeed and Rahima, both retired school teachers, had invested their entire savings in Afroz’s business. His shop, adjoining warehouse and his house were destroyed by the rioters four days ago. Afroz along with his wife managed to escape just minutes before the rioters attacked their house and shop. “I had started the business a few days ago and everything was wiped away in a few minutes. They even looted my home and now I am taking shelter at my relative’s place. I may leave SA. For the first time in my nine year’s stay, I saw such a situation,” Afroz told TOI. “Valuables worth over Rs 10 lakh Rand were looted from our shop. They did not leave even a spoon behind at our son’s home,” said Saeed, who returned to his native village Tankariya in Bharuch district a few months ago. Salwaruddin Patel, who runs a restaurant in Durban, has been holed up inside his house for the past week. “They cannot even go out for food or medicine due to rioting. Luckily, the rioters did not target the restaurant as they might have thought that they wouldn’t find anything valuable there. But all other neighbouring shops were looted,” said Saffan Patel, brother-in-law of Salwaruddin. Not just businessmen, even employees were targeted by the rioters. Fearing attack, 26-year-old Yasin Patel along with his roommates left Johannesburg in a hired car in the middle of the night and crossed the border. “Yasin went to SA in search of better employment two months ago. Currently, he is taking shelter in Lusaka, Zambia. I advised him to return to India,” said Ilyas, his father, who works as a tailor in Surat.

However, the main accused is still absconding. According to reports, Mahtab Alam and his armed accomplices attacked the girl’s family of another religion on Thursday night, following which tension prevailed in Uttartola. ASP Ballia Sanjay Kumar said, “Police teams have been engaged for the arrest of Mahtab and some other accused persons who are still absconding. Police and PAC has been deployed in Uttartola as a precautionary measure to avoid further escalation of situation.” As per the complaint submitted by a girl of a locality in Revati police station area, Mahtab had uploaded her photos on his Facebook account. On her complaint, Revati police lodged an FIR against Mahtab and his accomplices on Thursday. When Mahtab knew about the FIR, he and his accomplices raided the girl’s house and thrashed her family members. As many as 10 family members and neighbours of the girl suffered grave injuries in the attack. On hearing their cries, people of the girl’s community ran towards the incident site. However, the assailants managed to escape before they could reach the spot. The incident left Uttartola tense. On getting information about the incident, SO Revati reached the spot and alerted senior officials in view of the gravity of the situation. Later, ASP Ballia, Snajay Kumar, SDM Bansdih, Dushyant Kumar, CO Brijbhushan and other officials reached the spot with heavy police force and PAC.

The accused Umesh Sharma (25) had also promised to marry the woman, but later disappeared. According to a police complaint registered by the woman at Malviya Nagar police station, Sharma, a resident of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, had raped the woman for the first time in a room of the pizzeria located on 150-feet Ring Road. The complaint further stated that the woman had migrated to Rajkot in search of employment and was living alone in a rented accommodation in the city. K N Bhukan, police inspector of Malaviya Nagar police station said, “Sharma had promised the woman he would marry her and also had started living with her. However, he suddenly disappeared and it is suspected that he has left Gujarat.” The woman had left her job at the pizzeria along with Sharma when they started living together. Currently, the woman is unemployed. The woman in her complaint stated that Sharma disappeared on July 4 and has been out of contact since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pizzeria-manager-rapes-staffer-for-year-flees/articleshow/84512296.cms||---
---||Patna||With possibility of 3rd wave, uncertainty looms over Shravani Mela in Madhepura||MADHEPURA: With the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19, uncertainty looms over the Shravani Mela in Madhepura once again. Consequently, small vendors, who sell puja items near the Singheshwar Sthan in the district, are quite disappointed. The world-famous fair is organised in the months of July and August every year. Bambam Thakur, who sells ‘belpatras’ on the premises of the Singheshwar Sthan, told this newspaper on Saturday that his family was having a rough time for the last one year. “It seems this Shravan will be like the previous one,” he rued. Two other vendors, Jamun Malakar and Santosh Mandal, claimed that they borrowed money from relatives to feed their family members because they had “no source of income”. Even big businessmen, including cloth traders, jewellers, and hoteliers, look forward to the Shravani Mela every year because thousands of devotees from Mithila, Kosi, and Simanchal regions as well as Nepal visit Madhepura during the month. The Singheshwar Sthan was closed on April 9 after the second wave of Covid-19 hit the state. In view of the pandemic, fresh guidelines for the Shravani Mela have not yet been issued. Manoj Thakur, the manager of the local religious board, said he was waiting for instructions from the district administration for organising the Shravani Mela. The ex-officio president of the board, Niraj Kumar, claimed that any decision in this regard would be taken after August 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/with-possibility-of-3rd-wave-uncertainty-looms-over-shravani-mela-in-madhepura/articleshow/84508582.cms||Deo Narayan Saha
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Distress calls rise but Disha users hesitate to lodge FIRs||VIJAYAWADA: Even as the government continues its door-to-door campaign to get the Disha mobile application installed, the women safety initiative has successfully aided almost 1,400 women who have needed assistance in the last 17 months. Overall, cops have received 1.68 lakh SOS distress calls, though only a fraction of these were actionable cases while the rest were to check if the application works, or instances of accidental signals. It is pertinent to note that the app alerts the police control room when someone shakes the smartphone three times or touches the SOS button. Police have registered 220 first information reports (FIRs) from the genuine complaints received from the application. At least over 60% of these cases happened to be related to domestic violence followed by sexual harassment, which constitutes the second largest category of complaints. Explaining the reason for the relatively small number of FIRs, cops explained that in cases of domestic violence, the couple prefer being directed to a one stop center for counselling instead of a case registered against their spouse. In sexual harassment cases as well, women have often been reluctant to register a complaint. Cops explain that the women look for a sense of safety and security through the application but are hesitant when it comes to taking legal recourse, fearing visiting courts and police stations. Also, while the application was downloaded 17.65 lakh times in the past six months, only 7.4 lakh of them happen to be registered users, that is, users comprise less than half the number of downloads. However, the campaign did help scale up the number of users by several fold since the Seethanagaram rape incident that shook the state last month. Nonetheless, the biggest achievement of the Disha initiative has been that police managed to maintain a record response time of five to six minutes. A case in point would be Friday’s rescue of a domestic violence victim under Narasaraopet Two Town police station limits. A woman identified as Shaik Reshma in Chandrababu Naidu Colony messaged the police for help through the Disha app. Within four minutes, cops rescued the woman, who was badly injured, and shifted her to a government hospital while taking the husband into custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/distress-calls-rise-but-disha-users-hesitate-to-lodge-firs/articleshow/84509793.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Patna||Bakrid: Goat traders stare at losses for 2nd consecutive year||PATNA: Goat traders are staring at losses for the second consecutive year due to poor footfall of buyers ahead of Eid-ul-Adha (Bakrid) owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Bakrid will be celebrated on July 21. The traders, who have brought goats from different parts of the country to the city’s traditional ‘Bakra Mandi’ (goat market) at Raja Bazaar, said the demand has been the lowest this time. Mohd Ziaullah Khan, coordinator at the cattle market, told this newspaper that the situation is pretty bad even compared to the previous year. “The market which used to bustle with buyers, looks deserted after the pandemic. Last year, the market was down due to the Covid, but this time it is worse as many are scared of the likely third wave of the virus,” he said. “Many people are not buying because of high prices of sacrificial goats and financial impact due to Covid-19 lockdown. Those who can afford will perhaps buy animal for qurbani (ritual sacrifice). The sales have further declined by 15-20% compared to the previous year. The number of traders has also declined from 200 to 70 this year,” Khan said. Most of the cattle rearers and traders have bought limited number of goats. Tota Pari from Jaipur, Barbari from Etawah, Jamnapari from Allahabad and Ajmeri from Rajasthan are some of the goat species available in the market, besides local breed from different parts of Bihar. Beeral Singh from Etah in Uttar Pradesh said he has been visiting Patna goat market for the last 40 years, but never experienced such a low footfall of customers ahead of Bakrid. “It is really depressing. In last one week, only 15 goats were sold. Last time, we had sold almost two dozen goats in just 5 days. I have brought only 60 animals, but don’t find buyers. I don’t know whether I will be able to sell these animals before the festival,” he told this newspaper. He displayed different varieties of goats, including Sirohi, Gangapari, Ajmeri and Jamunapari, ranging between Rs15,000 and Rs35,000 per animal. Mohd Shamsul from Harat in Begusarai said, “We are unable to sell the first lot that I have bought from my village. I have around 50 goats but so far only 18 have been sold. We are even ready to reduce the prices, but the customers just leave after enquiring about the prices. The minimum price of a goat is Rs12,000 and the maximum Rs45,000, depending on the weight,” he said. Awadh Pal Yadav, another trader from Uttar Pradesh said, “People mostly buy sacrificial animals only a couple of days before the festival. So, we are hoping the situation to improve in the next few days. We can’t reduce the prices because we are spending more money on animal’s maintenance, feed and transportation.” Mohd Hamza from Samstipur said, “I have reared a dozen of goats at home, but could not find any buyer yet. I have reduced the prices from Rs 14,000 for a small goat to Rs11,000 and for big one from Rs 38,500 to Rs 35,000.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bakrid-goat-traders-stare-at-losses-for-2nd-consecutive-year/articleshow/84508683.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Delhi||Export market at Delhi's Sarojini Nagar to be shut for Covid violations||NEW DELHI: After finding violation of Covid norms, the district administration on Saturday ordered the closure of a section of Sarojini Nagar Market from July 18 till further orders. According to an order issued by the administration, “an inspection was done by the SDM, Vasant Vihar, on Saturday at 5.30 pm and it was found that the export market in Sarojini Nagar was extremely crowded with the Covid-19 norms being grossly violated and no social distance being maintained. While various directions have been issued from time to time for ensuring Covid- appropriate behaviour, the market associations have still not complied with these directions and hence, the decision has been taken to close Export Market, Sarojini Nagar from July 18 till further orders.” Traders’ associations, however, claimed that they were not served the order formally and they got to know about the development only after the local police turned up at the site late Saturday. “After the local police made the announcement, we went to the SDM office to get clarity on the matter but couldn’t find anyone there. We are unhappy with the decision because unlike other places, we ourselves are making best efforts to implement Covid norms and holding meetings with officials regularly. In fact, almost every day, someone is visiting the market from the district administration office and we are not raising objections even if challans are issued to defaulting shopkeepers. But targeting only the shopkeepers and not taking action against others violating norms is not justified,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of Mini Market Traders’ Association. Ashok Kalra, general secretary of Sarojini Nagar Market Association (big shops), said, “We made the specimen passes but the administration demanded photos of the shopkeepers, their workers and other details to be incorporated in the passes. The exercise will take time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/export-market-at-sarojini-ngr-to-be-shut-for-covid-violations/articleshow/84509904.cms||---

A native of Saharsa district, Singh was earlier the VHP’s national vice-president. He has been associated with the organization for decades. In 2010, he was honoured with the Padma Shri Award. The VHP decision was taken at its two-day central committee meeting in Haryana. “The organisation will be strengthened in Bihar,” Singh said and added that a lot is required to strengthen the organisation in a state like Bihar. He further said the Ram Lala temple was being constructed at Ayodhya with the cooperation of the people. “It has been decided to complete the construction work of the temple with people’s cooperation only,” he pointed out. Born in the family of late Radha Ballabh Singh, a retired district and sessions judge, Singh got his initial education in Katihar and later in Patna. After completing his MBBS from PMCH in 1968, he worked as a teacher at NMCH. Later, he went to London for specialization and returned to Patna on his father’s persuasion in 1981. Political observers feel his nomination will impact the political scenario in Kosi-Seemanchal region. Originally hailing from Golma village in Saharsa district, Singh has opened a private hospital at his village to serve the people. He visits the hospital at his native village twice in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dr-r-n-singh-named-vhp-national-president/articleshow/84509141.cms||Ramashankar
---||Hyderabad||Centre’s river management ‘experiment’ can throw up several challenges||By Shailendra JoshiHYDERABAD: It can be considered a momentous day, when the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India, while exercising its powers under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, gazette notified the jurisdictions of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) (SO 2842 E), and the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) (SO 2843 E) for the stretches of two interstate rivers -- Krishna and Godavari — flowing through Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. It may be recalled that both the KRMB and GRMB were constituted by GoI on May 28, 2014. It has taken over seven years for the Ministry of Jal Shakti to determine the jurisdictions of the two Boards. But one was expecting a practical and prudent solution to de-escalate tension between the two Telugu states over interstate river water sharing. Shailendra Joshi retired IAS officer. Let us examine this move of the Centre from theoretical and practical points of view. Since these two Boards do not cover the entire river basin, the management solution offered is at best partial and still depends on external conditions outside the ambit of Boards. The basic principle of natural resource management is allocation of share and other rights among the party state. The rationale for formation of Telangana was to get its due share in interstate rivers. Thus, the most obvious point towards finding an amicable solution i.e. determination of share of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the two rivers is still elusive. It is to be seen how two Boards will allocate water to various projects without overall allocation to each state. Water is an emotive and volatile issue. Its distribution through various projects needs quick political decisions that is at best left at the district and state levels. An outsider with a very short tenure as the chairman of the Board will have the job cut out for him /her. Ministry of Jal Shakti needs to have an exclusive cadre of additional secretary level officials with profound technical and managerial skills to be appointed as chairman and other members of the Boards. Not only do they have to take quick decisions, but also ensure that their decisions are acceptable to the political leadership of both the states. Its prima facie looks like a tall order. Taking over the management of almost the entire water sector projects (except minor irrigation) of both states is like nationalisation of water sector functions of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. One can only hope that this interpretation of the provisions of Reorganization Act to determine jurisdiction of two Boards will not add more problems than addressing the existing issues. This looks like a risky move on several counts. First, water is a state subject and as existing provisions of the Constitution only dispute resolution on inter-state rivers that falls within the purview of the union government. In this regard, the Constitutional provisions will have precedence over provisions in any enactment. Second, states are competent to construct projects with a positive benefit cost analysis within their territories on the basis of dependable/ surplus water. This entire paradigm is now getting changed. Third, union government, through its officials, will find it difficult to adjudicate on meeting the competing water demands of rival states in terms of providing overall quantity, timings and place of their choice and rate of release. Keeping such eventualities in view, the subsidiarity principle cautions against such misadventures. Any operation and management of interstate projects by a third party can also bring charges of favouritism and discrimination putting the onus on the chairman to be more judicious. Fourth, who will bear the expenses of completing such ongoing irrigation projects with interstate ramifications even if they get an improbable nod from the Apex Council? Fifth and the most important issue will be determination of the future course of action to be taken by the project regulator in the aftermath of legal interventions made by the dissatisfied state parties. Placing the concerned project staff at the disposal of the Boards and paying the salaries by the state governments, upfront payment of a sum of Rs 200 crore to each Board by both the states, are going to be other ticklish issues. What should have been the correct course of action? The first and foremost action would be -- quick determination of share of each state preferably in a formula form. The next important thing is creation of interstate river boards involving all riparian states. To sum up, this experiment of nationalisation of water- related functions of the states is going to be a harbinger of many opportunities and challenges. (The writer is a retired IAS officer.

District magistrate Abhishek Singh has asked the officials concerned to achieve the cent percent vaccination target by July 25. A district administration official said altogether 81 session sites, including 14 additional ones, have been set up in the GMC area. “Vaccination will also be done at Red Cross from Monday between 9am and 9pm. Special arrangements have been made at the session sites for pregnant women. For the elderly, persons with disabilities and those suffering from chronic diseases, vaccination will be done at home,” district public relations officer Shambhu Nath Jha said. Earlier, requests were made to religious and the spiritual leaders to motivate people for vaccination. This initiative paid good results and the people are showing willingness for vaccination. “The target of 100% vaccination in GMC area was fixed after Tekari, Bodh Gaya and Sherghati nagar parishads almost achieved the feat,” Jha said. On the other hand, following the mega vaccination drive in the district which started on July 2, the target of 100% vaccination of people above 18 years of age has been achieved in 10 panchayats under 10 blocks – Atri, Bankebazar, Belaganj, Dobhi, Dumaria, Guraru, Gurua, Khisersarai, Nimchak Bathani and Sherghati. “The mega drive was aimed at achieving cent percent vaccination target in at least one panchayat of 24 blocks in the district,” the DPRO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccinate-all-eligible-people-in-gaya-town-by-july-25-dm/articleshow/84509018.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa’s Covid graph depends on people’s behaviour, say experts||PANAJI: Goa’s Covid-19 graph has plateaued down for now, but the direction it will take hereafter will largely depend upon the behaviour of people, the environment and that of the virus. “Our cases have levelled off. Our surveillance has found no signs of a possible third wave so far,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI. Henceforth, the movement of the Covid graph – whether it ascends or descends - Betodkar said will largely depend on the environment, mutations if any, and the behaviour of the people. The weather presently, he said, has compelled people to stay indoors, but with the temperature dropping, more flu cases may be reported. “Temperature has dropped and due to incessant rains people’s movement has been restricted. There has been a sort of balance, currently,” Betodkar said. “The cases may start rising if people start attending functions where maintaining social distancing becomes impossible, or new mutations of the virus will come into play. Otherwise, we will remain on the plateau as the vaccination has picked up,” he said. Goa’s case positivity has been below 5% for the last two weeks and hasn’t shown any signs of rising though few centres in south Goa have a higher caseload. Betodkar said that even during the first wave of the pandemic, Margao, Ponda and Cortalim reported more cases, as these centres have wider jurisdictions. Several peri-urban areas fall under the jurisdiction of Margao urban centre, as also the commercial town is more populated vis-à-vis Panaji, he said. Of the 4,000 to 5,000 Covid tests that are conducted every day, about 1,500 are done at the border check posts. At least, ten to 15 travellers test positive, and they are asked to go back, he said. Those travelling for business purposes or students are permitted entry on the production of a certificate that says that they are fully vaccinated, and not required to submit a Covid-19 negative certificate, yet the tally of tests done at border check posts is high. “That's because the number of travellers who come with a certificate of vaccination is still less,” he said. “The number of people who are fully vaccinated whether in Goa or elsewhere is still low. Goa has been doing very well on the vaccination front as compared to other states, but a majority are yet to be fully vaccinated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-covid-graph-depends-on-peoples-behaviour-say-experts/articleshow/84512059.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Kolkata||Teachers improvise, set up home labs for online practical classes||KOLKATA: Dining tables, kitchen counters, wires from a recent electrical job at home, batteries from the TV remote, spare bulbs, potatoes, sanitiser, food colour, lemon juice, baking soda, a few beakers, test tubes, Bunsen burners and other household equipment have turned into teaching tools for a series of experiments conducted at home to help children understand science concepts. Schools are shut and laboratories out of reach, but teachers do not want students, especially those in Class IX and above who are preparing for their boards, to just learn theory. They want the children to get a taste of experiments, too. Board-year students of 2021 got less than a month for their practical classes when schools reopened briefly in February. Most complained that this was not enough. Practical exams were the only board tests that could be conducted this year and counted towards a big portion — 30 marks — of the results that are being drawn up now. Hence, science teachers are trying their best to introduce experiments through home-grown practical classes that are occupying a sizeable part of the online lessons. Head of the department of biology at Heritage School Anjali Gupta, who is teaching the effects of alcohol on permeability of cell membrane, said, “I have used potatoes and beet roots that were available at home and dipped them in sanitiser instead of alcohol. In the school labs, chemical dyes like safranil and potassium permanganate are used. I have replaced them with food colour and the “blue” that we use for whitening clothes after a wash.” Head of chemistry in the school Suvajit Majumder, who succumbed to post-Covid complications, was teaching students from his elaborate home lab that he had passionately set up, said principal Seema Sapru. While teaching colour change as the effect of acids and bases, Rekha Somashekharan of BDM International school has been showing her chemistry class how a red hibiscus turns bright orange when concentrated lemon juice (acid) is applied and yellow when a solution of baking soda (base) is applied. In her physics class, she has been teaching electromagnetism by winding wires around iron nails or solenoids. “I cannot let students suffer by just learning science through theory. They have to have practical knowledge. Since we cannot take them to laboratories, this is the best I can do for them,” she said. Students of Birla High School are being taught physics by Binay Biswas, who has been a part of the Vigyan Prasar movement of NCERT, who has been livening up his classes with experiments that he is setting up in his working lab — a table and some tools that he has because of his science movement background. “There are virtual labs available, but they are not enough because they show perfect results. Experiments cannot be taught without errors, and that is where live experiments become essential,” he said. Biswas is currently teaching measurement of capacitance to his Plus-II students through experiments conducted at home. “We are using simple tools so kids can work along with us. We have been able to tackle the fear of not being able to access labs among science students this year,” said Piyali Mandal, a biology teacher at BDM International school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teachers-improvise-set-up-home-labs-for-online-practical-classes/articleshow/84510075.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Patna||Bihar: Five railway stations to turn world-class in East Central Railway||PATNA: East Central Railway (ECR) has started the process of redeveloping five stations – Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Gaya Junction, Begusarai, Muzaffarpur and Singrauli – in public-private partnership (PPP) mode. The Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) has been assigned the task to execute the plan fast to give world-class status to these stations as envisaged by the Railway Board. ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said of 123 stations shortlisted for redevelopment across the country, five A-class stations are from the ECR. “Railways had floated tender for the station redevelopment plan recently. A few foreign and India-based firms have expressed interest in the railway station redevelopment plan,” he said. “Rajendra Nagar Terminal, which has been declared neatly maintained and environment-friendly railway station in country, has vast open space in the front side. This open space can be developed with facilities like mall, cinema hall, walking track and other entertainment facilities,” Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said. According to the DRM, Rajendra Nagar Terminal is likely to get direct connectivity of metro rail service in future like that of the Ajmeri Gate in New Delhi. “Under the plan, railways has decided to improve open circulating area of the Rajendra Nagar Terminal for metro rail connectivity,” he said. The CPRO said a blueprint has been worked out for these stations on the pattern of facilities available at different airports. “Railways has allocated Rs 175 crore for redevelopment of the Gaya Junction alone. Based on the anticipated population by the year 2065, railways intends to develop Gaya Junction as the world-class station,” he added. The CPRO added the five shortlisted stations will get facilities like proper ventilation, state-of-the-art washrooms, ATMs, food court and commercial complexes. “There will be no movement of parcel luggage trolleys on platforms. Passengers can make easy movement on station premises. Spacious parking areas at these stations can be used for commercial purposes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/five-railway-stations-to-turn-world-class-in-ecr/articleshow/84508462.cms||Kumod Verma

Altogether 16 persons died after allegedly consuming hooch in the district since Tuesday night. “The SHO of Lauriya police station has not returned from leave even though such an incident has occurred. He has thus been closed to the police lines along with the entire constabulary of the police station. The acting SHO and three chowkidars have been suspended," Champaran Range DIG Lallan Mohan Prasad told TOI late Saturday evening, adding that the police have identified the big sharks involved in the illicit liquor trade. "We caanot disclose the names at present and we are working on leads to nab the kingpins," he said. Earlier on Saturday, IG (Prohibition) Amritraj and excise commissioner B Kartikeya Dhanji reached Bettiah and held a closed-door meeting with the district civil and police officials. "A new team has been placed in the Lauriya PS and we have intensified raids in which 16 hooch vendors have been nabbed so far," the DIG said. Interestingly, an IPRD-Bettiah press release said the officials revisited the homes of the deceased and again took their statements, this time in writing. From the kin of merely four bereaved families that had earlier owed their loss to hooch consumption by the victims, when the DM and other officials visited the affected villages in Saturday’s fresh interactions, twelve bereaved families accepted that the departed had partaken liquor. District magistrate Kundan Kumar on Saturday directed the civil surgeon to issue an advisory to all government and private hospitals and clinics to immediately report cases showing symptoms of liquor consumption and/or poisoning to the local police station and excise officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lauriya-ps-team-changed-16-hooch-vendors-nabbed/articleshow/84508207.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

These venture funds from tier-I and tier-II cities are also driving the next wave of entrepreneurship in and outside Gujarat. For instance, Ahmedabad-based startup accelerator DevX has infused Rs 3 crore in some eleven startups in the last few years. It has launched a venture fund, which invests in early-stage tech-enabled B2B startups. Another city-based seed-stage venture fund, Amara Ventures, has invested in more than a dozen startups in less than a year. Its investment in a startup ranges from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 25 lakh. Disruptworkz Infolabs Private Limited, a recently founded startup for startups, has also created its own corpus of Rs 15 crore to fund startups incubated with them for mentorship and consultancy services. While new players have entered the venture financing space, Ahmedabad is also a home to GVFL, which is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of venture capital (VC) in India. Gujarat University associated incubator—Gujarat University Start-up and Entrepreneurship Council (GUSEC)—has funded some 80 startups since its inception. EIIE.CO, a startup incubator established by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, has been funding and nurturing startups for more than a decade now. "The idea of establishing DevX was to fund startups at an accelerator stage so that there is some validation to the success of its service or product," said Umesh Uttamchandani, founder, DevX. "After our investments into 11 startups, with three of the deals expected to be closed by July-end, we now plan to expand our corpus to Rs 14 crore. Now, we will focus on specific domains and aim at funding at least 16 startups over the next two years, with an average ticket size of Rs 15-40 lakh of funding per startup," added Uttamchandani. Several startups have mushroomed in sectors such as edtech, fintech and healthcare technology in Gujarat. Access to funds gets easier, but the dearth of risk capital continues he rise of local venture capital firms will help startup founders with easier access to capital at an early stage. "The local venture capital firms help startup founders with better and easier access to capital. They have made the launch of startups from tier-II and tier-III cities much easier. We have invested in more than a dozen startups in less than a year and we are very optimistic about the grand startup journey of India in the global market," said Samarth Desai, partner and co-founder of Amara Ventures, which strongly believes in supporting the underdogs. "At any level, a VC or an angel investor should have just one thing in mind that is to help the next generation of entrepreneurs to build companies, which can challenge the strongest players in their segment. The help can be in any form such as raising funds, finding talent and ensuring compliances," he added. According to experts, earlier entrepreneurs used to approach investors for pitching their ideas or funding. With several funding avenues available with startups, investors are now chasing the entrepreneurs. This was not the case a few years back as funds were not available easily and start ups had to demonstrate some success to get funding. Experts also opine that dearth in risk capital continues. "While the startup ecosystem in Gujarat is strengthening by the day, we are still to see investors betting big at the ideation stage There is a dearth of risk capital for innovations," said Uttamchandani.

Last year, the admission process had started in the first week of August and continued till January 2021 because colleges and universities failed to fill up seats. This year, documents like mark sheets and other testimonials can be submitted till December 31. UGC published the academic calendar on Friday. “This will bring some relief because in last two years we have witnessed how filling up seats took several weeks. This time, we only have two months to invite applications, publish merit list and conduct admissions. With UGC allowing to fill up vacant seats till October 31, we will have another month,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. Universities and colleges will have to refund the entire amount if a student cancels admission or migrates to other college or university if it is done within October 31. A processing fee of Rs 1,000 will be deducted if the student cancels admission between November 1 and December 31. “This has been done keeping in mind the financial hardships being faced by several families due to the pandemic,” said another principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-get-1-more-month-to-fill-up-vacant-ug-seats/articleshow/84510052.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Only the deceased, Ram Prasad Singh (75), and his wife Shakuntala Devi were inside their house. Police said jewellery worth around Rs1 lakh and Rs5,000 were looted. Sniffer dogs were pressed into service in the morning, but police could not make any breakthrough in the case. Sources said at least seven to eight dacoits barged into Singh’s house and looted the cash and ornaments before killing him. Later, they also attempted dacoity in a neighbouring house, but failed. Police sources said Singh had caught hold of one of the dacoits after which he was shot in the chest, killing him on the spot. Bihta police station SHO Atulesh Kumar Singh said no empty cartridges were recovered from the spot. “Only Singh and his wife were present in the house. She told the police that four unidentified persons had barged inside their house between 12 midnight and 2am,” he said. The SHO said the woman is in a shock and extreme grief due to which she is unable to give a proper description of the incident to police. Danapur SDPO Vineet Kumar said police are investigating the case from the angle of house dacoity as well as from murder over personal enmity as well. “No such incident had taken place there in the past. So, we are also investigating if someone had an enmity with Singh and intentionally came to kill him by trying to give the impression that it was a dacoity case,” the SDPO said. Kumar said the deceased was a farmer with a humble background and his financial situation was not such that dacoits would target his house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/75-year-old-shot-dead-near-bihta/articleshow/84509113.cms||---

Nitish said, “The community hall has been constructed under the Chief Minister Area Development Scheme. It has nine well-furnished rooms and a kitchen hall. Cultural and wedding functions can be organised here. Even commuters can stay here at night.” The CM added a multipurpose conference building was also being constructed on the same Dak Bungalow premises and asked the officials to complete the construction work at the earliest. “Also inspect the existing building of the Dak Bungalow.

While being the MP from Barh, I always used to remain in regular contact with people of this constituency. I used to walk 12km a day in my constituency to meet people from different villages. One day, I walked up to 16km. People of Barh constituency offered me special love and affection, which I cannot forget,” Nitish said, adding “Even after becoming the Union cabinet minister, I used to walk in the constituency.” Nitish also recalled how he worked for the development of the ‘taal’ area after becoming an MLA from Harnaut and later the cabinet minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.

The Kaimur police got the postmortem of the goat conducted by a government veterinary doctor. The incident took place at village Chaurasia under Mahonia police station area of Kaimur district on Friday morning. However, an FIR was lodged on Saturday only after Radha Devi, while crying hysterically, reached Mohania police station for a second time with her goat’s body, urging the police to take action against the accused. Radha alleged that her neighbour Sipu Ram and his other family members beat her he-goat to death with rods and sticks as it repeatedly went to meet the she-goat on their campus. The woman also alleged that she incurred a loss of at least Rs15,000, which was the estimated market price of the goat. She was planning to sell the goat on the eve of Bakrid. Mohania police station SHO Ram Kalyan Yadav said a case was lodged under Section 429 of IPC (mischief by killing or badly hurting cattle) and being investigated as per the law. “The goat’s postmortem was conducted by a veterinary doctor. The report is awaited,” Yadav said. He said Sipu is the prime accused in the case. “Both the neighbouring families belong to the same caste and might have an old dispute over livestock entering each other’s premises and other issues, resulting in the killing of the goat. However, things would clear only after further investigation,” the SHO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/goat-beaten-to-death-in-kaimur-probe-on/articleshow/84508065.cms||Debashish Karmakar

TOI had asked Ram over the phone about estimated revenue loss incurred by the state exchequer from the rampant illegal sand mining and transportation within the boundaries of the state. Based on an inquiry report of the Economic Offences Unit (EOU), several government officers, including Aurangabad SP Sudheer Kumar Podika and Bhojpur SP Rakesh Kumar Dubey, were removed recently for their alleged nexus with sand smugglers. As per the details available on the official website of the mines and geology department, sand mining is the biggest source of revenue for the state government. As per the information on the website, sand mining generated Rs 428.06 crore revenue in fiscal year 2015-2016 and Rs 457.65 crore in 2016-2017. This share of revenue from the sand mining was only a little less than 50% of the total revenue of Rs 971 crore generated from all sources by the department in 2015-16 and Rs 994.1 crore in the next fiscal year. “This entire operation (crack down on illegal sand mining based on EOU report) is a challenge for me. The government’s priority is to ensure easy sand availability and at right rates for its projects and common people,” he said. The minister said he had been continuously writing to district level authorities to take action against illegal sand mining. “I had earlier brought the matter of nexus between officials and illegal sand mining mafias to the notice of CM Nitish Kumar. Finally, action is being taken against the erring officials, including the ones of my department,” the minister said. Meanwhile, home department sources said EOU has begun its preliminary inquiry, which is a prerequisite for registering a disproportionate assets case, against 42 government officers, including the two IPS officers. “Such inquiries are conducted discreetly. This issue has now become public,” a senior state government official privy to the entire operation said. He said EOU’s inquiry report on rampant illegal sand mining had named 42 government officers, including the two SPs, who were posted in Patna, Bhojpur, Saran, Aurangabad, Rohtas and Kaimur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/illegal-sand-mining-costs-bihar-rs-700-crore-a-year-minister/articleshow/84509186.cms||Debashish Karmakar

This tigress’ movements were earlier photographed inside Tillari forests by a team of wildlife researchers working under a joint project by Bombay Natural History Society and Sahyadri Nisarg Mitra Saunstha of Chiplun. On May 27, 2018, the tigress moved away from the Tillari region into the forests of Chorla Ghat area. A wildlife enthusiast working for the last two decades in the Mhadei region confirmed, “We got images of this tigress on the camera trap in Chorla Ghat in the summer of 2018 in the morning session.” After around four years, the tigress was camera-trapped on June 30, 2021, in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. “We have given this tigress the name of TT7. Through images taken via camera trap technique it had been confirmed that a tigress from the Tillari had moved into the Mhadei sanctuary. On earlier occasions, it has been revealed that tigers are moving from the forests of Maharashtra into the Mhadei and Bhimgad Wildlife sanctuaries of Goa and Karnataka respectively,” wildlife activist working in the Tillari region Girish Punjabi told TOI. Kolhapur forest division chief conservator V Ben Clement said, “The Tillari forests are contiguous to the Mhadei sanctuary and the Bhimgad sanctuary. We will take up joint efforts to protect tigers and monitor their movements with our counterparts.” Presently, the Tillari has the presence of TT2 female tigers and TT8 male tigers whereas the Mhadei forests, besides TT7 tigress, has one male tiger and one female tigress. “As per the recommendations of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, we have taken various steps and mitigation measures for the tiger conservation and protection,” North Goa deputy conservator of forests (wildlife division) Arulraj Jabestin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tigress-spotted-in-tillari-region-moves-into-goa/articleshow/84512165.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Delhi||Delhi University to start admissions on August 2, to stay online||NEW DELHI: Delhi University announced no major changes in the admission process while releasing the registration dates for different programmes on Saturday. Like last year, the entire admission will be online in view of the Covid pandemic. The registration process for merit-based admissions to undergraduate courses will commence from August 2 and continue till the end of the month. Registration for admission to postgraduate, MPhil/PhD and 15 select undergraduate programmes via computer-based, multiple-choice entrance tests will go on from July 26 to August 21. Assuring aspirants of smooth conduct of the admissions from the “comfort of their homes”, acting vice-chancellor P C Joshi said, “Please do not feel stressed. We will be there to help. We will make sure the whole process is smooth and hassle-free.” The criteria decided by the university for the enrolment process in 2020 considering the challenges posed by the pandemic remain unchanged for the current admission cycle. There will also be no change in the registration fees for merit-based admissions and for the DU Entrance Test (DUET) or in the cancellation charges. DUET will be conducted by National Testing Agency and the dates will be announced later. Rajeev Gupta, chairperson, DU admission committee, however, added that while all trial-based admissions (extracurricular activities and sports quota entries) would be based on certificates, students would be asked to apply based on four years of performance. “But the students are free to use the best of three years’ certificates. We are aware that many would have participated in online events from home even during the lockdown this year,” said Gupta. The centralised UG admissions will be carried out through a common registration-cum-application form and all departments and constituent colleges will use the same form for the admissions. Similarly, for the postgraduate programmes, the candidates need only fill a single common registration form but pay separate registration fees if opting for more than one programme. Sanjeev Singh, joint director, DU Computer Centre, claimed that the 2021 online admission process would be more student-friendly, transparent, centralised, contact-free and paperless with the launch of a “new, refined website” dedicated to admission-related information. He said this would have matrices on seats, cutoffs, etc, as well as an automated chatbot to answer the applicants’ queries. On the cut-off marks will be determined this year with Class XII results based on internal assessments, Gupta said, “We trust CBSE and other state education boards to leave us with no technical issues to grapple with. Every college has an admission committee, and each will consider its factors before deciding the cutoffs a few days after the closing of registrations. The admission branch will see if these qualifying marks align with the current trend.” DU will release its information bulletin closer to the registration dates. It is also planning a number of webinars and tutorial videos on its website and on social media to assist admission aspirants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-to-start-admissions-on-aug-2-to-stay-online/articleshow/84509948.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

She was discharged within 24 hours of the surgery that was done using the minimally invasive surgery (MIS) technique at Manipal hospital. Dr Rohan Desai, hip and knee replacement surgeon, said the patient had consulted them a couple of years ago with problems in her left knee. The need for surgery was not felt then. “About a couple of weeks ago, she visited us and upon examination, her knee was found to be severely deformed. She was not able to stand or walk and was confined to a wheelchair,” Desai said. After doing necessary medical fitness tests and counselling, it was decided to take up her knee replacement surgery. She had comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiac issues - on pacemaker for 15 years, nephropathy and anemia. The ailments were managed well before and after the surgery. “Medical management of comorbidities is very important for a successful surgery. We performed it using the MIS technique and within a few hours, she was able to stand and walk to everyone’s surprise. This is the first time in Goa that such a surgery was performed on a 98-year-old having comorbidities,” he said. Manish Trivedi, hospital director, said people tend not to undergo such procedures once they reach a certain age, say after 60 or 70 years. “It is never late to undergo any kind of medical procedure, subject to prior consultation with a doctor. The patient in question was able to stand and walk without any problems in just a day after the surgery,” Trivedi said. “Fast mobilisation within a few hours was possible, thanks to the multimodal analgesia and advancements in anesthesia techniques, which we use,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/98-year-old-undergoes-knee-replacement/articleshow/84512084.cms||---
---||India||ED probes media portal’s funding from businessman ‘linked’ to China regime||NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate’s investigation into a money laundering case against media portal Newsclick and its promoters has turned the spotlight on their financial dealings with Neville Roy Singham, a businessman of Sri Lankan-Cuban descent whom the investigators have identified as the key source of Rs 38 crore that PPK Newsclick Studio Pvt Ltd received between 2018 and 2021 from abroad. Sources in the agency, who have been mapping the flow of funds to the media outlet, alleged that Singham was associated with the propaganda arm of the Communist Party of China (CPC). They also claimed that the probe has established that part of the money Newsclisck allegedly received from foreign sources went to activists such as Gautam Navlakha, one of the accused in the Elgar Parishad case. The anti-money laundering agency recently interrogated Navlakha in jail about his association with Newsclick’s founder and editor-in-chief Prabir Purkayastha. Most of the money received by the portal has been shown as proceeds from “export of services”. When contacted by TOI, Purkayastha denied the allegations about Singham being a front for CPC and his outlet’s links with the Chinese regime. He said Singham is an American citizen who launched and ran a software company in the US before selling it for around $700-800 million. “All our funds are from legitimate sources and well-known foundations in the US as per RBI guidelines,” Purkayastha said. ED sources said their investigations have shown the media portal received funds from Justice and Education Fund Inc, US; GSPAN LLC, US; Tricontinental Ltd Inc, USA — all located at the same address — and Centro Popular Demidas, Brazil. ED sources said the agency’s searches at the premises of shareholders of PPK Newsclick in February this year had thrown up regular exchanges of emails in connection with the Communist Party of China (CPC), a charge denied by Newsclick editor-in-chief Prabir Purkayastha. “If they have anything against us, let them file all these facts in the chargesheet before the court. We are ready to face trial and respond to all those charges,” said the Newsclick founder, who recently successfully petitioned the court to restrain ED from taking any coercive action against him.He expressed his inability to comment on ED’s claim that Singham has been working out of China, but said that it was possible that the businessman had located himself in that country during the pandemic because he found it safer. ED sources said the payments to Newsclick were linked to “specific jobs” like sprucing up China’s role in Africa, where it has attracted charges of high-handedness and predatory capitalism, and defending the Communist regime’s crackdown on Jack Ma, the promoter of online commerce giant Alibaba They said the agency is also investigating payments of large sums to journalists for any irregularities. Besides, Purkayastha has been asked about payment of money to one Bappaditya Sinha, a CPM member who maintains Twitter handles of some party leaders. When asked, Purkayastha acknowledged Newsclick’s links with Sinha, but said Sinha was paid for software services he provided. “There is nothing wrong about it,” he said. In addition to ED, other agencies are looking into the ‘China angle’ in the case, specifically into alleged surrogate funding by the CPC to build a ‘media narrative’ in India that suits Beijing's interests. The probe seems set to extend to Singham’s links with a senior politician. During his questioning by ED officials, Purkayastha was asked to provide details of services exported by his company, for which it had received about Rs 28.5 crore (between 2018 and 2021). He has also been asked to explain how funds running into crores had started flowing from abroad into Newsclick within a few months of the launch of the company, sources added. While trailing financial transactions, the agency came across one payment of Rs 1.55 crore to an electrician and Purkayastha has been asked to provide information on the “nature of work” the latter executed. Purkayastha said the government had sent income tax, the economic offences wing of the Delhi Police and the ED behind them, probably because they are not pro-government. “All of them have the same set of questions regarding the source of our funds and people associated with us,” he said. He defended the company’s share valued at more than Rs 11,000 each as “fair assessment” of the company, the valuation for which was conducted professionally, as is the case with any startup. Fearing arrest, Newsclick’s editor-in-chief had approached the Delhi high court seeking anticipatory bail. The court has given him protection from any ‘coercive action’ by the ED till July 29 when the case is listed for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-probes-media-portals-funding-from-businessman-linked-to-china-regime/articleshow/84514212.cms||Pradeep Thakur

---||Delhi||South Delhi municipal corporation to install 50 more e-charging points soon||NEW DELHI: As part of its electric vehicle policy to establish charging stations after every 3 km in its jurisdiction, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has made 40 e-charging points operational for four-wheelers so far. These are at parking lots in Nehru Place, Lajpat Nagar, Kamal Cinema, B-6 Safdarjung, Greater Kailash R block, Millennium Park, Hauz Khaz, Defence Colony and other places. The civic body targets to make another 50 e-charging points operational by August 15. All these stations are equipped with EV supply equipment, charger management system, meter box, LED screens and CCTV cameras. For uninterrupted power supply, it has already installed pole-mounted distribution transformers of 100 kilowatt each at 18 stations. A senior SDMC official said that a joint survey was earlier done by officials from BSES, the civic body and other agencies concerned to select the locations. These e-charging stations are being set up by public sector enterprises, including Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) and Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL). EESL has set up 35 e-charging points and BECIL five. “As per contract, the PSUs will be charging Rs 10 per kilowatt hour from customers,” said a south corporation official. SDMC is also working towards establishing 35 e-charging stations for two-wheelers by this year. “Two-wheelers contribute to 2/3rd of the vehicular pollution in cities, which is why we are emphasising on creating separate points for charging two- wheelers, particularly on roadsides. Sites for these 35 points have been identified and Telecommunications Consultants India Limited has expressed interest in the project. But we will be able to finalise the sites after a joint survey. Even three-wheelers can be charged at these stations,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner, Remuneration and Project Cell of SDMC. Jha added that after the Centre’s announcement giving a major rebate on electric two-wheelers, its sales are likely to jump. “Taking note of the future requirement, we are interested in setting up stations for them. The service providers in the e-commerce industry are mainly using a fleet of two-wheelers for supplying orders to customers and we expect them to use these stations in large numbers,” said Jha. In 2019, south corporation had signed its first MoU with EESL for setting up these stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-to-install-50-more-e-charging-points-soon/articleshow/84509986.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Delhi||New Delhi Municial Council: Private player to operate sweepers||NEW DELHI: For ensuring 100% mechanical sweeping on major roads, New Delhi Municipal Council has decided to hire a concessionaire for operation and maintenance of mechanical sweepers. “We have seven mechanical sweeping machines which work in two shifts. Each of them covers 35-kilometre area in one shift and all of them together cover around 250 kilometres in a day. Though the machines belong to us, we have hired drivers through a private concessionaire to do the job. However, recently it has been realised that in case a part of the mechanical sweeper gets damaged and any hired staff doesn’t turn up to the work, our work suffers for days,” said an NDMC official. “To resolve the problem, we have decided to hire a private concessionaire who will operate, maintain these vehicles and cover a defined distance every day without lapses. The concessionaire will have to get the machine faults fixed in 10 days maximum,” said the official. Meanwhile, NDMC has also initiated an exercise to install 34 underground bins at all strategic locations in a phased manner. So far, 24 underground bins have been installed. Unlike conventional bins, which often give an ugly look when filled, these are barely visible on roads and can be cleaned conveniently. “The sensor-based dustbins are connected to the command and control centre, and if not cleaned, they send alerts to the centre. It helps us to know which dustbins have not been cleaned. Also, garbage is not spilling out anymore,” said the NDMC official. The project was introduced in December 2018 with 20 bins installed at important places. These projects are aimed at improvingthe ranking s of NDMC in Swachhta Survekshan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ndmc-pvt-player-to-operate-sweepers/articleshow/84510002.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Nagpur||Strong correlation between ‘Long Covid’ & comorbidity: GMCH study||Nagpur: Patients, declared recovered with RTPCR negative status, sometimes have symptoms for a longer period of time. Such patients have been labelled ‘Long Covid’ by the world health organization (WHO). A first of its kind study on ‘Long Covid’ by the medicine department of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Nagpur, during the first wave of Covid has come up with some interesting observations. The study found over 75% of patients who required ICU during Covid treatment continue experiencing fatigue for up to 90 days post ‘official’ recovery; 70% experience shortness of breath (dyspnea), 62% continue suffering from muscle pain (myalgia) and over 55% suffer from loss of taste and smell for months post-Covid. For this study, that evaluated post-Covid manifestations, 200 patients, discharged from the ICU at GMCH between July 1, 2020 and September 30 2020, were followed up for 3 months post-discharge. Associate professor Dr Dipti Chand guided third year medicine resident Dr Preeti Namjoshi and lecturer Dr Ashish Nimsarkar who conducted this study. “As physical follow-up of patients in OPD was difficult due to travel restrictions, we decided to follow up telephonically. Only some patients were specifically asked to come to the hospital for repeat CT scans,” says Dr Chand. Participants included patients between 15 to 80 years of age with co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension and bronchial asthma. The study found that fatigue (increased tiredness on routine activity), shortness of breath and altered smell sensation persisted for up to 2 months in more than 70% patients. Altered taste sensation was persistent in 55 % patients. The other common symptoms that persisted were joint pain (36.5%) and muscle cramps, especially in the legs (62%). Sore throat, cough and decreased appetite were seen in 22.5 % and 28.5% patients respectively. Strong co-relation was seen between ‘Long Covid’ and co-morbid illness (hypertension and diabetes) increasing the duration of symptom persistence. The duration of hospital stay was directly proportional to the length of ‘Long Covid’. Nearly 40% patients had received high flow oxygen (> 15 litres, NIV an HFNO) on admission and 4% of them were dependent on home-based oxygen therapy for routine functional activity post- recovery. Follow-up studies of the same subject conducted in Italy and China too have similar findings. The study done by Apollo Hospitals has revealed that the manifestation of post-Covid complications in a number of patients is four-fold higher in the second wave as compared to the first wave. The GMCH study also gives an important message for policy makers. “The burden of caring for Covid survivors is likely to be huge. Therefore, it is important for policy makers to develop comprehensive strategies in providing resources and capacity in the healthcare system,” stated the study. LONG COVID WAVE 200 | Discharged from Covid ICU in GMCH in the 1st wave were followed up for 3 months 75.5% | Reported fatigue for months post recovery 70% | Dyspnea 55.5% | Anosmia 62% | Myalgia 2.5% | Completely free of any symptoms 32.5% | 1 or 2 symptoms 55% | 3 to 6 symptoms 10% | 7 or more even after recovery * Symptoms like joint pain, muscle pain, rash on skin, sleep disorder were experienced not during but post Covid in patients||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/strong-correlation-between-long-covid-comorbidity-gmch-study/articleshow/84510040.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Delhi||After a year, Delhi HC collegium again sends names for judges to SC||NEW DELHI: Functioning at just half its sanctioned strength for almost a year, Delhi high court has set in motion the process to get more judges. TOI has learnt that the high court collegium has recommended eight names from the subordinate judiciary to the Supreme Court for elevation after a long-drawn deliberation over several names. The latest recommendations have been made nearly a year after the Supreme Court returned the six names that the high court sent last year. The apex court had declined to appoint the six district judges to the high court and returned the names for “reconsideration” on various grounds, including that some of the senior judges had been bypassed. Since then the process to shortlist judges from the district judiciary, also commonly known as the “service quota”, has been under way with the collegium examining the candidates in the zone of consideration for elevation to the higher post. It has now finalised eight names for clearance by the Supreme Court and then by the central government. These are Poonam Bamba, Yashwant Kumar, Neena Bansal Krishna. Dinesh Kumar Sharma, Anoop L Mendiratta, Rajiv Mehra, Swaran Kanta Sharma and Sudhir Kumar Jain, with all except Mehra, being at the level of district judge. According to sources, the collegium also considered the names of Girish Kathpalia, Dharmesh Sharma and Deepak Jagotra, among others, but didn’t propose them after “comprehensive evaluation”. As a matter of practice, names from the service quota get cleared swiftly by both the Supreme Court and the central government while names from the bar are subjected to deeper scrutiny. TOI reported last year on how the high court’s recommendations last year ran into rough weather because of the Centre’s objections not only about bypassing seniority norms, but also adverse IB reports. There was also concerns that the seniormost judges in service at the time were ignored according to representations sent to the Centre and the Supreme Court judges by a senior judicial officer who had been overlooked for elevation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-a-year-hc-collegium-again-sends-names-for-judges-to-sc/articleshow/84510018.cms||Abhinav Garg

The SI was involved in a heated argument over signing of a verification report. Heavy police force was deployed in Jhalu town under Haldaur police station. A police team led by additional superintendent of police Praveen Kumar Ranjan inspected the area. According to SI Arun Kumar Rana, he was out to purchase something when four masked men attacked him. He received minor injury on the toe. The miscreants were on two bikes and were carrying batons and sharp objects. "The men threatened me with dire consequences. Now, if I am killed, it will be murder of the entire police department," the SI said. The SI further narrated, "I was posted at Jhalu police picket on Thursday. A man named Umang Kakran came to me and forced me to issue character certificate. When I told him to issue it only after verification, he misbehaved. He then got me suspended. I was on my way to market the next day when four men attacked me." Notably, Umang Kakran is a local activist. In a press note, Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh had announced the SI's suspension for "dereliction of duty and misbehaving with Umang Kakran, a lawyer by profession". When contacted, the Bijnor SP said, "Police have registered a case against four unidentified men. They are checking CCTV footage.

The CM had made the same demand while commemorating the legacy of Bahuguna at Delhi assembly where the government had installed a portrait and a stone in his memory. Bahuguna died on May 21, 2021. During the ceremony, Kejriwal had said that it was now that people were realising the importance of Bahuguna’s foresight. “We realise that if we continue to tamper with the environment, there will be a time when the entire humankind will cease to exist. We are at a stage that it is imperative for us to follow the principles laid down by him through his constant struggle. In his letter Kejriwal said, when the cause of environmental protection was not a part of international discourse, Bahuguna foresaw the threat and dedicated his life to it. The CM stressed on the significance of Bahuguna’s Chipko movement and how it spread from Himalayas to Karnataka. “Bahuguna understood the message that humankind is making a mistake by considering nature as its private property” the chief minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-seeks-bharat-ratna-for-bahuguna/articleshow/84510048.cms||---

---||Goa||GIDC eyeing ‘atmanirbhar’ by taxing MSMEs: Goa Inc||PANAJI: Goa State Industries Association (GSIA) has reacted strongly to Goa Industrial Development Corporation’s plans to enhance the lease rent and said that such a move would hurt economic recovery. GSIA, in a strongly worded letter, demanded that instead of taxing entrepreneurs, the corporation should recover pending dues from defaulters, including Rs 7 crore from the Centre for infrastructure created for Def-Expo at Quitol-Quepem. “To achieve financial sustainability of the corporation and to cover its financial mismanagement, GIDC cannot think of burdening the industries every time,” said Kochkar. He pointed out that across the country, state governments and the Centre are working on schemes to support MSMEs affected by the pandemic. “Here, Goa government is asking GIDC to become atmanirbhar at the cost of industries,” said Kochkar. At the GIDC board meeting held on Wednesday, agenda item No. 6 proposed a hike in lease rent due to the “absence of any long-term policy on the financial sustainability” of GIDC. “It is deplorable to note that GIDC is trying repeatedly to burden the industrial units for its financial mismanagement and misused of funds. We feel that any further increase in lease rent will be strongly opposed by the industries and it will vitiate the industrial climate in the state,” said Kochkar. In 2013, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had persuaded industrialists to agree for 10% increase in lease rent every three years and had assured the industries that the increase would come into effect only after the initial 30-year lease period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gidc-eyeing-atmanirbhar-by-taxing-msmes-goa-inc/articleshow/84512118.cms||---

The report has to be submitted to the state within 15 days. A government resolution to the effect was issued on Saturday. On Friday, as students logged on to the link provided by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) at 1pm —the scheduled announcement of results—they could not access it. MSBSHSE then came up with alternate links and students began to access their results after 6 pm. Due to the erratic access, though, several students gave and checked their marks on Saturday. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad constituted a five-member committee headed by the education commissioner. It will probe whether a trial run was carried out before the results were made available to students. Also, if the board had held meetings with technical experts before the launch of the links.

---||Lucknow||Do Boond Immunity Ke is RSS mantra to tackle Covid third wave||LUCKNOW: The famous Pulse Polio campaign catchline ‘Do Boond Zindagi Ke’ has been redefined by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to launch its own immunity-boosting drive to take on the third wave of Covid pandemic with special focus on vulnerable children. The catchline here is ‘Do Boond Immunity Ke’ and involves the administration of Ayurvedic concoction called ‘Suvarna Prashana’ to children between 1 and 16 years of age. Another difference is that it is given only on the day of ‘Pushya Nakshatra’, which happens just once a month. The campaign was launched by the RSS offshoot Arogya Bharti on July 11, the day of ‘Pushya Nakshatra’ and preparations are on to hold it again on August 7, the day which will have a similar celestial arrangement. On July 11, when Arogya Bharati workers launched the ayurvedic immunization programme, several BJP leaders and ministers were also present. Women and child development minister Swati Singh launched the campaign by administering ‘Suvarna Prashana’ drops to children at a Saraswati Shishu Mandir School. Cabinet minister for law Brijesh Pathak also administered drops at the Indira Nagar Branch of Saraswati Shishu Mandir. Pathak confirmed to TOI that he was present on the occasion. “For ages, Suvarna Prashana has been very good in boosting the immunity of children and increasing their intellectual power,” he said. A senior RSS functionary told TOI that the doses of Suvarna Prashana have been brought from Gujarat and the campaign would be held on every Pushya Nakshatra day until the majority of children get the drop. Arogya Bharati would delve in detail about the mass campaign undertaken and how it plans to further expand on the second day of the coordination meeting being held in the city. Meanwhile, on Saturday, RSS joint secretary Dr Krishna Gopal gave details of decisions taken at the RSS all-India meet at Chitrakoot during the first day of the coordination meet. RSS workers from region and province were present in the day-long sessions. Although RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale was supposed to chair the meeting, he couldn’t make it. He is expected to be present on Sunday. On Sunday, besides Arogya Bharati, other offshoots would also talk about their works and programmes they would be taking in future. During the meeting, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal would remain present. CM Yogi Adityanath, his deputies Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dr Dinesh Sharma would also be present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/do-boond-immunity-ke-is-rss-mantra-to-tackle-covid-3rd-wave/articleshow/84513573.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Kanpur||UPMRC invites suggestions on traffic diversion plan for underground section||Kanpur: A four-km-long underground Metro corridor is going to be constructed between Chunniganj and Nayaganj. In this section, four underground metro stations — Chunniganj, Naveen Market, Bada Chauraha and Nayaganj — will be constructed. For the construction of these Metro stations, a traffic diversion system will be introduced at all the four places, which will remain the same for about two years after coming into effect. Keeping in mind the convenience of the citizens, Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited has made an effective strategy for traffic diversion. UPMRC and Kanpur traffic police have decided to invite suggestions from the residents of the city before the implementation of the new traffic diversion plan. Primarily, this strategy is to be implemented for the proposed diversion near the Naveen Market Metro station. The details of the diversion plan prescribed for the Naveen Market station will be made available on the social media platforms of UPMRC and Uttar Pradesh Traffic Police, on which the residents can submit their suggestions in the form of comments till July 20. Keeping these suggestions in mind, suitable modifications in the diversion plan will be considered and finally, the plan approved by the traffic police will be implemented with effect from July 21. The proposed diversion plan for the Naveen Market is: The Naveen Market Metro station is proposed between Parade Crossroad and Kalyan Ji Bakery. Vehicles coming from the Lal Imli crossroad can take a left turn from the Parade intersection to reach Bada Chauraha via Civil Lines/Empire Lane. A 12-feet space will be left parallel to the barricading from Parade Crossroad to Kalyan ji Bakery for the passengers going to Naveen Market. This route will work as a one-way. Passengers coming from the Bada Chauraha side can use this route parallel to the barricading to reach Naveen Market. At the same time, vehicles coming from Lal Imli side, who have to go to Naveen Market, can reach the turn of Bhargava Hospital via Empire Lane and after that turn to the right and reach the Naveen Market via the road provided beside the barricading. It is also to be mentioned that the parking at main road area will be removed and citizens can park their vehicles at Crystal parking. Denizens can contact UPMRC for giving their suggestions.

---||Allahabad||‘Health & lives of people important’||He further said that although the CM wishes that the kanwar yatra be held with all Covid-19 protocols and norms in place, it is also the moral responsibility of the devotees to see that their deeds should not, in any way, enhance the possibility of triggering the third wave of the pandemic. “As such, it is advisable that the pujan (prayers) of Lord Shiva should be either done through making a Parthiv Shivlinga at their respective homes or if at all the devotees decides to visit the neighbouring Shiva temple, they must follow all the protocols and safety norms” said Giri. He further said that the health and lives of the people are equally important as are the religious practices and traditions, thus the best option is that like the previous year, we should not take out the yatra this year too. Agreeing to ABAP’s president, chief patron of Juna Akhara, Mahant Hari Giri said, “Akhara Parishad has taken the right decision as during the kanwar yatra, the religious sentiments are quite strong and devotees often forget to keep a safe distance between themselves and as such the crowd and groups of devotees can enhance the risk of spreading the virus and unnecessarily inviting the third wave.” “Rather, praying in the house and pleading to Lord Shiva for keeping the nation safe from the pandemic is the need of the hour,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/health-lives-of-people-important/articleshow/84509421.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Congress holds cycle rally, wants excise & VAT on fuel axed||PANAJI: The Centre and the state should abolish the excise duty and VAT levied on fuel prices so that the common man does not suffer an additional burden due to the exorbitant fuel and diesel prices, Congress said here on Saturday.  Congress said that in the seven years that Narendra Modi has been prime minister, the prices of all essential commodities have only gone up. The state unit of Congress said fuel must be sold at the landing price of Rs 36 per litre at fuel bunkers without the steep excise duty and VAT levied on petrol and diesel. “We demand that in order to give people relief, the price of petrol should be brought to Rs 35-36 per litre. The government, to fill its coffers, has imposed tax on the landing price of petrol and has increased the cost of petrol and diesel 65 times in recent months,” said state party president Girish Chodankar. Congress organised a cycle rally from Panaji to Porvorim as part of a nationwide protest, but heavy rain forced them to abandon the rally in Panaji itself. “The government that came to power by promising good days is giving people bad days. The price of everything has increased so much that today, people’s backs are broken,” said leader of opposition Digambar Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-holds-cycle-rally-wants-excise-vat-on-fuel-axed/articleshow/84512145.cms||---

The CM also started Janata Darbar at his residence earlier this week where he has been interacting with the public. “The CM had issued this order in 2019 but due to Covid, the system had to be suspended. Now that the situation has improved significantly, he said during the Team 9 meeting on Saturday that this process should be restarted. All additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries have been directed to be present in their offices from 10 am to 12 pm at least five days a week and meet people to resolve their problems,” said a government spokesperson. He added that officers on field duty should also be similarly present in their field office at the appointed hours to interact with the general public. “This will also apply to all district level officers and senior police officers,” he said. When this rule had been formulated in 2019, the CM office had randomly called officials on their landlines to check whether they were following orders and were present in office. Those who were found absent were pulled up by the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-asks-senior-govt-officials-to-remain-available-to-public-for-2-hrs-every-day/articleshow/84513502.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Farmer-administration talks inconclusive in Sirsa, talks on||Sirsa: Farm activists started an indefinite protest at the mini-secretariat in Sirsa after holding a mahapanchayat under the leadership of Sayunkta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Rakesh Tikait for the release of five farmers arrested in a sedition case, and withdrawal of a “secret FIR” registered against 100 farmers who stormed the BJP district executive body’s Sunday meeting here. A mahapanchayat was organised at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Stadium in Sirsa. In view of the crowd of farmers, the administration invited farmers for talks, but the talks were not successful. After this, farmers left Shaheed Bhagat Singh Stadium to gherao the SP office and sat on a dharna outside the mini secretariat on the way to the protest. In view of the farmers’ protest, the administration has deployed 25 duty magistrates, with whom 25 companies of police and paramilitary forces are deployed. Even before the mahapanchayat of farmers, the administration barricaded the mini secretariat, Bhumanshah Chowk and deployed a police force. On Saturday morning, when farmers were going to the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Stadium for the mahapanchayat, they were stopped, due to which there was a clash between farmers and police personnel. Later, a group of farmers uprooted the barricades and left for Shaheed Bhagat Singh Stadium. After this, police did not stop the farmers, but the police kept an eye on their activities with drone cameras. Later, farmer leaders addressed the farmers in the stadium. In view of the crowd of farmers, the administration invited farmer leaders for talks, then the farmer leaders Rakesh Tikait, Jagjit Dalewal, Kulwant Sandhu, Vikas Sisar, Abhimanyu Kuhar, Ravi Azad, Mandeep Nathwan, Prahlad Singh Bharukhera, Sudesh Goyat and Sirsa’s local farmer leaders, about 21 member farmer’s delegation went for talks. During the conversation, Inspector general of police (IGP) Rakesh Arya and superintendent of police Arpit Jainon showed the video footage of the July 11 incident to the farmers’ delegation and said that the arrested farmers were involved in the incident. Sudesh Goyat said that the administration could not show any such video in which farmers have stones in their hands. The people who pelted stones were government men and now the farmers are being arrested. This administration has become a slave of the government, so there is little hope of justice, she said. The talks here remained inconclusive and the farmer leaders came back to the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Stadium and then left to gherao the SP office. On the way, the farmers started a dharna on Barnala road. During this, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said no matter how many days they have to stay here, he will take a breath only after getting farmers released. The dharna has been started here, so that if the administration calls for talks, the distance does not remain much, Tikait said. Three cops and as many farmers were injured on Sunday, after protesters pelted Haryana deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa’s car with stones and smashed its rear windscreen. On July 11, the Civil Lines police station registered FIR 204 on the complaint of duty magistrate, district welfare officer Sushil Kumar, against Harcharan Singh and Prahlad Singh among those 100 protesters. The Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections that were applied include 124-A (sedition), 148 (armed riot), 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (injuring public servants), and 353 (criminal force to deter public servants). After this, Sirsa SP Bhupender Singh was transferred to IRB in Bhondsi and IPS officer Arpit Jain brought in as replacement. Civil Lines police station officer in charge Vikram Singh was suspended, and departmental inquiry recommended against DSP Sanjay Kumar, on the report of IGP Rakesh Arya. After this, police arrested farmers Balkar Singh, Nikka Singh, Balkaur Singh of Faggu, Sahab Singh of Khairpur, and Daljit Singh of Ranga on Thursday morning, a court remanded them in judicial custody on the same day. Govt run by company, not even BJP: Tikait SKM leader Rakesh Tikait said if there was a government of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or the Congress in the country, it would have negotiated with farmers, but now there was a government of a company because BJP’s big leaders were not even involved in party decisions. The agitation against the company’s government also goes on for a long time. Haryana government has taken responsibility for bringing the farmers’ movement of Delhi to Hisar and Sirsa and under this, farmers are being molested and cases are being registered under sedition, Tikait said. Road to deputy CM's house sealed On Saturday, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala was in Sirsa. However, in view of protests by Rural Safai Karamcharis Union, all roads leading to his house and that of power minister Ranjit Singh’s house were also sealed by police. However, it was claimed that despite sealed roads, the deputy CM listened to the grievances of people at his residence. Farmers give way to ambulance During the agitation on Saturday morning, when an ambulance was passing through Barnala road carrying a patient, police personnel did not give way by removing barricades. When farmers came to know about the matter, they reached there and started removing the barricades, then the police themselves removed the barricades and gave way to the ambulance. Fast unto death On Saturday evening, farmers announced that their dharna will continue near the mini secretariat in Sirsa. Baldev Singh will start a fast unto death from Saturday. Until five farmers are not released, they will not eat a morsel of food, farmers announced.

Religious structures have allegedly encroached upon a huge chunk of the park land. These illegal religious places are operating inside the Central Park by constructing permanent walls. Samiti’s president said, “Central Park is being encroached and misused by various anti-social elements in the name of religion and vehicles are being taken inside the prohibited areas of the park. This has resulted in the degradation of ecology and the greenbelt developed after serious efforts of numerous public-spirited persons.” The samiti further alleged that the Central Park area is a no-construction zone and no construction of any nature could be raised as per a high court order in 1996. But certain people are causing prejudice to the rights and interest of the public at large, have illegally encroached upon the land by establishing religious structures. “Since the title and ownership of the Central Park is with JDA, it is incumbent upon the JDA to maintain and keep a watch on the encroachers. But no efforts have been made to save the park,” said another samiti member. The samiti further alleged that the Central Park is the heart of the city and the JDA has failed to discharge its responsibilities, as from horse stables to private clubs, all are operating in the park which is a public property. The golf course and polo management too had encroached upon the parking space and the park space adjoining the club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/remove-squatters-from-central-park-not-the-hotel-samiti/articleshow/84513649.cms||---

Thanking them for the hard work over the past one-and-half years, she said: “Our organisation is in place till the nyay panchyat level and soon the structure till gram panchayats will be ready. Time has come to give the final push. Be fearless and battle it out.” Priyanka then held meetings with frontal organisations, student’s bodies, women’s delegations and other functionaries. In Lakhimpur Kheri, she parried a query on being the party’s chief ministerial face in Uttar Pradesh, saying “Should I tell you everything now”. To another question on whether she will contest the elections, Priyanka said, “We will see.” On her party’s strategy for the crucial assembly polls next year, she categorically said, Congressmen will always stand with the people in their joy and pain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dont-be-scared-fight-to-win-2022-priyanka-to-cadre/articleshow/84513427.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: CM Yogi Adityanath launches theme song for BJP campaign in Battle 2022||LUCKNOW: Setting the tone for the 2022 UP assembly elections, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday released the theme song, “UP Number 1”. The song has been woven around the achievements of the Yogi government in the past four and a half years in Uttar Pradesh, referring to the projects of the state government that brought prosperity to the state and the actions taken by the government that won appreciation from the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the higher-ups in the BJP and the Sangh.  Investors summit and the investment that it brought to the state finds foremost mention along with the state government’s schemes to upgrade skills in youth and make them employment-friendly, ‘Badha nivesh toh badhi income, nivesh mila UP mein bhari bharkam’. Composed as a rap, the song, that starts with ‘Jabse Yogiji bane CM, apna UP hai number one’, endorses brand Yogi which is already going strong after being praised by PM Narendra Modi in Varanasi and by the national BJP president JP Nadda in the executive committee meeting of UP BJP for turning UP into a leading state. The song projects that brand through its lyrics and shows that UP has shed its old image of being a laggard under the leadership of CM Yogi. Featuring Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in action, the video shows him inaugurating the projects, addressing public gatherings, walking with an air of authority, talking to children and women and holding a Janata Darbar. PM Narendra Modi also features alongside Yogi in few clips.  While heaping praise on the CM, the lyricist has not forgotten to hand out the credit for the state’s performance to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s `margdarshan’ and to the `double engine ki sarkaar’, BJP government at the centre and the state. CM Yogi, often attacks the previous Akhilesh government for not utilising the Central schemes, like PM Awas, for development of Uttar Pradesh.  ‘Aagaya hai ab Ramrajya yahan’ hints towards the action taken by the CM to cleanse the state of mafia and uphold law and order. The song, in a way, is also a retort to the opposition that has always attacked the government for state of employment in UP and Covid managament besides other factors as it glorifies the efforts taken by the government in the direction, ‘Covid management, raashan vitaran, muft ilaaj sabko, vaccination, sab ore shanti hai hardam’, makes clear the Yogi government is confident of what it has done for the state in the past four years in office and mudslinging by opposition won’t deter it. The work for which Yogi has earned maximum laurels from the higher-ups in the party and what has modelled his image of being a tough administrator is his action against rioters, those vandalising public property and people making UP unsafe for women. The song also gives credit to Yogi for that, ‘dangai, gangster, mahila apradh; sab par lagayi hai lagaam’. ‘Up ab kisi se nahin hai kam’, ‘Desh mein lahraya UP ka parcham’ reiterate that it’s because of Yogi that state has reached to where it stands today.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-launches-theme-song-forbjp-campaign-in-battle-2022/articleshow/84513570.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Lucknow||Ahead of UP polls, social outfitsup ante on SC status to Nishads||Lucknow: The issue of reservation for Nishads may set the tone for the upcoming state assembly elections in UP where the community, which reportedly constitutes at least 18% of the population, is livid that the BJP government has not kept its promise of the grant of Scheduled Caste (SC) status to the community. While the Nishad-centric political outfits have been vociferously demanding reservation, it is the Sarvadaliya Nishad-Kashayap Union, an amalgamation of non-political and social organizations working for the uplift of the community, which has upped the ante. According to the union, political outfits get embroiled in selfish motives and give up the cause in lieu of seats to contest elections but non-political outfits will remain committed to the cause. The union is backed by political parties like Rashtriya Mahaan Gadtantra Party, Phoolan Sena, Navlok Party, Nishad Army, Rashtriya Eklavya Sena and Bhartiya Manav Sena Party and non-political and social organizations working among Nishads in various districts of the state. “Many political parties are supporting us silently. There are Nishad leaders in other parties who cannot come out in the open to support but they are behind us giving us financial and other support,” founder of the union, Kunwar Singh Nishad, said. Currently, the union is taking out a ‘padyatra’ through the state with the message “aarakshan nahin toh vote nahin”. The march was launched from Mathura on July 11 and cover every district for the next three months. “We have already covered Mathura, Agra, Ferozabad, Etawah and Kanpur Dehat. We have workers in every district. Most of them are social workers engaged with the community. It’s like making people aware of ‘aarakshan nahin toh vote nahin’,” said Kunwar Singh Nishad, former state office-bearer of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, who quit the party on June 28 to cobble up the union. “We are asking them (BJP) to seek support of our community but give us reservation which was a part of BJP’s election manifesto. We have the strength to create major upset,” said the union leader. Nishads represent the community that once thrived on water resources. Their kings ruled along the rivers and people worked as boatmen, washermen, singhara-growers, fishermen and miners. Over a period of time, the community became socially and economically backward. Nishads used to vote for various political parties that catered to specific castes. Being the non-Yadav OBCs, Nishads did not fit into the strategy of these political parties till their own political outfits came into existence. The efforts by the various UP governments to include generic castes of Nishads in SC list are on since 2004 but the orders get challenged in the court. Once included in the SC list, Nishads will get the benefits that only Dalits get in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ahead-of-up-polls-social-outfitsup-ante-on-sc-status-to-nishads/articleshow/84513550.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh signs lease agreement for 1334-hectare land for Jewar airport with NIAL||LUCKNOW: The UP government on Saturday signed a lease agreement with Noida International Airport Ltd for 1,334-hectare land for Jewar airport, which could be the fourth largest airport in the world. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, it was the first time, land acquisition for such a mammoth project was seamless and peaceful, particularly in an area infamous for protests and violence. The CM said, there has been an aviation boom in four years with flights operating to 71 sectors, compared to a mere 25 before his government came to power. “There are eight functional airports in the state now and work is almost complete at Kushinagar International Airport from which global operations could start anytime,” he said. Special secretary, civil aviation, Vishak G and deputy secretary Satyaprakash Tiwari signed the agreement on behalf of the UP government while YEIDA CEO Arun Vir Singh and nodal officer Shailendra Bhatia signed on behalf of NIAL. The lease would be for 90 years, after which NIAL will hand over the land to Yamuna International Airport Pvt Ltd on a 40-year licence. A shareholder agreement was also signed between Zurich Airport International and Yamuna International Pvt Ltd and NIAL. The CM said, the lease agreement and swift pace of work would be a milestone in the state’s development. Praising the local administration and departments involved in the airport development project, the CM said, work was progressing as per timeline despite the pandemic. “In past four years, development in the field of civil aviation has been fast-tracked. Till 2017, there were four functional airports in UP, of which only two, Lucknow and Varanasi, had daily operations. In Gorakhpur and Agra, barely one flight was operational. Today, there are eight functional airports, where 71 sectors are being serviced in comparison to 25 before 2017,” he said. Commending the work of the local administration for ensuring smooth land acquisition, the CM said, when discussions on the airport project kick-started, ‘mediators’ became a hurdle to development when Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Authority were being formed. “We spoke directly to farmers through the district administration. I thank the farmers of Jewar, who along with local administration, helped create a positive environment for land acquisition,” he said. The airport will be developed on PPP mode in four phases. In 2021-22, work will start on the first phase. This will be completed in three years and once ready, it will cater to 12 million passengers a year. By 2040-50, it will be increased to 70 million passengers per year. By then it will also be handing 2.6 million tons of cargo annually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-signs-lease-agreement-for-1334-hectare-land-for-jewar-airport-with-nial/articleshow/84513516.cms||Neha Lalchandani

On Friday, Priyanka had said that Constitution was under attack in UP under the patronage of the ruling government and Congress was here to save democracy. Detouring from the official schedule of her visit to Lucknow, Priyanka left for Lakhimpur Kheri’s Semra village to meet Anita Yadav and Ritu Singh who are affiliated to the Samajwadi Party. After meeting the two women Priyanka said that she would also write a letter to the state election commission in this regard and question as to why such an election was not cancelled. “Can someone get eight - ten goons, beat up people and win elections? Is this our democracy today,” she asked adding, “What was the state election commission doing… Shouldn’t the authorities have cancelled the election after such violence?” Asserting that Congress will fight for the democracy, she said: “Women were given reservation in our democracy so that their rights can be upheld. And the situation has become such wherein a woman went to file her nomination papers, and she was beaten up. This is not democracy. I demand that this election be cancelled, and also at all those places where these types of incidents have occurred, and re-polling be held.” When asked on why she decided to meet the two women, Priyanka said: “I am here to meet them because they are my sisters, and I want to tell (them) that each and every woman of India stands with them. I told them not to feel afraid, and have confidence.” Sharing her experience Anita said: “You must fight, and all of us will fight for you.

In 2017, only four airports were functional in the state but the number doubled to eight in just four years. Kanpur, Bareilly, Prayagraj and Hindon airports have become operational in the last four years. Earlier, the state had only four airports at Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Agra. According to a report under compilation, upgradation and development work at 10 more airports in Agra, Saharanpur, Aligarh, Azamgarh, Moradabad, Shravasti, Chitrakoot, Sonbhadra, Ayodhya and Jewar is on.

---||Lucknow||UP first state in country to administer 4cr Covid shots||Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh on Saturday became the first state in the country to administer 4 crore doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. According to data from the CoWin portal, the landmark was achieved at 7pm on Saturday. This is about 10% of the total 39.94 crore doses administered in the country. Among other states, Maharashtra is the nearest contender with 3.89 crore jabs. Gujarat follows next with 2.93 crore doses. Rajasthan (2.83 crore), West Bengal (2.59 crore) and Madhya Pradesh (2.51 crore) follow next. Overall, 3.39 crore people in UP have taken at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while nearly 65 lakh are fully immunised. Official data showed that 1.37 crore persons in the 18-44 age category have taken the jabs, while 1.72 crore persons have taken at least one dose in the 45-60 age bracket. In the elderly section, 93 lakh people have got the jab. Officials attributed the success to hard work being put in by the health staff and the tool developed by the state government – cluster model – to boost vaccination in rural areas. Data showed that over 67% of the total vaccinations undertaken between July 1 and July 14 were given in the villages. In Lucknow, Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Gorakhpur, Kanpur Nagar, Varanasi, Prayagraj and Agra, more than 10 lakh jabs have been given, while Mahoba, Sant Kabir Nagar, Auraiya, Kaushambi, Lalitpur, Kasganj and Chitrakoot are trailing with less than 2.5 lakh shots each. A clear gender gap in vaccination is visible and needs to be addressed to improve the state’s overall performance, say health officials. While 2.30 crore males have taken the vaccine, only 1.73 crore females have been inoculated. Meanwhile, daily cases continued to decline in the state, while the number of active cases chugged along the 1,300 mark. As per the official bulletin, only 81 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours. It also showed that as many as 40 districts reported no case of Covid-19 infection in the past 24 hours, whereas 34 districts reported new cases in just single digits. Lucknow was the only exception with 12 cases. In terms of active cases, the tally now stands at 1,310 of which 1,114 are under home isolation. Officials also said that the daily test positivity rate for UP was 0.03% which is one of the lowest in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-first-state-in-country-to-administer-4cr-covid-shots/articleshow/84513569.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The circular to Goa University and colleges also states that those who are not vaccinated will be required to produce RT-PCR negative report on a weekly basis starting from August 2 and no leave requests will be entertained to get the test done. “The state government is planning to start classes in physical mode once the present pandemic situation gets normal. As per the inputs collected from the colleges and Goa University a week ago on Covid vaccination, it is known that about 11% teachers and staff have not yet taken even the first dose of vaccination,” Lolayekar’s circular states. He said that the directorate expects to achieve 100% vaccination of all teaching and non-teaching staff before classes start in the physical mode to ensure the safety of all concerned, especially students. “Those staff who are not able to get vaccinated due to medical reasons shall produce the certificate to this effect from the medical board constituted by the Goa Medical College,” Lolayekar said.

A few months ago, car of the deputy speaker of Haryana was attacked by farmers after which an FIR was registered against the accused farmers. There was a demand to release the farmers in this matter. To this, Vij said, “The law of this country is supreme and it doesn't work on anyone's behest or is not influenced by staging dharna or by threats. The law functions at its own pace and in its own ways and such activities have no effect on the legal procedures.” Besides this, a warning has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), regarding third wave of coronavirus that the next 100 days were crucial. In such a situation, the decision of lifting the restrictions has been taken by the government, which is likely to be revised. Vij said, “We have given orders to all the district magistrates to constitute a committee of civil and police officers and keep an eye on the crowd and ensure that standard operating procedures (SOPs) are strictly adhered to.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/law-supreme-doesnt-work-on-advises-vij/articleshow/84512207.cms||---
---||Meerut||Kanwar samitis ease UP's dilemma, request yatra cancellation||MEERUT: UP has been in a spot over the kanwar yatra. It declared it would allow the pilgrimage even as neighbouring Uttarakhand, where pilgrims head towards to collect Ganga water from Haridwar, banned it citing risk from the pandemic. Then, the Supreme Court issued notice to UP dissuading it from even a “symbolic” yatra. Bailing the state out of its quandary, kanwar samitis have now come forward asking district administrations to cancel the yatra this year. “Several kanwar samitis (organisations) have forwarded applications to call off the yatra. There are two reasons — fear of infection and the significance of Haridwar. If devotees can’t go to Haridwar, there can’t be an alternative,” IG (Meerut range) Praveen Tripathi said. Kanwar samitis are influential volunteer bodies that help organise the pilgrimage, setting up camps with food, water and beds along the long routes crores of pilgrims cover over a fortnight to collect Ganga water and offer it to Shiva lingas in temples. The march spans across states — UP, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Bihar, among others. In UP, pilgrims pass through Bijnor, Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Baghpat and Ghaziabad. Last year, too, the kanwar yatra had been cancelled in UP. This year, however, the poll-bound state has been insisting that it will not call off the yatra. “We have filed an application with the district administration to cancel the three-day fair for the festival. It is not possible to observe Covid-19 protocol. We would be inviting trouble if we went ahead with it,” said Swami Jai Bhagwan Pandit, chief priest of the Pura Mahadev temple in Baghpat, where nearly 25 lakh offer Ganga water. The government had earlier said it would ensure Covid-19 safety protocols are followed when the pilgrimage begins. But in Saharanpur, Dinesh Sethi of the Shiv Kanwar Seva Sangh, said that seemed unlikely. “Observing Covid safety norms is next to impossible. All our samitis have decided, unanimously, against setting up kanwar camps. We appeal to kanwariyas from Punjab and Haryana to not set off on their journey this time. It can be counterproductive.” When it comes to the matter of faith, the samitis said, calling off the march would be a greater service than embarking on it. “We are involved in the seva (service) of kanwariyas who pass through our district,” said Rajeev Sharma, manager of Mitra Mandal Kanwar Seva Samiti in Meerut. “It is an occasion of immense religious significance. At the same time, the well-being of devotees is also our responsibility. As the pandemic rages, not holding the kanwar yatra this year is also seva.” The Supreme Court had on Friday said UP “100% cannot go ahead” with the plan to allow the kanwar yatra, adding that it was giving the state “one more opportunity” to reconsider. The UP government has to respond to the Supreme Court on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/kanwar-samitis-ease-ups-dilemma-request-yatra-cancellation/articleshow/84508345.cms||Sandeep Rai

Sources told TOI there is a ‘high probability,’ of the killer being a resident of a nearby village.“As of now, these are mere conjectures. But based on the circumstances of the crime and other clues, we suspect that the accused was someone who the victim knew before,” an official said. Around 50 policemen including members of the district special team (DST) and cyber-cell are tracking the accused. Sources suspect that the accused had quickly gone to a neighboring state to evade arrest.“We had questioned a lot of people, following which we singled out a few suspects,” the official added. Seema was in Jaipur with her brother Aman Meena. On Thursday noon, one of the other tenants of the building found blood coming out of her room and spilling into the gallery. The tenant alerted the landlord about the tragic incident and informed Pratap Nagar police station.Seema’s room number 201 was located on the first floor of the house, right in front of the stairs. On the left side of her room is a hall with several other rooms where other tenants live. “Construction for a tubewell was underway at the house when the incident took place.

---||Jaipur||Experts flay staff for taking out gharial eggs from nests||Jaipur: Conservationists and experts have criticised the forest department’s interference at gharial egg laying sites in the National Chambal Sanctuary (NCS). In Rajasthan, efforts are made this year to protect the nesting sites. However, a recent video in which forest staff taking out eggs from the nests has drawn flak from experts who are associated with wildlife.Rajesh Bedi, who made award winning film ‘The Ganges Gharial (1984)’, said, “The state government should direct staff to stop interfering with nature. Mother should be allowed to visit and guard eggs during the night. Interference in hatching process is unnatural.”Rajiv Chauhan, secretary, Society for Conservation of Nature, an NGO working for the conservation of the gharials, said an incubation period of Gharial is of 60 to 80 days. During incubation, females stay near the nest. The human interference may lead to mother abandoning the area. Even, after staff assist the process, the survival of hatchlings becomes difficult in absence of mother’s protection.”The forest department officials, however, refuted the claims and explained that proper steps were taken to save the hatchlings. Assistant conservation of forest (ACF) Anil Yadav said, “We were constantly monitoring the nest. The mother did not return even after a constant call from eggs. The calls also invite predators, so it was a necessary action. We saved around 40 hatchlings and it was only last minute intervention.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/experts-flay-staff-for-taking-out-gharial-eggs-from-nests/articleshow/84513673.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Another gold carrier intercepted at Jaipur airport||JAIPUR: The customs department seized around 350 gram of gold worth Rs 17 lakh at the Jaipur International Airport on Friday. This is the third seizure in 10 days. The gold was intercepted from a passenger who landed from Dubai and officials claimed that in 90% of cases, these ‘carriers or mules’ have no idea as to exactly what they are smuggling and carry the precious metal for just few thousand rupees. Officials also said that in majority of the cases, the carriers turn out to be persons who are in blue collared jobs abroad and mostly are natives of Nagaur or Shekhawati belt. In the recent seizure on Friday evening, customs officers at Jaipur International Airport intercepted one passenger, who arrived from Dubai and after thorough examination of his baggage, 349.810 gram gold valued at Rs 17,40,305 was seized. The said gold was concealed in one coffee and spice grinder machine and three magnetic bracelets. “In 90% of the cases, while the carriers might have some inkling, they are not sure as to exactly what the package contains. They are persons who are sent abroad for jobs and after working for few months, they are unemployed so for a return ticket home and money, they get the package. In fact, they do not even know the identity of the person who is supposed to take the package from them after they get out of the airport though the receiver knows the carrier’s identity,” said a customs official. The passenger carrying the gold does not have any information of the smuggling ring. The smugglers also ensure that the gold carried is of the permissible value which is below Rs 20 lakh so that there is no risk of arrest. Elaborating further, the official said, “When the carrier is delayed getting out of the airport after we have intercepted the gold, the receiver realises that something is amiss and does not wait around. Also the receiver gets the information of a possible interception either through a co-passenger or other means.” Just five days back, 1,400 gram of gold was intercepted from a passenger who landed from Dubai and prior to this, around 400 gram of gold was seized from a passenger who landed from Sharjah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/another-gold-carrier-intercepted-at-airport/articleshow/84513664.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa to seek permit from Karnataka to transport animals for Eid||PANAJI: The state directorate of animal husbandry and veterinary services will write to its counterpart department in Karnataka asking it to permit the transport of animals to Goa for qurbani, the ritual sacrifice of livestock for Bakri Eid. With the festival scheduled on July 21, the dates decided for the slaughter at the Usgao-based Goa meat complex are July 20-22. “We have kept the entire machinery ready and are ready to carry out the slaughter at Goa meat complex. All that is left is to bring the raw material — the live animals,” an AHVS Goa official said. At a recent meeting attended by CM Pramod Sawant, Goa AHVS officials, the all-Goa Muslim Jamaat and meat traders, the latter lamented that they are not being allowed to transport animals from Karnataka due to the ordinance passed in the neighbouring state. “The Goa AHVS has therefore been directed by the chief minister to write to the director of animal husbandry in Karnataka to permit the transport of animals for qurbani to Goa,” the AHVS official said. After the abattoir was shut four years ago for renovations, it has been opened only on a few occasions for qurbani. Fresh beef is being sourced from Karnataka to be sold in Goa to meet the state’s demand for the red meat. However, the traders now intend to keep the abattoir running for regular operations. “After qurbani, we intend to start the slaughter of animals at the Goa meat complex. We will therefore require a regular supply of animals from Karnataka to Goa,” president of the Quraishi meat traders association, Manna Bepari, said. There is a high court directive that the Goa meat complex should make the abattoir available to local meat traders for animal slaughter. As per the court’s 2016 directions, AHVS has completed the formalities, obtained licences and made sure that all the machines are working. Once the traders are permitted to transport the animals, they will have to mandatorily abide by the regulation for transport of animals as per the amended Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. As per the amendment, the animals must be transported in a special carrier that has partitions and provides 2 sq m space per animal inside the truck.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-to-seek-permit-from-ktaka-to-transport-animals-for-eid/articleshow/84512218.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Kanwar associations in Uttar Pradesh call off annual yatra this year||LUCKNOW: The standoff over kanwar yatra in Uttar Pradesh was resolved when kanwar associations on Saturday decided to call it off in view of the coronavirus pandemic and experts predicting a third wave in coming months. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said that after an appeal by the UP government, the kanwar associations decided to postpone the yatra this year. On Friday, a Supreme Court bench led by Justice RF Nariman had directed the UP government to reconsider its decision to allow the annual religious yatra, scheduled to start from July 25. After this, Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had instructed additional chief secretary Awanish Awasthi and DGP Mukul Goel to talk to kanwar associations to reach a final decision before the government filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court on Monday. The government sources said that the kanwar association took the decision to call off the yatra after talks with UP government representatives. The yatra undertaken annually by devotees of Lord Shiva to bring water from sacred rivers, mainly the Ganga in Haridwar, to offer it to the deity in the month of Shravan, was cancelled last year by both UP and Uttarakhan in view of the pandemic. This year, too, Uttarakhand cancelled it after it drew flak over the organisation of Kumbh early this year. However, UP wanted to hold it with Covid protocol. The Supreme Court then took suo motu cognizance of the issue and served notice on the UP government. On Friday, the SC had asked the UP government not to allow even a symbolic yatra in light of the pandemic. It went on to say that if the government did not call it off, the court would be forced to pass an order. To this, the government had said that “if” the yatra took place, it would happen in accordance with Covid-19 protocols and “with the consent of kanwar associations”. Uttarakhand was earlier forced to suspend the Char Dham Yatra after the Uttarakhand high court had pulled it up for allowing the Kumbh Mela in the middle of the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kanwar-associations-in-up-call-off-annual-yatra-this-year/articleshow/84513576.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Mumbai||Mumbai minister Aslam Shaikh alleges ‘match fixing’ in Rs 320 crore oxygen unit contracts||MUMBAI: Mumbai city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh has alleged “match fixing” in the BMC oxygen generation plant contracts worth around Rs 320 crore. In a letter to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, the Congress minister alleged that there was a cartel of contractors who were hand in glove with BMC officials. Shaikh had last month demanded a vigilance department inquiry into the controversial BMC project to install oxygen generation plants in the city after the Rs 84 crore project was awarded to the Highway Construction Company, which was allegedly penalised in the penguin enclosure project at Byculla zoo, and an oxygen plant manufacturer that was allegedly blacklisted for shoddy work by Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Medical College in November. Shaikh said that till the previous contract of installing 16 plants at civic hospitals is not complete, no new contract must be given to the same company. “Now new tenders were floated once again for installing oxygen generator plants in Mumbai … [O]nly 2 bids were received of which one bid is that of Highway Construction Company who also happens to be the same company that was awarded the earlier tender even though it was a single bid and was above the cost estimate despite several complaints and objections….. I am given to understand that the company is already hand in glove with certain department engineers and will be issued a notice of delay and thereby pay a per day fine, which it has already calculated while bidding the tender and hence has bid above the cost estimate will be levied,” his letter said. TimesViewThe BMC has received appreciation for oxygen management, including from the Supreme Court. It should remove all doubts about transparency and see to it that tainted firms do not get contracts. It must also ensure that the project is completed swiftly and take stern action in case of delays or irregularities.The standing committee had on June 8 approved the proposal to award the work for 16 oxygen plants at 12 locations to Highway Construction Company. While tenders were invited for the project in April and the plants were supposed to be constructed in 30 days, the project was stuck after the BJP’s Vinod Mishra raised objections over tainted companies. “In spite of highly qualified companies that are ... in the business of manufacturing oxygen plants and have supplied to the state government ... , they are not considering bidding these tenders whereby they are being given 3 times the price from their usual price because of ‘Match Fixing’. I strongly suggest you consider investigating this as this seems to be a cartel created by two companies,” Shaikh said. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), said: “It was an electronic tender and was open to all. Only two bidders participated in spite of extending time also. Highway Construction Company has to perform and install as per tender conditions, failing which action will be taken. Due procedural sanctity and fairness will be followed while selecting the final awardees.” Romin Chedha of Highway Construction did not respond to queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-neta-alleges-match-fixing-in-rs-320cr-o2-unit-contracts/articleshow/84512257.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Allahabad||HC turns down bail plea of Amar Dubey’s wife in Bikru ambush case||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Friday rejected the bail plea of the wife of Amar Dubey who is one of the accused in the Bikru ambush in which eight policemen including a deputy superintendent of police (DySP) and three sub-inspectors (SIs) had been killed by slain gangster Vikas Dubey and his accomplices. The ambush took place on July 3, 2020 when police went to arrest Vikas Dubey from his house in Bikru village of Kanpur Nagar. Vikas Dubey and his associates opened indiscriminate fire on the police force, which led to eight police personnel being shot dead and six others getting grievous gunshot injuries. Dismissing the revision petition filed by wife of Amar Dubey, Justice JJ Munir observed, “An overall look on the circumstances of the case brings to mind the fact that the occurrence, in which the revisionist was involved, was not of an ordinary kind. Not only the spontaneous elimination of eight policemen in action and six others left injured, is a horrendous crime that shocks the conscience of the society, but also an act that strikes at the roots of the state’s authority in its territory.” “It speaks about the unfathomable extent of the lack of fear of the state in the minds of those who conceived and executed the dastardly act,” said the court. The court dismissed the revision petition filed by the wife of Amar Dubey, an aide and relative of Vikas Dubey, challenging rejection of her bail plea by lower court, seeking her release on bail on the ground that she was declared juvenile by the concerned Juvenile Board on September 1, 2020. According to petitioner’s counsel, she was about 16 years and 10 months old on the date of the incident and a few days before the incident, she was married to the relative of Vikas Dubey. According to the petitioner, she was not a member of the gang of Vikas Dubey, rather her husband was a relative of Vikas and on the date of incident, they went to Vikas’s house. She had no role in the incident. The state government opposed the bail plea on the ground that as per statements of the survivor policeman of that ghastly episode, the juvenile was an active participant throughout the assault. She was aiding and instigating the men not to spare any policeman. The state government counsel further argued, “Considering that she is above 16 years of age, and the offence involved is heinous in nature, the Board have opined, on a preliminary assessment, that the revisionist has the requisite mental and physical capacity to commit the offence, as also the ability to understand the consequences. The Board have also considered the circumstances in which she committed the dereliction and doing all this, opined that it is fit case where the petitioner deserves to be tried as an adult.” The court while rejecting the bail plea observed, “Prima facie, if not at the centre stage of this diabolical act, certainly as an important player, the revisionists seem to have actively participated. In the circumstances, permitting the revisionist to walk out free on bail would shake the law-abiding citizens’ faith in the rule of law and the state’s authority. If that were to be done, it would certainly defeat the ends of justice.” However, the court clarified that the remarks made by it are confined to judging the revisionist’s bail plea and should, in no way, be understood or construed as comments on the merits of the case, that is to be judged at the trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-turns-down-bail-plea-of-amar-dubeys-wife-in-bikru-ambush-case/articleshow/84509435.cms||---

Mhambre said he told the police that he and his party volunteers are all law abiding citizens. In his statement to the police, Mhambre alleged that two women party workers were assaulted and abused when they were peacefully protesting because of which he and the party held a protest. The party has already filed a counter complaint, he added. AAP functionaries had gone to the turncoat MLA with a cake to mock two years of his defection to BJP, when there was a clash between D’Sa’s supporters and the party workers. AAP condemned the misuse of the government machinery to suppress the voice of the Goans. AAP won't be stifled like Congress and other parties, Mhambre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-members-abide-by-law-says-mhambre/articleshow/84512287.cms||---

A case was lodged under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in Dehradun’s Patel Nagar police station in the matter after the woman approached the cyber police with the complaint. The cops investigating the fraud have said that they are following leads in the case while adding that further investigation will reveal more facts. Meanwhile, Meena Kamboj, the complainant, said, “I didn’t share OTP or any sensitive information related to my bank account with anyone but still the money was taken from my account. I have come to know that another bank account with the same account number already exists in Chennai. The other bank account even has the same registered email ID.

NGT sought a compliance report from the civic chief on each of the directions it had passed last October on curbing coastal pollution. “The municipal commissioner may explain why coercive measures under Section 25 of the NGT Act, 2010, read with Section 51 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), may not be taken to ensure compliance of the order,” said the NGT principal bench in New Delhi. Last year, the order had directed payment of Rs 35 crore and more towards environment compensation and for its failure to take corrective short- and long-term measures to stop untreated sewage and floating plastic debris enter the creek and the sea. The order by a bench of Justices A K Goel, chairperson, and Justices Sudhir Agarwal and M Sathyanarayanan, judicial members, and Dr Nagin Nanda, expert member, said its copy must be sent to the municipal commissioner by email for compliance.  It had directed BMC to abide or deposit compensation at the rate of Rs 5 lakh per month per drain with Central Pollution Control Board. The NGO’s advocate Zaman Ali submitted a truck discharging cement into the creek was apprehended and the NGO had made a representation in May but compensation was not deposited. “Further violation was found on 03.06.2021 when a truck was disposing of slurry into a creek at Wadala,” said the order. — Swati Deshpande||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-green-tribunal-seeks-bmc-chiefs-presence-compliance-with-its-coastal-pollution-order/articleshow/84510180.cms||Swati Deshpande

The tower was hit by lightning four times in the last eight days, which led to the collapse of a stone slab. The fort has two towers, Kirti Stambh and Vijay Stambh, which have lightning conductors but their earthing system has not been working for the past few years. The ASI has decided to install lightning conductors at all hill forts — Chittorgarh, Kumbhalgarh, Ranthambore, Amber, Jaisalmer and Gagron. The decision was taken during an inspection of the Chittorgarh fort by ASI officials, MP Chittorgarh CP Joshi and engineers of Hindustan Zinc on Saturday. “The slab weighing around 50 kilograms fell on the ground from the sixth floor. It is due to the impact of the repeated lightning on the structure. The immediate assessment followed by the repair work of the structure has been ordered and until the officials have been asked to take necessary steps to protect life,” said BC Negi, superintendent, ASI Circle Jodhpur. The team learnt that copper wires used in earthing went missing in 2014. A police complaint has also been filed for the same but wires were never retrieved. Experts say had the wires were in place, the damage could have been averted. Negi has also asked officials to access the tower at Vijay Stambh which is much higher than the Kirti Stambh. “Strict protocol will be followed for placing the earthing wire in the pit which will be filled with chemicals. No new pit will be drilled since the construction in the zone is highly monitored,” said an expert, who was with the team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/all-raj-forts-monuments-to-have-lightning-arresters/articleshow/84513680.cms||---

The announcement came during a panchayat organised by BKU (Maan) at Bagwali village, which falls on the district border of Panchkula and Ambala. Farm activists had assembled under the aegis of BKU (Maan) unit headed by Guni Parkash Rani. Farmers at the protest accused Charuni of leading the protest to fulfil his political aspirations. “Genuine farmers don’t get time to go out of their fields or from other works related to home or the fields. But, here he is the one who is just moving around. Now we shall not give any contribution to him and he will not be allowed even,’’ said Ram Parkash, a resident of Bagwali village. BKU (Maan) president Narpat Rana said SKM leaders had been calling agriculture laws as black laws. “But nobody has told farmers what is wrong. They have not even explained this to government during talks. Now, with Charuni’s statement, the entire motive behind the agitation stands exposed. They all have political aspirations and have got nothig to do with the farmers interests and welfare,” said Rana. BKU (Maan) has already announced to oppose SKM and BKU (Charuni). The Maan Group has also started a campaign to garner support for a state-level rally of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in Kurukshetra or Karnal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-group-which-backs-laws-says-charuni-barred-from-pkl-ambala-villages/articleshow/84512274.cms||---

Yet, the police catch only the commuters for not wearing masks. The city for the past several days has witnessed numerous political protests by different parties and outfits where leaders and their supporters gather in large numbers with police standing as mute spectators. On Friday itself, a cycle yatra was taken out from Albert Hall to Gandhi Circle. Before that, a similar protest was organised by another political party near Civil Lines crossing on Wednesday. However, despite all these events where large gatherings take place, they continue to elude the police’s attention. Talking to TOI, the additional commissioner of police (law and order), Rahul Prakash said that appropriate actions have been taken wherever the police learn about violations. “We have filed an FIR recently when norms were violated at an event. We take all necessary actions as per the law,” he said. The Jaipur police claimed that a total of 53,270 people have been challaned for violation of face masks, 2,912 shopkeepers who did not have masks were also penalised. As per the figures, 430106 were booked for different violations of Covid appropriate behaviour. The government on its July 10 order had clearly instructed authorities to ensure that no large gatherings take place at public places, at the same time, the order stipulated a complete ban on procession and rallies including political and religious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-norms-political-rallies-exempted-only-commuters-penalised/articleshow/84513683.cms||---

---||Jaipur||From con to porn: Gangs of Mewat reinvent selves for online ‘sextortion’||ALWAR/JAIPUR: In the late 90s, they mastered the criminal craft of ‘tatlu bazzi,’ an art of duping people by selling fake gold bricks presented as antiqued treasure discovered in excavations. Two decades later, the gangs of Mewat are back and this time they have struck gold using ‘sextortion’. An approximately 150km area of Alwar and Bharatpur districts is now fast emerging as the new Jamtara of Mewat, where every day gangs extort crores of rupees from wealthy middle aged-men, with porn clips to honeytrap them. According to Alwar and Bharatpur police, the modus operandi across all criminal cases remains the same. The gang poses as beautiful women on social media websites to befriend potential targets. Flirting soon follows. Using online Hindi-to-English translation tools, the chatting continues till numbers are shared on WhatsApp. The accused pretending as a woman would play a porn clip and insist the victim indulge in similar sexual activities on the video call. After recording the video chat of the sexual activity, the video is sent to the victim to demand exuberant money. If the victim refuses to give money, the accused threatens to share the video chat with the victim’s friends on social media, or worse, upload it on porn websites. According to Alwar SP Tejswani Gautam, many victims shy away from filing cases and quietly pay the money. “We have always implored people to file FIRs so that we can track the accused and arrest them,” she said. Alwar police had recently made a special task force called Cyclone to hunt for the gangs. In the past three months alone, the district police have busted over 36 gangs and arrested over 600 accused of running extortion rackets. “We also regularly coordinate with police units from other states. In fact, we have also begun tracking these accused through their mobile phones and also by decoy operations,” Gautam said. Bharatpur SP Devendra Kumar Bishnoi said most of the cases are registered at police stations outside the state because the gang prey on people based at faraway locations. A top official of Rajasthan police said a special cyber police station would soon be set up in Bharatpur district to keep a close watch on cybercriminals, especially ‘sextortion’ cases. The area under which the gang operates is located deep in the Mewat region that spreads across Haryana. But the main areas include Bhiwadi, Tijara, Kishangarh Bas, Ramgarh, Laxmangarh in Alwar and Nagar, Pahadi and Govingarh in Bharatpur. The gang also employed members from nearby Nuh and the Punhana area of neighbouring Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/from-con-to-porn-gangs-of-mewat-reinvent-themselves/articleshow/84513688.cms||Rajendra sharma

The agitators said that those involved in the tourism business are suffering heavy losses due to the suspension of Char Dham Yatra. "The state government should either start the Char Dham Yatra or announce a relief package for us. Several people in the tourism business are struggling for survival," said Shailendra Matuda, president of Uttarkashi Hotel Association. In a similar vein, Ravindra Singh Negi, the secretary of the hotel association, said, "Tourism activities have been allowed in Nainital, Mussoorie and Haridwar but the yatra has been suspended in the name of the pandemic. At least the government should announce a relief package and waive off water, electricity and all other kinds of taxes." He added that if their demands are not, they will intensify the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hoteliers-tour-operators-priests-stage-protest-demanding-to-start-char-dham-yatra/articleshow/84508440.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala
---||Dehradun||Communal tensions flare up after man gets death threat on Facebook in Haridwar village, PAC deployed||HARIDWAR: Personnel of PAC and civil police were deployed at Haridwar's Jat Bahadarpur village after a communal flare up between two communities. It started in mid-June, when a Muslim man from the village posted the photo of a Jat resident on Facebook, threatening to kill him as “the duty was assigned to him by God”. The victim, a Bajrang Dal worker, lodged a complaint at Pathri police station. As the accused was in Saudi Arabia, police said action would be taken when he returned. The accused man returned on July 3. On July 12, he participated in a bicycle rally organized by the Bhim Army. The complainant alleged that members of the rally raised provocative slogans targeting his religion and attempted to break down his front door. When called to the police station, he refused to go. Meanwhile, a 38-year-old Dalit woman from the village eloped with an 18-year-old Muslim boy, aggravating the communal tensions in the village. By mid-July, pamphlets appeared in front of Hindu homes, asking them to leave within five days or “face grim consequences”. On July 15, the man who posted on Facebook was booked and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) along with civil police personnel were deployed in the village. Bajrang Dal state convener Anuj Walia demanded strict action against the miscreants and said that safety of the Hindu families must be ensured. Village pradhan Vikas Kumar said the elopement had aggravated a situation which was created due to “otherwise minor incidents”. “A case has been registered against the accused under section 295 A (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC,” said Pathri station in-charge Deepak Kathait.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/communal-tensions-flare-up-after-man-gets-death-threat-on-facebook-in-haridwar-village-pac-deployed/articleshow/84508454.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ACB arrests IRS officer Shashank Yadav with unaccounted Rs 16 lakh||JAIPUR/KOTA: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Saturday arrested an Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer with unaccounted Rs 16 lakh in his SUV on Kota Hanging Bridge near toll plaza on Kota-Udaipur highway. The vehicle had logo of Uttar Pradesh police. Following his arrest, the ACB started raids and a team will visit his home in Uttar Pradesh. He has been arrested in alleged disproportionate income case and ACB is primarily considering the unaccounted income as bribe money taken from opium cultivators for allowing cultivation. The officer, identified as Shashank Yadav, is posted as general manager of an opium factory at Ghazipur in UP and is holding an additional charge at an opium factory in Nimach, Madhya Pradesh. According to ASP (ACB, Kota) Chandrasheel Thakur, the agency received a tip off that officials of Nimach opium factory were allegedly collecting Rs 60,000–80,000 from the opium cultivation licence holder farmers in Chittorgarh, Kota, Jhalawar, Pratapgarh areas of Rajasthan for sanctioning their opium produce samples with standard liquid quality and percentage of morphine so that the cultivators could be allotted 10-12 aari patta (lease) for opium cultivation. Farmers have to deposit their opium produce in Nimach opium factory. “He was on our radar for quite some time. We have booked him for disproportionate assets case and for bribery,” said BL Soni, Director General, ACB told TOI. Primary investigation suggested that the accused was taking the bribe that the bribe amount was being collected through middlemen Ajit Singh of opium laboratory and Deepak Yadav of coding team in Nimach opium factory and the IRS officer was in Rajasthan these days and was going to Ghazipur in UP through Kota–Udaipur highway after collecting the bribe amount, he said. When inquired about the source of amount in the SUV, the IRS officer could not respond satisfactorily following which he was initially detained and his interrogation is underway at Kota. Thakur said, Ajit Singh and Deepak Yadav have collected in advance around Rs 30-36 crore from around 6,000 opium farmers for allotting them lease for opium cultivation.

---||Amritsar||‘Punjab witnessed 331% increase in lightning strikes’||BATHINDA: The number and frequency of lightning strikes is increasing globally with bolts from the blue killing more people every subsequent year, data shows. Between April 2020 and March 2021, 18.5 million lightning strikes were recorded in India, a 34% rise over 13.8 million strikes between April 2019 and March 2020. These statistics were shared at a webinar on lightning, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Down To Earth magazine. Some of the states at the receiving end of these strikes are Punjab, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Puducherry, Himachal Pradesh and West Bengal. It was claimed that in Punjab, the increase in number of lightning strikes has been a staggering 331% annually, while in Bihar — where 401 people lost their lives to lightning strikes during the year — there was a 168% rise. Overall, 1,697 people were struck down dead by lightning in India between March 2020 and April 2021. “There is growing scientific evidence that climate change may be sparking more lightning across the world. Rapid urbanisation and population growth have guaranteed an intensification of human exposure to lightning hazard,” says Down To Earth managing editor Richard Mahapatra. A 2015 California University study has projected that an increase in average global temperatures by 1ºC would increase the frequency of lightning by 12%. Another paper, soon to be published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, warns that the frequency and intensity of lightning strikes in India are expected to increase by 15-50% respectively by the end of the century. A foreboding dimension of the surge in lightning strike numbers is their link to forest fires. “Scientists from the Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Srinagar, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, have studied the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in different weather conditions in the central Himalayan region. They have found a five-time higher concentration of CCN in the atmosphere during forest fires as against during rains. In May 2021, researchers in Australia linked excess CCN to the increased number of lightning strikes during the 2019-20 Australia forest fires,” says Kiran Pandey, programme director of CSE’s environmental resources unit. Some progress has been made to counter the adverse effects of lightning strikes. The rise in fatalities has prompted the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to start lightning forecasts from April 1, 2019. Lightning India Resilient Campaign (LRIC), a joint initiative of several bodies such as Climate Resilient Observing-Systems Promotion Council (CROPC), National Disaster Management Authority, IMD, Union Ministry of Earth Sciences and others aims to reduce the number of deaths due to lightning strikes to less than 1,200 a year by 2022. “The LRIC says its campaign has been successful in bringing down deaths by more than 60% within two years. Dedicated efforts by governments of states like Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have led to a 70% reduction in fatalities,” webinar was told. “The lightning incidents recorded reveal that seasonality of lightning is different for different states. Therefore, it is important that the lightning risk management programme for each state is customised according to the seasonality, intensity and frequency of lightning. States should undertake lightning micro-zonation for the regions inside their boundaries, depending on their geography, to handle the disaster and death risks better. These are LRIC’s recommendations,” says Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-witnessed-331-increase-in-lightning-strikes/articleshow/84512347.cms||---
---||Nashik||ED could arrest some netas in Maharashtra soon, says Chandrakant Patil||NASHIK: State BJP president Chandrakant Patil on Saturday said “some leaders in Maharashtra" could be arrested by the Enforcement Directorate soon. Speaking to reporters in Nashik, Patil said the ED was investigating alleged financial irregularities by some politicians in the state. “The ED is carrying out a probe into various financial irregularities involving some political leaders in the state. My assumption is that there is a likelihood that few of them could be arrested by the ED soon,” Patil said. Refusing to name the leaders who he thinks are on the radar of the ED, Patil said, “Those who have done something wrong could be arrested by the ED.” Earlier this month, Patil had written a letter to union home minister Amit Shah accusing deputy CM Ajit Pawar and transport minister Anil Parab of indulging in extortion, besides submitting a list of co-operative sugar factories and spinning mills to Shah seeking a probe for alleged irregularities. The ED had ordered attachment of the Jarandeshwar cooperative sugar factory at Satara. While Ajit Pawar had slammed Patil for his demand for a CBI inquiry against him based on now-dismissed Mumbai cop Sachin Waze’s corruption allegations, NCP leader Jayant Patil had questioned how Central investigation agencies were acting on politically-motivated allegations by the state BJP chief. Asserting that ED was an autonomous body and was doing its duty and that he had no clue on who will be arrested, Patil said, “Those who have not done anything wrong need not fear as ED will have no grounds to act against them.” On Shiv Sena and BJP coming together in near future, Patil said his party was never against the Shiv Sena. “We have no grudge against Shiv Sena. The only point that hurt us is we contested elections together and just for the sake of leading the government it took the support of the parties ideologically opposite to Sena,” Patil said. He said BJP in the state would continue to stage agitations against the ruling coalition on issues impacting the people. “These agitations could be against any minister or even the CM,” he remarked. He said there is unlikely to be any change in state government as MVA partners are aware they will have no future if they fall apart. “They are currently ‘forced’ to stay together as falling apart could create more problems for them now. They will stick together and try to patch every difference for some time more,” Patil added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/maharashtra-ed-could-arrest-some-netas-in-maha-soon-says-patil/articleshow/84512358.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kochi||Kerala: Commission soon to review university laws, says Higher education minister R Bindu||THRISSUR: The higher education department will set up a university law reform commission to study and report the changes required in the statutes and rules governing the university education system in the state, said higher education minister R Bindu. “Presently, the university education system in the state is being governed by statutes and rules framed about 60 years ago. Many of them have become outdated and have been found to be inadequate to address the challenges being thrown up by the drastic changes like digital education systems taking place in the field. The commission, to be announced soon, will be tasked to frame legal and regulatory frameworks, factoring in the transformations that have taken place in the educational ecosystem,” Bindu said. The minister said another commission will be appointed to suggest reforms to be implemented in the examination systems in universities so that the students will undergo a more effective and authentic evaluation process. She said that 30 centres of excellence would be set up across the state to conduct in-depth and focussed research. These centres will have inter-university links and will be undertaking interdisciplinary research. Efforts will be made to woo the best talents available in the country to these centres. They will also strive to inculcate research aptitude among the students at the degree and postgraduate levels, she said. A centralised learning management system (LMS) server will be installed under the Kerala state higher education council (KSHEC) which will be accessible to teachers of different universities. With the help of LMS, the teachers can implement technology-assisted pedagogy to provide a more immersive and precise learning experience to the learners by seamlessly integrating multimedia contents and other educational objects, the minister said. Bindu said that steps are being taken to ensure that all higher education institutions in the state achieve A+ level accreditation from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). The department will institute 500 post-doctoral fellowships, titled ‘Nava Kerala Scholarships’ for promoting research related to Kerala’s history and economic development. There will be measures to reform higher education curriculum in the state and the concept of ‘earn while you learn’ will be promoted on a wide scale. She said that 10% seats will be increased in all the colleges in the state. All the educational institutions must constitute internal complaints committees and gender-justice forums. ‘Need expert opinion on guv’s anti-dowry proposal’ Bindu said the government will seek expert advice on the suggestions by the governor to end the vexed dowry system. Governor Arif Mohammad Khan had suggested that students seeking admission in higher education centres and their parents should be asked to sign an undertaking that they will not give or accept dowry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/commission-soon-to-review-varsity-laws-minister-bindu/articleshow/84510289.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Char Dham priests announce protests from July 23||DEHRADUN: A meeting of the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board was chaired on Friday by CM Pushkar Dhami but no decision was taken regarding the scrapping of the board, which is a long-standing demand of Char Dham priests. Feeling let down, the priests, who feel the Devasthanam Board takes away their traditional right to oversee the administration of the shrines, have now decided to intensify their protests. Brijesh Sati, the spokesperson of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said that the priests are scaling up their agitation and will organise a public agitation rally at Uttarkashi from July 23 if the board is not dissolved. He pointed out that the priests have met CM on several occasions since the time the Bill was tabled in the state assembly. The Bill was passed in the Uttarakhand assembly in December 2019. Since then, a string of protests has been witnessed. However, the government has remained rigid on its stand. In his brief tenure as the CM, Tirath Singh Rawat had announced to take a call on denotifying 51 temples — besides the Char Dham shrines — from the Devasthanam board. However, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj, a few weeks ago, maintained that there was no process underway to review the board. The remark led to large-scale protests, especially in the Uttarkashi district. Meanwhile, in a board meeting on Friday, CM Dhami said, “The state government's job is not to control the internal arrangements of the temple but to cooperate. We aim to become a partner in the development of the facilities of the temple complexes,” said the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-devasthanam-board-still-not-scrapped-char-dham-priests-announce-massive-protests-from-july-23/articleshow/84508476.cms||Kautilya Singh

Now, as the state government is anticipating a third wave in the coming months, it has directed private hospitals to set up their own oxygen plants on their premises to cater to the need of Covid patients. The order is applicable for private hospitals with 60 or more beds. It further added that private hospitals should connect 50% of their beds with centralised oxygen supply. The health department has also made it compulsory for private hospitals with less than 60 beds to install oxygen concentrators on 30% of its beds. Most of the private hospitals do not have their own oxygen plants and arrange oxygen for medical use from private suppliers. “We have issued the orders for setting up oxygen plants in private hospitals. It will help us in generating more oxygen across the state for patients,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). Rajasthan was the first in issuing such orders for making oxygen plants mandatory for private hospitals, but a similar order has now been issued by the Centre, for making oxygen plants mandatory in clinical establishments having more than 50 beds. “The experience during the recent surge of the pandemic has affirmed that timely availability of oxygen to the Covid patients is a critical requirement in health facilities,”says the order issued by the Centre. Addressing the chief secretary, Centre has asked the state government to issue necessary directions to mandate every clinical establishment/ hospital to establish an oxygen generation plants of appropriate capacity. The state’s health authorities said they had already issued the orders for the same before the Centre. “The state government is giving subsidy of 25% in setting up oxygen plants with capacity of producing 30 oxygen cylinders daily. Earlier, the government had decided to give subsidy on setting up oxygen plant costing more than Rs 1 crore, but as a lot of private facilities are not capable of spending such an amount, we discussed the issue with the state government, which has agreed to give subsidy for setting up a plant with capacity of producing 30 cylinders daily,” said Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Society. Two died and 42 tested positive in state on Saturday taking the casualty count to 8,949 and tally to 9,53,334.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oxygen-plants-must-in-private-hosps-with-60-beds-and-above/articleshow/84513713.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan former chief minister Vasundhara Raje's aide Rohitash Sharma expelled from BJP for 6 years||JAIPUR: The BJP has expelled its former MLA from Bansur, Rohitash Sharma, considered close to former chief minister Vasundhara Raje from the party for six years on Saturday. He was expelled following charges of engaging in anti-party activities on the recommendation by the disciplinary committee. Sharma has been hogging the limelight for his pro-Raje statements since Satish Poonia has been appointed as the state president. His repeated statements ‘Raje is BJP, BJP is Raje’, ‘Raje is the CM candidate’ or ‘Raje the only leader of the masses’ have put him under the scanner of the party. He was one among the many leaders, including few elected representatives, pitching Raje didn’t invite any action. His frontal attacks on the state unit and Poonia repeatedly accusing them of not playing an active role in the second wave of Covid in Alwar cost several lives. His criticism of Poonia proved costly for him. “He didn’t stop even after repeated warnings of action. The party leaders did reach out to him urging him to express his grievances before the leaders but he continued embarrassing the party publicly,” said a source. Sharma, a three-time MLA, was served notice by the party’s disciplinary committee on June 24 seeking his explanation on his statements. The notice was served after keeping the BJP national in-charge Arun Singh in confidence. The notice didn’t deter him from speaking his mind and he continues to slam the party president publicly. Reacting to the move, Sharma said, “I was expelled on the personal grounds by the state president Satish Poonia. It is unfortunate that despite my request, nobody called me to present my side of the truth. I still believe that party is not at fault and state leaders have misused their position by reliving a staunch party leader.” The disciplinary committee which was investigating the allegations against him was found to have been involved in anti-party activities. “The report was submitted to the state party president office with a recommendation to relive him from the primary post of the party for six years on Saturday and within hours he was relieved,” said a source. He was a cabinet minister in the Bhairon Singh Shekhawat’s regime (1993-1998) and was close to him in handling political developments then. Raje appointed him as head of the cell handling inter-state water issues in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raje-aide-rohitash-sharma-expelled-from-bjp-for-6-yrs/articleshow/84513715.cms||---

The accused, who had an illicit relation with the widow, smashed her face and head with a stone suspecting her of having a realtion with a few other people. The widow, identified as Guddibai Dhobi (40), a daily wage labourer, was found dead with fatal injuries on her face and head in her house, where she lived alone in Kaidiyahat village under Bapcha police station of Baran district in on June 10, Bapcha SHO Mahendra Kumar said, adding that a case under Section 302 of IPC was lodged against unidentified accused in the matter and investigation was initiated. Police arrested Bharat Kumar Prajapat of the same village after his DNA sample was found matching with DNA samples collected from deceased’s body at the time of her autopsy, he said. The dog squad that was taken to crime spot also reached Bharat’s house, around 150 metres away from the house of the widow but he continued to mislead police saying he was not in contact with her and pointed out the names of other people in the village as accused, the SHO said. Police eventually collected samples of 16 suspects, upon whom the investigation had zeroed in, and sent them to a lab in Jaipur for DNA matching with the samples. During initial interrogation, the accused admitted to the crime and said he was in relationship with the widow since after her husband’s death in an accident four years ago but he started suspecting her character and loyalty to him as she was spotted speaking on mobile to other people for hours. On the day of crime, the accused first raped the widow on the rooftop of her house in the intervening night of June 9 and 10 and then lashed multiple attacks with a heavy stone on her face and head and fled away from the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dna-report-nails-man-35-days-after-he-killed-a-widow/articleshow/84513718.cms||---

It was our government which gave treatment to Togadia (former VHP leader Praveen Togadia) and (godman) Asaram Bapu. Nimbaram will also get the same treatment,” Dotasra said while speaking at the concluding day of the Congress campaign against inflation and fuel price hike.Dotasra also launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying he has committed grave sins and he will not be able to get peace even in Himalaya. “Under the useless prime minister, price rise and unemployment are at their peak. Even people in the villages now started saying that Modi is useless and a liar,” he claimed.“He had said he will pick up his 'jholi' and leave but he will not get peace of mind even in the Himalayas now because he has committed many sins through wrong policies that have made people suffer,” he said.He added, “There is no party worse than BJP and there are no more corrupt people than the RSS which works behind the scenes.”Dotasra said people do not like to see Modi on TV because he never talks about the issues faced by the people, be it inflation or unemployment.“Today, the farmers are troubled by bad agricultural laws, the common man is suffering due to inflation. Despite the low price of crude oil in the international market, the Modi government is charging heavy taxes on petrol and diesel. The prices of cooking gas have doubled,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-wont-spare-rss-leader-nimbaram-in-bribery-case-dotasra/articleshow/84513724.cms||Joychen Joseph

Bombay HC asks state govt, Centre||Mumbai: The Bombay high court (HC) on Saturday directed the Central and State governments to file affidavits to explain a time-flow of Covid-19 vaccine procurement—right from date of placing orders with manufacturer to vials reaching vaccination centres. The HC bench observed there was no regularity in allocation of vaccine doses by the Union government. The direction, passed by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, came on a PILby a school teacher Yogeeta Vanzara whose counsel Jamsheed Master and advocate Rajesh Vanzara said only 6% of Mumbai’s population was vaccinated so far and the doses were in short supply still in the city. For BMC, senior counsel Anil Sakhare said the civic global tenders for Covid vaccines did not fructify as expected. The HC asked the state and Centre to explain in an affidavit by August 2, the process each follows for vaccine allocation. “Our attempts to acquire vaccines directly from foreign vaccine manufacturers failed. We were informed that the foreign manufacturers would deal with Centre and states,’’ he said. The PIL raised issues of CoWin portal, difficulty faced by people in scheduling vaccination slots, given only one day’s notice. said BMC ought to open up the schedule for a week in advance for booking.  “Recently, court had asked, after Wimbledon tournament, when will be able to reach a stage where face masks were not required? At this rate, we will achieve it after 3.5-4 years,” said Master. HC also wants the State Family Welfare Bureau why it cannot inform BMC in advance of the exact number of vaccine doses allocated. Dr Sadhana Tayade, director in the office of commissioner of Health Service, Mumbai, in her affidavit said it was “not convenient to open weekly slots due to irregular supply. Once the Centre allocates, Bharat Biotech International and Serum Institute of India directly supply vaccines to Maharashtra and they are then distributed. For the Centre, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, said all state governments are informed 15-30 days in advance about the number of doses being allocated to them. The state said that on receiving the figure, it sends BMC and eight other zones details of vaccine availability. “BMC collects doses from Serum Institute of India...,” said the state lawyer. Sakhare said once BMC gets vials does it know of number received and then distribution begins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/how-are-vax-stocks-allotted-bombay-hc-asks-state-govt-centre/articleshow/84512498.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Transperson in court over ‘threat’ from parents, cops||MUMBAI: Bombay high court (HC) on Saturday, in an interim order, directed the state to protect a person who claimed to be a 23-year-old transgender male from being forced to leave Mumbai against their will, at the instance of parents and also restrained any coercive steps being taken by police. A trans person prefers to be identified as ‘they’. The person had moved the HC, fearing threat from their parents and the police. Advocate Vijay Hiremath submitted at a hearing via video-conferencing before a bench of justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar that they had come to Mumbai from Mysuru mid-January, sought protection for life and liberty of the person identifying as transgender “currently facing grave threat to their life from family members.” He said they had informed their parents that they wanted to pursue a career of dance and choreography in Mumbai and the father had not supported such decision and instead wanted them to get married. Hiremath said they arrived in the city against their parents’ wishes and officials of Versova police station are now “assisting the father to take them back to Mysore against their wish”. They were taken back to the home town in a few days after arrival and counselled by the family, but they left the family home again in February and returned to Mumbai in March for “career prospects”, after a halt in Bengaluru where an NGO gave shelter, said the petition. It adds that again the parents were making attempts to get them to return home and hence the petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution to invoke the extraordinary powers of the HC to grant justice and protect one’s life and liberty. Hiremath said now the person was almost in hiding. The HC orally said, “You have to protect them. They are also citizens of this country and they can travel where they want. How can they be asked to go out of Mumbai... Do not treat them like criminals...”. The state said parents had filed a missing person’s complaint in Mysuru. The HC said that since the person has committed no crime, the petitioner cannot be treated “this way”. It added in an oral exchange, “They are not offenders. We are directing [the] police not to harass them.” The matter has now been kept for further hearing on August 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-transperson-in-court-over-threat-from-parents-cops/articleshow/84512458.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Nagpur||‘Tackle solar energy waste withrecycle, reuse and regenerate’||India is among the top five countries producing solar photovoltaic (PV) power and will continue to further improve its position in the future. The government has already set its sights to produce 350 GW of solar power. Until June 2020, the country achieved close to 35 GW. Owing to the sub-standard quality of components being used at several places, the country is likely to witness a faster rate of early loss of PV modules. By 2030, close to 3,00,000 tons and by 2050, nearly 7,500,000 tons of solar waste is likely to pile up. Currently, there are no laws that mandate safe disposal of solar energy waste unlike WEEE in Europe and it needs to be accorded priority to ensure no land filling. A not-for-profit organisation can formulate a roadmap to pave the way for a safe end of life management using low-cost recycling equipment and ensure they are used for re-powering. About 240,000 MW of new panels can be re-produced without extracting new materials. It will result in the overall CO2 abatement of 360 billion tons in their lifetime. Jaideep N Malaviya is an expert on solar energy waste management. He spoke to TOI about the pros and cons concerning the issue. Excerpts... Q. Why do solar panels need recycling? A. India has set an ambitious target of 450 GW of renewable, largely using solar energy. All solar energy systems must be subject to the extended producer responsibility (EPR). Recycling will create more jobs and re-harvest the basic raw material to re-power. Let the new 3Rs be ‘recycle, reuse and regenerate’ instead of reject. Re-use of materials will greatly reduce the carbon foot-print as compared to fresh mining. The recycling entity can recover its cost by trading the raw material. Q. How do solar panels become a waste? A. The crystalline solar modules (panels) last 20 years or so. However, some manufacturers also claim life beyond this period. Our analysis shows that with recurring high efficiency, solar cell technologies end-users may opt for re-powering once the investment is recovered as it will give a higher yield. This will result in far sooner waste. We anticipate about 20,000 tons of waste by the year 2030 and eventually, 2,00,00,000 tons by 2050. Q. Are solar panels hazardous to the environment? A. Typical crystalline silicon solar modules (panels) have almost 95% (by weight) aluminium, glass, silicon, copper and metal parts that are recoverable and recyclable. The balance 5% polymer sheets are still a challenge to recycle and are a potential hazard to landfill as it contains fluorspar. Solar thermal panels (collectors) are 100% recyclable and easy to do. It will be interesting to undertake a detailed study on how much carbon footprint will be avoided if solar modules are recycled and reproduced instead of freshly mining raw materials. This is the only way it can put pressure on the government to consider it earnestly. Q. How is the government planning to address the issue of solar energy management? A. While inverters and batteries are already governed under electronics and battery waste management laws in India, there are none for solar modules. It is understood that an initiative has already been taken by the government to address the issue of solar energy ‘Circular Economy’ by forming a committee comprising of Industry associations, institutes and experts. What is required at this stage is to undertake R&D on developing low-cost recycling techniques to make it economical. India can set a benchmark for the consortium countries of the International Solar Alliance (ISA). Q. How does the current landscape of solar recycling in India compare to the markets across the world? A. There is no regulation or law that binds any solar module to be mandatorily sent for recycling. There is a need for an immediate bylaw to make sure all future solar modules made/imported in India have a cost of recycling built in as EPR. The classification of EPR has also to be clearly defined. Only Europe has a mandatory law on solar energy recycling under the Waste Electrical Electronic Equipment (WEEE). India needs to be ‘atmanirbhar’ in the entire value chain. Q. What are some of the main barriers for solar panel recycling? A. A database will have to be created of all installed domestic and imported solar modules in the country. This is necessary to ensure they are not dumped and break the EPR law. The EPR definition will require manufacturers to take back the waste and recycle, which will be an expense to them as they had not built in the recycling cost earlier. A preliminary study shows that a minimum 5,000 tons of solar module waste is feasible for setting up a recycling facility. Considering our vast geographic location, we will need multiple collection centres after de-framing the modules at the site. A central recycling facility that reduces the logistics cost will be economical. Nagpur fit the bill as it is centrally located and well connected with the rest of the country. Refurbishing modules, if disposed early, should be avoided as it may lead to fraud and malpractice. Q. What are some of the advantages for solar manufacturers that integrate recycling practices into their business operations? A. There is not much knowledge available on low-cost recycling. Manufacturers of solar modules have a very prominent role to play. The policies for recycling must be manufacturer-friendly. A devoted not-for-profit organisation of solar module manufacturers can function as a catalyst between the government, regulatory bodies and end-users to facilitate safe disposal. The body can invite entrepreneurs and researchers to offer low-cost solutions funded as part of the industry-institute partnership. The recovered materials can be then traded with the module manufacturers. Q. What is the current status for disposal of solar panels? A. Presently, it is sold as scrap in the open market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tackle-solar-energy-waste-withrecycle-reuse-and-regenerate/articleshow/84510384.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

He said gaps in border fencing would be plugged by 2022, adding that it was the Modi government that gave India an independent security policy that, while resolving to keep peace with all, provided for a befitting response if a challenge was posed to the country’s borders or sovereignty. Prioritising the drone threat, Shah said DRDO and other agencies are busy developing anti-drone technologies. “I am confident that we shall secure our borders soon with indigenous anti-drone solutions,” he said in his address at the 18th BSF investiture ceremony at Vigyan Bhawan here. Ministers of state for home Nityanand Rai and Ajay Kumar Mishra, home secretary Ajay Bhalla, IB and RAW chiefs attended the event. Shah’s assurance on early deployment of anti-drone solutions comes close on the heels of the first ever case of a drone being used to bomb an IAF facility in India took place recently. Though the drone attack at Jammu – suspected to have been carried out by Pakistan-based terrorist outfit Lashker e Taiba — did not cause any casualty, it did underline the need for deployment of anti-drone systems to rule out threats from the skies. The home minister said border forces should also prepare to tackle other technology-based security challenges based on artificial intelligence and robotics. “We are pushing for research and development in counter-drone technologies but will need to draw up a long-term plan,” he told officers and jawans at the BSF event that saw 23 bravehearts of the force being decorated for gallantry and meritorious service. He referred to the Vajpayee government for introducing the concept of “one border one force”. Shah asked the security forces to make efforts to check migration from border villages by ensuring that the benefits of development schemes reached there. BSF DG Rakesh Asthana, in his welcome address, informed that the force personnel had detected four tunnels and 61 drone activities along the western border in the past one year. It also seized 632 kg narcotics worth Rs 2,786 crore, 55 weapons including AK-series guns and 4,223 rounds of ammunition, apart from having killed 22 infiltrators and apprehended 165 infiltrators and smugglers. On the western border, BSF troops seized 12,881 kg of narcotics, 61 weapons, 7,976 rounds of ammunition. Besides, 12 infiltrators and smugglers were killed and 3,984 apprehended. Shah underlined that as compared to 7,270 metres of bridges built from 2008 to 2014, 14,450 metres were built in 2014-2020. Also 4,764 km road length was laid with a road construction budget of Rs 44,000 crore, as compared to 3,610 km or roads built with a budget of Rs 23,000 crore during 2008-14. While a single tunnel was constructed in 2008-14, six were built in 2014-2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/anti-drone-technologies-soon-says-home-minister-amit-shah/articleshow/84514293.cms||Bharti Jain

Dhami said that the state government is “sensitive towards the interests of the employees and ready to solve all their problems”. The salaries of roadways workers have been pending since February due to the non-operation of buses during the pandemic. In the cabinet meeting held on July 14, the issue was discussed extensively and thereafter, the chief minister was authorised by his council of ministers to decide on the payment of salaries to the employees of the transport corporation. The cabinet had then maintained that the CM would decide on the issue after discussing it with the finance department officials in length. Earlier on June 25, the Uttarakhand high court had slammed the state government for failing to pay wages to thousands of roadways workers for five months. The HC said the government's behaviour 'amounted to criminal negligence' and 'begari' (forced labour). During the hearing, the court was informed that a proposal — demanding Rs 140 crore from the state government — has been prepared by the transport corporation. The transport body said that the money will be used to pay the salaries, provident funds, and gratuities to the roadways employees. However, the court pointed out that the proposal had lacunae as the salary bills amount to just over Rs 100 crore. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has directed the managing director (MD) of the corporation, Abhishek Rohilla, to submit a complete proposal to the government so that it can be presented in the next cabinet meeting. It has also directed the state government to transfer Rs 23 crore to the corporation to compensate for the losses incurred by buses in remote areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/major-respite-for-roadways-employees-cm-sanctions-rs-34-crore-for-payment-of-pending-salaries/articleshow/84508690.cms||Kautilya Singh

Principal chief conservator of forests has recommended the suspension of the officer in his report submitted to chief secretary V P Joy. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan will take a call on the matter. The report has found that the officer tried to mislead the investigation and tried to trap officials in the case. Earlier, the forest vigilance department had also given a report against the officer. In the probe conducted by chief forest conservator (northern zone) D K Vinod Kumar, it was found that Sajan had tried to trap the range officer of Meppadi, who had tried to stop transporting trees that had been illegally cut. Also, a junior official had raised a complaint against Sajan to senior officials in the matter. All these were considered while recommending the suspension of the officer, it is learnt. The probe by a special investigation team, including the officials from three departments — forests and wildlife, crime branch and vigilance and anti-corruption bureau— are progressing in the illegal tree felling case. However, the chief minister said that the matter has not yet come to his notice. He said that the action by the revenue department by cancelling the good service entry of the deputy secretary of the department Salini O G who had parted with information regarding revenue files on tree felling order under the RTI Act, is the internal affair of the department, which is not under his consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/muttil-tree-felling-forest-conservator-faces-suspension/articleshow/84510422.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Deemed universities not following SC, ST, OBC quota rules, says students’ body||Nagpur: Alleging that the deemed to be health universities in the country are not following the reservation rules in accordance with Constitution of India, a student organization in city has lodged a complaint with the ministry of health and family welfare, National Commission for Backward Classes and SC, ST Commission. According to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar National Students Federation, the deemed to be universities should offer 15% reservation for SC, 7.50% for ST and 27% for OBC (non-creamy layer). “But, they offer only 50% seats reserved for minority students. These universities also have 15% quota for NRIs,” said the organzation. “Reservation policy for under graduate (UG) and post graduate (PG) medical and dental seats in deemed to be universities has not been followed as per the UGC (Institutions Deemed To Be Universities) Regulations, 2019. This is injustice with the students,” said Dr Siddhant Bharne, president of the organization. The group has compiled a national data which reveals that the SC/ST and OBC reservation is given in AIIMS, ESIC as well as Universities and institutes run by the Central government. “The point no. 14 in the Deemed to be Universities Regulations 2019 clearly mentions that the institution shall implement the policy on reservations in admissions and recruitment, in accordance with provisions of the Constitution of India,” said Dr Bharne. According to the complaint, the same policy is in place since last two years and same thing is likely to be followed this year too if the ministry fails to direct Medical Counseling Committee (MCC) to implement reservation. Due to this, many SC/ST/OBC students, who are willing to take admission in the deemed to be universities from academic year 2021-22, will miss the opportunity, as per the complaint. In deemed to be universities, “Deemed” is a status of autonomy granted to a university by Central government on the advice of UGC. Deemed to be universities enjoy full autonomy or independence in deciding courses, syllabus, admissions and fees. Deemed to be universities which continue to perform well can get the status of a full-fledged university. According to a UGC list, there are 123 deemed to be universities in the country. There are 20 such universities in Maharashtra while Vidarbha has only one – Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Sawangi Meghe. A senior educationist, who has been in the management council of several deemed to be universities in India, told TOI that reservation can be insisted only at government-aided universities. “Many fully self-funded universities have 50% minority quota and 15% NRI quota. Government cannot ask them to implement SC/ST and OBC reservation,” he said.The issue - Reservation policy is same for any college/universities all over India- Central Universities, AIIMS do have same SC/ST/OBC reservation policy- Deemed to be universities don’t have SC/ST/OBC reservation- Some of them have minority (Muslim, Christian and Jain) reservations- They also have 15% quota for NRI students - Medical students are demanding SC, ST and OBC reservations in deemed to be universities||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/deemed-universities-not-following-sc-st-obc-quota-rules-says-students-body/articleshow/84508709.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

According to police, accused had duped complainant Arbaz Rana, (25), a textile broker who later started selling used cars, between September and October 2020. Rana told the police that sans business for three years, he was in financial crisis and wanted to earn some quick money by selling off one kidney and get his sister married too. “Rana borrowed money to pay for the fraud. He planned that he will repay the debt from the money received after selling the kidney,” said Y A Gohil, assistant commissioner of police, cyber crime cell. Examining eight bank accounts that Gregoire operated, police found transactions of Rs 1.31 crore. “There could be many more accused involved in the crime but the African national is the mastermind. We request people to stay alert while entering in any dealings through the internet or over the phone,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar. Police found that Gregoire also created fake websites for forex trading and bitcoin investment besides offering jobs in airlines, agriculture, oil and gas, construction, dairy and courier delivery sectors in the UK, Canada and USA.

We will also take requests from districts and panchayats in these states. This way, the rituals would be followed without putting lives at stake … The aim is to save people from Covid-19 and prevent a gathering in Haridwar.” More than 3 crore pilgrims had turned out in 2019, the last time Uttarakhand had hosted saffron-clad Shiva followers who walk hundreds of kilometres barefoot carrying pitchers of water from rivers considered sacred. The Ganga in Haridwar is one such important river that the faithful from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh march to. The water is then offered to Shiva lingas in temples. This year, the pilgrimage was scheduled to begin on July 25 and end on August 6. On June 30, the government under former CM Tirath Singh Rawat had announced the yatra was cancelled. When Pushkar Singh Dhami took over as the new CM and had a conversation with his UP counterpart Yogi Adityanath on July 7, there was speculation that the yatra may be on after all. A day later, Dhami held a meeting with senior government officials and asked them to explore the possibility of holding the yatra. On July 10, Dhami visited Delhi and met PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, discussing the Kanwar and Char Dham yatras. And on July 13, he announced the kanwar yatra was cancelled in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-send-ganga-water-in-tankers-for-kanwarias-in-other-states/articleshow/84506803.cms||Kautilya Singh

According to the official data, 45,648 (11,412 in litres) bottles of Gangajal of 250 ml size were delivered to doorsteps between April and June this year. This is an increase from last year when the postal department delivered 42,288 bottles in the corresponding months. Meanwhile, postal officials are hopeful that the demand for Gangajal will rise further as the kanwar yatra has been cancelled due to the pandemic. Sunil Kumar Rai, director of Uttarakhand Postal Circle, told TOI, “The demand for Gangajal picked up during August and September last year — the months of kanwar mela. We sold 1.15 lakh bottles across Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other states in just two months. This was approximately four times what we distributed during the same period the previous year. Due to the lockdown, kanwar yatra has been cancelled this year too. Thus, we expect an increase in the demand in the coming months. We have adequate stock and are prepared to deliver the holy water to doorsteps.” The Gangajal is sold at Rs 30+transportation cost by the Uttarakhand postal department under project ‘Gangajal’, which was launched in 2016. The project covers 3,000 post offices under 22 postal circles in India. To fetch the Gangajal, four-to-five trekkers scale Gangotri — the origin of Ganga — and then the river water is treated before being bottled and sold. “Gangajal is collected from May to June and then from October to mid-November,” Rai added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-postal-circle-records-uptick-in-doorstep-delivery-of-gangajal/articleshow/84508711.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee
---||Nagpur||Facing big fund crunch due to Covid-19 pandemic: Govt||Nagpur: The Covid-19 pandemic has drastically drained the Maharashtra government resources so much so that it is unable to clear payments of various companies. The position became clear during the hearing of two suo motu PILs where amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar quoted media reports that all CCTV cameras stopped functioning after Larsen and Toubro (L&T) stopped its servers for recovery of Rs 135 crore.A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor on Friday directed the Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) chairman, L&T chief executive officer (CEO) and its city-based employees, and Maharashtra Information Technology Corporation Limited (MITCL) to hold a meeting at Mantralaya for discussing issues arising out of mutual and reciprocal contractual obligations. Asking all stakeholders to amicably resolve all the disputes, the bench directed the chief secretary or additional chief secretary (home) to preside over the meeting to ensure proper coordination amongst all the concerned government departments.Earlier, an affidavit by MITCL chief operating officer (COO) Prasad Kolte in HC informed that due to the pandemic, revenue generated by various government departments has been drastically reduced. Moreover, the tax revenue in 2020 and 2021 is substantially decreased than 2019 figures, while the prolonged lockdown has taken a toll on its income.“The lockdown’s crippling effect on income is further accentuated by the mounting expenditure on healthcare. The government expenditure is also prioritised to works and activities related to healthcare for tackling pandemic. With reduced industrial activity, the state is staring at a huge deficit which will have to be balanced with increased borrowings,” the affidavit read.Saying that expenditure on all activities have been reduced, Kolte said these difficulties will remain till pandemic is brought under control and the economy revives. “The budget of all government departments has shrunk and contributions have been delayed. As a consequence, payments due under contract to L&T couldn’t be made on time. However, substantial payment has been made to it earlier. The MITCL is coordinating with various government departments to ensure speedy payment of balance amount, but this delay can’t be the reason for dissolution of blockage of service.”The COO added that after HC orders of July 1, the MITCL has again written letters to various departments and other stakeholders for release of funds and after its receipts, the L&T’s dues would be cleared.Before adjourning the hearing by four weeks, the judges clarified that if the meeting doesn’t result in resolution of issues, the parties would be at liberty to take recourse to such remedy for resolution of the same, as may be available in terms of contract and law.“We must put it down in writing that HC will not permit the respondents to spill over their inter se dispute on account of payment/non-payment of the sums arising out of contractual obligations into the public arena to adversely affect the public interest,” they said.COVID-HIT STATE* Due to the pandemic, revenue by generated by various departments is drastically reduced*Tax revenue in 2020 & 2021 is substantially reduced than 2019 figures, as prolonged lockdown took a toll on income* Crippling effect on income is further accentuated by mounting expenditure on healthcare* With reduced industrial activity, state is staring at huge deficit which will have to be balanced with increased borrowings* Budget of all government departments has shrunk & contributions are delayed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/facing-big-fund-crunch-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-govt/articleshow/84508713.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

In 2017, when BMC officials were examining documents, they noticed that two employees had the same name, date of birth and other details, but worked in different departments. This was brought to the notice of senior officials. Both were told to submit original documents. Sabale submitted his documents, but the other person stopped reporting to work in 2017. A civic official said BMC sent a letter to the official address of the absent staffer but it was received by the mukadam’s father in his hometown.

---||Mumbai||Esplanade Mansion’s sad story eye-opener, save heritage buildings: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court recently observed that the “sad story” of the heritage Esplanade Mansion is an “eye-opener and an impetus” for the authorities to device an effective mechanism to protect and restore heritage structures. “We have good laws to protect ancient monuments but the implementation...to protect them and the heritage buildings is certainly not adequate and, in fact, dismal. Such buildings and monuments are neglected and not maintained,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni in a detailed order disposing a plea by Esplanade Mansion owner Saiq Ali. “We feel deeply concerned as to whether the state, Mhada and BMC should not work out an effective, robust scheme to preserve heritage buildings in the city,” the bench said. The HC on July 3 had suspended the demolition notices issued by the state’s housing body Mhada (Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority) which has possession of the building till a proposal on its reconstruction submitted by the owner is considered and decided by the BMC heritage committee and later the civic body. The order, made available on Saturday, said, “There can be no two opinions that there are a large number of such beautiful buildings not only in the Fort area constructed during the British times, privately owned and occupied, but also elsewhere in the city. Such buildings at all times have added to the glory and fame of this beautiful city.”  The judges mentioned how world over there are much older buildings like the Westminster Abbey in London constructed centuries ago which “have been preserved and have maintained the glory of such cities”. The HC order traced the history of Esplanade Mansion, once an elegant Watson’s Hotel in its unique cast-iron framed British construction of 1860-1863. It was designed by civil engineer Rowland Ordish who was associated with the construction of St Pancras station in London. “A saga of a heritage building situated between the University of Mumbai and the Bombay city civil and sessions court in the Fort area, not more than about 400 metres from the Bombay high court...has reached this court,” said the judges in the order. The hotel shut after 1920 and after 1960 building ownership changed hands and HC was told Ali purchased it by a deed of conveyance dated March 9, 1979, from Tata Sons Ltd. In 2006, it was listed as one of the 100 most endangered sites. Ali’s advocate Cherag Balsara submitted Rs 20 crore out of Rs 50 crore for reconstruction has been kept in a bank. BMC counsel Anil Sakhare said the heritage committee would study the proposal and the HC said if such permission is granted, further approvals can be sought from Mhada and BMC. The order said the state needs a “positive approach’’ to maintain heritage buildings “as it is impossible to construct such structures in the contemporary times”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-esplanade-mansions-sad-story-eye-opener-save-heritage-bldgs/articleshow/84510488.cms||---

Nitin Tej Ahuja, CEO of the Guild, said, “We are grateful to the CM for giving us a patient, responsive hearing. We requested that filming be permitted beyond the current deadline of 4pm for a few reasons. Firstly, night scenes demand that they be filmed at night. This cannot be managed within the current restrictions. Secondly, talent and manpower is not replaceable, and it is not always possible to manage the time of key actors and technicians together within the 4pm deadline. Thirdly, the risk [of Covid-19 infection] in fact reduces at night because there is less fear of crowds gathering.” The guild informed the CM that unlike malls, restaurants, markets and public places, film shoots do not involve a floating population of outsiders. Ahuja said, “Our units consist of the same set of people, and now that studios and production houses are all getting their employees vaccinated, the threat of infection reduces. Of course, the CM said to us that he has to consider the larger picture and manage the threat of a possible third wave and we see his viewpoint...” The Mumbai police should appoint a nodal officer to give permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-lets-lights-camera-into-action-beyond-4pm/articleshow/84512596.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to train Asha workers in distributing meds in remote areas||DEHRADUN: To strengthen the health infrastructure in the remote hills of Uttarakhand, the health department has mooted a proposal to train Asha workers in distributing basic medicines to sick people. This has been done to ensure that people receive immediate medical care and don’t turn critical before they can be shifted to a primary or community health centre. The proposal is inspired by Kerala where Asha workers have been trained to keep and distribute medicines in remote areas. Uttarakhand has nearly 13,000 Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) workers and their work includes conducting surveys, running health drives, creating awareness about diseases and distributing ration etc. The Asha workers will be trained under the aegis of the chief medical officer in their respective areas in distributing certain medicines. Confirming the proposal, the director general of health, Dr Tripti Bahuguna, said, “The proposal is at a very nascent stage right now and a dedicated technical team is deciding the medicines which the ASHAs can distribute before we seek final go-ahead for roping them in from the system.” This move will take medical facilities to the remotest villages of Uttarakhand but, in the process, also increase the responsibility of Asha workers who will have to provide basic treatment to sick people before they can be referred to a primary or community health centre. Ahead of a possible third wave of Covid-19, such preparations would help the state in controlling the impact of the pandemic. The newly appointed health minister, Dhan Singh Rawat, has also announced that a total of 600 health camps would be organized across the state in the next four months. As the state gears up for the February 2022 assembly elections, health facilities are being ramped up by the state government. Suggestions from experts in the health department and private doctors are being taken into consideration to create a robust health infrastructure in the state. The proposal, however, has left the pharma association fuming. “According to the Pharmacy Act 1948, Drugs and Cosmetic Act 1940 and Pharmacy Practice Regulation 2015, Pharmacy Council of India, no person other than a qualified and registered pharmacist can store, distribute and manage medicines. The move being planned is condemned by the pharmacist union of Uttarakhand,” said Sudha Kukreti, Dehradun district president, Diploma pharmacist association, Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/following-the-kerala-model-ukhand-to-train-asha-workers-in-distributing-meds-in-remote-areas/articleshow/84508729.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Drops gun, picks up books and clears SSC||NAGPUR: Before leaving the Maoist movement about three years ago, Rajula Hidami, 19, had more than half a dozen offences and took part in firing against police. Today, she has cleared her SSC examination with 51.08% marks and aspires to join the police department. A native of Lavhari village in Gadchiroli, Rajula was trained in arms and weapon and once worked with Korchi-Khobramenda-Kurkheda dalam of Gadchiroli. The turnaround came after cops helped her resume education following her surrender before Gondia police in 2018. It’s learnt, the tribal girl from Gond community had spent around two years with the Maoists before escaping from the dalam. Considering her tender age, the cops had offered her surrender scheme. With help from the then additional SP Sandip Atole, under the then SP Harish Baijal, cops from Naxal cell admitted Rajula in a school and hostel for tribal girls at Deori in Gondia in 2019. Cops from the Naxal cell also doubled up as her ‘tuition teachers’ to help her sail through the SSC examination as she struggled with languages and Mathematics. Atole also purchased for her a school kit, bags, books, cycle and uniform. The Naxal cell helped the girl to settle and adjust in the new environment. Rajula, who had lost father early, was abducted by Maoists when she was barely 15 years old and a student of Std VII. Youngest of three siblings, the girl had taken cattle for grazing to the forest where the Maoists snatched her cellphone and took her along on the pretext of asking directions. It’s learnt, the Maoists misled her stating that now cops would be now on her trail as she had spent two days with the rebels. The Maoists later trained her to use the walkie-talkie and other gadgets apart from weapons. Subsequently, she rose to prominence in the dalam and used a ‘tab’ to document the routine activities of the group. A cop from Deori told TOI on the condition of anonymity that there were multiple hurdles in resuming the girl’s education. “The school admissions were closed and the girl did not have any documents.” The cop said he posed as a tehsil office clerk and his wife a teacher to visit the girl’s family to get the required documents. Cops decided to take care of the girl upon learning that her mother had remarried and was settled elsewhere. “Some cops from the special cell helped her with studies and she responded well. I wanted her to pursue polytechnic but she wants to become a cop,” said the undercover cop who is sort of her guardian now. Atole, who is now posted in Daund in Pune district, said that he had almost ‘adopted’ the girl. “I have a lot of hopes from her,” he said. Under DIG Naxal range Sandip Patil, the special cells in Gadchiroli and Gondia had been extending special support to rehabilitate many surrendered Maoists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drops-gun-picks-up-books-and-clears-ssc/articleshow/84508727.cms||Soumitra Bose

She was dressed in a red sari, a shabby white shirt buttoned over her choli and a red towel wrapped around her head. In another field, her husband, Loganathan, 68, shoveled sand and levelled the ground. Far from celebrating their son becoming a Union minister, L Murugan’s parents continue to toil in the fields. The couple prefer a life independent of their son, earning their daily bread by the sweat of their brow. When TOI visited Konur on Saturday, the village landlord gave her permission to talk. Varudammal approached hesitantly and said, “What should I do if my son becomes a Union minister?” Proud as she is that her son is part of the Narendra Modi cabinet, she refuses to take any credit for it. “We didn’t do anything for his (career) growth.” The couple, both hailing from the Arunthathiyar community, a dalit subsect, live in a small asbestos-roofed dwelling near Namakkal, a wellknown truckers’ hub. The couple are coolies, daily-wage earners, who work in fields and wherever else they can find jobs. The fact that their son is Union minister of state is of little consequence. When they heard the good news from neighbours, they were busy working in the fields and did not stop. Couple well-known for their simplicity’After Murugan was appointed the BJP state chief (in March 2020), he called on them, arriving in Konur amidst much fanfare accompanied by police security and a convoy of partymen. His parents received him calmly without a flutter. Though proud of their son’s achievement, they are stubbornly independent and take care of their daughter-in-law and children too after their younger son died five years ago. Union minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Singh Thakur greets minister of state for Information and Broadcasting Dr L. Murugan, in New Delhi. (ANI)Murugan was studious as a child, his father said. He completed his schooling in government schools before pursuing law at the Ambedkar Law College in Chennai. Loganathan had to borrow money from friends and acquaintances for Murugan’s college education. Murugan would keep urging them to stay with him in Chennai. “We used to go once in a blue moon and stay with him for four days. We could not fit into his busy lifestyle and we preferred to return to Konur,” said Varudammal. Murugan contacted them over phone after his induction into the Union cabinet. Loganathan and Varudammal asked him if the post was superior to even the BJP state president post he held for about a year. Landlord Kezhsathambur Palanisamy, for whom Loganathan and Varudammal worked frequently, said there was no change in the couple’s attitude even after their son became the Union minister. For his part, Palanisamy asked Loganathan to report to work as usual. Fellow villager Vasu Srinivasan said Loganathan was standing in the queue at the local ration shop when the state government was distributing Covid dole. “We asked him to skip the queue, but he refused to do so,” said Srinivasan, adding that the couple was well-known for their simplicity. The couple did not own even a small piece of land, he said. Loganathan and Varudammal said they wanted to stand on their own feet till the end. “Our son has reached a high position. As parents, this is more than enough for us,” they said.

TOI visited various markets across the city on Saturday and found that neither the city police nor the nuisance detection squad (NDS) of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) were ensuring all non-essential shops remain closed on weekends. Many non-essential shops in commercial areas like Jaripatka, Itwari, Mahal, Gandhibagh, Sadar and Dharampeth were either fully opened or the shutter was half open. At some places, TOI found that shopkeepers were standing outside and entertaining customers. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi too said on Saturday he has received many complaints of shops functioning in Sadar, Itwari and Sitabuldi. He claimed the NMC’s civic cops are taking action against shopkeepers as and when violations of Covid-19 guidelines are spotted. As per the Epidemic Diseases Act, the NMC has powers to penalize those not following Covid-19 norms. “We will take stricter action if people are found flouting norms more often,” said the additional commissioner. According to NDS commandant Virsen Tambe, the squad has sealed 50 shops within city limits over the last five months for violating safety guidelines laid down to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “Besides sealing the shops for 48 hours, the team also collected fine of Rs4.25 lakh from the offending shopkeepers,” he said. Most shops were sealed for not ensuring physical distancing among customers, entertaining customers not wearing masks and not providing sanitisers. The NDS data revealed that the highest numbers of violations were reported from Gandhibagh zone where 20 shops were sealed and fine of Rs1.80 lakh was collected. Under Mangalwari zone, eight shops were sealed, four under Dharampeth zone and three each under Hanuman Nagar and Satranjipura zones. Under Nehru Nagar and Lakadganj zones, the NDS team sealed one shop each. Sources said all the eating joints, especially Saoji eateries in Bajaj Nagar are brazenly violating the Covid-19 guidelines by allowing dining in till late night. The city police and civic cops are turning a blind eye to these violations, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-fails-to-keep-non-essential-shops-closed-on-weekends/articleshow/84510567.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Nine get 5 years in jail for stopping dalit groom from riding horse at Parsa village||AHMEDABAD: A sessions court in Gandhinagar on Saturday punished nine persons with five years’ imprisonment for stopping a dalit youth from riding a horse in his wedding procession at Parsa village in June 2018. The court held Natvarsinh Parmar, Kuldipsinh Chauhan, Anirudhsinh Rathod, Devendrasinh Chavda, Vijaysinh Chauhan, Vipul Chauhan, Jigarsinh Chauhan, Naresh Chauhan and Virendrasinh Chauhan guilty of threatening people in the procession and of charges under the Atrocities Act, said public prosecutor P D Vyas. On June 17, 2018, youths from the Kshatriya community in Parsa village objected to the wedding procession of one Prashant Solanki from Mehsana town, because he was to ride a horse. The groom had travelled to the village border in a car and was to ride a horse to the bride’s house with the wedding party. The accused stopped him and claimed that Solanki could not ride a horse as only somebody from a “courageous caste” such as their community could do it. After they were confronted and threatened by the village youths, the groom’s family called police and asked for protection. Cops rushed to the village and the procession was held under police vigil. As the nine accused were put on trial, public prosecutor examined 18 witnesses to prove the charges. The court held them guilty and punished them with five-year imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on each of them. In May 2019, at Khambhisar village in Aravalli district, stones were pelted at the procession of a dalit groom. The situation escalated, and police had to use force to get the situation under control. Another case of objecting to a dalit groom riding a horse was reported from Sitvada village in Sabarkantha district. It was only after the deployment of 67 police personnel to protect the procession, could the groom clamber on to the horse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/9-get-5-years-in-jail-for-stopping-dalit-groom-from-riding-horse/articleshow/84510596.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bursts of intense rain likely to rise with warming: Study||MUMBAI: Short bursts of intense rain of the kind that flooded parts of Mumbai early Sunday are likely to increase with global warming — perhaps even more than daily or multi-day extreme rainfall events, a 2018 research says. Scientists say the trend poses a risk to Indian cities, reports Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar. The study, which simulated rainfall in 89 Indian cities under different climate scenarios, found 3-hour rainfall extremes increased by 20% if global mean temperatures rose 1.5C compared to the pre-industrial era. These “sub-daily” bursts of rain could rise by 25%, if global temperatures increased by 2 C, it projected. The Paris Agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions—which cause global warming—-aims to cap global temperature increase to 2 degrees celsius this century. The study also found that increases in three-hour extremes were almost twice that of daily precipitation for the same warming scenarios. For every degree of warming, one can generally expect a 6% to 7% increase in daily rainfall, says Vimal Mishra, a scientist with IIT-Gandhinagar who co-authored the study. That’s because the atmosphere’s capacity to hold water increases when temperature increases. But short-duration precipitation seems to be more sensitive to warming. “In most places, we found that sub-daily precipitation extremes are increasing faster than daily extremes—that it’s more sensitive to warming,” Mishra says. Interestingly, another study last year found that daily rainfall extremes did not increase beyond a certain level with rising temperatures—but three-hour extremes did. One reason for that, says IIT-Bombay professor Subimal Ghosh, could be that there isn’t enough moisture in the air most of the time to maintain that level of precipitation for a whole day. “If rainfall is coming down at 100mm an hour, there is enough moisture supply in the atmosphere for three hours of that, but not for 24 hours,” says Ghosh, His study also found that short-duration high-intensity rainfall events are intensifying with warming, leading to “extreme streamflow” in smaller catchments like urban ones. This trend is critical, he says, because sudden bursts of rain are more likely to lead to flash floods that leave little time for evacuation or warning. The trend is also risky for cities because outdated storm water drains and concretisation prevent drainage, leading to flooding of the kind seen on Sunday. Mumbai is currently expanding its storm water drain capacity from 25 mm of rainfall an hour to 50mm an hour, but what it needs now are drains that can handle more than 100 mm of rainfall in an hour, said Kapil Gupta, an urban drainage expert at IIT Bombay. Gupta, who advised the National Disaster Management Authority on new urban flooding guidelines, recommends increasing capacity for a climate change scenario, keeping rivers and drains clear, and building underground storage tanks to absorb extra water. “We need to upgrade our systems to account for increasing extremes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/study-bursts-of-intense-rain-likely-to-rise-with-warming/articleshow/84537529.cms||Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar

The government has reportedly directed the district to consider the deceased of other districts and states in the district’s toll but is avoiding the same in its data which is resulting in the difference. On Saturday, TOI had reported about the massive reconciliation done by the CS in deaths, cases and recoveries. The CS had added 1,075 deaths, 15,305 positive cases and 14,022 recoveries in the data of the district citing various reasons. After the increase in the number of deaths by 1,075, the total toll of the district rose to 10,115 on Friday. As per the government’s data, the district’s fatalities were 8,496 on Friday, a difference of 1,619. The difference was 546 a day before reconciliation. The fatalities of the district were 9,039 as per the CS and 8,493 according to the government on July 15. “Data of positive cases and recoveries have been matched. There will be a difference only in data of deaths when compared with the data of government and the CS. The government had directed us to count the Covid deceased of other districts and states who died while undergoing treatment in hospitals situated in the district. The government in its data is considering fatalities of the city and rural which are actually of the district. The government is considering deaths of other districts in a separate column of other states/country or counting in the toll of respective districts,” said officials of the state’s public health department. The government is not considering deaths of other districts and states in the column of other state/country. Also, the government is not counting it in respective districts. The number of deaths in government’s data is less compared with that of CS when it comes to other districts of Vidarbha. For example, deaths of Bhandara district are 1,116 in the government’s data whereas the figure is 1,130 as per the CS. Many patients of Bhandara had died in hospitals situated in the district. When it comes to cases and recoveries, the difference between the data of government and CS is quite less. The difference would have been high if the government was also counting cases and recoveries of other districts and states in their respective areas. As per the government, cases in the district were 4,92,895 while that of the CS stood at 4,92,728, a difference of 167 on Friday. Similarly, recoveries were 4,82,300 as per the CS and 4,82,028 according to the government, a difference of 272. The government had also done massive reconciliation in the deaths in districts last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-reconciliation-huge-difference-in-deaths-continues/articleshow/84510607.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The mother had died in April this year due to Covid. The teenaged girl has scored 80.6% while her brother 69%. A bunch of students including three orphans from Ganga Jamuna have cleared SSC, with most of them scoring over 80% this year. These students were supported by NGO Sharanasthan Charitable Society which has been working for children of sex workers from Ganga Jamuna for the last many years. The girl choked while recalling how her mother motivated her to succeed. After marriage, her mother was trafficked to the red-light area at the age of 15 years from Odisha. She was still a teenager when she became mother of two in Odisha. After coming to city, she gave birth to the children who cleared the SSC exam on Friday. The 16-year-old girl stays in a hostel where she was accommodated with assistance from Sharanasthan founders Easo Daniel and his wife Leela. “My mother always used to ask me about studies, result and percentage whenever we met,” said the teenager. The teenager said she expected to score 90% but somehow fell short. “After Std XII, I will appear for National Defence Academy examinations, and for UPSC after graduation,” she said. “We had studied hard apart from attending our online classes,” said the teenager who was five years old and her brother a year younger when they had come to Sharansthan. Leela said their mother was keen that her children fared well in life. “Their elder brother and sister stay away from the red-light area and earn livelihood by doing some other work,” said Leela. Another 16-year-old girl, who scored 70%, said she was aspiring to become a fire officer. Another girl, who score 69%, said she dreamt of becoming an army officer. One of the girls, who got 73%, aspired to become a doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sex-worker-died-of-covid-19-daughter-scores-80-in-ssc/articleshow/84508811.cms||Soumitra Bose

Poornima Mohan, whose appointment had sparked a row after questions were raised over her qualifications to perform the duties of a Malayalam Lexicon editor, had failed to complete the work funded by the UGC in 2012, said SUCC chairman R S Sasikumar. Poornima is wife of R Mohanan, a former IRS officer who works as the officer on special duty at the chief minister’s office. “Poornima Mohan was entrusted with the task of preparing a multi-cultural dictionary of major Dravidian and some Indo-European languages in two years. UGC sanctioned Rs 7,80,000 for the assignment in December 2012. However, she failed to complete the work even after five years. Since the project did not take off, Sanskrit university had directed the project director —Poornima Mohan— to pay back the money,” the committee said. It was alleged that Kerala University appointed Poornima, a Sanskrit professor, as the editor of Malayalam Lexicon under the influence of Mohanan. The university later defended its decision by claiming that Poornima was a multilingual scholar and her in-depth knowledge in Sanskrit and many other languages would be of great help for discharging her duties as editor of Malayalam Lexicon. Higher education minister R Bindu too had justified Poornima’s appointment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lexicon-editors-ugc-project-incomplete/articleshow/84510640.cms||---

The shootout took place barely 17 kilometres from the crime spot. According to police, when they tried to nab the assailants, they opened fire at a police team. Two of the five assailants were injured as police returned fire. The injured — Manish Pandey and Nirdosh Kumar – were immediately taken to a community health centre in Khandari, from where they were referred to SN Medical College after their condition deteriorated. They were later declared dead by the medical college doctors. However, three of their associates — Narendra, Anshu and an unidentified one – managed to escape from the spot. Talking to TOI, ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna said that gold worth Rs 5 crore has been recovered from the assailants. While two of them were killed, others managed to escape. “They will be arrested soon,” he said, adding that two country-made pistols and cartridges were also recovered from them. An FIR has been registered against five persons for dacoity on the basis of a complaint filed by the branch manager, said police. A 41-second CCTV footage shows the five assailants coming out after looting the branch and crossing the road on foot. Initial investigations revealed that the gang was from Firozabad, said police. Police said the incident took place at the first floor of the complex around 2:15 pm, when five assailants carrying bags entered the branch and looted the store after overpowering the staff members. The entire operation by the suspects lasted for 25 minutes. No customer was present inside the office at the time of the incident, said police. ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna, IG Naveen Arora, SSP Muniraj G and SP (city) Botre Rohan Pramod reached the spot to assess the situation. All neighbouring district borders were informed and check posts were put in place on National Highway-2 to nab the accused. Branch manager Vijay Narwaria said that four staff members, including him, were present in the branch when the robbers entered. He said, “No guard was there, as the company doesn’t provide one.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-shot-dead-in-encounter-2-hrs-after-looting-19-kg-gold-in-agra/articleshow/84510635.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Ahmedabad||Cyber con: Nurse in Ahmedabad loses Rs 1.2 lakh||AHMEDABAD: Searching for the customer care number of her bank online led a nurse to cyber fraudsters who conned her out of Rs 1.28 lakh. Shiba Yadav, a 35-year-old resident of Thaltej, filed a complaint in this regard with the Vastrapur police. She had an account with the State Bank of India and wanted a six-month statement. So, she went to the bank where she was told that the statement would be made available only after May 15 due Covid restrictions. In her complaint, she said that on May 5, she called up bank’s customer care number that she had looked up online. During the conversation, the person posing as customer care executive pretended that he could not hear her and promised to call back. She later received a text from a private mobile number asking her to download a screen sharing application. The person asked her if she used an e-wallet. She told the person that she wanted her statement. He convinced her to make a transaction of Rs 49,213. She did as asked but realized that the money got deducted from her bank account. When she asked the man why the money had been deducted, he told her that the money had been put on hold and would be credited to her account again. By then, an amount of Rs 1,28,623 had been withdrawn from the account. When Shiba asked the man to return the money, another person identifying himself as senior customer care manager asked her for her HDFC account to deposit the money back. When she refused to do so, the man said that her money would be refunded in 24 hours. She hung up and immediately called the police. After they looked into the case, a complaint was lodged on Friday. The police have repeatedly advised people against fake customer care service numbers that are posted online. “In case you want to contact a company or service, go to their website and look up the number instead of googling for it,” said cyber experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cyber-con-nurse-loses-rs-1-2l/articleshow/84510644.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Congress to petition PM on land auction||Hyderabad: Congress has decided to lodge a complaint against the alleged corruption by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his family members in the recent land auction held at Kokapet and other projects with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy said he would also submit the evidence available with him to Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy. “Let’s see if the central government orders an investigation against alleged corruption by KCR family based on the evidence submitted by us,” he said. Addressing a media conference on Saturday, Revanth said he would also raise the alleged corruption issue by KCR in Lok Sabha. Congress would also raise the issue of Krishna river water dispute, the Centre taking over the management of two rivers and projects on it. “If possible, I would talk about the issues currently prevailing in Telangana during zero hour in Lok Sabha. Right from corruption in land auctions to non-fulfilment of assurances made in the AP State Reorganisation Act, I will fight for the cause of Telangana people and their rights,” he said. Revanth alleged that the e-auction held for Kokapet land saw only those companies which were close to KCR and his family members got the land parcels as successful bidders. “There is a strong suspicion of a scam as one acre is sold at Rs 60 crore and remaining land parcels at an average Rs 30 crore to Rs 40 crore in the same layout,” he added. Revanth sought to remind that it was KCR and T Harish Rao who had opposed land auctions at Kokapet by the previous Congress government in the combined state in 2006. Now, CM KCR is selling the land, he added. “The government should have got Rs 3,000 crore for the land, but they were sold for Rs 2,000 crore. The government has incurred Rs 1,000 crore loss to ensure that those close to KCR and TRS got the land parcels at lesser price,” Revanth alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/congress-to-petition-pm-on-land-auction/articleshow/84510653.cms||---

---||Trichy||Trichy city on alert as dengue cases resurface after showers||Trichy: Trichy Corporation is on high alert after a few dengue cases were reported in the city during the past few weeks following the monsoon showers. After six years, a suspected dengue death was also reported in the city much to the worry of the civic body, which was burdened with the Covid-19 vaccination and preventive measures.Almost all parts of the city received substantial rainfall in the first week of July and moderate showers in the last few days. With several houses and commercial establishments remaining locked for weeks following the lockdown, uncleared scrap and fallen leaves on terraces, balconies and sunshades have turned them into potential mosquito breeding grounds after the rain. As the corporation has been focusing on the Covid-19 vaccination drive, much emphasis was not given on eliminating the potential breeding grounds of mosquitoes. The civic body said that at least two cases were being reported in the city a week. A nine-month-old baby boy at Kattur was suspected to have died of dengue. Cantonment locality also reported a dengue fever case. It is to be noted that the city has not recorded any dengue deaths since 2015.The civic body, which delayed the launch of fogging and source reduction drives soon after the rainfall, has planned to resume mosquito breeding control measures on a large-scale. Other preventive methods including spraying oil in sewage and letting Gambusia fishes in freshwater to prey on the larvae are to be revived. “Delayed presentation is there among the dengue positive cases. Since people are travelling, some contract the infection from elsewhere,” Dr M Yazhini, city health officer, told TOI. The civic body is focussing on households adjacent to the places where dengue was reported. The residents were asked to clear containers, empty flower pots and coconut shells from the terraces and backyards or pay penalties during inspection. “We have levied and collected Rs 10,000 as penalty from a shop at Ariyamangalam that had mosquito larvae in the unused washbasin,” a sanitary official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-city-on-alert-as-dengue-cases-resurface-after-showers/articleshow/84512694.cms||Deepak Karthik

The crop loan waiver announced by the AIADMK government helped several farmers tide over the financial burden, he said.The TMC MP said that those who availed the loans to purchase agriculture equipment and digging deep bore wells for the purpose of agriculture were excluded from the crop loan waiver. “Hence, they are unable to repay the loans and take fresh loans for the cultivation now. They are struggling to begin the cultivation. So, the Tamil Nadu government should write off the interest on the loans and provide more time to them to repay their loans besides arranging for new loans to them,” said Vasan. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vasan-seeks-more-time-for-farmers-to-repay-loans/articleshow/84512684.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Rendered homeless for the third time, Rohingyas demand dignity||NEW DELHI: After 56 shacks housing Rohingya refugees were reduced to ashes on June 12, the beleaguered community has been living in tents in another location in southeast Delhi’s Madanpur Khadar. When it rained in Delhi this past week, their tents, erected in a low-lying area, were flooded. But that is not the only woe they face. The heat and high humidity levels increase their discomfort, mobile toilets put up for them are at quite a distance from their tents and they regularly encounter snakes near their tents. As the refugees lost all their belongings in the fire, some NGOs have provided them with clothes, coolers, utensils and rations. However, the refugees want on a priority a place to live rather than donated items. As Mohammed Salimullah, living in Delhi since 2013, said, “This place is not suitable for families and we request the government to provide us a safer place. We can earn our own living and live life with dignity. The refugees lived at the current site in their shanties and huts till 2018. After a fire broke out around three years ago, they moved to a neighbouring site and rebuilt their homes. However, they were compelled to return to the earlier place and are now living in tents. Salimullah twice lost his home and shop to fires in 2018 and June this year. “I do not have the means to start another shop. As the conditions in Myanmar were terrible for us, we were forced to flee to India. Now, we find we have nowhere to go.” NoorBano, a mother of four, serving food to her kids, said over her shoulders that she feared for the safety of her children due to frequent snake sightings. “With the reptiles being frequently spotted in our camp, I am unable even to sleep without anxiety at night and especially worry about my children,” she said. For Rabiyana, who left Myanmar in 2011, the life under the tents is quite a tough one. “It’s too hot in the summer, but when it started raining, we faced more trouble because the water spoiled our clothes, rations and many other things.” Most of the refugees, who work as daily-wage labourers, were badly hit by the stoppage of work due to Covid-19. The fire in their camp has, thus, only aggravated their problems. Mohammed Amin, a labourer, said, “There is hardly any work for us and I am unemployed on most of the days. I have to support a family of eight, and I cannot afford to rent a room anywhere.” Amin added that after months of hard work, he had saved around Rs 8,000, but the currency notes were burnt to ashes in the fire. Welfare activists are aghast. Sabber Kyaw Min, founder and director, Rohingya Human Rights Initiative, said, “The refugees are living in inhuman conditions with difficult access to toilets and water. We request the government and NGOs to make efforts to rehabilitate them in a proper space.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rendered-homeless-for-the-third-time-rohingyas-demand-dignity/articleshow/84510677.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Patel, who is also the former chairman of Maharashtra commission for agriculture costs and prices, has proposed the use of biomass pellets or briquettes prepared from bamboo to not only bring down carbon emission but also make the overall thermal power generation process cost-effective. He told TOI, “By using biomass pellets or briquettes prepared from bamboo as fuel for thermal power plants, we are not only saving public money, but also helping the environment and at the same time generating employment in the farming sector.” Highlighting the potential benefit state treasury may make, he said that the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) based at Dadri near Delhi has issued a tender for the purchase of 1,000 tonnes of biofuel per day at Rs 5,500 per tonne this year. “This purchase and consumption is likely to transfer a sum of about Rs 200 crores in the pockets of farmers supplying them. Similarly, we can save lot of public money by replicating the same in Maharashtra based plants,” he said. Besides writing a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, he has also personally made a representation to state energy minister Nitin Raut as well as the leader of opposition Pravin Darekar demanding steps for bringing down the use of lakhs of tonne of coal by thermal plants each year. Citing that bamboo has the potential to generate more 4,000 Kcal of energy, Patel said that its energy potential makes it one of the best biomass alternative fuel for thermal plants. Also, the preparation of biomass pellets or briquettes from agricultural residues can be further used for bringing down pollution level and helping slowdown global warming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/agri-activist-demands-for-replacing-coal-with-green-coal-cane-as-fuel-in-thermal-power-plants/articleshow/84506953.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi airport's Terminal-2 reopening on July 22, confirms DIAL||NEW DELHI: Flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport’s Terminal-2 (T2) will resume from next week. The operator for Delhi Airport, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) on Saturday announced that flight operation will begin at the terminal from July 22. From 12.01am, all IndiGo 2000 series flights, alongside all GoAir flights will shift to T2, with a total of 27 counters to function initially to cater to passengers of the two airlines. The resumption of operations at T2 will be with approximately 200 air traffic movements (100 departures and 100 arrivals) per day, which may increase progressively up to 280 by August-end, officials said. The terminal initially expects a daily passenger footfall of around 25,000 passengers, with IndiGo’s 2000-2999 series flights and entire operations of GoAir functioning in the initial phase. Around 27 counters — 11 for GoAir and 16 for IndiGo — will be available to cater to the passengers of respective flights, along with 22 kiosks for e-boarding of passengers. The first flight scheduled from T2 after reopening of this terminal would be a Kolkata-bound IndiGo flight, which will take off at 3am. DIAL says it has taken several safety measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 and ensure the safety of passengers as directed by the government of India. “Delhi Airport is all set to reopen T2 once again for domestic flight operations after the recent shutdown owing to second wave of Covid-19 cases. We would like to assure passengers that at Delhi airport, they would be in a safe and healthy environment. We have implemented several measures at the airport to ensure passenger safety without compromising their comfort and experience,” said DIAL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar. “Our teams work round the clock to sanitise the terminal. DIAL will continue its awareness drive by educating and encouraging passengers to wear face masks and maintain social distance while at the airport,” he added. After resumption of flight operations on October 1, 2020, commercial operations of domestic flights were suspended again at T2 on May 18, 2021, following a significant drop in domestic air traffic. The decision to resume T2 operations has been taken after Delhi Airport started witnessing gradual growth in passenger footfall post relaxation in lockdown and travel norms by various states since June. TOI had earlier reported how flight operations at T2 could resume as early as the end of this month. In a recent survey carried out by the airport on passenger experience, around 99% flyers said they felt confident of flying through the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/t2-reopening-on-july-22-confirms-dial/articleshow/84510718.cms||---
---||Kolkata||With kids away, 3rd wave fear & travel curbs take a toll on elderly parents’ mental health||Kolkata: Deteriorating mental health of senior citizens, whose children live abroad, is one of the biggest collateral damages of Covid-19. The uncertainty of never being able to physically reunite with their children because of the current travel restrictions, the tension of the impending third wave, fear of not being fit enough to travel abroad ever again, are taking a huge toll on them. A 69-year-old lady had to be hospitalized recently over the uncertainty of meeting her son, who had got married in Europe during the pandemic in her absence. “She stopped interacting with anyone and reached a stage of complete mutism,” said psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram. “I don’t fear death but with both my children abroad, I worry about who will perform my last rites and look after my ageing family members,” said 73-year-old Arun Datta, who has various co-morbidities. Psychologist Anuttama Banerjee is noticing a sense of “letting go” among some parents. “On the one hand, they are terribly missing their children. On the other hand, some are relieved that the children are in a safer place and don’t want them to return,” she said. Untimely deaths of young adults could be a reason. “For parents, it doesn’t matter if they get the best of treatment. But their children should not suffer,” she added. Till 2018, epidemiologist Parnali Dhar Chowdhury of Johns Hopkins University used to visit her parents in Kolkata twice a year. “It’s been three years since I went over. My parents were hospitalized during the first wave. My in-laws too were positive. While I was involved in Covid research, my family was not getting my support back home,” she said from Washington DC. The anxiety is more now that she is expecting a baby in September. “It is depressing that my parents can’t come due to travel restrictions,” she added. Massachusetts-based Debasish Dutta Roy couldn’t come to Kolkata when his mother had Covid. “I’ve never felt so helpless in my 19 years stay in the US,” he said. Louisiana-based Aparajita Dutta returned home this April to be with her parents. “I spent sleepless nights with guilt of not providing the same privilege to family that I was getting in the US. Ailing parents with children in abroad need an organized set-up to help them,”she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-kids-away-3rd-wave-fear-travel-curbs-take-a-toll-on-elderly-parents-mental-health/articleshow/84510678.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The members of the two associations staged a demonstration opposite the head post office in Thanjavur. CPM MP M Chinnadurai of Gandhavarkottai constituency in Pudukkottal led the demonstration.Chinnadurai, state secretary of Akila Indhiya Vivasaya Thozhilalargal Sangam, called the Union government anti-people and anti-agrarian. “The Union government is planning to give a conditional nod to construct the Mekedatu dam. The project will put 25 lakh acres of cultivable area, dependant farmers and agricultural labourers in jeopardy. We openly accuse the Centre of attempting to destroy agriculture, farmers and agricultural labourers.”Stating that the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar river linkage will benefit Tamil Nadu farmers, Chinnadurai said that the government was attempting to destroy the water resources in the state instead of implementing the linkage. He also asked the people of Tamil Nadu to join hands in protest against the proposed move to construct Mekedatu dam.The members of the two associations also held the demonstrations in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Mayiladuthurai, Karur, Pudukottai, Ariyalur and Trichy. Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam general secretary P Shanmugam who participated in the demonstration in Thanjavur demanded the appointment of a permanent chairman for the Cauvery water management authority (CWMA).“The Union government had no authority to give a nod to construct the dam at Mekedatu but the CWMA has all the right over Cauvery river issue as per the final verdict of the Supreme Court. Instead of directing the Karnataka government to move the CWMA over the Mekedatu issue, the Centre interfered. We strongly condemn the move,” he said, asking M K Stalin to insist on appointing permanent chairman to CWMA during his visit to Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/centre-plans-to-give-conditional-nod-for-mekedatu-dam/articleshow/84512680.cms||---

The state government is yet to act on the proposal for relaxation in activities and increase in timings. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and collector Vimala R issued orders for city and rural areas, respectively, on Saturday. The existing restrictions and timings will continue now till July 25. Citing the reduced weekly TPR, occupancy of oxygenated beds and active cases, the district disaster management authority (DDMA) had on July 9 sent a letter to the government requesting to allow few more activities and increase in timings from existing 4pm to 8-10 pm in the district. Officials from the collector office and NMC told TOI that government approval is needed for relaxations from Level-3. The government had made mandatory for all districts to follow restrictions of Level-3 even if weekly TPR is below 5% from June 28. Weekly TPR of the district is below 5% since May last week. It was 0.41% when the district adopted restrictions of level-3 in the last week of June. The TPR further dropped to 0.38% and 0.31% in July first and second week, respectively. Dipen Agrawal, president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), said, “Restrictions amid less cases have increased corruption. The system of restrictions as per levels was ideal. Along with commercial establishments, people as well as the government are facing huge loss due to unwarranted restrictions. It is time the government conducted a proper study and opened economic activities as per caseload.” Essential shops will continue to run up to 4pm on all days. Non-essential shops, restaurants etc will function up to 4pm on weekdays and close on weekend. In the order, the collector committed a mistake by mentioning closure of schools despite 141 schools resuming from July 15 after orders of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/positivity-rate-down-curbs-to-continue-for-4th-week/articleshow/84510662.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The woman, Sonal Gadhvi, has two children. Her father Girishdan Gadhvi is a cop too; he is assistant sub-inspector at the Sabarmati East police station. Her last message to Gadhvi was: “I will die in such a way that even you will not be able to find me.” After Sonal went missing on Thursday, Gadhvi found a chit in which she said that she was going to commit suicide. Later that day at 1.53pm, Gadhvi received an audio message from her. “He is threatening to kill himself,” she says in the message, referring to her husband. “Let me show him by killing myself.” Since then her phone has been switched off. Cops found out that the last known location of her mobile phone was near the Dudhrej canal. “We deployed boats in the canal but there was no sign of her body,” a cop said. “We reached Dudhrej and called the fire bridge, but could not find the body,” Gadhvi said. In the audio message, Sonal says: “I have endured the mental torture so far, but now I cannot. He is threatening to commit suicide. I would prefer to die.” She adds: “I am sending this audio message as I am going to embrace death. I request you to take care of my son and daughter.” She even tells her family to stay strong and not to take the trouble of searching for her. “Sonal was married 14 years ago. Her husband is a police inspector,” Gadhvi said. “My daughter has been estranged from her husband and has been staying with me for the past two-and-a-half months.” Gadhvi said Sonal told him that her husband often threatened to commit suicide. “Recently too when she refused to go to her in-laws’ place, he said he would kill himself,” Gadhvi said. Sources close to the family said Sonal had told her brother in Australia that she might commit suicide by setting herself ablaze, taking poison, or drowning. Krishnanagar police inspector A J Chauhan said: “The father of the woman has given us an intimation that she is missing and we are searching for her.” He added: “The family has even carried out a search in Surendranagar but has failed to find her. We will register an offence if circumstances warrant it.” This is the second recent incident in Gujarat of a cop’s wife going missing. Sweety Patel, the wife of a cop posted in Karjan, had gone missing on June 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cop-threatens-suicide-wife-goes-missing/articleshow/84510716.cms||---

The ATS had got information about the sleeper cell after arrests done earlier in Delhi and other places. Investigating agencies are not ruling out funds from Pakistan’s ISI for this racket targeting economically-weak persons for conversion to another religion. An engineer, identified as Prasad Kaware, was among the three rounded-up in the city. Religious preacher Kausar Alam Shaukat Ali and Bhupriyobando Mankar, who is an ayurveda practitioner, were picked up from an apartment at Ganeshpeth. It’s learnt, the racketeers were planning to set up a ‘Dawa centre’ in the city on the lines of Delhi where the masterminds Umar Gautam and Mufti Qazi Jehangir were arrested. Sources stated Mankar, a resident of Gadchiroli, has already converted and rechristened ‘Assalam Mustafa’. It’s learnt Kaware too had converted some family members after coming in contact with the racket.

While East African countries have confirmed that the technique will be implemented there, other nations too are in talks with the institute. TOI was the first to report about the first-of-its-kind technique, which eliminates the need of collecting nasal and throat swabs. The cost-effective technique has been developed by Neeri scientist Krishna Khairnar who is also the head at environmental virology cell. While the technique has already been implemented by Nagpur Municipal Corporation, zilla parishad and four private laboratories in different cities, sources told TOI that it will now be adopted by different countries too. Haron Kebira, a scientist and consultant based in Kenya who works in coordination with the governments of East African region, told TOI that the saline gargle technology is being planned to be implemented in the region including Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Congo. “For now, testing kits will be sourced from the manufacturer based in India. The technology is very user-friendly and time-saving and will be very helpful for our citizens. It will save time as well as money,” he said. Adding further benefits, Kebira said, “No skilled workers are needed for this testing method. The collection of samples will also be a fast process and will reduce the long queues outside testing centres.” While other countries have not given any official confirmation yet, sources informed that Vietnam and Madagascar too are in talks with Neeri. “Being not only convenient but also affordable and fast, the technology can prove to be a game-changer across the world. Indian companies have already commercialized the technology and have scaled it up by manufacturing it at industrial level. Other nations can procure the testing kits from India,” said officials. They added that there might also be a possibility of technology transfer to stimulate country-specific manufacturing. “Neeri is providing the technology free-of-cost,” said officials. As reported by TOI, the technique is completely non-invasive which eliminates the need of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Further eliminating the need of expensive RNA extraction process, Neeri has developed a special buffer medium in which the collected sample is mixed for releasing viral RNA. The saline gargle sample collection kit is commercially available with Mumbai’s HiMedia Pvt Laboratories Ltd and Ahmedabad’s Meril Diagnostics. Recently, the RT-PCR test kit too got an approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). With this, the manufacturing of ‘one-step RNA extraction buffer’ is all set to begin by HiMedia Pvt Laboratories Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeris-gargling-for-rt-pcr-samples-set-to-go-global/articleshow/84510725.cms||Manka Behl

The move comes after an eight-member committee that was constituted by the forest department to study the health condition of the tusker submitting a favourable report on releasing the animal into the forest. Principal chief conservator of forest Shekar Kumar Niraj, who also holds the post of chief wildlife warden, had issued the order for the soft release of the tusker into the forest on Friday. The tusker had sustained a cut to its trunk in an unknown incident. According to L C S Srikanth, deputy director, MTR-buffer zone, the chief wildlife warden has specified a list of standard operating procedures for the release of Rivaldo. “The process is elaborate, as we have to identify a location within the buffer zone for the soft release of the tusker. It should be an enclosed location with solar energy hanging fencing. Huge cost is involved in developing such a location,” an official said. “At least a hectare of land is required for the soft release of the elephant.” Rivaldo would be radio collared before releasing it from the kraal. A meeting, which would be attended by forest secretary Supriya Sahu and the chief wildlife warden, would be held in Ooty on Monday to discuss the tusker’s release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tusker-rivaldo-to-be-released-into-forest-soon/articleshow/84510701.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||ED fails to find Deshmukh in Nagpur either||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) searched two premises of former home minister Anil Deshmukh in Nagpur district on Sunday but again failed to find him to record his statement in a money laundering case, reports Vijay V Singh. A manager of the Deshmukh family, Pankaj Deshmukh, was taken into custody by ED, which also collected documents and digital evidence from the raided places for examination in the case linked to the extortion investigation against him. P 5 ED insiders said officials acted on specific information and flew to Nagpur for the confidential operation but neither Deshmukh nor his family were found at his house in Katol or his ancestral home in Vadvihira, the two premises that were raided. Deshmukh is an NCP MLA from Katol, and many party politicians stood outside the raided premises there in a show of support. Similar NCP support was seen at his Vadvihira and Nagpur residences. So far, the ED has issued three summons to Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh, asking them to appear at its zonal office in south Mumbai for their statement in the case, but father and son have both kept citing various reasons to avoid making an appearance. The ED also issued summons last week to Deshmukh’s wife Aarti, who too skipped appearing before the ED officials citing health and old age reasons. Last week, in the first major action in the case, the ED attached Deshmukh’s assets, a flat in Worli here and land in Uran collectively worth Rs 4.2 crore, going by the purchase value. The Worli flat is worth Rs 1.54 crore and is in the name of Deshmukh’s wife. The 25 land parcels in Uran taluka of neighbouring Raigad district have a 2006 purchase price of Rs 2.67 crore and are in the name of Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd, a company in which Deshmukh’s two sons, Hrishikesh and Salil, have controlling stakes. Sources said the present market value of the Uran land parcels is over Rs 300 crore, although people close to the Deshmukh family said it is far lower than what is claimed by the ED insiders. The attached properties are not connected with the case. ED sources said that since they are yet to trace the money that Deshmukh allegedly collected from dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze through his personal staff, they have attached his other properties of similar worth according to their purchase value in the case, which is permitted under the PMLA. The ED is investigating a money laundering case against Deshmukh following allegations that he had asked Waze, who was then heading the CIU branch of the city police, to extort Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month. The ED investigation found Waze paid Rs 4.7 crore collected from bar owners to Deshumukh’s PA Kundan Shinde. Out of that money, Rs 4.18 crore was said to have been routed through a series of questionable transactions before it was shown as a donation to a trust controlled by Deshmukh in Nagpur. The ED is trying to trace the donation money.

The lawyer was driving to the college tribunal at Savitribai Phule Pune University when the road rage incident occurred. The police have booked the bicyclist on the charges of wrongful restraint, voluntarily causing grievous hurt and damaging car under sections 341, 323, 427, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code. Senior inspector Shankar Khatke of the Warje Malwadi police said on Saturday, “We have served a notice on the suspect working, a private firm’s employee, to join us in investigation because he was booked under bailable offences.” Recalling the incident, lawyer Anant Sakunde from Baramati told TOI, “My assistant and I had started from Nanded City on Sinhagad Road in a car for going to the tribunal to attend a case. I reached Chandni Chowk and switched on the indicator while taking the left turn to the Pashan exit for reaching the university. A bicyclist coming from the rear hit the car on the left side and caused dent on the door. I stopped the car and sought an explanation from him for hitting the vehicle.” Sakunde said, “After I rolled down the window glass, the suspect caught hold of my neck. I could not react to the situation because I was wearing seatbelt. After I managed to free myself, I alighted from the car. The suspect immediately started hurling abuses and attacked me. He tore my shirt, snatched the car’s ignition key and refused to return it despite repeated requests. I told him that I had not done anything wrong, but he was in no mood to listen.” He said, “I told the cyclist to take my cellphone number and share his, so that we can talk later because I was in a hurry to reach the tribunal. But he continued to misbehave with me. He called his three friends and threatened to teach me a lesson. Even they advised him to settle the matter, but he refused. I lost my gold chain in the incident.” Sakunde said, “A police team reached the spot and asked us to visit the police station. I requested the suspect to tender an apology, but he refused. I then decided to register an FIR against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bicycle-rider-booked-on-charge-of-attacking-lawyer-in-road-rage-incident/articleshow/84510686.cms||---

The sight of bulldozers razing houses isn’t unusual to villagers there. However, around 4pm on Saturday, the sound of a heavy vehicle was accompanied with commotion. Singh rushed out of his makeshift tent, and saw people jostling with each other with buckets in hand. Bulldozers took a break in Khori on Saturday as demolitions were halted to make way for debris to be cleared. But a water tanker made its way to the village after repeated appeals from residents there. Their houses razed, many of the villagers are staying put in Khori for the debris to be cleared. While some of them are rummaging through the rubble to look for their belongings, others are selling the rods, bricks and other construction material to make some money. Although the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) has made arrangements for food and shelter on the campus of Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Surajkund — 1.5km away — many of the villagers aren’t willing to leave Khori because they are still searching for their belongings in the debris. The villagers have been asking for food and water to be provided to them in Khori itself, but the authorities feel it would encourage them to stay put in the village. After repeated appeals for drinking water, a tanker eventually arrived in Khori around 4pm on Saturday. Within minutes, the villagers had formed a disorderly queue for water. “Forget food, we don’t even have water to drink in this scorching heat. The tanker that came today could be arranged with much difficulty. The authorities can’t deprive us of the basic needs of food and water like this,” said Singh. For Vimlesh Sharma and a few others, going all the way to the Radha Soami campus for food and water isn’t an option. “The authorities have made announcements that we can go to Surajkund for food and shelter. But we have our belongings amid the rubble. How can we leave whatever is left for us to collect?” Sharma asked. On Saturday, 264 villagers had queued up to be registered for rehabilitation in EWS flats. The Supreme Court has ordered the demolition of 10,000 houses that have been built illegally on Aravali forest land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bulldozers-take-a-break-tanker-pacifies-villagers-to-some-extent/articleshow/84510785.cms||Vishakha Chaman

Bulldozers took a break in Khori on Saturday as demolitions were halted to make way for debris to be cleared. But a water tanker made its way to the village after repeated appeals from residents there. Their houses razed, many of the villagers are staying put in Khori for the debris to be cleared. While some of them are rummaging through the rubble to look for their belongings, others are selling the rods, bricks and other construction material to make some money. Although the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) has made arrangements for food and shelter on the campus of Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Surajkund — 1.5km away — many of the villagers aren’t willing to leave Khori because they are still searching for their belongings in the debris. The villagers have been asking for food and water to be provided to them in Khori itself, but the authorities feel it would encourage them to stay put in the village. After repeated appeals for drinking water, a tanker eventually arrived in Khori around 4pm on Saturday. Within minutes, the villagers had formed a disorderly queue for water. “Forget food, we don’t even have water to drink in this scorching heat. The tanker that came today could be arranged with much difficulty. The authorities can’t deprive us of the basic needs of food and water like this,” said Singh. For Vimlesh Sharma and a few others, going all the way to the Radha Soami campus for food and water isn’t an option. “The authorities have made announcements that we can go to Surajkund for food and shelter. But we have our belongings amid the rubble. How can we leave whatever is left for us to collect?” Sharma asked. On Saturday, 264 villagers had queued up to be registered for rehabilitation in EWS flats. The Supreme Court has ordered the demolition of 10,000 houses that have been built illegally on Aravali forest land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/bulldozers-take-a-break-tanker-pacifies-villagers-to-some-extent/articleshow/84516735.cms||Vishakha Chaman

K Vadivel, a umpire in the Tamil Nadu Karate Association, teaches the kids karate on alternate days. It is not just the 264 students of this school who benefit from these free extra curricular classes, but also their friends in their respective areas. Many parents send their wards to attend these classes as they benefit from it.Early morning yoga classes are a must for all the students as Saravanan says they are concerned by the lack of physical activity. “Outdoor activities are a must for mental well-being and we are trying to do something in this aspect,” he said.Teachers M Saranya, S Packialakshmi, P Geethha, Chitradevi, Venkatalakshmi, Premalatha, Sumathy and Usha Devi contribute to the cause with their efforts while the school meets the travelling expenditure of their trainers who offer their services free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/this-school-goes-the-extra-mile-to-keeps-its-students-fit/articleshow/84512730.cms||---
---||Trichy||Aadi fest sale ignites fear of Covid spread||Madurai: It was a free for all on Saturday as large crowds thronged the shops as many had announced Aadi discounts for the Tamil month. Covid safety norms were thrown to the wind even as the government had allowed shops to open by following standard operating procedures post the lockdown relaxations in the state.As Covid-19 cases are coming down in the district, people seem to have downed their precautions as many are seen without wearing masks and a lot many, including police personnel, are seen wearing their masks improperly. Enforcement is lacking as there is no monitoring.On Saturday, all the shops had put up advertisements for discount sales, and people started thronging the shops from early morning. Since it was a cloudy day, crowds were seen even during the afternoon. The shops do not maintain physical distance, fail to check the temperature of customers and also don’t provide sanitisers to them.V P Manikandan, a social activist, said that the government should take steps to ensure that the shops followed the SOPs, because it was during the Onam festival last year in Kerala that the Covid cases started increasing after the rush.Clubs such as Rotary Clubs, Lions clubs and other social clubs have also started having installation meetings with hundreds of people and they do not figure in the list of priorities in the lockdown specifics. This should be prevented at all costs, he said.“It is predicted that the country would see the third wave soon, maybe even in August, and if the shops and temples continue to allow crowds like they did on Saturday, we can expect it even earlier,” said S V Pathy, founder for the Centre for Environmental Services. He said the opening of temples and shops, especially Tasmac, was a big mistake. “We are giving 400 tokens and see 5,000 people queuing up outside the vaccination centres. The government should not allow shops to have more than 100 people a day, and those with crowds outside should be sealed,” he said.As bus services were started, people from other districts and villages were coming in large numbers to the city for shopping, adding to the concern, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/aadi-fest-sale-ignites-fear-of-covid-spread/articleshow/84512738.cms||---

This is what the Bhopal cinema association felt after the state government announced the unlocking of theatres. The association said that new movies are not available to screen. Cinema owners felt that the situation will be better only when Bollywood returns to normalcy as it comprises 37% collection business in the country. There are 38 screens in Bhopal including 9 singlexes. Bhopal cinema association said that in the absence of new movies they were not able to open the cinema theatres. “What to screen if we start functioning?” asked Deepak Simhal, president of Bhopal cinema association. Simhal said that the cinema owners who have been incurring huge losses can’t afford to open it in the absence of a new movie release. “There are almost 10-12 big-banner movies which are to be released. However, fear of corona third wave plays spoilsport. Owners can’t afford more losses by opening the theatres without any new release,” added Manager, Jyoti cinema theatre, Rakesh Narula said that they will not open theatres till the new release. “The crowd that comes to watch our theatre wants to see new movies. As there is no new movie to screen it is not possible to open the theatre,” said Narula. Asked about any plan to open a cinema with the library content, Narula said, “No ways. No one will come to see old content in our cinema.” However, few cinema theatres in Bhopal have decided to open their theatre. “We are opening our theatre from July 23. It is just to encourage the people who want to come to the cinema. After witnessing huge losses, it has become very important to start the business again,” said a senior official in Inox without quoting his name. About the content to be shown after the reopening of the cinema theatre, Inox officials said that they will start with the library content. “We are also planning to screen South movies. We want to encourage the people who wish to come to the cinema,” said the official. Secretary, Bhopal cinema association, Azizuddin said that absence of help from the state government has also discouraged the cinema owners. “We have been paying all taxes and rent for the past 18 months. How long will a cinema owner continue like this? State government should come forward to help the dying business in the state capital,” said Azizuddin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/unlock-fails-to-keep-the-show-going-for-cinemas-where-are-the-new-flicks/articleshow/84510733.cms||Ramendra Singh

The Pune Rural police sent the tourists back and also collected fines of over Rs 71,000 from 145 motorists attempting to visit the Khadakwasla dam, Sinhagad fort and Panshet dam sites.

The Paud police on Saturday told TOI, “We have taken action against more than 100 motorists attempting to visit Mulshi dam, Tamhini ghat and other picturesque points in Paud-Amby Valley-Tamhini areas. There was a continuous traffic jam on Paud-Mulshi Road till Saturday evening.” The police urged the citizens to follow rules and directions of the district administration and refrain from visiting these tourists spots. Inspector Dilip Pawar of Lonavla (City) police said, “A majority of the motorists from Pune and Mumbai were sent back from Lonavla city where a nakabandi operation was carried out. We also fined 25 motorists in Lonavla.” On Saturday, the Ghodegaon and Junnar police stations blocked the roads leading towards Bhimashankar and Dimbhe dam.

TJS founder-president M Kodandaram demanded that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao immediately stop auctioning of government lands and keep the land parcels for future public purposes. “The TRShas further set a target of raising Rs 50,000 crore through auction of its lands. This has to stop,” he said on Saturday. He also found fault with the CM for taking the excuse that the government was not able to protect its land from encroachments as a result of which it was auctioning the land parcels. “How can the CM even talk like this. If the government cannot protect its own lands from land sharks, how will it protect the lives and properties of the people,” he wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tjs-to-launch-protest-against-land-auctions/articleshow/84510826.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An official said the constable had committed a violation against the Tamil Police Conduct Rules 1964 under sections 24 (1) and 24 (2).

---||Kochi||Kerala: Kunnathunad MLA P V Sreenijin behind series of checks, says Kitex||KOCHI: Kitex Group has released documents alleging that Kunnathunad MLA P V Sreenijin was behind the series of sudden inspections at Kitex Garments Ltd, which prompted the group to abandon its Rs 3,500 crore investment plans in Kerala and move to other states starting with Rs 1,000 crore investments in Telangana. “Evidence is emerging that it was the local MLA who put pressure on officials from the health and labour departments for inspections. According to a report sent by the medical officer of Malayadamthuruthu community health centre to the district medical officer on May 10, the inspection was conducted on the basis of a voice clip sent by Sreenijin. The report of the general manager of the district industries centre also shows that the first inspection was carried out on the instructions of the MLA,” the press statement said. The Kitex Group also circulated electronic copies of these reports to the media. “The MLA had put pressure on officials by spreading a fake voice message claiming to be a woman employee of Kitex. These incidents show that it was the MLA who had filed the complaint in the high court. The MLA himself called officials on phone several times and pressed them to file a report against Kitex,” the group alleged in its press statement. “It is as clear as day that the CPM and a former Congress MLA have joined hands with four other Congress MLAs in the district for this move. The report of the general manager of the industrial centre states that the investigation report of the factories and boilers, responsible for inspecting the operations of the factories, indicates that no violation is taking place at Kitex. The pollution control board’s inspection report also states that everything is done legally at Kitex,” the statement from Kitex said. When contacted, Sreenijin refuted the allegations and said: “The government had asked all the MLAs to lead the Covid fight in their respective constituencies and I had directed the health officials in my area too. That was a general statement I had given. Regarding the complaint to the high court, I have to clarify that I have no part in that”. Sreenijin added that he was not against Kitex Garments. “The government’s policy is to support the industries in a lawful manner. If Kitex approaches me, I will help them within my means,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kunnathunad-mla-behind-series-of-checks-says-kitex/articleshow/84509011.cms||Shenoy Karun

---||Delhi||Khori villagers in Faridabad move SC for rehabilitation for all||NEW DELHI: Facing demolition of their unauthorised homes built over Aravali forest in Faridabad, the residents of Khori Village have approached Supreme Court seeking its direction for rehabilitation of all of them and challenged the Haryana government policy as per which only those who had been occupying the land prior to 2003 would be rehabilitated. Invoking their right to adequate shelter, Priwasee Sangthan Welfare Society moved SC through advocate Mohit Paul and contended that the denial of a proper rehabilitation of the inhabitants of Khori Gaon will render them homeless in this pandemic and sought court’s interference. “Right to housing has been regarded as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Even the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna-Urban does not provide any cut-off date for rehabilitation. The said rehabilitation scheme is open. The purpose of state policies should be to implement the right to housing and not to limit it to the extent that it is rendered meaningless. If the state of Haryana does not re-open the rehabilitation scheme then thousands of residents of Khori Gaon will be rendered homeless and will not be entitled to any benefits under the scheme,” the petition said. The Haryana government’s rehabilitation policy, framed pursuant to the SC order of February 19, 2020, provided for rehabilitation of those who had been living in the unauthorised village before 2003. The present lot facing the demolition of houses in Khori village settled there after 2010. Pleading for court’s sympathetic intervention, the petitioner said that the majority of the residents of Khori Gaon colony are employed in the unorganised sector, did not receive formal education, and thus lack the awareness and resources required to maintain proper documentation, especially dating back prior to 2004. “It’s to be submitted that access to adequate housing can be a precondition for the enjoyment of several human rights, including the rights to work, health, social security, vote, privacy, or education. The possibility of earning a living can be seriously impaired when a person has been relocated following a forced eviction to a place removed from employment opportunities. Without proof of residency, homeless persons may not be able to enjoy social services or receive health care,” the petition said. “It is the responsibility of the courts to reduce inequalities and social imbalances by striking down statutes that perpetuate them. The right to live and the right to work are integrated and inter-dependent and, therefore, if a person is deprived of his job as a result of his eviction from a slum or a pavement, his very right to life is put in jeopardy. The denial of a proper rehabilitation is going to be deterrent to the interest of the inhabitants of Khori Gaon who will be rendered homeless in this pandemic,” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/khori-villagers-in-fbd-move-sc-for-rehabilitation-for-all/articleshow/84510856.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Tourists missing, Khajuraho turns into destination wedding site||BHOPAL: With hardly any tourists visiting Khajuraho in the last 16 months, the world heritage site is now trying to position itself as an emerging destination wedding site in Madhya Pradesh. Over 50 weddings were celebrated this year in Khajuraho after gradual unlocking, post second deadly wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Intimate weddings attended by 50 people with two -night stay in a five star hotel in Khajuraho costs around Rs 8 to Rs 10 lakh. This includes all the essential requirements of hosting a traditional ceremony and meals. This new avenue of earning has given some respite to the hotel industry in Khajuraho after the foreign tourists stopped visiting the popular international destination after the outbreak of coronavirus in March last year. Many families from Madhya Pradesh, UP and Maharashtra have organised weddings and other celebrations in Khajuraho since June first week when MP unlocked after the second wave subsided. Ritesh Shrivastata from Banda, who was a part of one such wedding, said, “Wedding celebrations in a luxury hotel made the occasion memorable. We were just 50 guests, but all of us enjoyed a lot. I think we got true value for money.” In the last 16 months, hotel industry has faced a deep crisis due to massive drop in the tourist footfall in Khajuraho. Hundreds of jobs were lost with 60%-70% retrenchment of staff in all the hotels, including five 5-star hotels and several of 3 -4 star luxury units in Khajuraho, many of them also faced a threat of shut down. Hotel industry was already facing a slowdown in last few years, reducing the number of foreign tourists. Connectivity issues of Khajuraho also led to a situation wherein international tour operators started dropping the destination from their itinerary, the industry sources said. “Pandemic further deteriorated the situation”, said Ashok Goutam, president of Hotel owners’ association in Khajuraho. “Destination weddings have helped us but that is not enough. There is a cut-throat competition among the hoteliers and a five-star hotel room is available for Rs 3000 to Rs 4000 for weddings,” said Goutam, adding, “there are number of recurring expenses including electricity bills and upkeep of the hotel, which add to the financial burden of hoteliers.” Sachin Tamrakar, a photographer who sees a new business opportunity now, said, “Government can help in developing Khajuraho further as wedding destination, so that more people can earn a livelihood in these tough times.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/tourists-missing-khajuraho-turns-into-destination-wedding-site/articleshow/84510857.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

---||Nagpur||CBSE seeks vaccination data from schools||NAGPUR: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has directed all affiliated schools to furnish details about vaccination status of all staff members. The board has given schools till July 22 to submit this data online as part of an exercise called “vaccination information system of school”. The circular issued on Friday by board secretary Anurag Tripathi clearly states that CBSE has been urging schools to encourage vaccination among staff members. “In continuation with the efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19, the government has laid emphasis on vaccination of prioritized groups, including teaching and non-teaching staff in schools,” reads the circular. Tripathi added that the CBSE through various circulars and activities, has brought to notice various initiatives of the government to the school heads and has encouraged that these may be brought to notice of all teachers, students and staff members of the school, including dissemination of message regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour campaign ‘Jan Andolan’. CBSE now seems keen to take immediate stock of the situation as it has given schools only till Thursday to fill in the details online. A special tab has been created on the website regarding vaccination details. Schools then have to login using their registered ID and password and fill in the details. Schools have to categorize their staff members into three categories. It will start with staff that are fully vaccinated, then those who have taken only the first dose and ends with those who have not taken the first dose. Many academics speculate that CBSE is collecting the data also to be able to formulate future SOPs and even plan on conducting physical exams. Though CBSE’s circular makes no mention of the intended use, other than simply having information on vaccinated staff, a senior principal said a policy on safe conduct of exams and physical classes may contain clause on vaccination. “It’s possible that fully vaccinated teachers shall have priority over other staff for various things. It could almost be like a ‘vaccine passport’ where only these teachers are allowed back on campus, which means they get higher salary etc,” said the principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-seeks-vaccination-data-from-schools/articleshow/84510859.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Nagpur||Cycling in Melghat, treating tribals, life lessons and other stories||By Dhananjay BokareA group of 7 decide to pursue their passion and profession. The result is rejuvenating for all. The cyclists are made aware of every dormant sinew and also the poor health conditions of the tribals in the remote region of breath-taking MelghatI pedal my way laboriously, my heart galloping faster than the wild horses in any western movie and me cursing my foolish mind to take this trip, as I climb, actually crawl my way (if at all it’s possible to do so on a cycle; I take the credit for being the first to do so) on the serpentine, winding road climbing up to Kokaru (MP) from the picturesque Ghatang village in Maharashtra’s Melghat region.I hate the very moment when I agreed with my friends to take on this cycling trip. My body is drenched with sweat in the hot and humid climate at three in the afternoon of July 8. My leg is beginning to give me signals of its dissent by sending few sharp cramps from my calf to my knee and hip and I’m all ready to give up when suddenly the road takes a sharp blind curve and it is the moment when magic happens.A chilly blast of wind hits me head on and brings with it a panorama I can never forget… we are at a height, flanked by lush green valleys on both sides and a misty mass of fog and clouds climbing in a hurry towards the road to welcome us to the magical land that is Melghat.All the fatigue is gone in a flash and is replaced by a feeling of belonging to this surreal dreamland. The heart winning over the head, mocking at it in the ‘ I told you so’ way. I’m blessed to experience this. 84509004It has been our passion to go on cycling trips to places far and near and when the opportunity came to plan a trip to Melghat we jumped at it. Shailesh and Ramya Nisal, Kiran and Anupama Belsare, Rajesh and Ritika Singhvi and myself, started from Nagpur on the morning of July 8 and reached Paratwada (approximately 200km). We were warmly welcomed by Chotubhau Varangaonkar and his family. From Paratwada, we proceded to Ghatang where our cycles had already reached. After a wholesome lunch provided by Aarti Amte, we were ready to cycle with Anupama backing us in the support vehicle throughout the trip.However, nothing had prepared us for the short but extreme climb to Kokaru. Believing that well begun is half done we were not to be shaken so easily. The moment of magic changed everything and soon we were atop the mountain, savouring the most delicious rabdi Melghat is so famous for. Our bodies and minds rejuvenated; we cycled the rest of the way to the picturesque Kokaru forest rest house. Set up on the hill, this place offers a great view of the valley all around and it takes no time to get lost in this enchanting world. Having settled and changed into more comfortable clothing, we set out to explore the surrounding area. Not paying heed to the warning ‘beware of bears’, we made our way towards a high view point only to be greeted by a heavy shower and strong winds. Soaked to the bones and shivering, we made our way back to the rest house. Apart from disrupting the power supply, the rains also washed away our plans of sleeping out in the open. Not to be thwarted, we put out our tents, albeit in the veranda and made the most of it. Friday morning (July 9) brought a clear sky and a fresh start. Well rested, we were ready to move to our next destination, Katkumbh, back in Maharashtra, where a medical camp for locals residents was already planned. The ride promised to be either downhill or flat but what was not expected was that much of the road was under construction, making cycling very demanding. As soon as one gets down from Kokaru towards Khamala, one is treated to the awe-inspiring sight of the windmills. Rising up in the sky, the huge windmills with their unimaginably long blades are a sight one can never forget. We were not sure whether their constant humming sound was an invitation or warning for us to not enter their kingdom, but we chose to believe that they were welcoming us with their baritones and pedalled on. Almost 70 windmills, spread all over, as far as your eyes can reach, are a proof of man’s endeavours to harness the power of nature. But at the same time a reminder of how miniscule we are before the endless energy of nature. Can we really put reins on it?At Katkumbh, we were accorded a very warm welcome by the PHC staff led by enthusiastic Dr Swati and her colleagues. Soon the arena was set and we were off to do what we like as much as cycling…our medical profession. The plight of people living in these remote areas with bare minimum health care support makes you aware of the privileges we take for granted in our day-to-day life. From common ailments to advanced cancer, there were about 200 people waiting patiently for their turn to be seen and given basic treatment by the ‘sheherwale’ doctors. We were also joined by Dr Kavita Satav, who, with her husband Aashish, has been doing outstanding medical work in these forest areas for the last so many years. Only now, could we understand the challenges they must be facing in their task of providing quality healthcare to th most needy tribals.After a little rest in the afternoon, we set out again for a trek to a nearby hill. Going uphill was like doing ten treadmill tests at a time. But the view from the top was truly amazing, not to forget the added assurance of a healthy heart as a bonus. At night, we could sleep out in the open in our tent, thus ticking one more item on the ‘to do list’. On Saturday, July 10, we were set to travel from Katkumbh to Chunkhadi, one of the most remote areas of Melghat. The day started with a hearty breakfast at Rakesh Rathore, our local coordinator’s house. The ride took us through the jungles of Melghat with almost non-existent roads. Pedalling on the gravelled, stony roads does have an advantage of whole-body massage but only for some time, after which it becomes a torture.Somehow, we managed to reach Chunakhadi. This is a small village inhabited by the tribals, most of whom speak only the local language ‘Korku’. Listening to their problems, translated by the staff of PHC, we managed to give some medical advice to about 50 patients. By this time, the challenges of travelling through these remote forest areas were getting to us. Having given up on the ‘luxuries’ of mobile network and internet, now with lack of basic urban needs like water, electricity, toilets and beds to sleep on, our bravado had begun to ebb. The fact that the road we were to cycle to Semadoh next day was something which would make the previously travelled roads seem like an expressway. We decided that it was prudent to call off the last leg of our plan and turn back.Luckily, our friend Parikshit Janai had travelled all the way from Nagpur on the same morning, just to do drone shooting of our rides and his car was available to take us back along with Anupama’s car. Having finished our work and relished the simple but most awesome lunch brought by Kavita, we bid farewell to the locals and the coordinators and drove back to the comfort of our houses in Nagpur.This trip presented many challenges but that was by our choice. When we look at the challenges faced by the tribals and rural people from these remote areas each and every day and still see the peace and content with which they live their life, it surely raises a lot of questions about what we are and what we seek. That was our big life lesson from these three unforgettable days.(The writer is a urologist, andrologist and transplant surgeon)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cycling-in-melghat-treating-tribals-life-lessons-and-other-stories/articleshow/84509005.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 200 illegal shops demolished along Belgharia E-way||KOLKATA: The Barrackpore police commissionerate has launched an eviction drive to remove encroachers along Belgharia Expressway to widen the road as the Belgharia Expressway and Kalyani Expressway will be connected with an elevated corridor soon. Police used a JCB excavator to demolish the illegal shops on both flanks of the expressway at Nimta, Baranagar, Belgharia, Durganagar, Dum Dum and North Dum Dum civic areas. Around 200 illegal shops on the 1.3 km stretch have been already demolished, police said. The state government decided to connect both the expressways with an elevated corridor as that would reduce the journey by a few kilometres for those who want to take Kalyani Expressway directly from Belgharia. The 40-km-long Kalyani Expressway that starts from Nimta in North 24 Parganas connects the city with Kalyani in Nadia district. Heavy vehicles from Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah could easily avail the by-pass route to take the Kalyani Expressway. Taking the 8km Belgharia Expressway from Dakshineswar is the shortest route to the airport if one comes from Baranagar, Belgharia or from adjoining districts, including Howrah and Hooghly. Vehicles for north Bengal which pass through Belgharia Expressway could also take the elevated corridor to reach Kalyani Expressway. A temporary police camp has been set up at Nimta to supervise the drive. A large police contingent from police stations, including Dum Dum, Nimta and Baranagar led by Ajoy Prasad, DCP, South zone, Barrackpore commissionerate were deployed. “State highway development authority had issued a notice 10 days ago to remove shops from the stretch. Some shop owners had removed their temporary shops. Many had to be demolished to clear the 1.3 km expressway stretch as it would be connected with Kalyani Expressway,” Ajoy Prasad, DCP, South Zone, Barrackpore commissionerate, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/200-illegal-shops-demolished-along-belgharia-e-way/articleshow/84510892.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

With 425 people getting discharged, the number of active cases fell to 3,100. The district recorded two deaths due to the virus, taking the toll beyond the 800-mark to 801. The total number of people cured rose to 2,21,419, taking the recovery rate to 97.6%. The move by the district administration to release the list of vaccination camps only at 8am instead of 9.30pm the previous day, seems to be working in terms of eliminating confusion. It has also eliminated scenes of people waiting and sleeping in queues from 10pm and 2am, often getting drenched in the monsoon rain.A brisk queue formed at Vellakinar Corporation Primary School on Saturday at 9.20am and corporation officials began distributing tokens at 10am. They announced the token numbers, calling forward people in the queue. They distributed all the 350 tokens within 15 minutes. The people, who missed out, went home quietly without any complaints.“While I feel I missed out on a token, I hardly waited for one-and-a-half hours, which was better than waiting for seven hours,” said one Balamurugan. “The open mic system is also to be praised because I know that each of the 350 tokens was given to a person in the queue. So, I don’t feel bad or cheated.”On Friday, TOI found people waiting from 8.30am at Dhaliyur Government School for vaccination. Though token distribution was delayed till noon, there were no complaints. “Distribution was by and large peaceful,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/active-covid-cases-fall-to-3100-in-dist/articleshow/84510889.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Forest department books farmers||IDUKKI: Following instructions from the forest department, range officers have begun registering cases against farmers for illegally felling trees in assigned lands in the district. In a notice issued a few days ago, Neriamangalam range officer in charge Arun Maharaja had sought an explanation from deputy range forest officers of Valara, Nagarampara and Injathotty forest stations within two days on their failure to register cases against the farmers despite sending them a directive in this regard. On Friday, Munnar DFO sent a letter, (accessed by TOI), to Adimali, Neryamanagalam and Devikulam range officers to book the farmers. According to forest department sources officials have started booking farmers in in Neriamangalam and Adimali. “The senior officials directed their subordinates to book the farmers to save the government’s face in the tree-felling issue,” said a department official. High Range Samrakshana Samithy general convener Fr Sebastian Kochupurakal said senior officials of the forest department are threatening subordinates to register fake cases against the farmers. “The government should look into the matter seriously and take strict action against such officials. If the forest department has registered fake cases against the farmers we will launch public protests,” he said, adding that the Samithy will provide all possible legal assistance to the farmers who illegally register cases against them. It was a week ago that divisional forest officers (DFO) issued an order the directing range officers to register the cases against the farmers. However, no cases were filed and the DFOs sent another letter to the range officers who sought an explanation from deputy range officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/forest-department-books-farmers/articleshow/84510917.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Coimbatore||Poor condition of roads makes life miserable here||Coimbatore: It has been five months since former municipal administration minister S P Velumani laid foundation stone to commence road laying work at Cheran Managar, Kumudham Nagar and surrounding areas. But the city corporation stopped the work after laying wet mix, which is causing inconvenience to the public. The Tamil Nadu water and drainage (TWAD) board had dug up the road to lay drinking water pipelines and to provide household water connections a year ago. Once the pipeline laying work was completed, the workers closed the holes using debris instead of restoring them properly, said N R Ravisankar, a resident and president of the Consumer Awareness and Protection Association. “The civic body started the relaying work after residents submitted petitions. Shortly after the work was commenced, announcement regarding the state assembly election was made and the work was stopped. After submitting petitions, works resumed in April and it was stopped after laying wet mix by May end,” Ravisankar said. “I petitioned chief minister M K Stalin recently, requesting him to direct the corporation to finish the work at the earliest.” Several internal roads are in a bad shape, said Balakrishnan, a shopkeeper. “Whenever vehicles pass, dust spreads from the road. We are forced to clean the shop several times a day. Gravel makes the road prone to skidding and is posing danger to motorists and pedestrians. The road turns slushy on rainy days.” Not just the internal roads, the Valankurichi main road is also riddled with potholes, said Mahalakshmi, a commuter. “The corporation should relay the main road also,” she said. A corporation official told TOI that the work was delayed due to the pandemic situation, and it will resume at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/poor-condition-of-roads-makes-life-miserable-here/articleshow/84510886.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Chennai||Orphaned at 7, raised by labourer grandma, Tamil Nadu’s Revathi Veeramani will sprint for nation in Tokyo Olympics||CHENNAI: “I went blank for some time and my entire journey flashed before my eyes,” said an emotional Revathi Veeramani about the moment when her name was confirmed for the Tokyo Olympics. It’s been quite a journey for the 23-year-old Tamil Nadu sprinter, an orphan brought up by a daily-wage worker who couldn’t even afford a pair of running shoes. Revathi, part of the 4X400m Indian mixed relay team, lost both her parents by the time she turned seven and was brought up by her grandmother Arammal, who worked as a daily wager. As a teenager, Revathi used to barefoot. Her life may well have remained less than ordinary but for the keen eye of K Kannan, coach at Madurai centre of the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu. Kannan saw Revathi in action at the MGR Race Course Stadium in Madurai in 2014-15. She didn’t win the event but the coach spotted a spark in the then 17-year-old. “I saw this young girl running barefoot and was impressed by her strides. I found out where she lived and decided to go and meet her. Revathi’s grandmother politely declined my offer of coaching her as she felt it would be expensive. They came from a poor family and were reluctant to pursue the sport full-time,” Kannan recalled. “I couldn’t afford the bus expenses of about Rs 40 from my home to the training centre but Kannan sir was persistent,” Revathi said. Multiple attempts from Kannan finally saw Revathi’s grandmother give in. Not only did Kannan coach Revathi without charging a fee, he also helped her get free admission at Lady Doak College, Madurai. The first biggest challenge for Revathi was to run with shoes. “Even though Kannan sir got me shoes, I was comfortable running barefoot. Over a period of time, I learned to run with shoes,” Revathi said. Her breakthrough moment arrived in 2016 when she won gold medals in 100m, 200m and 4X100m relay at the junior Nationals in Coimbatore. “That performance made me realise that Revathi was meant for bigger things,” said Kannan. Revathi was coached by Kannan till 2019 before she shifted base to Patiala to be part of the national camp. While she primarily ran in the 100m and 200m events at the initial phase of her career, Revathi became a quarter-miler thanks to Galina Bukharina, India’s 400m coach. In 2019, Revathi won the women’s 400m events in Indian Grand Prix 5 and 6 clocking 54.44 and 53.63 seconds respectively. A knee injury kept her out of action during the first part of the current season but Revathi made a comeback to win the 400m event at the Indian Grand Prix 4 last month. The final trial to select the 4x400m relay event saw Revathi finish on top with a timing of 53.55 seconds. The trip to Tokyo also means the talk of Revathi’s marriage goes into the backburner for now. “My grandmother had plans of getting me married but thanks to the Olympics, she has changed her mind and wants me to continue what I am doing,” said Revathi, who is employed as a ticket collector with the Southern Railways in Madurai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/orphaned-at-7-raised-by-labourer-grandma-tns-revathi-will-sprint-for-nation-in-tokyo/articleshow/84510877.cms||Prasad RS

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Cops help Maoists’ kin get Aadhaar, PAN and caste cert in Gadchiroli||NAGPUR: Gadchiroli police may have zero tolerance towards Maoist violence, but there is no discriminatory approach when it comes to extending helping hand to families of the rebels and also their supporters while playing the role of facilitators in various government schemes. As per central government’s guidelines, police stations in remote parts of the Maoist-infested district are doubling up as ‘growth centres’ which ensure government schemes reach the remotest residents of tribal hamlets where other agencies fail to do so due to security reasons and tough accessibility. Furthering the agenda, police have taken into their fold kin of the Maoists and their supporters including village-level workers and actively trying to reach out benefits of different government schemes and also cash entitlements in the poverty-stricken tribals. Gadchiroli police, by launching ‘one-window scheme’ known as ‘dadalora khidki’ in local parlance, are helping the tribal population get the benefits of government schemes. The cops have also floated ‘project pragati’ for helping the tribals and others to get their caste certificates. They have also launched ‘project vikas’ under which villagers are enrolled under various government schemes like Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana to receive cash entitlements. The cops are also engaged in vocational training for skill development and arranging employment. They are also helping farmers in getting quality seeds and saplings at 50% discounted rate, apart from enrolling them under personal accident insurance policy. Under the guidance of superintendent of police Ankit Goyal, the cops had helped 16,231 people which included 250 for caste certificates, 2,166 farmers getting seeds and saplings at 50% rebate and 11,562 register for Aadhaar, PAN, Ayushman Bharat card and other documents in June this year. DIG, Naxal Range, Sandip Patil, said the monsoon break in aggressive operations was utilized to reach the benefits to the people. “Families of Maoist cadres and their supporters were not left out. Firstly, we could prove them what the government is doing for them and what the rebels do. Secondly, we did not want to discriminate despite they being kin of the Maoists, who indulge in violence,” said Patil. The DIG added that the police have helped many tribals get their caste certificate and Aadhaar card, which are crucial for availing benefits of any government scheme. Goyal said the cops help the villagers during patrolling and also by setting up camps at police stations in the presence of officials from other government departments so that all documentation for Aadhaar or PAN etc is done at one place. “The running from pillar to post is done by the cops to ensure that the documents of the tribal are handed over to them at their doorsteps.

The society, however, obtained a stay on the order from the high court after about a week the memo was issued and has been allowed to continue the construction on the land excluding the area under dispute. The corporation issued the memo on April 29 based on a complaint filed by Saleesh K S, a resident of Vyttila. According to the complaint, the society tampered with revenue records to convert it into dry land before applying for a building permit and getting the corporation’s approval. Saleesh said that 3.27 ares out of the 33.90 ares where the 12,961 square metre building is being constructed is wetland. “Based on the complaint, corporation authorities conducted an inspection and found out that the 3.27 ares come under the wetland category. The society authorities secured the building permit from the corporation and started the construction hiding this fact,” said A R Padmadas, a councillor. At the same time, the office bearers of the society have lodged a complaint with Palarivattom police saying that Padmadas and Saleesh forged documents for getting a memo issued for stopping the construction work. They have alleged in their complaint that the duo had tried to blackmail the society for financial benefits. Palarivattom police have registered an FIR based on the complaint. “We have received another complaint from the corporation councillor against the society. We are looking into both the complaints,” a police officer said. The society officials claimed that the corporation issued the stop memo without hearing them. “The HC stayed the memo on May 7 and gave us permission to continue the construction on the land excluding the 3.27 ares. We purchased 84 cents (34.90 ares) in different survey numbers from the previous owner. There was an old building existing on the disputed area from where a parcel company used to function,” said an official with the society. But he agreed that the disputed area is wetland as per the basic tax register (BTR).  “Out of the 84 cents, 8 cents was shown as "Nilam" (wetland) in the BTR. But a building was already there when we purchased the plot in 2018. It is not included in the data bank notified under the Kerala Preservation of Paddy Lands and Wet Lands Act 2008. It is shown as garden land with road access in the fair value notification issued by the Government under the Stamp Act in 2010. Since a building already existed there, there was no difficulty in granting a building permit,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/wetland-norms-corporation-issues-stop-memo-to-building/articleshow/84509088.cms||---

He had called up a number of the pizza store that he came across on the Internet on Monday. The caller, Manish Goswami (59), found out that he had been duped only when the bank executive called on his number and asked if he had carried out any back-to-back online fund transfer. Goswami then filed a complaint.  “The scamster had added his number to contact details of Francesco’s Pizzeria online [who are unaware about the misuse]. We’ve sought details from the bank,” said an officer of Khar police station. In another case, Powai resident Pradeep Prabhakar (45) lost Rs 74,200 on July 14 while trying to place an online breakfast order for Rs 350.

Though Hakim was taken aback by the demonstration, later he gave a patient hearing to them. According to a hawker union leader, there were anomalies in distribution of stalls. “We strongly condemn the allocation of stalls for hawkers who need to vacate their space for construction of a skywalk,” the union leader said. According to an official, the delay in shifting hawkers could push back the project. The KMC top brass was hopeful of shifting hawkers from Kalighat by June. “Now we need to convince the hawkers to shift to the new stalls which are ready at Hazra Park. They will be given back their space at Kalighat once the skywalk project is over,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/firhad-faces-hawkers-protest/articleshow/84510918.cms||---

The role of tribals, villagers, NGOs and urban people living close to the forest and protecting wildlife is also a huge contributing factor.”The camera traps were initially placed to monitor elephant movement. The photos showed how much wildlife the 70,000-hectare area hosts and the extent it acts as a migratory path of elephants migrating between protected areas of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, added a statement from the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/camera-traps-unveil-western-ghats-thriving-biodiversity/articleshow/84510899.cms||---

Coming down heavily on both the AIADMK and the DMK, its members said the state government had always ignored the Kongu region, despite it brining the highest tax revenues. They said making the region a separate state would result in ease of administration and speed up development of businesses.Speaking to the media here on Saturday, its state general secretary K Devaraj said they had passed a resolution to bifurcate Kongu region from Tamil Nadu and form Kongu Nadu. “We have also placed our request before the Union and state governments. We will gather more support from other sections of people, organizations and parties and if required will protest and fight for it.”Justifying their move, Devaraj said both the previous and the incumbent governments hadn’t paid enough attention to Kongu region. “The region is the highest contributor of tax revenues to the state and the Centre. But Dravidian parties continue to side-line the region when it comes to development.”They also pitched for the appointment of a separate judge to handle all the petitions and cases related to the formation of a separate Kongu State (Kongu Nadu), citing the example of the judge appointed for NEET related issues. “We demand a separate judge and commission to consider everyone’s opinion. Becoming a separate state will aid ease of administration and faster development of businesses,” Devaraj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/call-for-kongu-nadu-gets-louder/articleshow/84510913.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||NGOs blame corpn for reducing water spread area of lakes in city||Coimbatore: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have accused the city corporation of reducing the water spread area of lakes in the name of smart city works. They have demanded the corporation to take necessary steps to increase the water spread area, instead of creating recreational spaces along the waterbodies.NGOs like Kovai Kulangal Padukaappu Amaipu, Siruthuli, Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore, CUBE, Arulagam and Osai have petitioned chief minister M K Stalin and other officials in this regard on Saturday.Pointing out that smart city projects were being carried out at seven city lakes, the petition said the civic body was developing infrastructures along them for about 19.03km by reducing water spread area by at least 20 acres.Speaking to TOI, R Manikandan, managing trustee, Kovai Kulangal Padukaapu Amaipu, said, “The corporation has evicted houses along the bunds of Valankulam, Muthanankulam and Selvampathy lakes based on a court order and retrieved about 39.14 acres land. If the civic body works to increase the water spread area in these lakes, we would be saving about 38 crore litres of water. But instead of restoring the waterbodies, the corporation has again encroached them by creating another infrastructure.” The petition said the corporation had not deepened Krishnampathy tank to augment its capacity, which should have been the primary objective of any tank restoration project. “Sewage water continues to flow into the tank and the quality of water is bad. The growth of typha angustata in the tank has not been removed.”In the case of Selvachinthamani tank, the petition said, the corporation should ideally have made efforts to plug the sewage inlets, but the same was not done. “The tank bund has been widened unnecessarily, reducing its storage capacity. Similarly, water storage capacity of all the other tanks has also been reduced by the corporation in the name of smart city works.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ngos-blame-corpn-for-reducing-water-spread-area-of-lakes-in-city/articleshow/84510903.cms||Nivedha Selvam

This year’s event also coincided with ‘gaja pooja’, which is held every four years at the temple. Unlike previous years, the event was held with limited participation of elephants, and the public due to Covid restrictions. Usually, about 80 elephants from across the state used to participate in the event. However, this time only 15 elephants took part. Similarly, the event used to attract hundreds of people, while this time the participation was restricted to about 50 office-bearers of the organizing committee and media personnel. The rituals associated with the programme started with ‘Ganapati homa’. Priest Tantri Puliyannoor Sankaranarayanan Namboodirippad performed ‘gaja pooja’, before the start of the feeding of elephants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/scaled-down-anayoottu-held-at-vadakkunnathan-temple/articleshow/84510987.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra cuts open spaces in Andheri (east) by 90%||MUMBAI: In a blow to Mumbaikars, the state urban development department has quietly reduced the quantum of open space that will be available to the public. The department recently approved an ‘excluded plan’ of the Development Control and Promotion Regulation 2034 (DCPR 2034) for the K-East (Andheri East) ward, reducing the open space requirement against 20 reserved open spaces to 50% and allowing the remaining 50% to be commercially exploited. It has further decreed that the land owner needs to provide public access to only 20% of the reserved 50%, effectively bringing down public access to these reserved open spaces from 100% earlier to 10%. TimesViewMumbai has the least open space per person (1.28 m) among global cities. The city’s latest development plan aims to increase it to 6.13 sq m but this is likely to remain on paper as state governments over the years have only encouraged large- scale construction. By shrinking open spaces, the state has sadly again shown where its priorities lie.These 20 reserved open spaces in Andheri East are part of five-star hotel grounds. All the hotels with these open spaces are along the way to the airport. Earlier, 100% of each of these open spaces were open to the public for restricted hours. Activists blame govt, BMC for reduced open spacesThe new plan favours the plot owner by allowing him to surrender 10% to the BMC to be kept open permanently to the public. In return, the plot owner actually gets to keep 90% of the plot for his use (50% for commercial and 40% as a private park). “Prior to the DCPR 2034, the plot reserved for open space was 100% open to the public. Now the public will have access to only 10%, while the owner gets benefit of 90% of the plot. In a city starved of open spaces, how much more cruel can the government get?” asked activist and convener of Watchdog Foundation, Godfrey Pimenta. This is in sharp contrast to Singapore, where the government has ensured public open spaces in all high-end areas, allowing the public access to open areas even if it means crossing hotel lobbies. Under the 1991 Development Control regulations, all the 20 Andheri East plots were 100% open to the public for certain hours of the day. “Except for Hotel ITC Grand Maratha, none of the others would allow the public access to these open spaces. This was further aided by the BMC not putting up boards in prominent places informing that these parks are open to the public. Now the government and BMC have aided the hotels in officially ensuring the public does not have access to these open spaces,” Pimenta said. Under the new rules, the BMC has stipulated “that 50% of these lands in revenue village Sahar be reserved for the park. These open spaces on the Development Plan are not required to be acquired by the BMC. The remaining 50% of the land be deleted and included in C zone only for hotel- plus commercial purpose and be kept open for general public during restricted hours.”The same rule offers a further option to the plot owner. It states, “The owner may at his option hand over 20% of the reduced reserved open space to the BMC to be kept permanently open for the general public without any compensation in any form and maintain the rest of the park as a park always. No floor space index/transfer of development rights compensation in any form shall be allowed for the area kept permanently open as park and even for the area to be handed over to the BMC.” Nayana Kathpalia, trustee, NAGAR, said this was not at all good for the city which already has very few open spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-cuts-open-spaces-in-andheri-e-by-90/articleshow/84513856.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Delhi||Delhi: Buy bus tickets on app, pocket 10% discount||NEW DELHI: In a significant move that aims to incentivise contactless ticketing, the Delhi cabinet led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has approved the grant of 10% discount in fares to bus commuters on purchase of tickets through mobile phone applications. Delhi government said in a statement that the discount will be applicable on 6,750 buses operated by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and under the Cluster Scheme. While at present contactless ticketing by scanning QR codes is now available through the Chartr mobile application, commuters would be able to use the Delhi government’s One application for this purpose too. “Delhi government for the past few years has been striving to revolutionise how public transport is perceived in the country. Today’s decision is a welcome step,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said. “When we launched the common mobility card in 2018, we saw a large number of private car users shift to public transport. I’m hoping that state of the art buses with increased surveillance and safety features and right incentives like e-ticketing apps and common mobility card will be a much-needed push for Delhiites to adopt public transport as their default mode of commute,” he said. In August last year, Delhi government had carried out the first public trial of the e-ticketing system in all buses on route no. 473 through the Chartr mobile application. The government has been promoting e-ticketing to reduce the spread of Covid-19 and Gahlot had constituted a task force to explore the options of contactless mobile ticketing in buses. The initial trials had shown that tickets booked through the app account for 6% of total ticketing, the government said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/buy-bus-tickets-on-app-pocket-10-discount/articleshow/84511009.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||Fitness cert breather raises safety, pollution worries||Kolkata: Almost all private buses and more than 70% taxis in the city are running without certificate of fitness (CF), a mandatory prerequisite before hitting the road. Without undergoing the fitness tests, which determine the road worthiness of vehicles, these vehicles are potential threats to road-users and also big emitters of noxious fumes. Significantly, because of the Covid-19 restrictions, Bengal government offered waiver on the penalty against CF expiring validity period. “But this does not mean that buses and taxis will not undergo fitness tests,” said a transport department officer. Buses and cabs skipped fitness tests. “Without the CF, most of these buses or taxis are mobile junks. The second-hand tyres of these buses have no minimum road grips, the brake system is worn out, mechanical faults are rampant. I always avoid the close proximity of a bus on the road,” said Professor Prabir Basu, an automobile engineering expert. “The buses which were parked on the road for more than one and half month, under open sky got weathered and often remained under waist deep water when roads got waterlogged. The tyres were worn out, engines got dysfunctional, brakes lost grips. All these make a recipe for disastrous accidents on the road. Motor Vehicles must carry out mandatory CF tests before allowing them on the road,” added Professor Basu. In fact, the accident of a bus near Fort William, which killed a young city police personnel on his bike, was a grim reminder of how dangerous these buses could be. “Each bus operator spends anything between Rs 30,000 and Rs 40,000 on a bus before sending it for CF tests. They paint the exterior, overhaul the braking system, hire tyres with better grips and ensure smooth functioning of engines. Now, most of the bus operators don’t have enough money to get CF done,” came the candid confession from Tapan Banerjee, secretary, joint council of bus syndicates. “But without being roadworthy, the buses are running the risk of causing catastrophe. The Motor Vehicles Rule has clearly underlined that without the CF, a bus or a cab is violating permit conditions and its registration stands cancelled. Each bus can develop mechanical snag at any moment. It can fail to break. I get terrified whenever I visualise the danger they can unleash any moment,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an automobile engineering consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fitness-cert-breather-raises-safety-pollution-worries/articleshow/84511044.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh BJP netas to drum up support for Yogi Adityanath in Uttar Pradesh polls||BHOPAL: State BJP leaders would get big responsibility in Uttar Pradesh elections scheduled early next year. The saffron party’s central leadership has already started exercise to shortlist leaders who could be helpful to drum up support for UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. BJP national president J P Nadda is believed to have talked on the issue with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan during the latter’s visit to the national capital. Madhya Pradesh leaders have been instrumental in UP politics and played an important role in the 2017 assembly polls as well. Chouhan campaigned for the party while incumbent state home minister Narottam Mishra was given the responsibility of Kanpur region in-charge. BJP also has Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on its side this time. The Rajya Sabha MP has a mass base in the Gwalior-Chambal region that shares boundary with UP. Scindia had earlier worked in the neighbouring state and was made in-charge of western UP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when he was in Congress. The BJP leaders in MP districts adjoining UP are well-versed with UP politics and remain in touch with their counterparts. Experts pointed out that if BJP can depute close to ten of its MP leaders in the West Bengal polls, the number of leaders to be pressed in campaigning for the UP polls would be much higher. Though the party failed to form the government, a number of MP leaders were deputed in the recently-held Bengal polls. BJP’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya was active and CM Chouhan had also held poll rallies there.  State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agrawal said, “It is obvious that MP leaders would go to UP during elections. UP shares a border and the language and culture of the two states are similar. The central leadership would decide who would go for campaigning ahead of the UP polls”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/state-bjp-netas-to-drum-up-support-for-yogi-in-up-polls/articleshow/84511036.cms||Ankur Sirothia

Also, with the university offering alternative BSc courses in IT and computer science, which are way cheaper than engineering, families tend to choose them,” said principal of Thadomal Shahani College of Engineering G T Thampi. He said that there are fewer placement opportunities in the manufacturing and civil sector, and therefore, students will naturally not want to invest a lot in these courses. While 4.04 lakh applications were received, the numbers may go up by a few thousands after some more students confirm the registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-applications-for-mht-cet-drop-to-4l-from-5-3l/articleshow/84515710.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Hyderabad||No claims under Rythu Bandhu for one lakh acres across Telangana||HYDERABAD: Eatala Rajender, before he was sacked as a minister, was often heard saying that the state government should not be extending Rythu Bandhu sop to big landlords holding hundreds of acres. His contention was “why should those who do not cultivate their lands, taxpayers and realtors get the benefit of Rythu Bandhu scheme?” He wanted the government to extend the benefit only to poor and eligible farmers. Not just Eatala, even chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was appealing to the landlords who can afford to forego the financial benefit under the government scheme to return the amount which, he said, could be used for the benefit of poor farmers on a rainy day. Interestingly, many eligible landowners in the state have not opted for the scheme. Government sources said there were no claims under Rythu Bandhu for nearly one lakh acres. Notwithstanding 2,81,865 more farmers brought under the Rythu Bandhu ambit this season, it was found that several landowners have not bothered to apply for the scheme to claim investment support. Sources said many of these owners could be having large chunks of land parcels. Officials said 66,311 more acres of land had been brought under Rythu Bandhu coverage this season. Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar said this belies the claim that Rythu Bandhu is meant only for rich farmers. “More than 90 per cent of poor and eligible farmers are reaping the benefit. There is a falsehood that this scheme is being wasted on rich farmers. This argument does not hold water,” he said, taking a dig at Eatala. Agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy said 63.25 lakh farmers, covering an extent of 150.18 lakh acres, were benefited with Rythu Bandhu assistance this Vaanakalam season. The government spent Rs 7,508 crore on the scheme this kharif. Vinod Kumar said fear of introduction of a cap on the scheme and implementation of Rythu Bima had led to eight lakh succession certificates being issued in last two years alone. “For distributing money within the family and for claiming the benefit under Rythu Bima, many landowners have given titles to their heirs. So, there is no question of unnecessary claimants or beneficiaries in either of the schemes,” he asserted. The government is yet to impose any cap on Rythu Bandhu scheme though some experts had suggested that rich farmers should be excluded and a cap on the number of acres to avail the benefit should be introduced. The state government, while introducing the scheme, announced that those who can afford farming on their own without investment support can give back the benefit they received and that it won’t stop the benefit on its own for any one. However, officials said response for the ‘give it up’ option in the scheme has somewhat been poor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-claims-under-rythu-bandhu-for-one-lakh-acres-across-telangana/articleshow/84511294.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Another case has also been registered against him for setting her scooter ablaze at Uzhavar Sandhai at Singanallur on Friday morning.Police identified the arrested as K Parthiban, 57, of Vellalore. An officer said the SSI was having an illicit affair with the 30-year-old relative women, who had separated from her husband and was living with her son in a rental house at Varadharajapuram. The woman, the officer said, started to avoid Parthiban and shifted to another house near Varadharajapuram two weeks ago without his knowledge. “Parthiban traced her whereabouts and visited her around 8am on Thursday in uniform. He assaulted her for avoiding him, abused her with filthy language and damaged her scooter.”To vent his anger, the officer said, Parthiban set the scooter, which the woman’s father had taken for repair and parked at Uzhavar Sandhai at Singanallur, on ablaze on Friday morning. The act was recorded on the CCTV cameras in the locality.The woman lodged a complaint with the Singanallur police, who registered a case against Parthiban under Sections 294, 323, 427, 452 and 506(ii) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act.

After speaking to the bereaved families and local residents of the village, former minister Jitu said, “Even after 18 years of the BJP regime, people are facing a severe dearth of drinking water. So much so, that they are embracing death to collect water. Corruption is such that the government-built well collapsed. This incident is an example of the kind of corruption that persists in Madhya Pradesh.” Jitu said that the chief minister was busy in the marriage ceremony of three girls in Vidisha when the “victims were succumbing to their injuries”. After talking to the villagers of the ill-fated Lal Patthar hamlet, the Congress MLA argued that if a motor pump was attached to pull water from the well, then the tragic incident could have been easily averted. “What will happen to these families where the young earning members are dead? The chief minister says compensation of Rs1 lakh, Rs2 lakh and Rs5 lakh will be paid. The pain is such that compensation cannot heal. Congress party demands that the state government adopt these families and give Rs50 lakh compensation for each of the dead,” Jitu said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/jitu-visits-lal-patthar-blames-govt-apathy-for-well-collapse/articleshow/84511042.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Abortion video from Mahisagar district shocks health department||VADODARA: A video of four women ‘killing’ a foetus illegally in the backyard of an old house in Santrampur in Mahisagar district has sent the district administration into a tizzy. The district health officials on Saturday got into the act and visited the spot where the women were seen taking out parts of the foetus before starting an inquiry into the matter. The health department also registered a police complaint against the four women who were seen in the video that went viral on social media. The officials, however, said that they aren’t trying to ascertain if it was recently shot and initiated legal action against the women under The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act. “The police accompanied us to the spot for further inquiry. We have registered a FIR against the four women,” said Dr Swapnil Shah, chief district health officer, Mahisagar. In the video the four women are seen taking out parts of a foetus from a young woman. “Investigations will reveal if the foetus was already dead in the womb or if it was killed. The faces of those four women in the video aren’t clearly visible,” Shah added. Allegations have also surfaced that the four women are ‘staffers’ of a private hospital. The cops are now trying to ascertain identity of the woman whose foetus was removed and investigations will also focus on the allegations of hospital staffers. Shah said that the incident was serious and inquiry will be done to ascertain if illegal abortions are being conducted in other parts of the district. Santrampur MLA Kuber Dindor said, “Such incidents are shameful for the society. Legal action should be taken against whoever is involved in the incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/video-of-four-women-aborting-fetus-illegally-jolts-health-dept/articleshow/84510954.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Finish metro work at one spot within six months’||Mumbai: Metropolitan commissioner S V R Srinivasan has ordered civil contractors to remove barricades within six months of placing these as prolonged work is affecting smooth movement of traffic. Metro work is being carried out across all corners of Mumbai and Thane with one lane being blocked to enable space for construction of viaduct. “The contractors have been instructed to not extend the work in the barricaded stretch beyond six months. Ideally, this work should get completed in four to five months, but in Mumbai work is going on for years,” Srinivasan said. He warned that contractors will be penalised if they fail to adhere to this directive. Metro work is being carried out on Link Road and Western Express Highway in the western suburbs as well as LBS Road, Eastern Express Highway and Sion-Trombay road in the eastern suburbs and the Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road. Besides there are other non-arterial roads where work is in progress. Residents have often complained about barricades reducing the width of the road. “LBS Road near R-City mall and 90-Feet Road in Ghatkopar (east) have been barricaded but there is very slow progress. The barricades and unauthorised parking leads to huge traffic snarls,” Ghatkopar resident Ajay Shah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-finish-metro-work-at-one-spot-within-six-months/articleshow/84512938.cms||Manthank Mehta

---||Surat||Security guard’s organs give new life to four in Surat||SURAT: A 35-year-old man security guard, who suffered a fatal road accident a few days back, gave a new lease of life to four patients by donating his organs on Saturday here in the city. His two kidneys, a liver and a heart were donated to patients in need of organ transplant. The donor Shailesh Harihar Singh (35), a native of Jharkhand who was residing at Ashish Nagar in Bamroli of Surat, used to work as security guard at ONGC. After doctors declared him brain dead, his wife Seema and other relatives agreed to the organ donation after being persuaded by members of Donate Life. Singh’s heart was transplanted into Jamkhambhalia based 22-year-old youth at Ahmedabad’s CIMS hospital. His liver was transplanted into a 41-year-old man from Rajkot at the Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC). Singh’s one kidney was harvested at IKDRC while the other one was transplanted at the K D hospital in Ahmedabad. According to sources, Singh was seriously injured after his motorcycle was hit by an unidentified vehicle near Althan in Surat on July 9 when he was returning from ONGC. He was taken to a new civil hospital for treatment by passersby who saw him lying on the road in an unconscious state. After the primary treatment, he was shifted to a private hospital in the city for further treatment. On July 15 treating doctors declared Singh brain dead and informed his family members as well as Donate Life founder Nilesh Mandlewala. “We met Singh’s family members including his wife Seema and explained to them the importance of cadaver donations and they readily agreed for it. After receiving consent from the family, we informed State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) convener Dr Pranjal Modi in Ahmedabad for further process,” Mandlewala told TOI. “I have lost my husband, but his organs will give new life to four patients and therefore we decided to go ahead with the donation,” Seema said. SOTTO allotted the heart to Ahmedabad CIMS hospital and it was transplanted into Jamkhambhalia youth who had been suffering from serious heart problems since the last few years. The youth’s heart pumping was reduced to just 5-10% in the last three months, sources informed. “After the second wave of Covid-19, six brain-dead patients donated their organs through Donate Life. In the last few months, we have facilitated 31 organ transplants by securing donation of three hearts, two lungs, 12 kidneys, six livers, and eight corneas,” Mandlewala added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/security-guards-organs-give-new-life-to-four/articleshow/84511720.cms||---

Satish Vasava was killed by his former friend and six unidentified people on Friday night. The deceased Satish and the accused Rakesh Vasava were best friends until a year ago. Police said that Satish started dating a nurse named Divya Vasava, but after a brief period they had a break-up and she got into a relationship with Rakesh. Since then, the two friends severed ties and often got into verbal fights over petty issues. On Friday late night when Satish, along with his nephew Kishan, was going to purchase some essentials for his boat, Rakesh and six others stopped them near Nava Tariya village in Ankleshwar taluka and attacked them. Kishan told police that Rakesh hit his uncle with a sickle on his head and before they could attack him, he managed to flee from there. A few minutes later when Kishan returned with other family members, Satish was lying unconscious in a pool of blood.

Vegetable vendor Redya Naik tucked away the cash in an almirah in his house. He kept the money for his abdominal surgery. Part of the cash that was shredded by the rodents was borrowed from his relatives. The currency notes in Rs 500 denomination were kept in a bag. Naik earns a living by selling vegetables on his two-wheeler. “It was my savings after selling vegetables. I had kept the currency notes in a cotton bag,” he said. “When I opened the bag, I was shocked to see that all the currency notes of Rs 500 were nibbled by the rats,” Naik rued. A grief-stricken Naik went to a local bank to exchange the notes, but the bank officials refused to oblige. “Not just one bank, I had gone to several banks in Mahabubabad but the officials said they cannot exchange the destroyed currency notes for fresh ones,” he said. Naik, a resident of Indiranagar thanda, saved the money for his surgery. He had also borrowed some money for the operation. Naik, who was suffering from severe stomach ache, developed a lump in his abdomen. When he went to a private hospital in Mahabubabad, he was advised by doctors to go to Hyderabad for the surgery, that would cost up to Rs 4 lakh. The banks advised Naik to approach the RBI in Hyderabad to explain his problem. It may be recalled the Reserve Bank of India had instructed the banks to exchange soiled and damaged currency notes. However, notes half-eaten by rats do not feature in the RBI’s order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rats-nibble-rs-2l-cash-of-veg-farmer-kept-for-his-surgery/articleshow/84512978.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

This plant will cater to the medical oxygen requirements of the 150 private hospitals in the city,” he said.According to him, like several other districts in the state, the private hospitals in Ahmednagar city had faced an acute shortage of medical oxygen during the peak of the second Covid wave. “There were occasions when doctors of the private hospitals stood in queues themselves to refill the oxygen cylinders. Some IMA members have now come forward to set up a refilling plant. This project would be a big relief for the private hospitals here,” he added.Some doctors in the city recalled that when the medical oxygen availability had become a challenge, hospitals had to cough up Rs 2,000-3,000 to refill each jumbo cylinder, which, in turn, increased the treatment cost.“The hospitals were desperate as the Covid patients on oxygen support had to be given oxygen without disruption. They were forced to buy medical oxygen at higher prices. But once the new project is in place, these hospitals can refill their cylinders at the right price without hassle,” Dr Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ima-members-to-set-up-o-refill-plant-in-ahmednagar/articleshow/84715316.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Govt is unlikely to plan big hydel power projects in state in future’, says N S Pillai outgoing CMD of Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB)||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It is unlikely that sensitive hydel power projects such as the Athirappilly project will ever be planned again in the state, N S Pillai, the outgoing CMD of Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has said. Pillai, however, considers hydel power projects the most suitable and sustainable alternative among power sources. “Compared to thermal power, which makes up a major chunk of the power we currently use, hydel power is clean and carbon-free. But it would be impossible to commission big new power projects like the Athirappilly project in an ecologically-sensitive state such as Kerala,” Pillai told TOI. Pillai, who led the board successfully during some turbulent times, said the board navigated the crises, especially the consecutive floods and landslides, in 2018 and 2019, without any power tariff increase on account of the board’s unprecedented drive to replace the faulty energy meters. “When I took over as the CMD, at least 30% energy meters, cutting across domestic, industrial and commercial categories, were faulty. Now, the board has tackled the issue. We could plug the pillage and it did reflect in board’s revenue. If it were not for the natural calamities, KSEB would have been a profit-making utility by now,” Pillai said. Pillai said KSEB has emerged as one of the most competent power utilities in the country and it has been able to provide quality power at affordable rate. As long as the central government does not take an adamant stand against power utilities in public sector, the board can successfully compete with private power suppliers in the coming years. However, it would require the wholehearted cooperation of the board employees, he added. The feasibility study of the second phase expansion of Idukki power project will be completed soon and the board must be able to float a tender by 2021-end, he said. Pillai said he received a firm backing from the state government and was forced to come out with answers when the board’s integrity and competency was questioned by political parties in the opposition. Pillai was selected to Indian Audit and Accounts Service (IA & AS) while working in AG's Office here in 1995. He was appointed as director (finance) of KSEB in 2015 while serving as the AG of Chhattisgarh and subsequently elevated as the CMD of KSEB in 2018. He will retire from service on July 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-is-unlikely-to-plan-big-hydel-power-projects-in-state-in-future/articleshow/84511099.cms||B S Anilkumar

A bench of Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice Madhav Jamdar directed that “all authorities shall accept his status as such and allow him to operate or manage the movable and immovable properties of his wife”. The properties include a residential premises, bank accounts and a number of investments. The order was given on a petition by Vijay Salgaonkar (73) to appoint him legal guardian of his wife Veena (65). The Salgaonkars are Mumbai residents and have no children.Salgaonkar’s petition said Veena suffers from vascular dementia with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. “Because of her debilitating health condition she is unable to take care of herself, not to speak of her property. She is virtually a ‘living dead’ person,” the order noted, adding that Salgaonkar has to constantly look after and take care of her. The judges said while looking after Veena is not a difficult proposition, Salgaonkar is handicapped in looking after her properties in the absence of being declared her guardian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/spouse-of-woman-in-vegetative-state-will-be-treated-as-her-guardian-bombay-hc/articleshow/84512991.cms||Rosy Sequeira

All five accused -- including the sarpanch’s husband Bhagwan Singh and his father — have been arrested. The victim, Somesh Gurjar, is in critical condition in hospital, his hands severed from the wrist. Gurjar and Singh are distant relatives and live in Chourahet village in Babai region, around 110km from Bhopal. According to police, the two got into a quarrel at a mandi in Itarsi, some 40km away, during procurement of crops on Friday morning. The sarpanch felt humiliated when Gurjar grabbed his collar in public. Other farmers separated the duo, but Singh was allegedly plotting revenge. Hoshangabad SP Santosh Singh Gaur told mediapersons that Gurjar was attacked in the evening when he was returning home from the market. According to Gurjar’s complaint, Singh and four others waylaid him near a canal and began hitting him with sticks. Singh and his father hacked off both hands with sickles, and walked off. Gurjar somehow managed to stagger home, but he had to leave his severed hands at the site of the attack. By the time his family members recovered from the horror, took him to hospital and went looking for his hands, it was too late to reattach the severed parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mans-hands-chopped-off-for-grabbing-collar-of-sarpanchs-husband/articleshow/84511101.cms||---

They have also asked the VC how such incidents of theft occur in a university which has its own dedicated security personnel along with outsourced security contingent. JU authorities have decided to keep two doors of the university open. Gate 4 will remain open throughout while, gate number 1 will be open during office hours. “The decision has been taken keeping recent thefts in mind. More security personnel will be deployed,” said an official. It was discovered on Wednesday that some computers and other equipment, including electric cables, taps and other items were missing from the Bengali and civil engineering department. “All the items that have been stolen are bulky and big in size. So, there is no question of them being concealed by somebody while taking out. It raises many questions over the security inside the campus that nobody could detect when these things were being taken out of the campus,” said Partha Pratim Ray, secretary of the Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association. The association has requested the VC to carry out a thorough investigation into the incident which brings “disrepute” to the university. “This has not happened for the first time. Few months ago several instruments were stolen from the civil engineering department and several trees on the campus were chopped and taken out,” said Ray. Several teachers have pointed out that people manning some of the gates are not apart of the security wing of the university. Registrar Snehamanju Basu said: “Police complaint has been lodged.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ju-to-keep-2-gates-open-profs-write-to-vc-on-theft-flag-security-concerns/articleshow/84511084.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Delhi||Former Delhi University professor held captive, robbed||NEW DELHI: A 62-year old retired Delhi University professor was allegedly held captive and robbed inside his residence in northwest Delhi’s Model Town on Thursday. Police said two men who worked as domestic helpers in the professor’s house were arrested within two hours of the robbery for their alleged involvement in the crime. The accused had taken Rs 50,000 cash and an iPhone from the victim before fleeing. According to police, the money and the phone have been recovered from the possession of Jayaram Mandal, 29, and Mahanand Mandal, 24, both natives of Bihar. On Thursday, a call was received about a robbery, and police discovered the DU professor with his hands and feet bound with strips torn from a bedsheet. He had been overpowered apparently by his house helps, who robbed him and then fled. Police immediately registered a case of robbery and started investigations. Since the accused were already identified, several police teams raided locations in Azadpur village and managed to nab the accused men. “On questioning, they confessed to their involvement in the case,” said Usha Rangnani, DCP (Northwest). “They were working as domestic helpers of an elderly person who lives in the house with the family. On the day of the incident, the victim was alone at home. Grabbing this opportunity, the two servants, who lived in the servant’s quarter on the third floor of the same building for the past 3-4 years, overpowered the professor, looted the cash and took his mobile phone.” The DCP took the opportunity to appeal to all the citizens to get their servants police verification done at the nearest police station in the interest of their safety and security, especially after the recent series of attacks on senior citizens who were alone at home. In the last two months, several senior citizens have been victims of murders and robberies. The police data shows there are 39,223 senior citizens in Delhi who live without children or families.

The EOW hopes to get at least 15 API rank officers. EOW takes over investigations from police stations where the cheating amount is more than Rs 10 crore. While the sanctioned strength of police sub-inspectors in EOW is 74, it has only 13 working with it; more than 80% of the posts are vacant. “As part of reorganisation of our department, we would prefer experienced officers since the job profile in EOW is different,” said a senior police officer. EOW is probing Cox and Kings cases involving a total cheating amount of Rs 2,000 crore and the PMC Bank case involving 4,700 crore, among others. “A committee will examine EOW’s proposal and a GR could be issued as per the findings and recommendations of the committee,” said the officer. The sanctioned strength of API rank officers is 48 while 34 are working with the EOW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-eow-seeks-15-asst-inspectors-total-80-psi-posts-vacant/articleshow/84513015.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said a probe team was being sent to the spot. “Just got the news of a crash of a Cessna aircraft (solo flight) that belonged to the Chimes Aviation Academy in Sagar, MP. Fortunately, the trainee is safe. We are rushing an investigation team to the site,” he tweeted. Another plane of Chimes, a private institute, had crashed while landing in fog in January 2020, killing the instructor and trainee pilot. This time, the trainee escaped without any injury, said Sagar administration officials and Chimes Aviation’s local administrator, Rahul Sharma. The incident happened around 3pm. Eyewitnesses said the Cessna 172 shot off the runway and ended up in a clump of bushes. The pilot got out unharmed. Chimes was barred from using the airstrip for some time after the January 2020 crash of a Pinnacle Air P68 Observer-II aircraft in which instructor Ashok Makwana and trainee Piyush Chandel were killed. The accident was probed by DGCA, but no one here knows if the report has been filed. Bhopal airport director KL Agarwal said, “DGCA had conducted the probe. We have nothing to do with it. It was done by DGCA so I can’t comment about it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/trainee-pilot-survives-runway-runoff-in-sagar/articleshow/84511135.cms||---

Justice A Abhishek Reddy said: “Do not finalise the auction bids in respect of this area.” He was hearing a petition filed by Sangamala Chakravarthy and three others, who questioned the industries department and the TSIIC for including the two-acre plot which was used as a cemetery. They contended that it had several memorials and samadhis of their ancestors. The judge said the auction conducted in respect of this land would be subject to the result of the writ petition. “Pending further orders, status quo should be maintained. Status of the land should also not be changed,” he said. The judge further directed the officials to implead the GHMC and the revenue department as respondents in the case, saying they would be able to clarify the status of the land. The officials had classified this area in survey no. 41/14 as plot number 17 for the purpose of auction. Petitioners’ counsel J Prabhakar said the land was already under use for a public purpose. “The state government is preventing people from nearby places from entering the area because it wants to auction the plot through HMDA,” he said. Prabhakar said: “Once an area is earmarked as a crematorium, it continues to be so and cannot be changed.” The state counsel for industries department sought time to inform the court about the status of the land. Dealing with a related petition by Manne Jyothi and 208 labourers from Khanamet, Justice P Naveen Rao directed the state government to inform the court about its stand on the pattas granted to them in 2007-08 for the purpose of house sites. “At least can you accommodate them in your double bedroom housing scheme,” the judge told the government and posted the case for September 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-orders-status-quo-on-2-acre-khanamet-land/articleshow/84513036.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Lake Kalibari help for cyclone victims||Kolkata: It’s been two months since cyclone Yaas battered Bengal and and more than a year since cyclone Amphan ravaged the state. But teams from Lake Kalibari on Southern Avenue are still reaching out to the cyclone-affected, attending to their needs and also showing them how to stay safe in the pandemic. The Southern Avenue temple seems to have emerged as a leader in philanthropy, routinely visiting the cyclone-affected areas of South 24 Parganas and West Midnapore. The areas include Kakdwip, Sagar, Diamond Harbour under Gosaba block of Canning sub-division in South 24 Parganas and Daspur-2 block, Ghatal in West Midnapore. They have also started a project to raise awareness among fishermen on staying afloat during inclement weather conditions. “On one hand, people are fighting the pandemic and on the other, vast stretches of our state have been hit by cyclones for two consecutive years. That’s why we decided to be with the cyclone-affected and provide relief material and any other help,” said Lake Kalibari’s medical team head, Utsho Basu, an endocrinologist attached to Apollo Hospital. Last Tuesday, a team led by Basu went to Dwariknagar in Namkhana block to distribute relief material to those affected by cyclone Yaas. Their next stop will be the riverine areas of Sunderbans. “People are affected very badly this time. Though the immediate impact is similar to any cyclone that has hit these areas previously, the long-time impact is severe,” said Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lake-kalibari-help-for-cyclone-victims/articleshow/84511158.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The work is being done at a cost of around Rs 530 crore. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has been closely monitoring the exercise of upgrade and Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) has set a timeline of the work. Officials have been checking technical aspects from time to time to submit details to senior officers. “Since the work of STPs of Dhanas and 3 BRD is not much, the upgradation works of these two STPs is likely to be completed by the end of the calendar year, while upgradation of the remaining three will take time. The deadline to complete the upgradation works of all the five STPs is 2022 and all the companies carrying out the works have already been instructed about this. Diggian STP is the biggest and around 15% to 20% work of this STP has also ben completed”, a senior official said. Earlier, work could not start due to the Covid-19 pandemic, following which the authority sought time to complete the tender process and other formalities to allot work of upgrade of the STPs. Sources said that completion of the works will be a challenge. The NGT is also being informed about the progress from time to time. “The companies have prepared their designs as per the specification and tender document to upgrade the sewage treatment plant and to make sure these designs are technically sound and in accordance with the expansion plan of the project. Since the project is using latest available technologies in the world for long-term sustainability, there are numerous technical aspects which these companies have to follow,” sources said. Since the Diggian STP is the biggest, a separate tender was initiated for it, while the remaining four STPs were clubbed into two each. The reserve price of upgrade of the Diggian-based STP was Rs 329 crore, while that of upgrade of Raipur Kalan and Raipur Khurd STPs was Rs 126 crore. Cost of upgrade of STPs in Dhanas and 3BRD was Rs 75 crore. The Diggian STP tender went for Rs 283 crore against a reserve price of Rs 329 crore, which is around 13% below the reserve price. Although the upgrade of all the five STPs is quite significant for authorities, but since Raipur Kalan and Raipur Khurd-based STPs are in bad shape, the authority is giving extra attention to their upgrade. Earlier, the internal assessment pointed out that these two STPs needed major improvements. Box: Maintenance for 15 yrs Besides the up-gradation works, selected companies will also operate and maintain these STPs for 15 years, as this is a crucial part of the tender. The up-gradation includes bringing BOD level below 5 milligrams, bringing down Fecal Chloroform (Bacteria) to 100 MPN (most probable number) and other related technical parameters. Box: STP BOD level Raipur Kalan 80 to 90 Raipur Khurd 80 to 90 Diggian 14 Dhanas 10 3BRD 10 Box: What is BOD? Bio-chemical oxygen (BOD) is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed or demanded by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material in water at specific temperature over given time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/3-firms-start-work-on-upgrade-of-5-stps-for-around-rs-530-crore/articleshow/84509228.cms||Deepak Yadav

League leaders including IUML high power committee member Syed Sadiqali Shihab Thangal and national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty addressed a press conference on the issue in Malappuram on Saturday. Kunhalikutty said that the party will strongly oppose the government’s rejection of Sachar committee report for resolving Muslim backwardness. He added that there was no clear stand on the issue even in LDF. “It may seem that the aim of LDF is to create a communal divide. Would everyone with the Left agree if the benefits of Muslim-Latin communities are cut down abruptly?” he said. “The Left has put in cold storage a commission report which found the truth behind the educational, social and employment-wise backwardness of a community. Even the one thing that they executed, the scholarship, has been watered down. Paloli committee reduced 100% to 80% and now they have made it 59%. As a result, the scholarship itself has become almost non-existent,” he said. Shihab Thangal said that the government should have implemented the Sachar committee report. “Sachar committee studied how to resolve the backwardness in Muslim community and gave ideal guidelines on the issue. Instead of implementing it, Paloli committee was appointed and the Sachar committee report got diluted. Now, that has been further watered down by the government and this approach is not right,” said Thangal. Kunhalikutty said that the Paloli committee’s 80:20 formula was the root cause of all these debates. He said that no one was against giving benefits to the other communities. “The scheme, based on backwardness, should be set aside for that purpose. For other minorities, separate schemes should be created based on population. Both should be considered separate,” he said. When asked about opposition leader V D Satheesan’s conflicting statement welcoming the government decision, Kunhalikutty said that the statement that media portrayed as the comment of the opposition leader has been clarified by him. “When I talked to him, what I understood was that he was also of the opinion that both schemes should be considered separate,” he said. On differences of opinion within UDF, especially with regard to Kerala Congress, he said that UDF stand has to be decided after a discussion. “There shouldn’t be any doubt that we would raise it within UDF and the assembly. There would be no change in the party’s policy that the Sachar committee report has to be implemented,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-creating-division-in-society-iuml/articleshow/84511248.cms||---

I just pray for him,” said Surgy, the mother of Alex Antony who will be representing India at the Tokyo Olympics, when we phoned her. But she knew one thing for sure years ago; that her son would run so fast that he would make them proud one day. That’s why when Alex didn’t have proper running shoes, she pledged whatever little ornaments she had to buy him a good pair of shoes. Alex said that he derives the strength and confidence from such experiences. “Being selected for the Olympics is a dream come true and my family is also excited. There was a time when I couldn’t even afford a pair of good running shoe... Though my family knows nothing much about sports, they support me well,” said Alex. It has been 19 months since this 27-year-old visited home. He is currently training at the National Institute of Sports, Patiala, to race for India in the mixed 4x400m relay. Alex, a native of coastal Pulluvila in the district, hails from a fishermen family. Sachin Roby, an athlete and a good friend of Alex, is all praise for the remarkable improvement Alex had shown on the track. “We were often taken aback by his endurance level and strength something which he had achieved by playing football during his childhood days. On track, nothing affects his focus. He’s such a strong competitor,” said Sachin. M K Rajmohan, the National team coach, is proud of Alex with whom he shares a close bond. Rajmohan had been training Alex since he joined the Indian Air Force in 2014. “I spotted Alex at the Kerala University Championship in 2013. Then itself he had the pace required for a 400m relay. He clocked 47.83 seconds in the Olympics trials. I am confident he will make it to the finals,” said Rajmohan. Alex, who was more into football during his childhood days, was introduced to athletics by Johnson, his physical education teacher at Leo XIII HSS, Pulluvila. That was when Alex was in Class V. Thereafter he ensured that Alex took part in all athletic competitions. “I used to make him run on the beach which helped a lot,” he added. Alex has represented Indian in the 400m at events like the Asian Championship and World Championship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/alex-sets-eyes-on-tokyo-with-mothers-prayers-for-strength/articleshow/84509242.cms||---

The bench of Justice K Ramakrishnan and Dr K Satya Gopal asked the company to obtain EC even for its expanded areas and operations before scaling up its mining beyond the permitted levels. The bench earlier heard a petition filed by Banothu Nandu Nayak, and another person, who complained of frightful consequences for the people of neighbouring villages caused by excessive mining through indiscriminate blastings. These high intensity explosions are causing several health hazards to the local residents of five villages near the mines, they said. The bench, while finding fault with the pollution control board for not assessing the damage and quantify the same, directed it to make a fresh case for compensation after assessing the same. The bench, which appointed a committee of officers to go into the issue in the last hearing, noted that the committee too gave a finding that the company is resorting to excess mining. The committee recommended compensation to the aggrieved villagers in the form of improving infrastructure and health facilities in the affected villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-excess-mining-in-khammam-mines-hc/articleshow/84511253.cms||---

Nearly 40% of the students enrolled in the new batch belong to various PSUs and government organisations. Usually, the majority of the IIM-ites for the executive programmes come from the corporate sector. These ambitious professionals represent top-notch organisations like Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, TCS, HSBC, Tata International, HPCL, L&T, BARC as well as public sector banks, pharma, healthcare and infrastructure companies. Going by their job profiles, these students form a diverse group of experienced professionals. IIM-V launched the third batch of the two-year postgraduate programme for experienced professionals (PGPEx), leading to the award of the MBA degree of the IIM-V, on Saturday. The intake has crossed the 30-mark. According to IIM-V officials, the institute of national importance has become a go-to destination for the professionals, mostly in their mid-careers, to accelerate their career progression, hone skill sets/knowledge, and develop network, critical-thinking capacities and decision-making abilities through the executive MBA programme. As Visakhapatnam is endowed with several PSUs, premier organisations and private companies, IIM-V is witnessing hundreds of applications for the programme every year. Additional secretary, Union ministry of skill development & entrepreneurship, Juthika Patankar, who attended the virtual launch event as the chief guest, spoke on the theme of ‘Great Expectations’. “We need to create and enforce expectations in the community that the people are entitled to receive and get good services. As part of their corporate social responsibility work, the private sector companies and PSUs could actually think of conducting quality capacity building programmes to the government employees to enable them to join the dots. This can greatly refresh the views of government employees and would make them much more receptive to new innovations and activities of other organisations for better service delivery and implementation of programmes,” said Juthika Patankar. Welcoming the third batch of experienced professionals, IIM-V director Prof M Chandrasekhar said the participants would stand to benefit immensely from the unique strengths of the Institute in knowledge resources and infrastructure. “The Institute is known for its impactful learning outcomes, since it builds system skills, soft skills, and social skills in the cohort as a judicious amalgam to broaden their horizon and world-view. This is sure to reflect in their enhanced efficiency and effectiveness at their workplace,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. Quoting American actor Will Rogers, Prof Chandrasekhar told the students that everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects. “It is the responsibility of the institute to make the students well-rounded professionals in the management domain,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/iim-v-exec-mba-top-pick-for-psu-staff/articleshow/84513077.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Chandigarh||SAD condemns Cong: Misusing state chopper||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) condemned the Congress government for misusing the state helicopter to fly in party general secretary and Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat to Chandigarh, to meet chief minister Amarinder Singh, as part of Congress high command’s efforts to resolve the internal rift in the Punjab Congress. Demanding a probe into the matter, SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said it was shocking that the Punjab Congress was misusing state assets to this extent. “There is no justification for flying in Rawat to Chandigarh on state expense when the Congress general secretary has officially stated that he is visiting the union territory to discuss party affairs with chief minister Amarinder Singh. Rawat should be asked to pay for the ride or else the chief minister should make the desired payment to the state treasury from his personal funds. State funds cannot be used to solve the infighting in the Punjab Congress.” Cheema also disclosed that the misuse of the state chopper was in stark contrast to the claim of the Congress in its election manifesto, which stated that ‘the use of a helicopter for travel by the chief minister and ministers will be forbidden except in case of emergency or calamity’. He said like all other promises made to Punjabis, the assertions in the election manifesto on use of the state helicopter had also been thrown to the winds. The SAD leader said it was condemnable that Amarinder Singh had also misused the state helicopter recently to answer repeated summons from the Congress high command in Delhi in the last two months. “The helicopter, however, was not used to visit any hospital during the peak of the Covid pandemic or to provide solace to farmers suffering from power crisis or even meeting employees agitating against the Congress government across the state..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-condemns-cong-misusing-state-chopper/articleshow/84513082.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||All cops barring medical cases fully vaccinated||CHANDIGARH: Almost all the staff — 5,975 cops and 1,300 home guard volunteers — in the police department have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, with 130 cops being ruled out owing to their medical conditions. As these people were advised not to take the vaccines by doctors, they were exempted, according to Manoj Meena, SP (headquarters). Earlier, cops were not turning up in hospitals for the vaccination, forcing the SSP to issue an order on February 23. He had directed the SHOs and in-charges of other units to ensure all cops whose names were in the vaccination list to reach the police hospital in Sector 26. “Defiance will invite strict disciplinary action and unit in-charges held responsible,” the order had said. SP Meena said 512 cops had tested positive for Covid-19 since last year. There was only one active case in the police department and he was stable. However, the department has not been taking any chances, getting around 300 cops randomly examined and tested for the virus daily. “All the cops, especially those deployed in the field, are being distributed hand sanitisers, masks and gloves,” the SP added. The virus had proved fatal for two home guard volunteers and an assistant sub-inspector (ASI). Jasbir Singh, the ASI, breathed his last at PGI on May. He was suffering from diabetes and had kidney problems, ailments that had prevented him from taking the shot. Balwinder Kaur, home guard volunteer, had succumbed to the virus at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32 on May 7. Another home guard volunteer, Balwinder Singh, had died at PGI on April 24. The first Covid-19 case in the police department was reported on May 12, 2020, when constable Suman had tested positive while discharging her official duty at a containment zone in the vegetable market of Sector 26. Sanjay Baniwal, DGP, had inaugurated a vaccination drive for cops at the Sector 26 hospital on February 3. The DGP had taken the first shot on the inaugural day and urged other cops to come forward and take the jab without fear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/all-cops-barring-medical-cases-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/84509253.cms||Pawan Tiwari

There is a reason for everyone to cheer. That’s why the opposition leader too welcomed the government decision earlier. There will be no reduction in the benefits enjoyed by the Muslim community. Why should anybody be disturbed at others getting their due share,” he told reporters at a news conference . When the discontent expressed by IUML leaders was brought to his notice, Vijayan said, “Better not join those who try to flare up the issue with ulterior motives.” Vijayan said it was not right on the part of opposition leader V D Satheesan to change his stand under pressure from IUML leaders. LDF convener slams Kunhalikutty Meanwhile, CPM acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan slammed the Muslim League and its leader P K Kunhalikutty on the controversies regarding the minority scholarships issue. Speaking to reporters in Alappuzha on Saturday, Vijayaraghavan alleged that the Muslim League is trying to create divisions in society on the scholarship issue. Muslim League had taken a different stand in the UDF. Some statements raise the suspicion that the issue is being diverted to another level, he said. He slammed Kunhalikutty saying that the League leader had other political interests, he said. “The government took a decision on the minority scholarship after discussions at the all-party meeting,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/new-formula-equally-beneficial-to-all-backward-communities-cm/articleshow/84511257.cms||---

After BJP and other parties promised top position to these communities after coming to power, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal too pledged to have one a Hindu and a Dalit deputy chief minister. SAD moves works well for its alliance partner BSP too as it Dalit politics is raison d’etre for Mayawati-led outfit. Working on the optics, SAD’s traders’ wing president and former MLA Sarup Chand Singla led a “delegation of Hindus” on Saturday to Sukhbir’s house in Badal village from Bathinda to “appreciate the decision of the party”. “It is not the SAD earlier has not been giving tickets to Hindus but such position never was assured for them. The party had been giving plum ministerial berths to Hindus from BJP when in alliance. SAD has broken alliance with BJP, but it did not want to annoy Hindus and thus declared to give post of deputy chief minister to a Hindu. It made a similar announcement for Dalits to keep alliance partner BSP in high spirits,” a SAD leader said, not wanting to be named. Singla claimed as the party had assured fair representation, Hindus wanted to thank the Badal family and for it they got together at Bathinda and come to Badal village. The former CPS claimed Hindus would now support the Akali Dal wholeheartedly. SAD’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal said, “SAD had always believed in communal harmony. The party is for all communities and religions to cohesively work together.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/akali-dal-promises-to-do-more-for-hindus/articleshow/84513155.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Mom rescues 5-year-old kid from jaws of death in rare ‘big cat bite’||NAGPUR: On July 3, five-year-old Prajakta had followed her mother Archana Meshram (27) who chose to avoid their home toilet and headed for the forest nearby to relieve herself in the afternoon. Even as Archana disappeared behind the thick greenery in Junona village in Chandrapur district, Prajakta’s unusually frightening cry ‘Aai, Aai’ forced the mother to rush back, leaving her urgency aside. Archana was horrified to see her daughter’s entire face in a huge big cat’s jaws. As the beast began to drag its prey, the mother gave it a chase. Picking a big bamboo stick, she hit the beast on its tail. The big cat dropped Prajakta only to grab her back. Another strike with the stick and the big cat dropped the kid but this time, charged a bit towards Archana who started swinging the stick. Narrating the incident which has caught media attention, Archana wasn’t sure if it was sheer luck or her valour that forced the big cat, which she now claims was a tiger, abandon the place. As per Archana’s statement recorded by forest guard Soni Pandhare “it was a leopard”. Pandhare told TOI this was the first man-animal conflict in the area since 2012 and camera traps showed presence of a leopard only. After the initial treatment and healing of her facial wounds at the Chandrapur Medical College, Prajakta was shifted to Nagpur’s Government Dental College and Hospital on July 15. The attack has left the 5-year-old’s upper and lower (maxilla and mandible) jawbones misaligned and fractured periorbital bones. “In my 21-year career, I haven’t seen a survivor of a big cat attack. Hence, this can be called a rare big cat bite. The animal didn’t use full force to grab her face. It was perhaps like the way a tiger holds its cubs,” said Dr Abhay Datarkar, head of the oral and maxillofacial surgery department. Dr Datarkar and his team would operate on the kid on Monday. The girl would need a facial fixation surgery as she is unable to chew due to the displacement of teeth. She is also unable to close her right eye due to facial palsy. Arachana said even after two weeks, the horrific incident keeps flashing before her eyes. “Since that day, whenever I close my eyes, I see the tiger holding my kid in its mouth. Somehow, we are trying to overcome the nightmare,” she said. Asked if she was in two minds, Archana said, “I feared the tiger would charge at me if I chased or beat it. But then how could I leave my daughter to die. As soon as it dropped her and left, I picked up Prajakta and rushed home to inform my husband who took us to hospital.” Dr Datarkar said the surgery would take about two hours to set the teeth alignment right. “One jaw has been displaced and lowered from its original position. It is called disturbance in occulsion of teeth. Damage to the upper palpebral hinders closing of one eye. Over a period of time it will get restored after the surgery,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mom-rescues-5-year-old-kid-from-jaws-of-death-in-rare-big-cat-bite/articleshow/84511232.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Unlike the dacoits of yesteryear, the new breed of criminals here no longer abduct people from homes at gunpoint. Rather, they deploy the female members of the gang to lure their targets. The Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh police say that while the vast deserted ravines of Chambal, which cuts across three states, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, have been largely cleared of the dreaded dacoits, criminal gangs have nevertheless found the area a haven to hide their victims. The face of new terror is Badan Singh, a notorious criminal wanted in over a dozen cases, including abductions and kidnappings.On Thursday, when Dholpur and Agra police in a joint operation rescued Agra-based senior surgeon Dr Umakant Gupta, police learned that Badan Singh was the mastermind behind the kidnap. He had allegedly demanded Rs 5 crore in lieu of the safe return of the surgeon. “We are searching for other accomplices of Badan Singh; he has been evading arrest in multiple cases,” Botre Rohan Pramod, SP of Agra (City), said. Sources in Rajasthan police said that Badan was once an underling of a former dacoit who ruled Chambal two decades ago. Earlier, Badan had kidnapped another doctor, Dr Nikhil Bansal of Agra, in 2017. Dr Bansal was later released by the gang after receiving the ransom. “The gangs still use some of the old tactics of dacoits like leaving extortion letters for the family of the abductee. But their modus operandi has changed significantly. For instance, Dr Gupta was allegedly honey-trapped by a woman with ties to the gang. He was abducted in his own car by an aide of Badan, assigned to deliver the surgeon safely to a different group deep in the ravines,” an officer of the state police claimed. These methods, according to cops, help the accused cover their tracks in the event where one of the gang members is arrested. Police suspect that gangs here rely heavily on their extended families that live in small villages around the inter-state borders of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. According to the Uttar Pradesh police, in February this year, a lawyer from Agra was kidnapped from the same spot, Bhagwan Talkies, where Dr Gupta was picked up on Tuesday night. The lawyer was taken to Bari in Dholpur via Bharatpur district by a different gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chambal-ravines-a-safe-haven-for-new-breed-of-ransom-gangs/articleshow/84513165.cms||Dishank Purohit
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Congress slams govt for rising fuel prices, inflation||CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh Congress, on Saturday, held a demonstration against inflation, in Sector 22. The protest was attended by senior Congress leaders and workers, including former city MP Pawan Kumar Bansal. Addressing the workers, Bansal accused said the government of working to cut people’s pockets by imposing tax on petroleum products. He alleged that while the government was collecting money from people by taxing petroleum products, it had never collected money from income tax and other taxes. He said it seemed that the government had exhausted all means of income and wanted to collect money from tax on petroleum products. He said there were other sources of collecting money to run the government. He also expressed concern over rising unemployment. “Unemployment has now exceeded 11%. This is a fact. It has come to fore that 23 crore people have come below poverty line. The rich man is getting richer. Upper class people are absorbed in their bliss. Poor section of society is the most affected. This government has no concern for people of these sections,” Bansal alleged. Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said the government had failed to check rising inflation. The last 15 months have been very difficult for every person in the country. These 15 months pushed three crore 20 lakh people of the middle income group into the low income group, he said. Chandigarh Congress spokesman Harmail Kesri said when the United Progressive Alliance government was in power from 2004 to 2014, the price of petrol crude in the international market was $144 per barrel, even then Manmohan Singh's government did not let go the price of petrol go above Rs 72 per litre. Today, when the price of crude oil in the international market was not more than $ 75 per barrel, petrol was being sold for Rs 100 per litre all over the country, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chd-cong-slams-govt-for-rising-fuel-prices-inflation/articleshow/84509279.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Nala Squatters Thrive On Sloppy Eviction Drive||Hyderabad: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has identified 28,872 encroachments on major nalas flowing through 390 km length in greater Hyderabad region. The official data, however, remained unchanged in last six years, when 28,000 encroachments were identified on the city’s nalas, clearly indicating that none of the structures have been removed. For that matter, the situation is same in several lakes dotting the city. This is despite Hyderabad going through multiple flooding episodes, especially the October 2020 floods that wreaked havoc in several parts of the city. While GHMC records limit the encroachments to pucca constructions and temporary establishments such as huts or boundary walls, environmental experts say that the problem is much more critical. “When you are allowing constructions on the nalas, the rainwater will take its natural course and as a result people who are inside the lake as well as the surrounding areas will be flooded. The encroachments are so rampant that most lakes in the city have been reduced to less than half their original size,” said lake protection activist Lubna Sarwath. Citing one such case, Sarwath said that during an inspection with the commissioner in Bandlaguda last month, a high-rise was found to have come up right inside the lake’s area. “The commissioner said this was an illegal construction and also mentioned the sale in the report submitted at a court hearing but where is the eviction order?” Sarwath questioned, and said the rate of encroachments has increased drastically since 2014. Of the 28,000 unauthorised constructions, last year, the civic body came to a conclusion that 1,001 structures in 47 critical bottlenecks are to be removed immediately to avoid inundation during heavy rains or flash floods. But till July this year, there has been no major drive or attempt to remove the encroachments except taking up the removal of bottlenecks at some isolated places. “Near some of these nalas, you can see the houses that are already demolished but you still get flooded. It is because after removing the house, there is a lot of dredging work to be done. The stream width also remains unchanged. So, if you don’t fix that, how is it going to change anything?” questioned Anant Maringanti, urban planner and executive director of Hyderabad Urban Labs. “These are all agricultural lakes and agricultural nalas but that purpose is now lost. Therefore, the engineering also has to change because you engineer an irrigation structure and that becomes an urban romantic lake for middle-class entertainment. If you want to prevent floods, you have to deal with the whole system as one integrated area,” said Maringanti, who inspected a few flood-prone areas and nalas in Al-Jubail colony on Saturday. In Kondaram Nagar, which was flooded due to the rains earlier this week, residents said that the situation is due to the surplus water from Saroornagar lake being diverted into their colony. “The rainwater is following its natural course. It is because the authorities did not construct a nala here which connects from our area to Musi river, our houses are being flooded,” said Sai Charan, a resident of Kondaram Nagar. The data procured by TOI also states that the Greater Hyderabad has 173 major nalas flowing through the region out of which 102 nalas are in the 12 municipalities and 71 nalas in the erstwhile MCH area, which is the core area of the city. When asked about the data on the action plan to clear encroachments, GHMC chief engineer for maintenance M Devanand said, “We are following a process where we first plan for a particular stretch of nala, give eviction notices, evict them and then construct nala. The works are taking place under Strategic Nala Development Programme.” While GHMC’s chief city planner Devender Reddy did not respond to calls and messages asking about eviction notices, SNDP chief engineer Dr C Vasantha said, “The SNDP work including nala restorations will be completed in a year.” However, none of the officials could provide data on eviction notices issued against encroached areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nala-squatters-thrive-on-sloppy-eviction-drive/articleshow/84511266.cms||Moulika.KV

A dentist returning home became a victim of road rage at Broad Street in Karaya after he was assaulted and his two-wheeler damaged by two bike-borne men while a youth alleged that he was assaulted by his in-laws at Mayurbhanj Road in Ekbalpore. The dentist, Alexander Maio, alleged he was assaulted while returning from his chamber around 10.40 pm on Friday. He was on his way back to Palm Avenue when his bike hit a parcel belonging to the two bikers that had fallen on the road. After abusing him, one of them allegedly started punching him. “I started bleeding from my nose and got severe injuries on my legs. He even damaged the two-wheeler,” said Alexander. Karaya police detained the accused. Sonu Lal Mallick (26), a resident of Karl Marx Sarani, alleged that while he was visiting his in-laws at Mayurbhanj Road to meet his wife and daughter around 2.30 pm on Friday, Raja Dhanuk (24), his brother-in-law, assaulted him with a stick and also tried to strangle him with a nylon rope.

---||Hyderabad||Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation razes nearly 300 dilapidated buildings||HYDERABAD: Intensifying its efforts to address the issues of urban flooding, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC)has so far demolished close to 300 dilapidated structures in the city. The civic body also alerted its officers to evacuate people from all dilapidated buildings and be ready with their monsoon emergency teams. On Friday, the GHMC officials demolished a building in Shastripuram ward after the wall of the G+1 building in Owaisi Hills was in a dilapidated condition due to the recent rains. “We had to bring down the structure as it was located on the hill and was posing danger to the people as well as other buildings nearby,” said AIMIM’s Mohammed Mubin, corporator from Shastripuram ward. Further, the officials said that they have also identified two more dilapidated buildings in the same area. A similar drive is being taken up in all six GHMC zones. The GHMC had identified 563 buildings that are structurally unfit and initiated measures to avoid loss of life and property. Officials have been put on alert over messages from IMD and have been told to act immediately on citizen complaints. “We have prepared a list of all dilapidated structures in each circle which includes newly-identified structures following which the special demolition drive was taken up,” a GHMC official said. The special drive was started on June 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-razes-nearly-300-dilapidated-bldgs/articleshow/84511287.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: As Covid on wane, doctors suspect dengue in cough, hypoxia cases||MUMBAI: Dengue cases have been rising sharply across the city, said doctors, even though the BMC has officially stated that only eight patients were diagnosed between July 1 and 11. An added complication this monsoon, said doctors, was that several dengue patients have been coming in with symptoms of cold, cough and low oxygen levels that are now synonymous with Covid-19. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Srivastava said people associated dengue with a drop in white blood cells and platelets, but “we now have dengue patients with cough, cold and lower respiratory ailments”. It isn’t as if dengue’s symptoms have changed but Covid has changed us, said Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital near New Marine Lines. “People have become very observant, especially with cough, cough and blood oxygen levels. All these symptoms are part of most viral fever, be it Covid or dengue,” he said. In 2019, 920 dengue cases and three deaths were reported. The numbers dropped to 129 cases and three deaths in 2020. In 2021, 74 cases have been reported so far. Dr Mandar Kubal from Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central, said the worst manifestation of dengue is acute respiratory distress syndrome. “We have been seeing dengue with lung involvement for some time now, but the point is that now that monsoon is here, doctors should suspect dengue in patients who come in with breathlessness, not just Covid,” he said. There is an “overlap” in symptoms between Covid-19 and dengue that is posing as a challenge, said Dr S P Kalantri from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha. “Typically, dengue patients came in with high fever and backache, but they now have a third symptom: Cough and hypoxia. Many of them in our hospital need mechanical ventilators,” he told TOI. As a result, most patients with suspected dengue also undergo a Covid-19 test first. “After a patient’s RT-PCR report for Covid comes negative, we do a dengue test,” said Dr Kalantri. In most hospitals and clinics, doctors advise patients to first undergo the RT-PCR test to rule out Covid-19. Dr Pratit Samdani said three out of every 10 dengue cases need hospitalisation. “The patients come with high liver enzymes and dehydration,” he said. Dengue cases usually start with monsoon when other maladies such as malaria, jaundice and typhoid also start surging in cities such as Mumbai. “We are seeing cases from chawls as well as tony addresses on Nepean Sea Road. We expect the cases to keep increasing till September as is the dengue routine,” said Dr Shrivastav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-covid-on-wane-docs-suspect-dengue-in-cough-hypoxia-cases/articleshow/84509283.cms||---
---||Kochi||‘Will demand scheme for Muslims’||Kottayam: Opposition leader V D Satheesan said on the minority scholarship issue that the UDF had suggested to the state government a formula protecting the existing scholarships. The Sachar Committee had put forward a special scheme for providing scholarships for students of the Muslim community. The UDF formula stood for maintaining this scholarship and finding ways for providing scholarships for other minorities also by forming another scheme, he said. “The state government decided that there won’t be any reduction in the number of scholarships provided currently. However, the government removed the special scheme for the Muslim community. The Muslim League is complaining about this. I had asked the government to consider this concern of the League,” he said. Satheesan also welcomed the state government for partially approving the UDF stand of not reducing the number of the existing scholarships. However, the demand for a special scheme for the Muslim community has not been approved, he said. He also said that a demand for this will be raised with the government. He also said that there are no differences between League and Congress on the issue. “We are united and UDF also has the same stand on the issue. Differences on the issue exist in LDF,” he said. Regarding the controversies over his reactions on the issue over the last two days, Satheesan said that he had expressed the same view while meeting mediapersons in Kasaragod and Kottayam. “I don’t have to change or soften my views,” he said. He said that a section of media interpreted without understanding the facts. The state government on Thursday had altered the proportion of scholarships for minority community students based on 2011 census. The high court had in February struck down the 80:20 ratio for minority students. It had found the original allocation legally unsustainable and favouring a particular community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/will-demand-scheme-for-muslims/articleshow/84511313.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Himayatsagar reservoir close to full tank level||HYDERABAD: The incessant rains this month have seen the Himayatsagar receive inflows almost up to the Full Tank Level (FTL). The water level in Himayatsagar, which is one of the city’s main drinking water sources, was 1,761.55 feet while the FTL is 1,763.50 feet, short of just 1.95 feet. As per the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) data released on Saturday, the inflows into the reservoir was 209 cusecs. “The water level has been steadily rising in the last five days due to incessant rains in the catchment area and therefore the Himayatsagar has almost reached FTL,” V Renuka, deputy general manager, Himayatsagar, told STOI. She added that the water board has alerted the Hyderabad collectorate and other government agencies about the possible flooding. The floodgates of the Himayatsagar are opened based on the inflows and rainfall reported in the catchment area. Water level at 1,761.55 feet in Himayatsagar reservoir on Saturday.Meanwhile, the water level of Osmansagar is also rising. The recorded water level in Osmansagar on Saturday was 1,784.50 feet, while the FTL of the reservoir is 1,790.50 feet. However, water board officials said that they have observed no inflows into the reservoir. “For Osmansagar to reach FTL, it may take a few more days,” said deputy general manager, Osmansagar, A Narahari. Currently, the water board is drawing 9.8 million gallons of water from Osmansagar and another 7.23 million gallons of water from Himayatsagar for supply to Old City and some other parts of Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/himayatsagar-reservoir-close-to-full-tank-level/articleshow/84511279.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Vaccination found to reduce mortality by 50% in patients, says study||HYDERABAD: Vaccination against Covid-19 either by Covishield or Covaxin would help reduce mortality by 50% in hospitalised patients, revealed a joint research study by teams from the city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and Asian Institute of Gastroenterology (AIG). The study found that both Covishield and Covaxin, which were the only vaccines available in India when the research was conducted (April 24 to May 31, 2021), are effective in preventing disease severity and mortality against the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) in completely vaccinated hospitalised patients. The study, which appeared in the preprint online platform, MedRxiv, on July 13 was updated on July 16. While 3.45% of hospitalised unvaccinated patients died fighting the Delta variant, only 1.51% of fully vaccinated hospitalised patients succumbed to the new variant that fuelled the second wave of Covid-19 in India. Those who received single dose of vaccine had a mortality rate of 3.35%. “Severity of the disease (severity/ICU requirement at admission) was significantly low in the vaccinated group when compared to the unvaccinated (3.18% versus 7.06%). Requirement of ventilatory support was low as well (2.8% versus 5.7%). No significant differences were seen in the incidence of acute kidney injury, requirement for renal replacement therapy or thrombotic complications between both the groups,” the research study said. Referring to mortality, the researchers said mortality was 50% lower in fully vaccinated individuals (completed 14 days after receiving second dose) hospitalised with Covid-19 when compared to unvaccinated individuals. “These results become even more significant in the light of higher comorbidities and age in the vaccinated group. Majority of deceased in completely and partially vaccinated individuals had no/minimal antibody response which was comparable to unvaccinated individuals. Strategies targeting these non-responders to vaccination like additional booster doses or change of vaccine type need to be explored further,” they suggested.

Hyderabad sub-divisional revenue officer Venkateswarlu told STOI on Saturday: “Necessary orders have been issued to tahsildars of Charminar, Golconda, Asifnagar, Himayathnagar, Nampally and Bandlaguda to tackle the flood situation if the floodgates of Himayatsagar are opened. We have also asked revenue officials to identify suitable venues located in their respective jurisdiction to evacuate the families.” “The plan, which we had followed during the floods in October, will be implemented to tackle the situation in the Old City and certain areas. In fact, Hyderabad collector Sweta Mohanty has been alerting us to get ready to relocate families of mandals likely to be affected due to opening of the floodgates,” a revenue official said. The civic body has also geared up to deploy Disaster Response Force (DRF) to handle the flood situation in areas likely to be affected in the Old City.

With the appointment of Medchal Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy as the new TPCC chief, the by-election battle adds another dimension with TRS, BJP and Congress going all out to win the seat. While sitting MPs Revanth and Bandi Sanjay Kumar head Congress and BJP respectively, former MPs B Vinod Kumar and Ponnam Prabhakar whose names are doing the rounds for the bypoll ticket represent TRS and Congress. Winning the bypoll is all the more prestigious for Sanjay as after Eatala Rajender had joined the saffron party, the stakes are high. Eatala is likely to enter the fray as a BJP candidate. Sanjay, who represents Karimnagar in the Lok Sabha, has a fight on his hands as Huzurabad assembly segment falls in his parliamentary constituency. Analysts said if Sanjay has to regain his winning momentum of Dubbak and GHMC election wins after the reverses in the graduates MLC elections and Nagarajuna Sagar bypoll, Huzurabad by-election provides a perfect setting. For the new TPCC chief, a good performance in Huzurabad holds key to prove his credentials. Revanth also has to pass this test as Congress had fared poorly in the GHMC elections while the BJP came out on top. In the graduates MLC polls also, Congress performance was dismal though it did fairly well in Nagarguna Sagar byelection. Interestingly, TPCC outgoing chief Uttam Kumar Reddy’s relative Kaushik Reddy met Revanth and reportedly expressed his keenness to contest from Huzurabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/task-cut-out-for-sitting-and-former-mps-in-huzurabad/articleshow/84511323.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||50% rise in PhD enrolments from medical fields in 3 yrs||MUMBAI: The number of medical experts, be they neurologists, pharmacists, ayurveds or nurses, enrolling for PhD has been steadily going up. While 5,981 healthcare professionals enrolled for doctoral studies in 2016-17, the corresponding number is 1.5 times that at 9,330 in 2019-20. In 2017-18 and 2018-19, the enrolments for a PhD in the health sciences numbered 7,086 and 7,473, respectively, said the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) released by the HRD ministry recently. For 2019-20, the 9,330 medical postgraduates are enrolled in 48 sub-streams, with the highest number enrolled in pharmacy at 3,536. Ayurveda has 361 and dentistry, 507. At the PhD level, only 153 students are from the general medicine stream while 665 are from nursing. “Double doctors”, the elite group of medical professionals who can boast of the dual MD-PhD title, are not uncommon in the West. In India, where research, especially funding, is scarce, dual degrees in health sciences are fewer. But the AISHE numbers suggest the trend could be changing. Maharashtra University for Health Sciences (MUHS) registrar Dr Chavan K D says there is an aspirational angle to the rise in those pursuing “medical PhDs”. “Degrees like MBBS and MD have become essential qualifications now. PhD is the desirable one that adds weight to one’s CV,” said Chavan. He said the MUHS promotes research and is taking a cue from states such as Karnataka to introduce the DSc (Doctor of Science) programme. “We noticed an upward trend in DSc numbers in Karnataka, so we are planning to start it in MUHS too,” he said. A senior medical teacher from the city said there are indications that some health universities such as the Homi Bhabha National University and the St John’s National Academy of Health Sciences are considering introducing the MD-PhD dual degree track in the coming years. Dr M K Ramesh, president of the Postgraduate Medical Education Board of the National Medical Commission, says the rise in medical PhD aspirants is a function of the overall interest in PhD. “Most universities offer PhD which was not the case earlier,” he said, adding that the easy availability of guides to mentor students and the introduction of part-time PhD are “huge hits”. There is one more reason for the doctor-doctor pursuit. On July 10, senior teacher Dr S P Kalantri from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Wardha tweeted: “Almost everyone--hundreds of medical teachers--in a medical school is currently busy acquiring a PhD tag after MD. Willy-nilly. They have to. There is no option. This helps the medical school score brownie points when they apply for NAAC accreditations. PhD or perish.” Dr Kalantri said the presence of teachers with PhD helps institutes get “more publications”, “better NAAC ranking” and “status” to draw more students. Medical doctors from para-clinical subjects like biochemistry, pharmacology, physiology, anatomy and pathology are the most likely to take up PhD, said Dr Sudarshan Ballal, pro-chancellor, Manipal Academy of Higher Education. The only reason there are only 268 neurologists, 204 cardiologists and 129 urologists who enrolled for a PhD in 2019-20 is the vast demand for their services from patients. “Clinical work takes precedence over research in India. It is, hence, not common for doctors to enrol for a PhD programme, especially in clinical fields,” Dr Ballal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-50-rise-in-phd-enrolments-from-medical-fields-in-3-yrs/articleshow/84513180.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Kochi||Kerala: Tourism dept held guilty of CRZ violations at Varkala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a major setback to the tourism department, Kerala coastal zone management authority (KCZMA) has concluded that the constructions done at Varkala are in violations of the provisions of costal regulation zone (CRZ) notification. This is a rare instance in the district where a government department has been held accountable for CRZ violations. In its 114th meeting held recently, KCZMA took up the matter which was pending since March 2021 and decided that the district collector and the secretary of Varkala municipality shall be informed about the violations. “We will send letters to the secretary and the collector to take steps to restore the place where violations have been committed,” said a KCZMA official. The matter came to light after KCZMA received a complaint from president of environmental protection and research council Sanjeev S J. It had sought reports from district town planner and municipality secretary. “The damage done by the tourism department in an ecologically important place like Varkala cliff is irreversible. It is far more embarrassing that a government department has been found at fault here,” said Sanjeev responding to the decision of KCZMA. As per the complaint, the department had started conversion of a walkway into a road on Papanasam Beach, which will destroy the natural ambiance and quietness of Papanasam Beach. He also informed that the road construction has started along and on top of the seawalls that are subject to constant coastal erosions. The district town planner had conducted a site inspection and reported that the construction started for a 200-m walkway on Papanasam Beach near the cliff after demolishing the hill. Officials from the irrigation department, who were present in the site, reported to district town planner that tourism department started the walkway construction in Varkala Beach under the government flagship programme with permission of Varkala municipality. KCZMA had learnt that the seawall constructed by the irrigation department was removed approximately for a distance of 200m for the construction of walkway and now activities are undergoing to reconstruct the demolished seawall. The district town planner also reported that the walkway construction began without any scientific study and the existing construction is dangerous to the public as during every raining season the cliff used to collapse. The Varkala municipality secretary explained to the district town planner that they gave permission to the tourism department for the project for rejuvenation of beach, but this was misused by the tourism department by demolishing the hill and the secretary issued a stop memo against the constructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tourism-dept-held-guilty-of-crz-violations-at-varkala/articleshow/84509351.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: ‘Follow Covid norms during festive season’||HYDERABAD: In view of ongoing Bonalu celebrations and ahead of the Bakrid festival, director of public health and family welfare (DPH&FW) Dr G Srinivas Rao on Saturday asked people to strictly follow the three essential principles— wearing of masks in a proper manner, frequent hand sanitation, and physical distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection. In an advisory released here, the health director cautioned the people, especially those who would be part of celebrations like potarajus, pujaris, rangam devatas, staff of various temples to follow all guidelines. “I appeal to the devotees, organizers and general public, who all are participating, to follow the precautions. It is to remember that huge gatherings like these have triggered the second wave of Covid-19, in massive proportions,” Dr Rao said. “This is also the season of many festivals, including Bakrid, auspicious time for functions (marriages, etc), wherein, if people are careless, we have to pay a heavy price,” he added. Dr Rao pointed out that the decline of cases has been slow in some parts of the state. “It’s not over yet,” he said, adding that the current conditions were not favourable/encouraging for the Covid-19 situation. “Only public contribution, by actively following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, will help in prevention/mitigation of the third wave,” he added. The DPH asked people, who develop any suspected Covid-19 symptoms to immediately undergo isolation at home (even from other family members, who don’t have symptoms), rush to the nearby testing centre for Covid test and consult a doctor for immediate treatment, if the test is positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/follow-covid-norms-during-festive-season/articleshow/84511362.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Theatres in Telangana set to reopen today||HYDERABAD: Movie theatres in Telangana will reopen from today after choosing to remain shut though the state government completely lifted lockdown from June 20. The decision was taken after a delegation of the Telangana Film Chamber of Commerce met cinematography minister T Srinivas Yadav on Saturday. For the last one month, Tollywood chose to remain shut in a bid to bring pressure on the state government to issues GOs for the demands of the film industry which had already been accepted. With theatres not opening, chief secretary Somesh Kumar also called representatives of the film industry to know what their issues were. However, with Srinivas Yadav assuring once again to take the issues to the notice of the chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, exhibitors decided to reopen theatres. “It is now up to individual exhibitors to screen any movie from Sunday itself. A new film is expected to be released on July 23 and that is when most theatres might open as they would have a new film to screen,” M Vijendar Reddy, exhibitor and secretary of the film chamber said. Some of the demands that the exhibitors have taken to the notice of the government include no property tax should be collected for the last nearly one-and-a-half years as there have been hardly any screenings, power bills should be waived for the period and the government should issue GOs for the demands that had already been agreed upon. The film industry asked the government to allow it to charge parking fee, have flexible ticket pricing, permit more than four shows and waive state GST for theatres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/theatres-in-state-set-to-reopen-today/articleshow/84511367.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

In some centres, it was partly hit. Meanwhile, on Saturday, there will be no vaccination in NMC’s centres due to shortage of Covishield doses. Also, the state government has planned to start vaccination of bedridden people at their homes and have sought details. The state government has asked bedridden people to send name, address, contact number, reason for being in bed, a medical certificate by a treating physician about the condition and eligibility of patients for vaccination along with the informed consent by their near relatives or caretakers on covidvacc2bedridden@gmail.com. Over 150 vaccinators (nurses) and Co-Win application handlers (data entry operators) working on a daily-wage basis struck work without any intimation. Chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI that NMC had to rope in staff from urban primary health centres to continue vaccination. After 33,235 on Friday, the number of vaccinated dropped to 25,575 on Saturday. Dr Chilkar said that from Monday the striking staff will be replaced. Several doctors, data entry operators and nurses are working on a temporary basis in Covid hospitals and vaccination centres. The NMC used to pay Rs 17,000 per month to data entry operators, Rs 25,000 to nurses and Rs 30,000 to doctors. The payment system was revised from monthly to daily — Rs 500, Rs 700 and Rs 1,000, respectively — from this month. Unhappy with this, the staff refused to work. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said that it was decided to shut down all centres on Sunday to avoid overcrowding in a few. “We “do not have sufficient stock of Covishield doses,” he said. As the NMC had received 64,000 doses of Covishield on July 15, vaccination resumed and was held for two days. Subsequently, no fresh stock has been sent. Vaccination has happened only on 10 of the last 25 days. Launched a day ago, no vaccination happened at NMC’s Pachpaoli ANC centre on Saturday due to lack of beneficiaries. Three pregnant women got the vax on the first day. The NMC will continue the drive and is likely to open two more centres at Daga Hospital and IGGMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-vax-staff-go-on-flash-strike-23-centres-hit/articleshow/84511353.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Aurangabad||Think of changing GR on suspension, says MAT Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal, Aurangabad, has asked the state government to consider amending a resolution issued by the general administration department (GAD) defining period of suspension. MAT member Bijay Kumar ordered, ‘General Administration Department, Government of Maharashtra may consider to amend the GR dated January 31, 2015 to incorporate review period of three months in view of directions issued by the Supreme Court in Ajay Kumar Chaoudhary Vs Union of India.’ According to the GR, the suspension period in ‘such’ cases would be one year. However, SC has capped the suspension period to 90 days and further extension of the period is subject to conditions. The directives have come while hearing a petition filed by Suresh Tandale, an inspector of Legal Metrology (weights and measures), who was suspended after being nabbed by the anti-corruption bureau at Beed in October 2015. He was reinstated after years of suspension. Representing Tandale, lawyer Balbhim Kedar pointed out that he should have been reinstated after 90 days of suspension and contested that ‘he was suspended on November 2, 2015 with effect from October 29, the day he was landed in ACB trap.’ ‘Since then neither any charge-sheet was served, nor was any enquiry officer appointed for carrying out departmental enquiry. Moreover were not revoked despite making several representations including the last one in January 29, 2019,’ the petition stated. The controller of legal metrology (weights and measures) passed the suspension order by exercising powers under the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979. The MAT observed that ‘The order passed on November 02, 2015 had been given retrospective effect from October 29, 2015. However, the quoted rule does not stipulate passing of suspension order with retrospective effect.’ While granting relief to applicant, MAT ruled ‘Continuance of the impugned suspension order of the applicant dated November 02, 2015, beyond 90 days is without review and as no fact has been presented to establish justification for the continuation of suspension, therefore, the same is disregarded and it is directed that the applicant shall be deemed to have been reinstated after completion of prescribed review period of 90 days of actual suspension and all consequential benefits thereof shall follow treating that suspension ceased to exist 90 days after the date of suspension.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/think-of-changing-gr-on-suspension-mat/articleshow/84507585.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad police intercept truck carrying cattle to abbatoir||AURANGABAD: Aurangabad city police intercepted a truck carrying cattle to be slaughtered at Sillekhana area on Saturday morning. A total of 11 animals, including bulls and buffalos, have been seized. Authorities said the action is part of the police’s preventive steps being taken ahead of Eid-Ul-Adha to ensure there is effective implementation of the Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, which bans the slaughtering of cows, bulls and some other animals in the state. In the action carried out on Saturday morning, police have managed to nab the truck driver, Faisal Khan (29), while the person accompanying him managed to escape. Based on the complaint lodged by assistant inspector Rahul Suryatal, an offence has been registered under relevant sections of the Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, prevention of cruelty to animals (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2017 and Motor Vehicle Act. Following a specific tip-off, nakabandi was enforced at different points at around 9 am on Saturday, when the police team spotted a tempo truck. Suryatal told TOI, “We signalled the tempo-truck to stop, but the driver sped. After a brief chase, the vehicle was finally intercepted at government library situated in Sillekhana area.” On being questioned, the driver failed to give any satisfactory reply about the source of these animals and the destination. The probe has indicated that the animals were allegedly being taken to the slaughterhouse. “We are probing the source of animals and trying to find the respective owners,” he said. City police authorities have warned of stringent action against any person involved in violation of the Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act and in any kind of cow vigilantism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-intercept-truck-carrying-cattle-to-abbatoir/articleshow/84507638.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Mumbai||Child sent to estranged wife, father tells Bombay HC ‘lower court didn’t hear’ him||MUMBAI: A father has petitioned Bombay high court to challenge an order passed by a sessions court that handed over custody of his child to his estranged wife without giving him a hearing. The child was in the care and custody of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) of the state as the couple were caught up in a battle over accusations against each other. He filed for divorce before a family court last December on grounds of cruelty and other allegations against the estranged wife. They had been married for a decade. Within a fortnight, he was hit “as an afterthought” with a first information report, he said, by the wife, accusing him of sexually abusing their child who was in his custody. He was arrested in February. The child, aged in single digit, was handed over to the CWC. His advocate, Prashant Pandey, through whom he filed a habeas corpus petition initially (to produce the child from alleged unlawful detention) on July 15 pleaded before the HC bench of justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar to be given a chance to see his child, since the child is now with the mother. The bench said since the sessions court has passed an order, he may challenge it as habeas plea is infructous. The father filed a fresh petition to challenge the validity of the lower court order, questioning how that court did not even hear his sister, despite the CWC saying the child may be handed over to the paternal aunt while father was incarcerated. The father got bail after two weeks in custody but it took four more weeks to be released from prison. On his release, he said he sought to be reunited with the child, and “followed up numerous times.’’ He also filed an application before the district judge in April. It was pending he said, but in June his estranged wife appealed in sessions court and sought the child’s custody. Pandey submitted in HC, “Two weeks later” sessions court handed custody to the mother. He said the child had told police, in a statement, of preferring to live with the father. The statement is part of the petition, he said. The HC said since he has already filed a petition to challenge the lower court order, the habeas corpus petition stands disposed of. The HC, noting that it has not gone into the merits of the case, directed that all contentions including of producing the child in court are open in his fresh challenge. His lawyer pleaded that the father, an engineer, wants to at least see his child online at the online hearing as the child had expressed a desire even to the CWC, to stay with the father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-child-sent-to-estranged-wife-father-tells-hc-lower-court-didnt-hear-him/articleshow/84513280.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata second among cities to vaccinate 18-44 group||KOLKATA: The 18-44 age group in Kolkata was included in the vaccination campaign much later than many capital cities of other states, but the drive was conducted faster than most of them, inoculating the second highest number of recipients in that age group. Only Mumbai is ahead of Kolkata in administering the Covid-19 vaccine to recipients in the 18-44 age group. Till reports came in last on Saturday, 15,48,269 citizens in this age group had been vaccinated, while Mumbai had offered the doses to around 29,20,000 recipients, according to the Co-Win portal. Health experts said this was a good sign as this age group was economically active and had to step out for work. “The median age of Indian population is 29 years. So, by vaccinating people in the age bracket of 18-44 years, we are facilitating two purposes. One is the opening up of more economic activities and secondly, it will help reopen educational institutes,” said IPGMER surgery professor Diptendra Sarkar. The Centre rolled out universal vaccination, including the 18-44 age group on May 1, while Bengal started for this group on May 11 from limited camps in Kolkata. Even now, jabs to this category from state units are restricted to the priority group, including journalists, hawkers and transport workers. “We are gradually expanding the priority group in this age category. If we get adequate supply of vaccines, we could have opened it to everyone as we have the infrastructure to administer close to 10,000 doses a day. But due to the scanty supply of vials, we are unable to do it,” said a senior health official. The Centre had initially said that from May 1, states would have to buy its own stock for 18-44 age group, while it would provide doses for the 45-plus category. Accordingly, Bengal bought 18 lakh doses from manufacturers. But in first week of June, the Centre changed the policy, announcing no state would need to buy vaccines as it would send all vials from June 21. “If we want to arrest the feared third wave and its probable catastrophic effects, we should vaccinate at least 70% of the country’s population with two doses. Municipalities, like KMC, are doing their best and in several fields of Covid control, they have set an example,” said Swasthya Bhawan public health expert Anirban Dalui. Sarkar said more people in the 40-50 age group were affected in the 2nd wave and many younger people died. “Infection and death rates should be less as we inoculate more in this group in case of a third wave,” he said .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-2nd-among-cities-to-vaccinate-18-44-grp/articleshow/84511484.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Nashik||Invasive alligator gar caught in Panchaganga||Kolhapur: Fishermen in the Prayag Chikhali village caught an invasive freshwater fish called the ‘alligator gar’ on Saturday in the Panchaganga river. This fish is native to North America and is claimed to be a threat to the local freshwater bio-diversity. Fishermen Kishor and Raghunath Dalwi, who are brothers, found this fish in their net. Kishor Dalwi said, “I was stunned to see this fish species — it has a crocodile-shaped head and a double-row of teeth. The fish was around 3 feet in length and weighed 3kg. We later checked videos online and then came to know that this is a rare and dangerous fish species from North America and can even kill a man. We have kept the fish in a glass vessel and have informed the forest officials.” Experts said this fish must have been smuggled for aquarium purposes. Dr Vidyadhar Atkore, a fish ecologist and scientist at the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore, said, “Alligator gar fish are a threat to native marine bio-diversity as they are invasive predators. They remain at the top of the food chain. They are native to North America and can grow up to 8 feet in length. In freshwater, they can be dangerous to any living being. The fish getting caught in the Panchaganga river might have been brought for the aquarium trade. Someone might have kept it in an aquarium, and when it grew in size, they may have released it into the river. The fisheries department needs to trace more of these fish and prevent further breeding of this species in the river. Another such invasive species that has caused much nuisance in India is the African catfish.” Atkore is also a member of the freshwater fish specialist group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Clement Ben, the chief conservator of forest for the Kolhapur territory, said, “There have been cases of these predatory fish being found in the rivers of Andhra and Tamil Nadu. It is possible that this fish had moved down south —Panchaganga — as the rivers are connected. This is the first reporting of this exotic fish in the region and we will need to do more research. If the count is low, then it is okay, but if the number is high then it can be dangerous as these fish attack and even bite fishermen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/invasive-alligator-gar-caught-in-panchaganga/articleshow/84507678.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Moreover, Punjab governor and UT administrator was also told about it,” said Sanjay Tandon, former BJP chief. The local unit of the BJP is considering to get a ban imposed on the ongoing protests along the roundabouts and other places by bringing the matter to the notice of national leaders. “The laxity of the UT administration has made protesters take over key roads and roundabouts. This may create serious law and order problem in the future. These protests need to be banned,” a senior BJP leader said. It was for the first time that BJP leaders were targeted in Chandigarh, a cause of concern for the ruling party as the municipal elections are scheduled later this year The BJP had recently appointed various officer-bearers to strengthen the party and increase its activities in both rural and urban areas. However, the BJP smells an opposition hand. “The opposition is trying its best to take advantage from the agitation. But they don’t know that people of the city are with the Narendra Modi government, a symbol of the development and progress, which is committed to the upliftment of all sections of the society,” said mayor Ravi Kant Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/briefed-shah-nadda-says-tandon/articleshow/84509410.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Pune||Realty premium segment demand up in Pune, reveals survey||PUNE: Mumbai and Pune led housing sales in first half of 2021, aided by the state’s two-step stamp duty cut and low interest rates, as per reports by real estate observer Knight Frank and developer Gera. The reports stated that the Pune housing market evolved towards the mid and premium segments during this period. As per Knight Frank’s data, roughly half of all housing sales in India between January and June this year were executed in Pune and Mumbai. Also driving sales were historically low interest rates offered by lenders for home loans, and strong hiring in IT and ITeS sectors. They also noted that housing prices contracted by around 2% over the past year. The first half of 2021 was also marked by a rise in unsold inventory — 18% over the same period in 2020 — with roughly seven quarters of inventory left to sell. “The sales in the latest half-yearly period were driven largely by the stamp duty concessions in the first three months of 2021, reduction in home loan rates to an all-time low, demand for larger homes, better job prospects in the IT sector, increased savings, economic revival after the first wave, and price cuts and discounts offered by developers. Despite the closure of the stamp duty window and the second lockdown, homebuyers were active from April to June 2021, and as developers were willing to absorb the burden of increased stamp duty, it led to closure of transactions,” said Paramvir Singh Paul, Pune director of Knight Frank. Overall, Knight Frank’s data shows that housing sales in the first half of 2021 grew by 74% over the corresponding period in 2020, considering that part of March and all of April-June 2020 were a washout because of strict lockdowns. Both Knight Frank and Gera noted that the market in Pune was growing in its eastern and western fringes. Gera, in its Pune realty report, added that premium segment homes were taking in an increasing share of the housing pie, with increasing disposable income and low interest rates pushing the market towards branded and large realty projects. “We have seen the biggest gains in the Hinjewadi-Baner-Balewadi areas, and sales dropped the most in core city areas. Budget and value offerings dropped, as did luxury. However, the premium segment — Rs 5,000-6,000 per square foot — increased in sales, and the share of 3BHKs increased. Affordability has gotten better, and is currently at 2004 levels,” said Rohit Gera, managing director of Gera Developments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/realty-premium-segment-demand-up-reveals-survey/articleshow/84511506.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: School reopening day spells relief for rural students & teachers||July 15 became the new August 15 for tenth grader Dnyaneshwar Kale as he returned excitedly to school in a village in Beed carrying a sanitiser bottle, plonked himself on a partner-less bench and bantered through his mask with his long-time-no-see mates. "I have never understood freedom better," said Kale in rustic Marathi when teachers asked some of the students for a speech. "The past year has been agonizing," he added. "There were times I wondered if we would have to stay home all our lives." Given that rural students suffered a more pronounced loss of learning during lockdown due to lack of access to mobile phones or network connectivity issues, it was inevitable that a heightened chatter of relief would ensue. On July 15, after the state government's nod for students from grades 8 to 12 to attend physical classes in Covid-free areas, nearly 6000 schools reopened with meticulous planning to keep the children safe. If Aurangabad's Shri Goraksha school now conducts all-female batches on three days of the week and all male-batches on the rest, Nandurbar's AD Deore school has resumed in a new open-air avatar. A blackboard has been strung up against a tree and benches placed at a six-feet distance in the open space outside the school. "Classes run for four hours with no recess. Students have been asked to eat at home and not get their tiffins along," said Dinesh Salunke, headmaster of the school, whose online classes never took off because 80% of the students hail from tribal families that couldnt afford a smartphone. As a primer for the new academic year, teachers are now busy teaching the 45-day bridge course designed by State Coucil of Education Research and Training that covers important topics of the previous year's syllabus. They say making up for lost time won't be simple given the psychological side-effects of the lockdown on students such as gaming addiction and strained relations with families. Despite the eagerness of teachers and students for schools to resume, attendance was low on the first day. Pradeep Kasar, a maths and science teacher at Nandurbar's Jeevan Vikas High school, remembers a short roll call. "Only 19 out of 167 students turned up," said Kasar even as principal Sunil Bhamre attributed the low turnout to the fact that many families in the tribal area had retreated into remote forests and farms during the pandemic and had not yet returned. "The attendance might pick up by Monday," proffered Bhamre. The hesitance of parents in the face of Covid's impending third wave threat to kids meant that just a little over a half of the parents of 729 students studying between the eighth and tenth grades at Shree Shanti Vidya Mandir High School in Hingoli have given their consent for sending their kids back to school. While all his 35 teaching and non-teaching staff members have been twice-vaccinated and RT-PCR tests are underway, "we don't want to force the parents," says principal KD Mahajan. Some rural schools also noticed a higher dropout rate during lockdown as children of labourers were forced to accompany their parents to work with physical schools being shut. "Parents of adolescent girls had started marrying them off, despite the girls being underage, as they were fearful their daughters would "chat with boys" if provided with cellphones for online classes," said a teacher. Another rural school teacher recalls exterminating social-media-induced rumours about the virus being an "upper-class affliction" and debunking myths in the face of poojas being conducted for "Corona devi". Understandably, teachers like Pitambar Urkude of a Bhandara-based school find their phones flooded with messages from students asking when they can return to class. Urkude-- who personally distributed photocopies of the revised class XII political science textbook to every student in April last year-- can't wait. Recently, the political science teacher had to repeat the definition of regionalism to his faceless digital classroom thrice. "When you can't see your students, it's difficult to know if they are paying attention," he says. While the primary sections have not been given the green signal to reopen, an enterprising school teacher from Nandurbar-- who wrote English and math homework on postcards and mailed them to her students during the lockdown as motivational tools-- is restless: "I don't mind taking socially-distanced classes under the tree near the school if that's okay."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-reopening-day-spells-relief-for-rural-students-teachers/articleshow/84513324.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Pune||MSMEs stare at uncertainty over high debt & delayed payments||Pune: Operators of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Maharashtra have sought concrete and comprehensive steps from the Union government to streamline the sector, which was facing a multitude of factors like high levels of indebtedness threatening to sink large parts of it.The operators of MSMEs, who are the largest industrial employers in Maharashtra, said they were facing other factors like delayed payments and high raw material prices over the past year. The prices for steel, for example, have risen by up to 50% over the past year, with some even accusing steel manufacturers of cartelization.Recent data released by the Centre showed that Maharashtra, the most industrial state in the country, also had the dubious distinction of being the state with the most number of cases related to delayed payments to MSMEs. These payments are supposed to be released after orders being serviced within 45 days, according to Union government regulations.“We do not get payments on time anyway, and now because of the pandemic, those payments have been delayed more. Thus, we do not have funds to execute new orders, or even invest in clearing older orders,” said a MSME operator based out of Chinchwad.Also complicating matters is the fact that only around one of six MSMEs across the country (and a similar level in the state) are unregistered with the government, which makes them unable to access credit with banks, or avail of other government incentive or bailout schemes. The latest signing-up drive by the Union MSME ministry generated a tepid response.“The registration drive for MSMEs should be carried out like Aadhaar. Only then will more MSMEs register with the government,” said an industry observer based in Pune.GRAPHICpayment redressal issuesMSME Samadhaan applicationMaharashtra leads with a total of 21,089 cases filedPending: 8,816 cases(Samadhaan is the Union MSME ministry’s forum for payment redressal issues)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msmes-stare-at-uncertainty-over-high-debt-delayed-payments/articleshow/84511536.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The accused was allegedly targeting senior citizens who used to go on morning walks alongside the Kalavad road and ring road of Rajkot. The accused was identified as Ajij Uthar (47) a native of Khambhalia town of Devbhumi Dwarka district. Dressed as morning walkers, the crime branch sleuths laid a trap for the accused at around 5.30am on the two roads. Having gone through the CCTV camera footage of earlier incidents, the cops had a rough idea about the chain snatchers’ appearance. Constable Ashok Danagar saw Uthar near Janki park main road of Kalavad road at around 6.15am. When Dangar approached him, Uthar identified him as a cop and tried to escape on his bike. As his bike slipped, Uthar started running and snatched a bike from a student at knifepoint. A team led by sub-inspector M V Rabari chased Uthar and cornered Uthar near Indira circle on ring road. Uthar’s speeding bike slipped again but rather than surrendering he tried to grab his knife, which had fallen away, with an aim to attack the cops. But constable Pushparajsinh Jadeja, a national hockey player, overpowered him. Police said that Uthar used to pick senior citizens as they were easy targets. Later, he used to mortgage the jewellery with small money lenders. After repaying the amount he used to sell the stolen jewellery in the market. Uthar was earlier arrested from Khambhalia for the same offence. He took to chain snatching after watching CCTV footage of similar crime that took place in Delhi. The police recovered three gold chains from the possession of the accused, valued Rs 2.25 lakh. During the interrogation he admitted to having committed eleven such offences in the last one year out of which few incidents were of last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/chain-snatcher-nabbed-after-action-packed-chase-in-rajkot/articleshow/84512400.cms||---

Solanki’s family then traced Subhash’s mobile number and called him the next day.Subhash called Solanki’s family to Pavagadh and told them that they were hanging out in Maachi village on Pavagadh when some security guards came in following which they all parted ways. Subhash told them that he tried to look for Solanki but couldn’t find him anywhere. Solanki’s family then approached the police that began searching for him in Pavagadh.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: SOP likely for industries with eye on possible third wave||Pune: Baldev Singh, principal secretary of industries, on Saturday said that the government would soon come out with a standard operating procedure (SOP) for all sectors, considering the possibility of a third Covid-19 wave. Industry heads sought the standard operating procedure (SOP) to resume activities following all Covid-19 protocols during their interactions with district collectors. “The SOP will be for all industries, including manufacturing and service sectors, to ensure their seamless functioning ahead of the impending threat of the third wave,” Singh told TOI. The collectors would draw up detailed plans for districts concerned after taking inputs from the industry bodies. Singh said the matter was discussed during a video-conference with all the collectors late on Friday evening. He said the SOP would be finalised in consultation with relief and rehabilitation and health departments. Relief and rehabilitation secretary Assem Gupta told TOI that the movement towards normal socio-economic activities hinged on vaccination. “It will surely become one of the important criteria in discussions when the state considers opening up,” he said. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, who attended the Friday’s meeting, said, “There were several demands from the industry and if an outline or an SOP is given, they can adhere to the guidelines.” The SOP is expected to give clear guidelines on travel, timings and the number of people in industrial units in each shift. The units would have to follow all the Covid protocols and ensure that there is no unnecessary rush. Industry representatives said the SOP would be easier to execute and monitor at units. Mohan Gurnani, chairman of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade, said the government should step in and take decisions to help all kinds of medium and small industries, and traders. “Districts such as Sangli have had closure of shops for the past three months. District-wise, and even area-wise, assessment should be done to work out a way to resume activities,” he said. Recently, the state had constituted a Covid-19 task force for the industrial sector to ensure that the economic activities did not stop because of the pandemic. The chief minister discussed oxygen production, mass vaccination of workers in the units and staggered working hours, among other things, during a recent meeting with the industries’ representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sop-likely-for-industries-with-eye-on-possible-third-wave/articleshow/84509455.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Gangster, accomplices booked under MCOCA||Pune: The Sinhagad police on Saturday booked gangster Mahesh alias Bunty Prakash Pawar and his two accomplices under the provisions of stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act. Pawar was earlier arrested under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in 2015 but he was released on bail from the Yerawada Central jail in 2019.  However, he was arrested again in August 2019 and was released in January this year. “Pawar, a criminal on police records and his two accomplices again formed an organised crime syndicate. Among the other cases registered against Pawar, two are related to involvement in an attempt to commit a murder. Pawar’s accomplices — Shubham Borkar and Pravin Dhakane — were later arrested for possessing ganja. During the questioning, the duo revealed that they were dealing drugs at the behest of Pawar. Senior inspector Devidas Gheware initiated a proposal to prosecute Pawar and his aides under MCOCA after an investigation established that they were members of an organised crime syndicate. Additional commissioner of police (west region) Sanjay Shinde considered the proposal and accorded sanction for prosecuting Pawar and others under the MCOCA. The Pune police on Tuesday had arrested a local journalist Davendra Jain and a self-proclaimed RTI activist Ravindra Bharate under the MCOCA in a different matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gangster-accomplices-booked-under-mcoca/articleshow/84511545.cms||---
---||Thane||Thane: Man held for fraud of Rs 16.5 crore in Ponzi scheme||THANE: The economic offence wing of thane police arrested a cheat for duping over hundreds of investors of Rs 16.5 crore in sham investment scheme and more victims could be involved in the Ponzy scam. The police said that the accused Chetan Dand, 42, floated the Desar investment company with various schemes being advertised online and on various social media since 2014. It is learnt that there was a huge outcry on the social media against the scamsters as the cheats siphoned off millions from the investors. “Dand, told the investors that on the amount they invest in various schemes and route the money to share markets as well as other importing goods and promised them that they would get over heavy returns which obviously was the false assurance he gave to the investors. We have also learned from some investors that he told them that he would also invest in dates which are to be imported from Pakistan which obviously was a false promise,” said a police officer. “Later, when the investors started demanding their interest as well as money back, Dand and his accomplices gave various implausible excuses viz. Dand’s partner Kelvin Kenia has fled abroad with the money, terrorist attacks hampered their business etc,” said a police officer. The police claimed that Kenia’s kin claimed that he passed away due to corona last year and also a death certificate was produced, but the police said that they are investigating the same from all angles. A police officer said, “family claimed that he died during the pandemic last year and we are verifying.” The case was registered with the Tilak nagar police station with nearly 100 investors being duped of Rs 2.1 crore but the police claimed that the number has gone up to over hundreds and the amount duped to Rs 16.5 crore which is likely to rise as the investigation progresses. The officer added that another case is under investigation registered at Kasarwadavali police in which the FIR mentions that Kenia was suffering from cancer. The police have urged the citizens not to fall for such ponzi schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-man-held-for-fraud-of-rs-17cr-in-ponzi-scheme/articleshow/84513332.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Pune||Six arrested for death of two brick-kiln workers in Maharashtra's Karanjvihire village||PUNE: The Chakan police on Saturday morning arrested six persons for fatally assaulting brick-kiln workers Balu Sitaram Gawade (26) and his friend Rahul Dattatray Gawade (28), both residents of Aaskhed village in Khed taluka, at an eatery in Karanjvihire village late on Friday night. According to Chakan police, Balu and the daughter (21) of the eatery owner, who also owns the brick kiln, had eloped on July 14. The arrested persons called Balu and the woman and told them to visit the eatery for discussion. Balu, Rahul, and the woman came to the eatery following which the arrested persons assaulted them with sticks and hot iron rods. The arrested persons also beat up the woman in a fit of rage. She has been admitted in a private hospital in Khed, police said. Police said that the brick-kiln owner was not happy with the elopement of his daughter with Balu. “Balu was already married and has two children. His wife and other relatives also beat him up. We have also arrested his wife in the murder case,” said Prerna Katte, assistant commissioner of police (Chakan division). “We have thoroughly questioned the suspects and it has been confirmed that the woman’s family members and Balu’s wife were unhappy after both eloped,” Katte said. “The two deceased men had been working at the brick kiln for the last three years. The daughter of the brick kiln owner used to visit the site. Balu and she interacted on a few occasions and they fell in love with each other,” Katte said. “The daughter of the brick kiln owner and Balu eloped on July 14. Rahul dropped them at Khopoli,” she said. “The brick-kiln owner and Balu’s family members started a search for the two. Rahul also joined them but alerted Balu on the direction of the search,” she said. However, the brick-kiln owner managed to track them down and also came to know about Rahul’s involvement in the elopement. “The brick-kiln owner and others then told Balu and the woman to come to the eatery for discussion. The family members of Balu as well as that of the woman were already present in the eatery. They beat up Balu, Rahul, and the woman with sticks and hot iron rods,” she said. “We have arrested members of both the families. In a fit of rage, they assaulted the duo mercilessly,” Katte said. “After Balu and Rahul fell unconscious, one of the suspects called up police and claimed that two men have been found dead in the eatery. “After reaching the spot, police studied the circumstances minutely and then questioned the brick-kiln owner and others. After questioning them separately, the involvement of the family members became evident and it was clear that they were telling lies,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/six-arrested-for-death-of-two-brick-kiln-workers/articleshow/84511512.cms||---

---||Nashik||ED may arrest some Maha politicians: BJP state chief||Nashik: State BJP president Chandrakant Patil on Saturday said that “some leaders in Maharashtra” will be arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) soon. Speaking to reporters at Nashik during his two-day visit that began on Saturday, Patil said the ED was investigating the alleged financial irregularities by some politicians in the state. “The ED is carrying out the probe into various financial irregularities involving some political leaders in the state. My assumption is that there is a likelihood that few of them could be arrested by the ED soon,” Patil said. Refusing to name the leaders who he thinks are on the ED’s radar, Patil said “Those who have done something wrong will be arrested by the ED.” Earlier this month, Patil had written a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah accusing Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and transport minister Anil Parab of indulging in extortion, besides submitting a list of cooperative sugar factories and spinning mills to Shah seeking a probe into alleged irregularities. The ED had ordered the attachment of the Rs 65crore-worth Jarandeshwar cooperative sugar factory in Satara. While Ajit Pawar had criticised Patil for his demand for a CBI inquiry against him based on former Mumbai cop Sachin Waze’s corruption allegations, senior NCP leader Jayant Patil had questioned how the central investigation agencies were acting on the politically motivated allegations by the state BJP chief. Asserting that the ED was an autonomous body and was doing its duty, and that he had no clue on who will be arrested, the BJP state chief told reporters: “Those who have not done anything wrong need not fear as the ED will have no ground to act against them.” On Shiv Sena and BJP coming together in near future, Patil said the party was never against the Shiv Sena. “We hold no grudge against Shiv Sena. The only point that hurt us is that we contested the elections together and just for the sake of leading the government, Sena took the support of parties that are ideologically opposed to it,” Patil said. He said the BJP in the state would continue to stage agitations against the ruling coalition on issues impacting people. “These agitations could be against any minister or even the chief minister,” he said. He said there is not likely to be any change in state government as the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners — Sena, NCP and Congress — are aware that they have no future if they fall apart. “They are currently ‘forced’ to stay together as falling apart could create more problems for them right now. They will, therefore, stick together and try to patch every difference for some more time,” Patil added. BOX: Asked to comment on the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NCP chief Sharad Pawar in Delhi on Saturday, the state BJP chief said that nothing much should be read into that meeting. “Before the start of Parliament session, senior leaders of various parties usually meet the Prime Minister to draw the latter’s attention to issues that these leaders want to get resolved during Parliament session,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ed-may-arrest-some-maha-politicians-bjp-state-chief/articleshow/84507750.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Dehradun||One scheme, 3 CMs, 2 different names: Mahalaxmi Yojana launched in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Mahalaxmi Yojana, the Uttarakhand government’s ambitious scheme for new mothers and the newborn girl child, was inaugurated by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Saturday. The scheme has seen quite a few twists and turns since it was announced by former CM Trivendra Rawat a couple of months ago. He had named the scheme ‘Soubhagyawati Yojana’ and was all set to inaugurate it when he had to step down. His successor, Tirath Singh Rawat changed the name of the scheme to Mahalaxmi Yojana and was gearing up to launch it. But on the very day he was to inaugurate it, he was summoned to Delhi and subsequently had to let go of the CM’s chair. Under the scheme, the new mothers and newborns would be provided with clothes and other accessories by the women and child welfare department. A total of 16,929 women have been initially identified to be benefitted across the state as part of the scheme. The Mukhyamantri Mahalaxmi kit is being provided to the mother and the newborn girl child on the birth of the first two girls or twin girls. For mothers, the kit has dry fruits, two pair of socks, one scarf, two towels, one blanket or sheet, two cotton bedsheets, two packets of sanitary napkins, nail cutter, four bathing soaps, four detergent soaps and 500ml mustard oil. After inaugurating the scheme along with women and child development minister Rekha Arya, Dhami said, “If we look around us, we will find that daughters take more care of their parents than sons. Today there is no area in life where daughters have not achieved success.” He added that the scheme is inspired by the “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” campaign of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/one-scheme-3-cms-2-different-names-mahalaxmi-yojana-launched-in-ukhand/articleshow/84507762.cms||Kautilya Singh

Bharne said the pandemic had led to a strain on the state’s finances, so it was unable to conduct MPSC exams for 18 months.“There are students who worked really hard but could not appear for the exam as they were not conducted, and some students clearing interviews were not given appointments. But the impact of Covid-19 is reducing a bit and we can assure you that your hard work won’t go in vain,” the minister said.Bharne announced that many meetings were held between ministers and MPSC officials. “We will urgently conduct interviews of 6,998 students pending since 2019. MPSC conducts the interviews. It is supposed to have one chairman and five members but four posts are vacant. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has announced that the posts will be filled before July 31. Following the Kerala model, we will recruit more people to the commission so that the load of over 6,000 interviews can be distributed and completed in time,” said Bharne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/min-mpsc-interviews-pending-since-2019-to-be-conducted-soon/articleshow/84513346.cms||Ardhra Nair

The commissioner along with divisional forest officer of the social forestry division, Varanasi, Mahaveer Kaujalgi, camped on the commissioner’s office compound in the morning to monitor the process of transplanting big trees to vacate the land on which ICC’s twin buildings will be constructed. The commissioner said it is for the first time in East UP when efforts are being made to ensure that no fully green tree is sacrificed for any development project. The twin-towers project is coming on 3-acre land in the commissioner office compound spread over 6.44 acres. It will also have the first skywalk at the top floor of the twin buildings, he added. Regarding transplantation of trees, the DFO said, “A total of 73 full grown trees have been identified for transplantation. The average age of these trees is 25 years. Apart from Ficus, many other varieties including Sagaun, Amaltash, Kachnar, Gulmohar and Mango trees are mainly being shifted to Central Jail premises, where 12 trees have already been transplanted in the past one week. Many trees are also being relocated in commissioner office premises.” For the transplantation, a Delhi-based company has been engaged, said the DFO adding, as per the contract, this company is charging Rs 11,000 for transplantation of each tree. “Half of this money is paid in advance while the remaining amount would be paid after one year of maintenance of the transplanted tree and ensuring its survival. With the process of transplantation, the department has also started a detailed study for utilising this method of saving trees in future projects,” he added. About the progress in the ICC project, the commissioner said its detailed project report had been sent to the state government a week ago for approval. Total estimated cost of the project is around Rs 400 crore and the government will not spend money from its own exchequer as the project is based on the PPP model. “After government nod is received, the process of finalising all paper works and floating RFC will be completed by August end,” said commissioner. For better coordination between different government offices associated with the divisional commissioner and also to avoid inconvenience for people coming from neighbouring districts of the division, the ICC was sanctioned for the PM’s parliamentary constituency and Gorakhpur, the home turf of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, in the pilot project. “A government order was received here in January,” he said adding, “the basic exercise of site selection, tentative expenditure on constructing ICC building and arranging budget on PPP model instead of depending on the state government for funds, were conducted. It was followed by the appointment of a Nagpur based firm as transactional advisor for the project.” One tower will accommodate 44 government offices while the other will be totally commercial to generate revenue for the project and maintenance. Each tower will have a double-floor basement parking facility. Currently, offices of 12-13 departments are running in their own buildings while others are being operated at rental accommodation where their maintenance is also very poor. Only the regional sports office will not come to the ICC as the RSO office can run from the stadium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/in-a-first-in-east-up-big-trees-being-transplanted-to-vacate-land-for-icc/articleshow/84509470.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Pune||Murder suspect held at Indo-Nepal border||Pune: The Pune rural police on Tuesday arrested a citizen of Nepal (21) from a place in Bihar near the Indo-Nepal border on the charge of murder. The police identified the suspect as Niranjan Sahani, who used to work at a furniture shop in Saswad. The incident had happened at Borkar Vasti in Saswad on July 9, when Sahani had brutally attacked and killed his friend Bhagwan Markad (45) with a stick in an inebriated state over a petty dispute. In a bid to destroy the evidence, the suspect dumped Markad’s body on a bank of a nullah. He then fled to his native village in Nepal. “A police team under inspector Appasaheb Gholap found out that the victim was last seen with Sahani. We obtained the suspect’s photograph and traced his location to Nepal,” inspector Rahul Ghuge said. Ghuge added, “We reached the Indo-Nepal border and after conducting investigations it was learnt that Sahani will be visiting a weekly bazaar in Bihar. Disguised as locals, we laid a trap and took the suspect into custody on July 13 from the bazaar.” The suspect was brought to Pune Wednesday night and during the questioning, he admitted his involvement in the murder. Sahani has been remanded to police custody till July 19. The victim’s wife has registered an FIR relating to murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/murder-suspect-held-at-indo-nepal-border/articleshow/84511561.cms||---
---||Pune||Single shot for 75% population in 30 days may cut deaths, says ICMR||PUNE: An Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) modelling study recently published in Lancet has stated that single dose vaccination of 75% population in a 30-day period was found to substantially reduce mortality by up to 37% and symptomatic infections by 26% in a district witnessing the beginning of another Covid wave. The study stated that the test positivity rate crossing an example threshold value of 0.5% in the period between two Covid-19 waves in a region could provide a timely alert for the emergence of the next wave. The study suggested employing a technique called “rapid-response vaccination” in a hypothetical district immediately upon the test positivity crossing the threshold of 0·5%, to reduce the local resurgence of Covid-19 at the start of another wave. Dr Samiran Panda, chief of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, told TOI, “As per this technique, we concentrated on a vaccination strategy that prioritises the widest possible coverage with single-dose vaccination, in which it takes one month to cover 75% of the population aged 18 years or above with a single dose. We found that such rapid and focused vaccination efforts alone could substantially reduce mortality by up to 37% in a district witnessing the beginning of another Covid wave.” He said the appropriate test positivity rate thresholds for other districts in India could be arrived at to employ rapid vaccination strategies to cut down resurging infections during the start of another wave. As per the study, if non-pharmaceutical measures, such as mandatory mask wearing, restrictions on gatherings and stay-at-home, could be adopted along with rapid response vaccination, transmission could reduce by 25%. “If these measures are implemented for one month in the district at the same time as the vaccination drive, the model projections suggest that overall deaths could be reduced by up to 45% for a Covid infection with reproduction rate of 2, and by 30% for that with a reproduction rate of 3,” he said. The model included practical assumptions on the effect of vaccination, including that, once vaccinated, people take an average three weeks to develop immunity. Thus, a single vaccine dose could offer 60% protection against severe disease and death, but could not protect against contracting Covid itself, the study findings indicated. The vaccine efficacy was based on published estimates of 76% protection from symptomatic infection, following a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India. Giving another example of rapid and agile vaccination protocol, Dr Panda said, “Clearing off trees in the path of a fast-raging forest fire will ensure that gradually, there would not be any trees for the fire to catch on to. It is like creating a fence to prevent the fire from progressing further. Similarly, when a district crosses its threshold test positivity rate indicating a resurgence in infections, vaccination in the surrounding districts with lower test positivity rate could be ramped up to prevent the infection catching on to them.” This is also to tackle the limited stores of vaccines and using them smartly at times of a rise in infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-single-shot-for-75-in-30-days-may-cut-deaths/articleshow/84511569.cms||Neha Madaan

Around 7 am, passers-by saw smoke coming out of Bhawani Enterprises, located near Brihaspati Dev Temple. They informed the police personnel at the nearby Awas Vikas police outpost. Subsequently, firefighters were pressed into service and Manish Agrawal, the owner of the store, was informed of the fire accident. “As no one was inside the store at the time, there were no casualties. However, the fire had spread to both floors when we reached the spot,” said an official from the fire department. He added that computer equipment and other electrical appliances were stored on the ground and the first floor of the building. “We suspect it was an accidental fire caused by a short circuit,” said the fire officials. Meanwhile, Agrawal has said that it took almost one hour for the firefighters to reach the spot. “The entire store was engulfed in flames by the time they arrived. Timely action could have averted the huge loss,” lamented Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/electronics-store-gutted-in-us-nagar-goods-worth-rs-20l-damaged/articleshow/84507827.cms||Aakash Ahuja

The industry heads sought standard operating procedures (SOPs) to resume activities following all Covid protocols during their interactions with the district collectors. “The SOPs issued will be for all industries to ensure their seamless functioning ahead of the impending threat of the third wave,” Singh said. The collectors would draw up plans for districts concerned after taking inputs from the industry bodies. Singh said the matter was discussed during a video conference with all the collectors on Friday evening. Relief and rehabilitation secretary Assem Gupta said the movement towards normal socio-economic activities hinged on vaccination. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “If SOPs are given, the industries can adhere to the guidelines.” Industry representatives said SOPs would be easier to execute and monitor. The chairman of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade, Mohan Gurnani, said, “District-wise, and area-wise assessment should be done to work out a way to resume activities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sops-for-industries-soon-says-principal-secy/articleshow/84511617.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The state has demanded 3 crore vaccines every month from the centre. For July, the state was allocated 1.15 crore vaccines. The state government had requested the Centre to dispatch another 1.50 crore vaccines. “Sending teams, which will visit places for one or two days, may not help either them or us to get a clear picture of the situation,” he said. “Priority should be given to increase vaccine supply. Now all states know what strategies needed to be adopted. What is important is implementing them earnestly,” he said. A central team is currently touring all the affected districts in the state. Dr Salunkhe said that there is a need for the state to stress on more institutional isolation for those do not have such facilities at home, With 10 districts showing a high positivity rate, he said that the overall strategy of testing, tracing and tracking was being followed but districts with high positivity rate need to intensify vaccination. “We need more vaccines for the most affected districts. This is where the Centre has to do the hand-holding,” Dr Salunkhe said. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the state has the capacity to speed up vaccination provided they receive the required doses.  On Friday, too, the state had requested for more vaccine doses from the centre. Asked about the vaccine dose allocation for the private sector, Dr Salunkhe said that at present it is 25% and the centre has no plans to reduce private hospital allocation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-should-send-more-doses-rather-than-dispatching-teams/articleshow/84511582.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Pune||Women gamers’ community in India has grown exponentially during the pandemic||PUNE: Women are increasingly breaching traditionally male bastion of gaming. During the pandemic, there has been a spurt in women gamers, especially those who have made a profession out of it. A recent report by the All India Gaming Federation found that there were 365 million online gamers in the country in 2020, with the number expected to rise to 510 million by 2022, with a corresponding growth of in women gamers. According to the ‘Think with Google APAC – Play like a Girl Report, 2020’, the number of women in India who began using the internet on their smartphones grew annually from 19% to 42%. Of these, 95% use smartphones to play games, indicating a huge potential for growth in Asia’s market. Rashi Agarwal (25) recalls how her younger brother got her hooked to ‘Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds (or PUBG)’ during last year’s lockdown. She now spends a couple of hours playing the game after work every day. “It was a great way to talk to friends and play together. The community of women players, including those who play professionally, is growing rapidly. It’s become normal to have one or more women on your squad,” she said. Women gamers span genres — adventure, first-person shooters, multiplayer online battle arenas, survivalist horror, virtual sports, or strategy. Monisha Dewani (25) made it a point to try out new games on different platforms over the year. “Right now, it’s easier for a woman to become a gamer. Viewers are more interested to see a woman’s gameplay or livestream for the novelty,” she said. Mitsu Chavda (29) influencer and e-sports legal advisor, was introduced to the world of multiplayer gaming through first-generation Counter Strike while growing up. Today she is popular as ‘Queen Hawk’ or ‘iDramaQueen’ among those who play ‘Free Fire’ or ‘Call of Duty (mobile)’, even as she juggles studies, work, and gaming. “After morning classes, I have to go to court. I then play from about 9pm to 2-3am,” she said. Chavda points out many women have represented India in international gaming tournaments or regularly participate in cash-rich competitions. “If one wants to become a professional gamer, one must hone one’s skills, improve gameplay, practice in a mixed squad, build a portfolio that will help reach out to sponsors,” she added. There is a flipside to women playing games. “Women are often targeted in these multiplayer online games, bullied and verbally abused by other players,” she said. Experts said it was good to indulge in gaming, stressing that it was important not to overdo it. “If gaming is affecting jobs or personal life, then it is a red flag,” said psychologist Shobna Das. “It is important for gamers to keep physically fit and exercise daily; wrap up an hour before bedtime to help with better sleep cycle,” physician Ashish Agarwal. Shubhangini Iyer (21) said, “Gamers must also avoid strain to their eyes and consider glasses with blue light filters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/women-gamers-community-has-grown-exponentially-during-the-pandemic/articleshow/84511651.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The board’s deputy director, J G Pandya, said that most students who required grace marks to pass were granted five grace marks by the Board.  Nearly 1% students required a more generous approach and were awarded more than 5 marks. About 100-odd students were given as many as 140 grace marks, Pandya said. Unlike Class 10 results, there was no mass promotion declared for Class 12 students, though their exams were cancelled on account of the surge in Covid-19 pandemic. The results of Class 12 students were decided on basis of their past performance. It was only by giving grace marks that the 100% success ratio for Class 12 Science stream students was achieved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/grace-marks-go-up-to-140-to-make-all-pass/articleshow/84511730.cms||---

Generally, the rainfall will be heavy to very heavy in two districts on both days,” said Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji. While the wet spell has continued since July 12 — recording nearly 500mm (19.7 inches) of rainfall in six days — chances of a respite are remote, as a low pressure area is likely to form over the northwest Bay of Bengal on Wednesday. “Very heavy rainfall is likely for about a week,” the scientist said. On Saturday, the circulation was prevailing over coastal Andhra Pradesh and its neighbourhood, while an offshore trough was spanning at mean sea level from the Maharashtra coast to the Karnataka coast. An eastwest trough was also running from the north Arabian Sea to the cyclonic circulation over coastal Andhra Pradesh. The wind will occasionally gust to 50 km per hour along with rain spells, which may increase in intensity in short durations. IMD, Panaji has issued a caution to monitor sites vulnerable to flooding and landslides. The water level in rivers may also rise due to the intensification of rainfall. On Saturday, the seasonal total had touched 1,740mm (68.5 inches) as compared to the normal of 1480mm, a surplus of 17%. During the past 24 hours, Mormugao recorded the highest rainfall, 110mm, while Dabolim recorded 97mm, Panaji 95.1mm, and Quepem and Old Goa 80mm each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-respite-red-alert-for-today-very-heavy-rain-likely-this-wk/articleshow/84511726.cms||---

The CJI commended the efforts and decision of the high court judges to conduct proceedings in screen, and he said that while this is in the right direction, “one must tread the path with caution. At times, livestreaming of court proceedings may prove a double-edged sword. The judges might feel the pressure of public scrutiny, which may result in stressful environment that may not be conducive to justice dispensation.” Justice Ramana further said that a judge must not be swayed by popular opinion, because the public gaze may lead to multiple debates. But this must not deter the judge from performing his constitutional duty with objectivity. The chief justice also stressed on the necessity to protect privacy of the litigants and security of witnesses in this mode of court proceedings. He said that there is a need to draft rules carefully. The CJI said that this direct access of court proceedings to common people would eliminate the transmission loss caused due to media reporting, which leads to misinterpretation of questions asked and observations made by courts due to absence of context. “Vested interests are eager to amplify these misinterpretations in order to embarrass and discredit the institution,” he said and added that the direct access of court hearings through livestreaming would eliminate misconceptions and there would be little room for any mischief. Another Supreme Court judge, D Y Chandrachud, said that he was glad that his judgment delivered three years ago is seeing the light of the day. He echoed the thought of Gujarat’s chief justice, Vikram Nath, that this should have trickle-down effect on district judiciary and the model might be replicated by other high courts across the nation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cji-warns-judges-of-public-gaze-burden-in-livestreaming/articleshow/84511732.cms||---

The committee, headed by the commissioner of education, has been asked to submit its report in 15 days. The five-member committee has also been asked to provide recommendations to prevent a repeat of the problems faced on Friday in future. The state board had announced Std X results online at 1 pm on Friday. However, almost immediately the website crashed due to its inability to handle high traffic. Students were unable to access results. Finally, at 7pm, the state board released two other links for students to access their results. Even so, the problem persisted to some extent, with many school managements and students unable to view results until late in the night. The government resolution, released on Saturday, has told the committee to identify the people responsible for the problem and to investigate whether the state board chairman had organised a meeting with everyone concerned prior to announcing the result; whether the technical advisors concerned in the state board were notified in advance regarding the announcement of results; whether the website maintenance company was given advance notice to announce the result; whether a trial run was conducted to check the working of the website and whether the server of required capacity was used to declare the result.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/committee-to-probe-delay-in-accessing-ssc-results/articleshow/84511701.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘17 European countries have cleared Covishield for travel’||Pune: Adar Poonawalla, owner and CEO of Covishield-maker Serum Institute of India (SII), on Saturday dismissed the need for a “marketing authorisation application” to the European Union, saying 16 of the 27 member countries and Switzerland (not part of the EU) have currently approved the vaccine based on the WHO’s pre-qualification or emergency use listing (EUL). France on Saturday became the latest EU member to approve Covishield for travel. Poonawalla told TOI: “With the addition of France, 16 of the 27 EU countries have already approved Covishield, including Germany and Netherlands. Switzerland, which is not a part of the EU, has also accepted it. Slowly, every EU nation is accepting Covishield. But Italy and a few others have not approved it yet. We did not make any application to those who have approved it. Europe, the US and everyone else have to acknowledge that this vaccine (Covishield) is of good quality because WHO has approved it.” In the EU, while the majority of the new medicines are evaluated by European Medicines Agency (EMA), regulatory bodies in each country can also independently authorise use of a vaccine in their jurisdictions. Covishield, manufactured under technology transfer from Oxford/AstraZeneca, is currently not among the authorised vaccines under EMA. On July 15, EMA said it had not received an application from SII for authorisation of Covishield, almost a fortnight after EU had introduced the EU Digital Covid Certificate, which makes intra-EU travel possible. Poonawalla said, “Marketing authorisation application is made when a manufacturer intends to sell its vaccine in that country. We cannot apply because we are not selling Covishield in Europe. Europe is not even our territory, where we intend to sell and we don’t even have the licence from AstraZeneca to do that. We have no plans to even export our vaccine. So the question of us putting in an application does not arise at all.” He said AstraZeneca is working with EMA to get approval in other EU countries. A WHO pre-qualification, or EUL, is given after assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines. “If the vaccine is approved by WHO, it should be a good passport certificate for travel,” Poonawalla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-17-european-countries-have-cleared-covishield-for-travel/articleshow/84512151.cms||Umesh Isalkar

These are people who received their first shot in early May, when the drive opened for all adults. Health department estimates indicate more than 50,000 Covishield beneficiaries in the district (inoculated with first doses from May 1-7) would have completed the 12-week interval (after the first jab) by July 30. At least 19,000 from this number are people from the 18-44 group. Pune also has the highest number of target beneficiaries in the 18-44 group - nearly 52 lakh. Nearly 35 lakh people from that total are yet to receive their first dose, health department data showed. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), said, "Vaccine availability has now increased, and we are fully prepared to cater to the upcoming surge in second-dose beneficiaries. In general, we have sensed a bit of hesitancy towards the second dose among healthcare staff, frontline workers and those in the 18-44 group. Hesitancy towards the second shot has been relatively low in the 45-plus and 60-plus groups. A reluctance to get the second dose could be because of the falling Covid cases, something that was seen in January and February as well." He added that the PMC, PCMC and the Pune rural administration have been asked to prepare a list and follow up with people who are due for a second shot. "We have a wider contact base with beneficiaries in rural areas, where they can be contacted to get second doses. But that may not be totally possible in urban centres. Still, efforts are on to complete the schedule of everyone who is due," Deshmukh said. He also said the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) had 600 operational vaccination centres when daily inoculation had hit a high of 1.41 lakh doses. "Overall, the district has 700 centres that can go live as the number of second-dose beneficiaries swells. The number of average daily beneficiaries can be easily increased to 200 per session, by adding more vaccinators at sites," he said. Private hospitals are also expected to play a key role when many in the 18-44 group become eligible for a second dose. Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of the Symbiosis Society, which has three sites - at Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, Lavale; Senapati Bapat Road; and Vimannagar - said the hospital had recently purchased one lakh Covishield doses for first and second-dose beneficiaries." Rajendra Patankar, CEO of Jupiter Hospital, said, "Instead of being hesitant, more and more people should come forward to get the jabs, both first and second doses. This is the only way to beat the pandemic. The second-dose due date for 18-44 beneficiaries is approaching in the next few days, and is expected to significantly push up the number of daily vaccinations at private centres beginning July last week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-sites-brace-for-rush-as-nearly-50000-people-near-due-date-for-covishield-2nd-dose/articleshow/84511712.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kolkata||Relief marks first public exam after second wave in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The first physical public exam after the second wave of the pandemic, WBJEE, passed smoothly on Saturday. Though 92,695 candidates had registered for the exam, many remained absent at exam centres. This time, the WBJEE Board had set up a large number of centres so that candidates did not have to travel more than 5-6km to take the test. A large number of ‘exam special’ buses plied throughout the day. Railways and Metro allowed candidates to travel by staff special trains. Despite such massive arrangements, a large number of parents chose to take their children to the exam centre by booking app cabs or on bikes. “I had the option of taking the local train from Nungi but when I found that the app cab was costing me just Rs 200 till Chetla Boys High School, I booked it because I wanted the child to go comfortably,” said candidate Arijit Bera’s mother. Soumyodip Das, a student of Nava Nalanda, too, chose an app cab and did not want to risk travelling by Metro from Haridevpur. Ritam Dey, a student of St Augustine’s Shyamnagar, went to his exam centre at Barrackpore on his father’s bike. “The centre was 6kms away and we did not want to look for an exam special bus. We wanted to reach well before time and so I rode pillion,” he said. Sanjana Gupta, a student of Ballygunj Shiksha Sadan, too, booked an app cab from her Gariahat residence to reach her centre at Santoshpur. Outside almost every exam centre, worried parents sat throughout the day, beating the sweltering heat. “We are a bit worried because of the Covid situation but it was also important for the children to write the entrance test. Otherwise, how will merit be tested?” said Dibyojyoti Mukherjee, whose son, a student of DPS-Ruby Park, was a candidate at Jadav-pur Vidyapith. A large number of candidates were absent in this centre. “Out of 450 candidates, only 290 came to the exam centre. This was natural in the Covid situation. I am sure this would be the case at other centres too,” said Parimal Bhattacharya, exam in-charge of the centre. All candidates were masked and carried sanitiser bottles and water bottles to the centre. Arrangements for extra masks and sanitisers had been done by the Board at each centre. Every centre was sanitised on Friday. “The arrangements we had done were inspected by the WBJEE Board,” said Jadavpur University VC Suranjan Das. The exam took place in two shifts — from 11am to 1pm for mathematics and then again from 2pm to 4pm for physics and chemistry. Candidates were happy with the papers and said that though maths was a bit difficult, physics and chemistry were comparatively easier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/relief-marks-first-public-exam-after-second-wave/articleshow/84509594.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

He had stated that 13,584 bedridden people had responded to the state’s awareness drive for home vaccination. A high court bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni is hearing a PIL filed by advocate Dhruti Kapadia for door-step jabs to the elderly, home-bound and bedridden people. Hearing in the matter will continue on Monday. Meanwhile, BMC’s vaccine update on Saturday said that 60,152 people were vaccinated, taking the number of vaccine doses given out in the city so far to 64.5 lakh. On Saturday, BMC vaccinated 31,261 people under its free vaccination programme while the private sector vaccinated 26,228 people. The latest beneficiaries, pregnant women, still turned up in small numbers; on Saturday, 26 pregnant women took the vaccine, taking the total count to 51 so far. The state’s vaccination figures for Friday stated that 6.2 lakh people were vaccinated, including 2.5 lakh in the 18-44 age group.

---||Pune||17 European nations have cleared Covishield, says Adar Poonawalla||PUNE: Owner and CEO of Covishield-maker Serum Institute of India (SII), Adar Poonawalla, on Saturday dismissed the need for a 'marketing authorisation application' to the European Union (EU), saying 16 of the 27 member countries and Switzerland (not part of the EU) have currently approved the vaccine based on the WHO's pre-qualification or Emergency Use Listing (EUL). France on Saturday became the latest EU member country to approve Covishield for travel. Poonawalla told TOI, "With the addition of France, 16 of the 27 EU countries have already approved Covishield, including Germany, and Netherlands. Switzerland, which is not a part of the EU, has also accepted it. Slowly, every EU nation is accepting Covishield. But Italy and a few others have not approved it yet. We did not make any application to those who have approved it. Europe, the US, and everyone else have to acknowledge that this vaccine (Covishield) is of good quality because WHO has approved it." In the EU, there are two main routes for authorising vaccines: a centralised route and a national route. While the majority of the new and innovative medicines are evaluated by European Medicines Agency (EMA), regulatory bodies in each country can also independently authorise use of a vaccine within their jurisdictions. Covishield, manufactured under technology transfer from Oxford/AstraZeneca, is currently not among the authorised vaccines under the EMA. This lack of authorisation for Covishield has been creating hurdles for Indian travellers. On July 15, the EMA said it had not received an application from the SII for authorisation of Covishield, almost a fortnight after the EU had introduced the EU Digital Covid Certificate, which makes intra-EU travel possible. "For the Covid-19 vaccine Covishield to be evaluated for use in the EU, the developer needs to submit a formal marketing authorisation application to the EMA, which to date has not been received," the EMA said at a press meeting. In his response, Poonawalla said, "Marketing authorisation application is made when a manufacturer intends to sell its vaccine in that country. We cannot apply because we are not selling Covishield in Europe. Europe is not even our territory, where we intend to sell and we don't even have the license from AstraZeneca to do that. We have no plans to even export our vaccine. So the question of us putting in an application does not arise at all." Poonawalla said AstraZeneca is working with the EMA to get approval in other EU countries. "We have no local standing to deal with them (the EMA). AstraZeneca is dealing with them," he said. About efforts being made to address concerns among those traveling to the EU, Poonawalla said, "We have already written to all the countries. We have talked to all our diplomats. Our foreign offices have taken it up. We have also taken up the matter directly with these countries, AstraZeneca and also with the WHO. The efforts have already yielded results in the form of 16 EU countries acknowledging Covishield based on WHO's pre-qualification." Sixteen EU countries and Switzerland have confirmed they will accept travellers who have received Covishield. The list includes Austria, France, Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden, he said. A WHO pre-qualification, or Emergency Use Listing (EUL), is given after assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines. It allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approvals. "If the vaccine is approved by the WHO, it should be a good passport certificate for travel," Poonawalla said. So far, the EMA has approved only those vaccinated by any of the four vaccines - Comirnaty of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna's Spikevax, Vaxzervria by AstraZeneca-Oxford and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen - for restriction-free travel within the EU during the pandemic. This means people vaccinated with Covishield may be subject to quarantine protocols as enforced by individual member countries, and may even be blocked from entering some.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/17-european-nations-have-cleared-covishield/articleshow/84511810.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The corridor is being executed by Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) through the concessionaire, Tata-Siemens. PMRDA officials said they were waiting for Rs 1,224.8 crore from the central government under its share of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) — under which the government funds a portion of the project. The officials said the project’s VGF stands at Rs 2,351 crore, of which the state government would provide Rs 1,126.2 crore by way of a land bank. The total cost of the project is Rs 6,124 crore. “The proposal to sanction the Centre’s VGF share has been forwarded to the Department of Expenditure and is under scrutiny by the empowered committee,” officials said; PMRDA expects to receive the funds this month. PMRDA officials further said the “appointed date” — the date of commencement of the concession period — will be announced this month. The project is expected to be completed in 40 months from the appointed date, while the concession agreement is for a 35-year period, with an option to extend for a further 25 years. “Barricading work has begun at various spots along the route in Hinjewadi, Balewadi, Baner and Ganeshkhind Road, while soil-testing, structural-designing and work at the 15.5-hectare casting yard has also commenced,” an official said. Officials in the loop attributed the delay in announcing the appointed date to the delay in land acquisition, as the concessionaire must have 100% of the land in hand before moving ahead with the project. “With 96% of the land in hand, the acquisition of the rest should be wrapped up soon,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/96-land-in-hand-for-metros-hinjewadi-shivajinagar-line/articleshow/84511767.cms||Nisha Nambiar

DPIIT’s Start-Up India mission held a meeting in Delhi to select the incubators after which FiiRE was selected as an incubator to disburse seed funds to startups. The Centre started the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) to provide financial assistance to startups for proof of concept, prototype development, product trials, market entry, and commercialization with an outlay of Rs 994 crore. In April, then Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal had unveiled the Startup India Seed Fund scheme and had said that early-stage startups across 300 incubation centres, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities would be supported. “The primary task at hand is to ensure that start-ups are made aware of the schemes available and the channels of communication are open for founders and startup entrepreneurs,” said Prashant. He said that FiiRE is getting a lot of inquiries from startups from across the country but very little interest from the local startup ecosystem. Established with the support of the Centre’s Department of Science & Technology, FiiRE supports early stage technology ventures working on innovation, development or improvement of products, processes or services. “FiiRE will also handhold the interested startups through counseling and training, which is initiated from this month,” said Prashant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/centre-selects-state-incubator-for-startups/articleshow/84511739.cms||Newton Sequeira

Last year, after differences cropped up between them, the woman’s husband had in a letter to the then SSP claimed that his wife’s real name is Reena Yadav and not ‘Saroj Yadav’ as shown in her documents. He had also alleged that she changed the date of birth in her educational documents. A probe by circle officer, Kotwali, Indu Sidharth found the allegations to be true. Amit Kumar Anand, SP (City), said,” It has also come to light that the constable’s husband had helped her to forge the documents.” An FIR has been registered against both Reena Yadav (Saroj Yadav) and her husband, Arvind Yadav, under IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonesty inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-cop-suspended-booked-along-with-husband-for-forging-docus-to-get-job/articleshow/84507918.cms||Maria Khan

This was mandatory for every examinee. He left his bag inside and rushed out of the hall to look for his father. Other parents who stood near the gate were alarmed at the way he ran about. Finally, his parent was located and he rushed home to get the student’s photograph. Other parents who were waiting outside tried to encourage him as best as they could. His father managed to return only at 11.15am and the student was not allowed to write the exam. Some parents, like Dibyajyoti Mukherjee, whose son was also at this centre, went in to plead the boy’s case, but it was in vain. “The boy could have come and explained his case to us. Instead, he left the centre and stood outside waiting for his father. We couldn’t allow a candidate in after 11am since it would have been against the rules,” said centre in-charge Parimal Bhattacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidate-forgets-pic-misses-test-for-stepping-out-of-hall/articleshow/84509634.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Vaishnav held a meeting with CM Rupani at his Gandhinagar residence on Saturday. A detailed project report (DPR) has been prepared by Western Railway in the matter and sent to the railways ministry. The report is in the final stages of consideration. The Ahmedabad-Rajkot Semi High Speed Rail project will be completed on an elevated corridor. Under the proposed project, the distance of 225 kilometres between Ahmedabad and Rajkot will be covered in under two hours. The train will run at a maximum speed of up to 220kmph. A government release said that once the Ahmedabad-Rajkot semi high speed rail project and the bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai are complete, people from eleven districts of Saurashtra will be able to visit Mumbai and return back to their respective places within a day. Once complete, the project is expected to substantially decrease the volume of road traffic on the Ahmedabad-Rajkot stretch and provide people with a clean and faster mode of transport between the two cities. The CM also briefed the railway minister about Gujarat’s new approach to ‘Level Crossing Free’ railway network, constructing 59 Railway Overbridges (ROB) and Underbridges (RUB) at a cost of Rs 1,202-crore, as part of the state’s initiative for Ease of Living and Ease of Transportation goals.

---||Goa||Goa: Can’t disregard safety of people when tourism starts, says Minister of state for tourism Shripad Naik||PANAJI: Minister of state for tourism Shripad Naik said the state will have to strike a balance between complying with standard operating procedures (SOPs) and tourism activities as the economy of Goa is dependent on the latter. Tourism has to be started sooner or later. “When tourists are allowed into Goa, it needs to be seen that all protocols in place are followed thoroughly. It should not look like that in a bid to uplift the economy, the safety of people is neglected when the danger of the third wave is looming large,” Naik told TOI on Friday. After mining came to a standstill, Naik said, Goa’s reliance on tourism rose. During the pandemic, it has suffered setbacks, and needs help in its deadliest crises. As a tourism minister, he said it will be his priority to ensure that Goa develops all required facilities for tourists. As to ensure that Goa gets benefits from the central schemes under his ministry. The projects that he said, will be finalised after a discussion with chief minister Pramod Sawant and tourism minister Manohar Ajgaokar. “We haven’t had a formal meeting to discuss tourism projects for the State yet,” he said. His priority will also be to see that the projects that were taken during his first stint as the tourism minister, are completed without further delay, he said. Since he was allocated tourism portfolio last week, the representatives of tourism trade have submitted him memorandums, seeking assistance for the revival of the economy. “I will discuss with the union tourism minister with regards to a request by the trade if a date can be announced in advance when charters will be permitted to land," he said. Since October last year, the tourism stakeholders have been asking that bubble travel be established with countries that Goa receives charter tourists from. The date from which international tourists will be allowed in the country be declared two to three months prior, facilitating marketing and promotional activities. Naik said when international travel restrictions will be lifted, tourists could be allowed in with a covid negative certificate or if they are fully vaccinated. “We can’t afford to lower the guard and people will require to strictly follow measures against Covid-19,” he said. Tourism trade is expecting that the central government will allow international tourists in two to three months, as the latter has recently announced 5 lakh free visas. This gesture, the trade thinks is in line with the Centre’s plan to commence international tourism in a few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cant-disregard-safety-of-people-when-tourism-starts-shripad/articleshow/84511773.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Ahmedabad||‘Second wave was three times bigger in India’||Ahmedabad: India, which recorded a major surge in Covid-19 cases in April and May, was among the top countries in terms of daily cases during its second wave. To put India’s second wave in perspective, experts said that it was three times (344%) bigger compared to the first wave. The figures were 280% for the US and 135% in the UK. The data was shared by Dr Girdhara Babu, professor of epidemiology at Public Health Foundation of India during a webinar on theme of ‘Covid 2021 and Beyond: Epidemiology, Clinical Care and Public Policy’ organized by IIPH Gandhinagar and Collaboration to Eliminate TB among Indians (CETI) on Saturday. “The current pace of vaccination will decide how fast we are going to get the third wave. The future mutations could be more infectious. Along with strengthening healthcare sector, we must also focus on non-pharmaceutical intervention like wearing masks to safeguard against the rise in numbers,” said Dr Babu. Prof Dileep Mavalankar, director of IIPH-G, said that the event attempted at putting both the waves of the pandemic experienced by the country in perspective and share learning from the past one and a half years. Prof T Jacob John from CMC Vellore said that the two waves covered a large population of the country, and subsequent sero surveys have shown significant increase. Thus, chances of a severe third wave may be less. Dr Manoj Jain, professor of health policy at Emory University, US, agreed, and said that the impact of third wave may be low compared to the second as vaccination may play a big role in immunization. “We have examples of Mississippi and Massachusetts — where the first is recording rise in cases due to low vaccination, the scenario is inversed in the second,” he said. Experts also stressed on post-Covid implications and other infections. For example, 7% of Covid patients had bacterial and 3.2% had fungal infection right at the time of treatment, said Dr D J Christopher in his presentation. Dr Harikrishnan S said that Covid patients run three times higher risk of cardiovascular complications. Prof Deepak Saxena, one of the convenors, said that about 1,300 national and international delegates participated in the virtual event and covered a spectrum of topics ranging from the experience in the US to post-Covid complications and role of NGOs to microbiology of the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-wave-was-three-times-bigger-in-india/articleshow/84511868.cms||Parth Shastri

Singh said the matter was discussed during a video-conference with all the collectors late on Friday evening. He said the SOP would be finalised in consultation with relief and rehabilitation and health departments.Relief and rehabilitation secretary Assem Gupta told TOI that the movement towards normal socio-economic activities hinged on vaccination. “It will surely become one of the important criteria in discussions when the state considers opening up,” he said.Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, who attended the Friday’s meeting, said, “There were several demands from the industry and if an outline or an SOP is given, they can adhere to the guidelines.”The SOP is expected to give clear guidelines on travel, timings and the number of people in industrial units in each shift. The units would have to follow all the Covid protocols and ensure that there is no unnecessary rush.Industry representatives said the SOP would be easier to execute and monitor at units. Mohan Gurnani, chairman of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade, said the government should step in and take decisions to help all kinds of medium and small industries, and traders. “Districts such as Sangli have had closure of shops for the past three months. District-wise, and even area-wise, assessment should be done to work out a way to resume activities,” he said.Recently, the state had constituted a Covid-19 task force for the industrial sector to ensure that the economic activities did not stop because of the pandemic. The chief minister discussed oxygen production, mass vaccination of workers in the units and staggered working hours, among other things, during a recent meeting with the industries’ representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sop-likely-for-industries-with-eye-on-possible-third-wave/articleshow/84511841.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The authority also made a presentation to members of all political parties, who pushed for a discussion in the upcoming general body meeting.The flyover will be part of the viaduct of the Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar Metro corridor, being developed by PMRDA.Congress corporator Aba Bagul said they sought clarity on the financial burden. “During PMRDA’s presentation, we got the impression that PMC will have to incur the expenses for the project. It has already been decided that PMC will not spend money to demolish the existing flyovers and build new structures. The PMC should not incur any expense. We want the proposal to be discussed at the general body to get clarity about the design and expenses,” Bagul explained.Once the PMC gives the go-ahead, PMRDA will chalk out the execution plan, which includes managing traffic during the construction.Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said they were leaning towards approving the design. “A proposal states that expenses of the underpasses, which are part of the project, are to be incurred by PMC. We will discuss this issue, but also ensure the project is not delayed,” the mayor said.The flyover will have wings towards Aundh, Baner and Pashan, apart from underpasses and pedestrian facilities.Shivajinagar legislator Siddharth Shirole said they will take all sets to ensure traffic is smoothly managed during the construction of the flyover. “The design is now with PMC. The civic body is expected to give the go-ahead in the next few days,” Shirole said.Last August, the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority had demolisted two flyovers -- the one at University Chowk and the one at E-Square to make way for the new flyover. Earlier, several options, including marginally shifting the Metro alignment to not disturb the flyovers was considered, but the authorities decided that a new, multi-tier flyover would be expeditious. The flyovers were demolished during a 14-day lockdown imposed in July-August 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/multi-level-university-flyover-design-awaits-pmc-approval/articleshow/84511829.cms||Sarang Dastane

Thirty-four-year-old Moumita Mali, however, was not infected by Covid but suffered a miscarriage at home that had led to serious complications forcing her on to life support. The homemaker from Bhadrakhali was rushed to the obstetrics and gynaecology department on March 11 with abdomen pain and vaginal bleeding. She had a history of spontaneous abortion. Doctors at the department immediately conducted an ERPC (evacuation of retained products of conception) under general anaesthesia, a procedure to remove pregnancy tissues from the womb after miscarriage. Further evaluation found the patient was severely infected (sepsis) by then and had multiple organ dysfunctions, including acute kidney failure. Doctors also found that she had severe pneumonia, causing acute respiratory failure. Mali was shifted to the hospital’s critical care unit (CCU) and was put on ventilator on March 11 itself. “She started recovering from kidney failure after 13 sessions of dialysis. But the ventilation had to be continued due to intra-tracheal bleeding issues from formation of granulation tissue in the trachea and non-resolving pneumonia,” said CCU physician professor Sugata Dasgupta who heads the CCU. Due to the complex condition of the patient, apart from the CCU team under Dasgupta and gynaecology & obstetrics team headed by gynaecologist Aparna Mondal, the treatment called for the involvement of an ENT team led by Indranath Kundu and anaesthesiologist Rajib Ganguly. Repeated endoscopic and open ENT surgeries were done under ventilation to manage the tracheal problem (granulation tissue and bleeding) and the tracheostomy issues. The patient had also developed deep vein thrombosis in the legs that complicated the anticoagulation treatment issues as at the same time there were bleeding issues from the trachea (airway). Ventilation continued while the patient underwent repeated imagings, multiple ENT surgeries and management of repeated secondary infections caused by prolonged ventilation. The perseverance by the medical team finally brought cheers. Doctors started the procedure of waning her out of ventilation and tracheostomy in a graded manner on June 21. “I had given up hope. The doctors, specially Saugata Dasgupta and his team at the CCU, were so patient and gave all their efforts to give my wife back to me. I am indebted,” said husband Abhijit Mali, a fish vendor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-returns-home-after-100-days-on-ventilator/articleshow/84509679.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Constitutional right to contest polls snatched away, says Priyanka Gandhi Vadra||BAREILLY: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met Samajwadi Party-backed candidate Ritu Singh and her proposer Anita Yadav who were assaulted allegedly by BJP workers during the nomination for panchayat block chief elections in Kheri district recently. Talking to reporters after meeting Ritu, the Congress leader said, “It was her constitutional right to contest the election. It has been snatched from her. The police circle officer who tried to save her was suspended, but there was no action against the officials who remained a mute spectator. Why didn’t re-election happen in the block? Doesn’t she [Ritu Singh] have the right to contest an election?” Priyanka, who is currently in UP to strategise ahead of next year’s assembly polls, said, “The culprits should be punished irrespective of their political affiliations. Police and administration should investigate the matter properly and take corrective measures.” Five cops, including two inspectors, were suspended by Kheri SSP while the decision of the suspension of the circle officer came from Lucknow. The Returning Officer (RO) on duty at the block was also transferred to another district and repeated requests of the SP-backed candidate for a re-poll were turned down by the district administration. A candidate close to a senior member of the BJP won unopposed and the winner's certificate has been handed over to her. When asked how she felt about a Congress leader coming to meet her, Ritu Singh told TOI, “A woman came to support women and she treated us like sisters. She has assured us that she will fight for our justice and take this issue with the Election Commission for ensuring re-poll. Our sympathy is with the policemen who were made ‘scapegoats’ by the government and no action has been taken against the real culprits.” Three separate videos of the incident surfaced on social media. In one of the videos, Ritu and her proposer Anita Yadav were intercepted by a crowd of alleged BJP workers who yanked her sari. The second video was even more disturbing: a cop (the circle officer) can be seen trying to save Ritu Singh from rival party workers who were manhandling her and trying to push her out of the nomination room. In the third clip, a senior ruling party member can be heard purportedly saying, “No one should enter the nomination room.” Ritu Singh has demanded a re-poll at Pasgawan block. The FIR in this case was registered late on July 8 in which Yash Verma, Brij Kishore and several unidentified BJP workers were booked under sections 147 (rioting), 171-F (undue influence or personation at an election), 354 (attempting to outrage the modesty of a woman), 392 (robbery) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of IPC. Overall three accused have been arrested, including those named and all of them are connected with BJP. Additional SP Arun Kumar Singh told TOI, “The investigation in the Pasgawan incident is on and we have already sent three persons to jail so far. The viral videos have been included in the investigation and the statement of the two women has also been recorded by the investigation team.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/constitutional-right-to-fight-polls-says-priyanka-after-meeting-woman-stopped-from-filing-nomination/articleshow/84508017.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The bridge near the zoo connects several important places and below it flows the river. In case of any unfortunate incident who will be answerable?" questioned SP Sharma, a resident. The locals also claimed in the last few days whenever it rained the water remained there. The parapet walls have become very weak which in itself is dangerous, they said. “There are so many universities around the place. There are also movement of tourists round the clock. But such roads and bridges are still overlooked," said Saurabh Thakur, a resident. When contacted, executive engineer, PWD, DC Nautiyal said, “We are already carrying out a survey of roads and bridges in need of repair. I will check the bridge and get it repaired soon.” A proposal for reconstruction and repair of the bridge was sent to the government a year ago after which Mussoorie MLA Ganesh Joshi along with PWD officials had visited the site. “We wake up to problems only after some incidents. When newly constructed roads are unable to bear the first rains, how will an old bridge survive without repair?" a local shopkeeper asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bridge-ahead-of-doon-zoo-in-poor-condition-locals-demand-repair/articleshow/84508005.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Pawar told us at the meeting that the government will soon release funds for this work considering its importance. The actual work will start once we complete the procedures, such as floating tender,” district collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI on Saturday.“Contaminated ‘bhandara’ or turmeric powder which the devotees sprinkle in the air in large volumes with diced coconut has caused damage to the stone surface of the temple over the years. As a result, conservation work needs to be done on priority,” he said.The temple was constructed between 15th and 16th century by Malojiraje Bhosale, grandfather of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and renovated by Ahilyabai Holkar, said experts from the Deccan College Post Graduate and Research Institute (DCPR) and College of Engineering Pune (CoEP). They had inspected the temple in 2015. Former vice-chancellor of Deccan College Vasant Shinde, who inspected the temple, said, “Our report had clearly mentioned that the ‘sabha mandap’ (porch) is in danger of tilting towards one side due to overloading of the four beams. Also, it is necessary to carry out scientific cleaning and coating of the entire stone surface of the temple to provide protection from the environment and chemical reactions due to the turmeric used. These two works need to be done on priority.” Shinde said that a team of experts from the college would assist the government in this work.Meanwhile, priest Mayur Ashok Barbhai of the temple said that the conservation work should be carried out urgently considering its historic importance and current condition.“Lakhs of people from across the state visit the temple to perform rituals every year. So, conservation of the temple is necessary,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/government-to-give-funds-for-khandoba-temple-conservation/articleshow/84511853.cms||Sandip Dighe

France on Saturday became the latest EU member country to approve Covishield for travel. Poonawalla told TOI the EU countries that had approved Covishield included “Germany, and the Netherlands,”. “Slowly, every EU nation is accepting Covishield. But Italy and a few others have not approved it yet. We did not make any application to those who have approved it. Europe, the US, and everyone else have to acknowledge that this vaccine (Covishield) is of good quality because WHO has approved it,” he said.

---||Dehradun||‘People-centric approach worked in Delhi, will work in Uttarakhand too’||Col Ajay Kothiyal (retired), former principal of Uttarkashi-based Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Uttarakhand in April. He had played a crucial role in rehabilitation of victims and reconstruction of the shrine after the Kedarnath floods in 2013. With Uttarakhand headed towards assembly elections next year, AAP is looking to emerge as a viable option to BJP and Congress in the state and is using the promise of quality education and affordable electricity as its poll planks. Col Kothiyal spoke to Gaurav Talwar on why focusing on people and issues will work in the party’s favour in Uttarakhand. Excerpts: As a new entrant to Uttarakhand’s politics, how real do you think are AAP’s chances in the state assembly polls? AAP is an issue-based party and the issues raised by it are very important to the people of Uttarakhand. AAP has compelled the mainstream parties to respond and take a second look at their own strategies, as is evident with the way Congress and BJP both promised free electricity like AAP did. We are confident of projecting ourselves as an alternative to BJP and Congress. I am sure AAP will do well in next year’s elections. Electoral contest in Uttarakhand largely remains bipolar — between BJP and Congress. Other parties like SP, BSP and UKD to name a few have failed to make a mark. How will AAP be able to break the stronghold of the two main parties? AAP’s way of choosing candidates, style of campaigning and electoral focus is based on real issues and that has redefined the way of doing politics. Before AAP’s entry, Delhi was also bipolar. But with the right intention and a people-centric approach, the party was able to convince people to vote for it and the rest is history. We are going to repeat it in Uttarakhand. But there is a difference between Delhi and Uttarakhand in terms of culture, politics and terrain.. The basic issues are the same. Like in Delhi, people in Uttarakhand also want efficient government schools, affordable electricity, good governance and a corruption-free administration, which only AAP can provide. Politically speaking, Delhi is more difficult because it has a multicultural and multilingual society. The promise of free electricity by Arvind Kejriwal has led to both BJP and Congress also promising the same. Don't you think such promises encourage a freebie culture in Uttarakhand, which is already reeling under financial stress? Uttarakhand is producing electricity and giving it to other states while its own residents are deprived of 24x7 power. Free electricity is the right of people. Along with providing free power, our party has also promised to overhaul the functioning of the electricity department and stop leakages. Will you be the party’s CM candidate in Uttarakhand? That will be decided by the party. Like I did in the Army, I am concentrating on the mission, without thinking about any position.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/people-centric-approach-worked-in-delhi-will-work-in-uttarakhand-too/articleshow/84508016.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Mumbai||As Covid on wane, docs suspect dengue in cough, hypoxia cases||Mumbai: Dengue cases have been rising sharply across the city, said doctors, even though the BMC has officially stated that only eight patients were diagnosed between July 1 and 11. An added complication this monsoon, said doctors, was that several dengue patients have been coming in with symptoms of cold, cough and low oxygen levels that are now synonymous with Covid-19. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Srivastava said people associated dengue with a drop in white blood cells and platelets, but “we now have dengue patients with cough, cold and lower respiratory ailments”. It isn’t as if dengue’s symptoms have changed but Covid has changed us, said Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital near New Marine Lines. “People have become very observant, especially with cough, cough and blood oxygen levels. All these symptoms are part of most viral fever, be it Covid or dengue,” he said. In 2019, 920 dengue cases and three deaths were reported. The numbers dropped to 129 cases and three deaths in 2020. In 2021, 74 cases have been reported so far. Dr Mandar Kubal from Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central, said the worst manifestation of dengue is acute respiratory distress syndrome. “We have been seeing dengue with lung involvement for some time now, but the point is that now that monsoon is here, doctors should suspect dengue in patients who come in with breathlessness, not just Covid,” he said. There is an “overlap” in symptoms between Covid-19 and dengue that is posing as a challenge, said Dr S P Kalantri from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha. “Typically, dengue patients came in with high fever and backache, but they now have a third symptom: Cough and hypoxia. Many of them in our hospital need mechanical ventilators,” he told TOI. As a result, most patients with suspected dengue also undergo a Covid-19 test first. “After a patient’s RT-PCR report for Covid comes negative, we do a dengue test,” said Dr Kalantri. In most hospitals and clinics, doctors advise patients to first undergo the RT-PCR test to rule out Covid-19. Dr Pratit Samdani said three out of every 10 dengue cases need hospitalisation. “The patients come with high liver enzymes and dehydration,” he said. Dengue cases usually start with monsoon when other maladies such as malaria, jaundice and typhoid also start surging in cities such as Mumbai. “We are seeing cases from chawls as well as tony addresses on Nepean Sea Road. We expect the cases to keep increasing till September as is the dengue routine,” said Dr Shrivastav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/as-covid-on-wane-docs-suspect-dengue-in-cough-hypoxia-cases/articleshow/84512030.cms||---

Bharne said that the pandemic had led to a strain on the state’s finances and so it was unable to conduct the MPSC exam for the past 18 months. “There are students, who worked really hard, but could not appear for the exam because they were not conducted and some students clearing the interviews were not given appointments. But, the impact of Covid-19 is reducing a bit and we assure that their hard work won’t go in vain,” the minister said. Bharne announced that many meetings were held between ministers and MPSC officials regarding issues plaguing the department. “We are going to conduct interviews of 6,998 students pending since 2019 on an urgent basis. MPSC conducts these interviews. It is supposed to have one chairman and five members but four posts are vacant. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has already announced that the posts will be filled before July 31. Furthermore, following the Kerala state model, we will recruit more people to the commission so that the load of over 6,000 interviews can be distributed and completed in time,” said Bharne. He also said that 817 candidates, who had qualified from previous exams and were recommended by MPSC, would be given appointments soon. The results of 837 candidates, who had appeared for preliminary exams of various departments, will be declared too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/minister-bharne-promises-a-slew-of-measures-for-mpsc-students/articleshow/84511961.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Goa||Goa asked to demarcate bird habitats in coastal plan||MARGAO: Making a case for formulation of a bird habitat management plan for the state, three senior birders from Goa have jointly stated in their written submission on the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) that as several bird habitats haven’t been identified in the maps, the areas must be identified, protected and managed to ensure the persistence of the bird species and their populations. Pointing out that only one bird nesting area, Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary at Charao, is marked along the entire coastline of Goa, they said that “though this is an important area for birds, as highlighted by its protected status, there are many other parts of Goa’s coastline that require identification.” “It is extremely important that a management plan specific to bird habitats for nesting, foraging, roosting and wintering is drafted and implemented. These areas also have a huge potential for well managed eco-tourism zones,” Pronoy Baidya, Farai Patel and Omkar Dharwadkar said in their written submissions. To drive home their point, the birders said that Miramar beach was an example of a “mismanaged” birding site. “This area used to regularly host an annual population of about 2,000 migratory shorebirds. The site currently does not host any more shorebirds of significant numbers as of 2020,” they said. Highlighting the importance of Goa’s coastal areas for birds, they said that hundreds of “high species richness” of birds have been recorded across the coastline and inland waterways of the state. “Goa is an important stopover for many migratory birds. Many species fly to Goa’s coastal and wetland areas to forage and roost during the winter months and return to higher latitudes to breed during summer. Hence, protection of foraging and roosting areas is of utmost importance,” they said. Illustrating their case, the birders said that White Bellied Sea Eagles nest in various areas along Goa’s coastline, including around Cabo de Rama and near Agonda, and that Yellow-breasted bunting has been seen in Divar. Surveys should be conducted to identify these areas, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-asked-to-demarcate-bird-habitats-in-coastal-plan/articleshow/84512022.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: May not risk CET, say students happy with SSC scores||MUMBAI: Students whose Secondary School Certificate (SSC) results were beyond their expectations say they may stay out of the Common Entrance Test (CET) race. The optional CET, which is likely to be held on August 21, will override SSC marks for the first round of junior college admissions. The first round is key for students who look to get admission in top-notch colleges and for specific subjects. The results announced on Friday saw a near 100% success rate. The results were based on an assessment methodology after exams were cancelled due to the second pandemic wave. Of the 1,394 schools in the Mumbai division, 1,354 got 100% marks. Across the state, too, over 98% schools got 100% success. With the state passing all registered students, schools had the task of pushing up scores to get them to at least a pass class (35% and above). Students who would have otherwise failed obtained scores as high as 50-60%. In the Mumbai division, 21% of students scored 45% to 60% followed by another 16% who got between 60% to 65 %. “Many of these students would not have expected a score beyond 50%. We had pushed over 50 students from Class IX to X last year despite poor performance. And this year, they were given scores to help pass the board exam,” said a principal. Vivek Parcha of People’s Education Society School was elated with 55.2%. He expected less than 50%. Parcha said he does not want to take the CET as he is happy with the SSC results. A student from a Tardeo school who secured 74% had expected around 60%. “I was preparing for the CET but now with my SSC scores I will wait for round two of admission,” said the student. At Utkarsh Night High School, Worli, a student who scored 73% said he will seek admission based on his SSC results. The CET, say educationists, may become a battleground of top scorers. In the Mumbai division, 15,540 students secured 91% and above. Another 21,992 students got 85-90%. “There will be many top scorers in other boards too. It will be these students who will compete in the exam,” said a junior college professor. Animesh Shinde, who got 99.8%, is ready to take on the CET battle. With a 100% score in mathematics and social sciences—two of the four subjects for CET—Shinde, a student of Vasant Vihar School, Thane, is confident of scoring well in CET too. Last year, in the Mumbai division, 30% Class XI seats were vacant and admissions extended to March this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-may-not-risk-cet-say-students-happy-with-ssc-scores/articleshow/84509893.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Delhi||Delhi ready for another wave? Doctors feel better systems put in place now||NEW DELHI: Is Delhi prepared to deal with one more wave of Covid-19? The jury is still out on this. City doctors and hospitals say, at least arrangements are being made to ensure no shortage of medical oxygen, the cause of a serious crisis in the currently receding wave. The resurgence of infections caught everyone by surprise, conceded Dr Arun Gupta, member of the committee formed by Delhi government to prepare an action plan for the third wave. He added that this time around, the government was alert and prepared for all possible eventualities. “To meet the demand for medical oxygen, 27 pressure swing adsorption oxygen plants have been installed in state-run hospitals and at least a dozen more will be installed soon. The central government is also providing support to the state and to Centre-run hospitals to augment the oxygen storage and supply,” he said. Dr Gupta added that the state government was also in the process of procuring cryogenic tankers to transport medical oxygen from the manufacturing plants. “Delhi recorded 28,395 cases in a single day on April 20. While we are optimistic that a similar situation will not occur again, we are preparing to deal with an even worse scenario of more than 40,000 cases in a day,” the Delhi Medical Council president said. Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of AIIMS Trauma Centre, said the hospital had commissioned two new ICU floors with an augmented capacity of 28 beds. “The ICUs will be operationalised by July 31, complete with state-of-the-art ventilators and monitors newly acquired for the possible third wave with special emphasis on paediatric care,” Malhotra claimed. The AIIMS Trauma Centre has been designated as a special centre for Covid treatment. Malhotra said it had procured 40 ventilators with paediatric mode, paediatric fibre-optic bronchoscopy, paediatric laryngoscope and cardiac monitor with paediatric cuffs, among other equipment, to be fully prepared to manage infected children. There are apprehensions that a new wave will affect children more than adults, though there is no scientific evidence to support this belief. In order to handle patients with advanced lung damage, AIIMS is acquiring ECMO, a machine that pumps and oxygenates a patient's blood outside the body, allowing the heart and lungs to rest. Few public hospitals have this facility at present. According to Dr S K Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, Vasant Kunj, “One of the areas we are lacking in is vaccination. Only 22 lakh people have received both doses of the vaccine. This is very low. Besides, there are no trials planned as yet to assess the need and efficacy of a third/booster dose.” Sarin also stressed on the need to make Covid tests readily available at lower costs. “Timely tests, tracking and isolation is key to control the disease’s spread. For this, the government must ensure easy availability of testing facilities. Also, we need to expand the infrastructure for genome sequencing to be able to identify newer variants of the coronavirus that causes Covid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-ready-for-another-wave-docs-feel-better-systems-put-in-place-now/articleshow/84509886.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Despite the weekly market having re-opened recently, fearing action from authorities due to shoppers not following Covid-19 restrictions such as maintaining social distance, most vendors have opted to sell their produce or wares along the footpath of the main road. “Vendors are afraid to set up shop. If there are too many customers surrounding them, authorities show up with a truck and threaten to take away their wares,” said Kishor, who sells local fruit. He set up his business after losing his job on a cruise ship due to the pandemic. Accusing the Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) of lack of support, the vendors claim that they have not received any help from the civic body during the closure of the market due to the pandemic. Instead, they say, they are subject to mistreatment despite paying the stipulated vending fee. Further, they said, even during the recent spell of heavy rain, the civic body did not make any effort to provide any sort of relief to them to conduct their trade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/afraid-to-set-up-shop-say-fri-mkt-vendors/articleshow/84512024.cms||---

The announcement was made by Municipal Administration and Urban Development minister KT Rama Rao on Saturday after launching an FSTP at Nalla Cheruvu in Uppal. This plant, with a capacity to treat 40 kilo litres per day (KLD), was built by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) to recycle the faecal waste collected from septic tanks where underground sewerage facility is not available. Also flagging off a total of 87 septic tank cleaning vehicles from Peoples’ Plaza on Necklace Road, KTR said, “Hyderabad is ahead of other cities in the country in sewage treatment. After ruling out manual labour in sewerage cleaning works by introducing mechanisation, the water board has now crossed another milestone.” The plants will treat the waste collected from septic tanks of villages within the Outer Ring Road. Earlier, the faecal waste would be deposited in lakes, nalas and other water bodies brining enormous harm to environment and public health, the minister said. The ‘Dial-a-Septic-Tank-Cleaning’ services may be availed by calling 155313/14420. In addition to this, two more FSTPs with 20 KLD capacity each are under construction in Nagarm and Injapur villages. The Water Board has taken up construction of FSTPs to serve seven corporations, 18 municipalities and 18 village panchayats within ORR to which the board is already supplying drinking water||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-fstps-in-71-places-across-t/articleshow/84511999.cms||---

At the same time, we are also looking at expanding our reach to more geographical locations in tier-II and tier-III markets by increasing our user base," said Niral.India currently has over 2 lakh training and coaching institutes offering various courses in the fields of information technology, marketing and branding, graphic design and various others to some 4.5 crore students, he said."We aim at adding on up to 250 courses and target to onboard at least three million unique students and users on our website and mobile app by the end of 2021-22," he further said.Founded in July 2019, the startup operates out of Ahmedabad with a team of 40 persons. The founders are also in talks to collaborate with colleges and universities to offer training and placement programmes to the students and better prepare them for their aspired jobs.Before launching the online platform, both the founders used to run an offline training business which they scaled to some 20 locations in India and trained over 100,000 students."Over a 12-year period of trying to scale up our business, we realized how most students would learn more effectively in vernacular languages. At the same time, we also observed that there was a lack of training and skill-set among students of tier-II markets. The idea of starting out with LearnVern struck since then, after which we decided to use the digital platform to help students and professionals gain skill-sets," added Niral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ed-tech-co-learnvern-eyes-expansion-after-1mn-in-fundraising/articleshow/84512003.cms||Niyati Parikh

Family members of Thapar, who was in his late 40s and lodged at the Gaghidih jail since June 16, claimed that he died of torture, the East Singhbhum district police said he died on the way to the hospital and a post mortem will be conducted to find out the cause of the death. SSP M Tamil Vanan said the post mortem would be videographed and conducted by a medical board in the presence of a magistrate. “We will have to wait for the post mortem report to know the cause of the death. Jail officials told me that Thapar’s vitals dropped suddenly in the morning after which he was rushed to the MGM hospital but died on the way,” he said. Thapar’s sister, Manjeet Kaur, said, “A thorough investigation can only bring to light the actual cause of the death. He could have died of torture inside the jail.” Thapar, along with three other accused, the district child welfare committee chairperson and his wife, Pushpa Rani Tirkey, warden of the child care centre, Geeta Kaur, her son and accountant, Aditya Singh, are lodged at the jail since June 16 following their arrest from Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh on June 15. The fifth accused in the case, Toni Singh, is at large. All five are facing charges under sections 354, 354 (D), 323, 334 of the IPC. They are also facing charges of siphoning off funds from the centre. Earlier on June 5, two minor girls, both aged 15 years, had fled the centre located in Telco and was found by police in adjoining Birsanagar the following day. The girls complained to the police of sexual exploitation at the centre following which a case was lodged and an investigation was started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/child-shelter-home-head-dies-in-jamshedpur-jail/articleshow/84511479.cms||B Sridhar

Acting on the directives of chief minister Hemant Soren, the state labour department secretary, Prawin Kumar Toppo, sent a three-page letter to BRO’s director Lt General Rajeev Chaudhary on Friday seeking accountability and clarifications on several aspects, including the number of migrant workers from the state who died between March 2020 to June 2021, list of people who received the Rs 5 lakh compensation, the current status of the workers engaged in projects and their detailed status. The letter, which was released by the CM’s office on Saturday, also asked whether the BRO intends to sign an MoU with the Jharkhand government to induct migrant workers under the prescribed statutory provisions. The letter also red-flagged numerous instances of exploitation of the migrant workers, denial of proper wages and the ongoing role of middlemen (mates) among others. Referring to a written communication between the BRO and the labour department of the state government on June 5 last year amid the migrant crisis because of the Covid-induced nationwide lockdown, Toppo said, “As per the mutually agreed terms and conditions for taking migrant labourers from our state, the BRO had stated that it will apply for registration as an establishment with the state government under the existing rules and regulations.” He further said, “The BRO also decided to sign MoU with the state government following its approval by the ministry of defence. Further, it also agreed to comply with all the statutory provisions of the Interstate Migrant Workmen Act, 1979, among others. A TOR (terms of reference) was also signed in between the state government and the BRO on June 13 last year to induct 11,815 workers as casual paid labourers (CLP) through an agreed framework.” One year later, nothing has moved forward on the agreements, but several migrant workers from Dumka were taken for BRO projects through mates without the knowledge or consent of the state government or the local district administration, officials of the state labour department said. Notably, around a dozen people died in the Uttrakhand glacier burst this year while regular reports of the precarious living and working conditions faced by the workers during the second wave of the pandemic have come to the fore, prompting the state government to seek answers from the central agency, the officials said. Toppo maintained that since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the myriad problems faced by the migrant workers have necessitated an official action to uphold their rights and dignity at their place of employment by ensuring decent pay and proper living conditions among others. “The state government is committed towards th value and dignity of our workers and we are striking coordination with the BRO to understand the current situation so the issue is taken up at an appropriate level,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lens-on-bro-for-not-paying-workers/articleshow/84511357.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Additional chief secretary (health0 Arun Kumar Singh flagged off the mobile laboratories which will be deployed in five districts — Ranchi, East Singhbhum, Dhanbad, Palamu and Hazaribag – since the positivity rate is higher or the population density is more in those areas. The mobile laboratories, approved by ICMR and the National Accreditation Board for Laboratories, have a capacity to test 1,000-1,500 samples per day. The mobile labs would cover an area within 35km radius of the district headquarters and also test samples collected from far-off areas of the five districts. Singh said that till March 14 last year, there was no facility to conduct Covid-19 tests in the state but with concerted efforts almost every district is now equipped with an RT-PCR or TrueNat testing facility. “We have conducted tests on 1.06 crore samples till July 16, of which 37.42 lakh tests were conducted on RT-PCR while 57.23 lakh samples were tested on Rapid Antigen Test kits,” he added. National health mission’s director Uma Shankar Singh said that the state has adopted a five-pronged strategy of testing, tracking, isolating, treatment and vaccination for containment of Covid. “The mobile laboratory would further augment the state’s capacity to test more samples. As of now, the government has eight RT-PCR laboratories and effort is being made to equip the remaining 16 districts with similar testing facilities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-introduces-5-mobile-rt-pcr-testing-vans/articleshow/84511318.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Additional director general Sanjay Lathkar said that in the past two days the Jharkhand police have achieved major success with the killing of Oraon in Gumla and PLFI commander Surin on the Khunti-Chaibasa border. “Oraon and Surin carried a bounty amount of Rs 15 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, respectively, and this amount would be distributed among the security forces involved in the operations,” he said, adding that 109 cases were registered against Oroan while Suirn was an accused in 80 cases. Meanwhile, while addressing media persons at the police headquarters on Saturday, DGP Neeraj Sinha claimed that the killing of Oraon was one of the best operations of the state police in terms of planning and execution in the last 15 years. He said, “During the operation, the security forces suffered losses, including the death of sniffer dog Drona and injury to its handler in an improvised explosive device (IED) blast. A villager was also killed in another IED explosion. Despite the ordeals, the forces continued their operation which ultimately led to the execution of Oraon.” He added that Oroan and his squad were a big problem for the police force and the villagers as they would often plant thousands of IEDs across several places. He also gave cash rewards to the team involved in the operation. He further said, “The number of cadres associated with left-wing extremism (LWE) is decreasing in the state however, the ultras are using various improvised technologies for increasing their influence. They are also using opium cultivation for mobilising funds. The police are constantly on their toes to defeat their plans. I appeal to the extremist cadres to surrender before the police and join the mainstream of society.” He added that even though encounters are taking place at the moment to nab the Maoists, the emphasis is on encouraging them to surrender. “The government has framed an attractive surrender policy for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rs-25-lakh-to-be-distributed-among-cops-for-gunning-down-rebels-oraon-surin/articleshow/84511456.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Govt to sign MoU to identify new mines||Panaji: The state government will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) to identify new iron ore mines in the state on Monday. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said the MoU will be signed in his presence besides the Union minister for mines Pralhad Joshi. Keeping in mind the delay in resumption of mining activities, Sawant had decided to form a mining corporation and identify new mineral blocks to restart the industry. With the signing of the MoU, mining corporation will identify new mineral blocks in the state for e-auctioning. The state government is likely to give cabinet approval for forming of the new Goa mining corporation and the bill will be tabled in the upcoming monsoon session. A senior government officer said once MECL finalises the blocks to be auctioned, the leases would be transferred to the mining corporation and thereafter it would be auctioned. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018 following the Supreme Court’s decision to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. During the Portuguese period, Goa had 806 mining concessions; and in 1987, after the concessions were abolished and converted into leases, the number had reduced to 595 leases. In 1987-88 and in 2000, 438 lease holders applied for first renewal. Subsequently, 413 lease holders had applied in 2006 for a second renewal. Out of the 595 valid mining leases in Goa, the state government cancelled 252 of those holders who had not applied during the first or second renewal in 1987 and 2007. In October 2013, 119 mining leases were cancelled and another 133 in November 2013. Before mining came to a halt in Goa, around 110 leases were in operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-sign-mou-to-identify-new-mines/articleshow/84512174.cms||---

Vast tracts of fields have been submerged under water after the heavy rainfall. Farmers are worried that if rainfall continues for another three-four days, there is a possibility of crops rotting, leading to heavy financial losses. With the India meteorological department (IMD) forecasting heavy rainfall for another week, farmers are even more anxious. Mayem-based farmer Kashinath Mayekar said that in the initial days, when the seeds were sown, there were no rains, leaving them worried then that the crops would dry up. “Now the situation is the opposite. Heavy rains have submerged fields and we are suffering,” he said. Another farmer, Sakharam Pednekar, said that after rainfall activity picked up, they resumed sowing. Now farmers want some respite from the rain, he said. This is the third year that such a situation has occurred, Mayekar said. “Fertilizer prices have skyrocketed. Daily wages have increased. Rent of digging equipment has gone up. How long can farmers bear this,” he further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholim-fields-submerged-ryots-fear-paddy-saplings-will-rot/articleshow/84512447.cms||---
---||Goa||Vasco: Man who hired killers in Bogmalo shooting case held||VASCO: Vasco police on Saturday arrested a third accused for the murder of 30-year-old New Vaddem resident Amar Naik, who was shot in the head at Bogmalo on Thursday evening. The police also recovered the two guns used in the crime. Ravi Shankar Yadav, 30, a resident of Anjuna and native of Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, has been identified by the police for having paid the two accused who killed Naik. Arresting Yadav is a major breakthrough in the murder case and is likely to help uncover the motive behind the crime. “We are yet to establish the motive behind the murder and the amount paid to kill Naik. We also want to know from where the weapons were procured,” said SP Pankaj Kumar Singh. The police are now seeking to establish whether Yadav is the main accused and wanted Naik killed or if there is a fourth person involved who had some enmity with the victim. Two country-made pistols were recovered from the accused persons, along with magazines and cartridges. Sources said the weapons had been thrown into the bushes near the site of the shooting. “Yadav resided in New Vaddem about a decade ago. He and Naik were known to each another. Yadav brought the two accused from UP to Goa. They travelled to Maharashtra by train and then to Goa by bus. He accompanied them and kept them in Anjuna. He also made them call Naik and crack a false deal to lure him,” Singh said. Yadav’s brother had taken up a hotel on lease in Anjuna and Yadav, who is unemployed, had taken shelter there. On Friday, the police had arrested the two contract killers, Shailesh Gupta, 29, and Shivam Sarvajeet Singh, 22, both natives of UP. Police confirmed that Gupta had shot Naik. Both are in police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/man-who-hired-killers-in-bogmalo-shooting-case-held/articleshow/84512574.cms||---

The accused duo had been stealing the oil from a trunk pipeline near Raipura village on the outskirts of the city. According to the police, a PCB sleuth had received information that Amarsinh Rathod, who was earlier arrested in crude oil thefts, had stolen oil from a pipeline and the tankers were being offloaded in a transport firm compound near Ranoli bridge on Saturday. The cops raided the spot and nabbed Shashikant Yadav, who owns the transport firm, and Hanuman Vanzara. The cops are yet to arrest Rathod, Sanjay Kaliyo and Madanlal Vanzara who are also involved in the oil theft racket. The police said that Rathod has many cases booked against him and he has been arrested by Karjan police, Anand police, Patan police and even the cops in Rajasthan in the past. Rathod steals crude oil from the pipelines laid by ONGC and IOCL and sells it in the open market.

---||India||In a first, Gujarat HC livestreams proceedings; SC to follow soon||NEW DELHI: Taking a giant step towards more openness and unleashing “the transparency revolution”, the Indian judicial system on Saturday for the first time embarked on livestreaming of its court functioning with CJI N V Ramana launching livestreaming of Gujarat HC proceedings and assuring that Supreme Court will start the same soon. The Supreme Court had on 2018 held that live telecast of important cases would usher in greater transparency, and three years after its order a committee headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud finalised draft rules for livestreaming and recording of court proceedings. Launching the system for livestreaming of the proceedings in Gujarat HC, Justice Ramana said judicial system had always been open as people are allowed to witness court proceedings but with livestreaming the access to justice will become a true reality, when litigants and interested parties get to witness, understand and comprehend justice dispensation first-hand. He said that livestreaming will remove multiple incorrect notions in the minds of the public regarding the justice delivery system. Information, he said, will not be filtered by agents of transmission which vested interests sometimes use to spread misinterpretations in order to embarrass or discredit the institution. “It is this lack of direct access which gives space for misconceptions. The formalisation of the livestreaming of court proceedings is the best cure for the aforesaid malady. Livestreaming of proceedings is crucial for dissemination of information. Through such direct access, the people can get first-hand information about the proceedings and the opinions of the judges, leaving little room for mischief,” he said. The CJI said that judges might feel the pressure of public scrutiny due to livestreaming, which may ultimately result in a stressful environment. He, however, said “a judge must remember, even if justice commands standing up against the popular perception, he must do so out of his commitment to the oath he took under the Constitution”. “A judge cannot be swayed by popular opinion. Yes, with increased public gaze, he might become a subject of multiple debates, that should never deter him from his duty to protect the right of one against the might of many,” he said. “We are keen to start live proceedings at least for some of the courts in the Supreme Court. We are working out the logistics and working on consensus of the full court,” the CJI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-first-gujarat-hc-livestreams-proceedings-sc-to-follow-soon/articleshow/84515061.cms||---

The offence is of heinous nature and committed in a brazen manner. The crime charged against the accused is of the highest magnitude and the punishment of it assigned by law is of extreme severity,” the court stated. The court added that there is every possibility of Yergatti pressurizing or threatening the witnesses. “Bail cannot be granted in case of such violent offence, which would be seen from the chargesheet and statements of the victim and witnesses. The court would take into account the expected intimidation and threat to the victims and/or witnesses. In fact, the state of mind of witnesses is required to be taken into account while granting bail in such shocking offences,” Justice M S Jawalkar stated. “While weighing the right to liberty of the accused vis-a-vis the larger public interest, I am certainly not inclined to release the applicant on bail. Hence, the application stands rejected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-rejects-bail-plea-in-methar-murder-case/articleshow/84512714.cms||---

Elections to rural local bodies must be conducted before September 15 in nine newly created districts as per an order of the Supreme Court. “The chief minister has told us to conduct election to urban local bodies in one or two months after the rural body polls are over. The CM will make an announcement in the upcoming budget session. He has already said the terms of elected rural local bodies (for which polls were held in December 2019) will not be disturbed and they will complete their five-year tenure,” Nehru told TOI. While the DMK election manifesto was silent on urban local body polls, the leadership is keen on holding the elections given the popularity of the government. Recently, the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK exhorted party workers to start poll work. Nehru said the previous regime had done delimitation of wards in 2018 and issued a government order on quota for SC and ST and women. But the exercise was incorrect and even the number of voters was not maintained properly. “Wards that had more women voters were designated as men’s wards and reserved seats became general seats. A lot of complaints poured in and all these must be set right,” the minister said. The government will look into these issues before issuing another order for delimitation of wards as it has plans to upgrade municipalities and corporations, Nehru said, adding that announcement on upgrading them will be made in the assembly. Elections to urban local bodies was last held in October 2011. The previous AIADMK government’s attempts to hold polls when former chief minister J Jayalalithaa was hospitalised in 2016 did not materialise as the Madras high court cancelled the notification citing non-compliance with the Tamil Nadu Panchayat (Election) Rules 1995. The DMK also moved the court complaining that delimitation of wards was wrongly done by the AIADMK government. Finally, rural local body poll was conducted in 2019 except in nine new districts that were bifurcated and trifurcated by the EPS government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/urban-local-body-polls-to-be-held-in-tn-before-december/articleshow/84510759.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Vishwamitri river clean-up destructive, claim activists||VADODARA: Environment activists and concerned citizens have asked the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to immediately stop the clean-up activities at the Vishwamitri river. Terming the entire exercise being carried out by the civic body as utterly destructive, the citizens through notices issued to all the authorities have claimed that the process was in violation of order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). On May 25, NGT had issued order stating that the entire flood plain zone of Vishwamitri river should be mapped and demarcated. The order had also stated that unauthorized, illegal structures should be removed and river’s integrity should be maintained and restored. The order was issued in connection to the Vishwamitri River Action Plan. “We have visited the location of ongoing works multiple times to gauge the nature of work being carried out by the VMC. Prima facie, it appears as an effort towards the re-sectioning of the river resulting in further encroachment on the river section through dispersal and levelling of the soil,” the notices issued to all the authorities by the group of citizens states. “Though VMC is claiming that they have been guided by the Gujarat forest department, Gujarat Pollution Control Board and other authorities, we believe that these activities are in violation of various orders, directions, and acts specifically The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and the recent NGT order,” said environment activist Rohit Prajapati. The citizens have demanded that the civic body should stop work and plan systematic ways to deal with river flow, flooding and water-logging. “We are reiterating an urgent need to establish well qualified quasi-governmental or semi statutory body or task force that includes subject experts as well as other knowledgeable experts and experienced members of community at-large. This body should not merely be a teeth-less and perfunctory advisory body,” said Prajapati. Such an interdisciplinary and empowered body will go a long way in ensuring transparent, participatory and proactive processes for holistic development of our city and Vishwamitri river watershed, the representation made by the group states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vishwamitri-river-clean-up-destructive-claim-activists/articleshow/84511642.cms||---
---||Delhi||Manish Sisodia objects to LG meeting Delhi officials on ‘state govt subjects’||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday shot off a four-page letter to lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, asking him to stop holding meetings with Delhi government officials on subjects falling under the elected government’s jurisdiction. He said this has been happening for the past three months. “I have come to know that you call officers for meetings, without informing the ministers, on subjects falling under the elected government’s jurisdiction and give them instructions. Later, officials from the lieutenant-governor’s office put pressure on the officials to implement the directions,” Sisodia wrote. Sisodia: LG’s action against SC’s 2008 ruling, murder of democracy He called the LG’s actions unconstitutional and against Supreme Court’s April 2018 ruling, adding it amounted to murder of democracy. He said he had done much contemplation before writing the letter and it was important for democracy and Constitution. “If the Centre-appointed LG sidelines the elected government and takes decisions on all subjects, then the democracy which has been achieved after much struggle and sacrifice by our forefathers and freedom fighters will be destroyed,” he said, adding that it was against the vision of the freedom fighters. “The Constitution makes it clear that barring three subjects (land, police and public order), you will work according to the decisions taken by the elected government on all subjects. Since Delhi is the national capital, the Constitution has given veto power to the LG that he can express a difference of opinion in case he disagrees with any decision of the elected government,” said Sisodia. He, however, also pointed out that the Constitution Bench of Supreme Court had in its July 4, 2018 order stressed that the LG can use this power in extremely rare cases. Sisodia’s letter contained two paragraphs from the SC judgement which stated that the LG has not been entrusted with any independent decision-making power. “The Constitution confers only two powers on the LG – either he agrees with the decision of the elected government or in case of disagreement he may refer the matter to the President. The SC has also stated that the LG has been given the power to refer to the President a disagreement only in very exceptional cases,” Sisodia stated. He said that since the LG has been appointed by the BJPled Central Government, BJP functionaries might be putting pressure on him to work against the AAP government. “I want to remind you that you are the honourable LG of Delhi,” wrote Sisodia. He said that Anil Baijal could become LG only because India is a democratic country and it gives equal opportunities to all, irrespective of caste and creed. “If democracy is destroyed, the coming generations will be deprived of this opportunity. Democracy has given you this position and power. Now, it is your duty to protect democracy and the future of the country,” he said. “As LG, you have an opportunity and you can use it to do jobs which will leave a weaker democracy for the coming generations. History will remember you as a good person but one who weakened democracy. If you want, you can use your position to make democracy stronger. Then people will remember you as a person who strengthened democracy despite huge pressure from BJP,” Sisodia wrote in the letter, adding that the country would need a stronger democracy for a long period. There was no reaction from the LG’s office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/manish-sisodia-objects-to-lg-meeting-delhi-officials-on-state-govt-subjects/articleshow/84515151.cms||Alok K N Mishra

However, the government clarified that there is not enough evidence to suggest that there has been an increase in TB cases due to Covid-19. States and UTs have also been asked for convergence in efforts for better surveillance and case finding of TB and Covid-19. Besides, the Centre had already issued multiple advisories and guidance emphasising on the need for bi-directional screening of TBCOVID and TB-ILI/SARI, the government said. "Due to the impact of Covid-19 related restrictions, case notifications for TB had decreased by about 25% in 2020 but special efforts are being made to mitigate this impact through intensified case finding in OPD settings as well as through active case finding campaigns in the community by all states," the government said. Moreover, there is not enough evidence currently to suggest that there has been an increase in TB cases due to Covid-19 or due to increased case finding efforts, it added. Highlighting the dual morbidity of Tuberculosis (TB) and Covid-19, the health ministry said both the diseases are known to be infectious and primarily attack the lungs, presenting similar symptoms of cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. However, TB has a longer incubation period and a slower onset of disease, it said. In a warning against post Covid diseases such as black fungus, the ministry said SARS-CoV-2 infection could make an individual more susceptible to developing TB disease, as TB is an opportunistic infection like black fungus. Drawing parallels between decreased immunity in both tuberculosis and Covid-19 patients, the ministry said TB bacilli can be present in humans in a dormant state and has the potential to start multiplying when the individual’s immunity is compromised for any reason. The same is applicable in the post-Covid scenario, when an individual may develop decreased immunity due to the virus itself or due to the treatment, especially immune-suppressants like steroids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/screen-covid-patients-for-tb-vice-versa-centre-to-states/articleshow/84515155.cms||---

Tamil Nadu Directorate of Government Examinations (TNDGE) said Class XII results would be declared on July 19. Though UG admissions would commence after Class XII results for state board students are released, the TN higher education department asked all colleges to commence admissions for 2021-22 on August 1 after the declaration of CBSE Class XII results. As per UGC’s academic calendar for 2021-22, colleges must wind up admissions before September 30 and the academic session must commence latest by October 1. However, the UGC left the planning of semester exams, break, commencement of next semester and exams with concerned universities and autonomous colleges. The next academic year for the 2021-22 batch will begin on August 1, 2022. “In view of the financial hardships faced by parents due to lockdowns and related factors, the commission asked all colleges to refund full fees for cancellations of admissions or migrations up to October 31 as a special case. It said there should be zero cancellation charges till October 31 and thereafter, the college should refund full fee after deducting process fee not more than ₹1,000,” the UGC said in its guidelines. Loyola College principal Thomas Amirtham said arts and science colleges may not need two months for the admission process and online classes for first year students may commence much earlier. “In the present academic schedule, it is not possible to have a long summer break. The schedule also allows each state to adapt according to their local Covid-19 situation,” he said, adding that the online classes are likely to continue for a few more months. D G Vaishnav College principal S Santhosh Baboo said colleges may be looking to wind up the admission process quickly. “Even if colleges are allowed to reopen, science students will be called to do practicals in person while theory classes will be online,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/first-year-admissions-to-start-after-july-31-end-by-september-30-ugc/articleshow/84515123.cms||---

To popularise mediation as cheaper and faster dispute resolution mechanism, a movement needs to be launched,” the CJI said. Pendency not a useful indicator of how well a system is doing: CJIPrescribing mediation as a mandatory first step for resolution of every allowable dispute will go a long way in promoting mediation. Perhaps, an omnibus law in this regard is needed to fill the vacuum,” the CJI said at the India-Singapore Mediation Summit on Saturday. “We must take note of the fact that a vast majority of litigants in India belong to middle and poorer sections of society. They will find great solace if mediation gets established as a reliable means of redress. Needless to state, it will lead to a remarkable reduction in the number of cases reaching the regular courts. Such a scenario will enhance the efficiency of the judicial system,” he said. The CJI also added that mediation could be made easily available to the public at large and be a tool of social justice and must be adopted for resolution of all disputes. Justice Ramana, however, refuted the perception that large pendency of cases in courts is a reflection of inefficiency of the judicial system. “The often-quoted statistic that ‘pendency’ in Indian courts has reached 45 million cases, which is perceived as the inability of the Indian judiciary to cope with the case load. This is an overstatement and an uncharitable analysis.” He elaborated that even a case filed a day before gets added to the pendency statistic and, “therefore, not a useful indicator of how well, or poorly, a system is doing”. “There is no doubt that the issue of judicial delays is a complex problem, not just in India. Several factors contribute towards such a situation. One of them is an Indian phenomenon called — luxurious litigation. It is a specific type of litigation wherein parties with resources attempt to frustrate the judicial process and delay it by filing numerous proceedings across the judicial system,” he said. “The sheer number of cases in the Indian judicial system may have to be viewed in the context that India is the largest democratic republic in the world. The people believe in the Constitutional project,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/make-mediation-first-step-to-settle-disputes-cji-n-v-ramana/articleshow/84515193.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Principal chief conservator of forests has recommended the suspension of the officer in his report submitted to chief secretary V P Joy. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan will take a call on the matter. The report has found that the officer tried to mislead the investigation and tried to trap officials in the case. Earlier, the forest vigilance department had also given a report against the officer. In the probe conducted by chief forest conservator (northern zone) D K Vinod Kumar, it was found that Sajan had tried to trap the range officer of Meppadi, who had tried to stop transporting trees that had been illegally cut. Also, a junior official had raised a complaint against Sajan to senior officials in the matter. All these were considered while recommending the suspension of the officer, it is learnt. The probe by a special investigation team, including the officials from three departments — forests and wildlife, crime branch and vigilance and anti-corruption bureau— are progressing in the illegal tree felling case. However, the chief minister said that the matter has not yet come to his notice. He said that the action by the revenue department by cancelling the good service entry of the deputy secretary of the department Salini O G who had parted with information regarding revenue files on tree felling order under the RTI Act, is the internal affair of the department, which is not under his consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/muttil-tree-felling-scam-in-wayanad-forest-conservator-faces-suspension/articleshow/84515227.cms||---

---||Kolkata||After 112 days, no Covid death in Kolkata||KOLKATA: For the first time in 112 days, no Covid death was reported in Kolkata on Saturday while the number of fresh cases stood at 62. The last time the city reported zero Covid casualty was on March 27, just before the start of the second wave. Thereafter, the daily toll in the metropolis kept climbing till it touched 44 — once on May 12 and again on May 29. The number of daily casualties started declining in end-May and since the third week of June, it has been in single digits and dropping steadily. Experts say this is a good sign and indicative of the fact that vaccination has worked and the city is “inching towards herd immunity”. The city has recorded a total of 4,956 Covid deaths Jsince the beginning of the pandemic. “Kolkata has been doing well ever since vaccination started. The city now has less than 1,000 active cases, which is lower than the figures of a few districts, including Nor-th 24 Parganas and Darjeeling. The city is now in a good space since a large section of residents has been inoculated and we are inching towards herd immunity. In terms of the number of vaccines administered, Kolkata now ranks second in the country, ” said professor Diptendra Sarkar of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER). According to internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas, the virus has been effectively countered after the second wave. “While vaccination has helped in preventing transmission, the virus has lost some its sting. With more vaccinations, the situation will continue improve. But let’s remember that the virus is still there and letting our guard down could again activate it. The longer the virus remains, the faster and more it will mutate,” Biswas said. He stressed that this was the time when Covid norms should be adhered to very strictly. Sarkar, however, said it was difficult to predict how long the good phase will last. “The third wave could hit by August-September. But we should now be looking at the number of deaths and not the number of cases. Vaccination has been able to pull down the figure in Kolkata,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-112-days-no-covid-death-in-city/articleshow/84512676.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Kolkata||Guv goes to Delhi after tweets from Gita||Kolkata: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar flew to Delhi on Saturday morning, but without announcing his itinerary like he usually does. Before leaving town, he invoked the Gita and tweeted: “Inaction in challenging times is an inexcusable stance that eats into humanity and civility. Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with results…” Dhankhar’s visit comes two days after the NHRC panel probing post-poll violence complaints in Bengal criticised the state administration in its full report to Calcutta High Court. The governor’s unscheduled visit also comes three days after he had an hour-long meeting with Mamata Banerjee at Raj Bhavan “without aides”. The CM made the “courtesy call” days after she described Dhankhar as a “corrupt man”, referring to the Jain Hawala scam. “This governor’s name was in the Jain Hawala case. But they have gone to court, cleared it from the court. But the PIL is pending. He is a corrupt man I am sorry to say. Why does the Centre allow a governor like this?” Banerjee had said. The governor expressed his “shock” at the criticism. Dhankhar read out only the first and last paragraphs of the 18-page speech prepared for him by the state government for his first address to the new assembly after this year’s state election, leaving out the paragraphs on post-poll violence. The CM’s comment and the ruling Trinamool stepping up the pressure on the governor had sparked speculation if he was on his way out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-goes-to-delhi-after-tweets-from-gita/articleshow/84512298.cms||---

The entry and exit areas of the barracks, which is right opposite Adhikari residence Shantikunj, were videographed. However, there was no videography inside Shantikunj, the CID said. Some sketches of the crime scene were redrawn while the team spent maximum time in the room at the barracks where guard Shubabrata Chakraborty was found critically wounded by a gunshot. The day’s investigation follows two days of questioning of Chakraborty’s 11 colleagues. A CID officer earlier said the guard’s wife, Suparna Chakraborty, had specifically said there was a delay in shifting him to Contai hospital and then to Kolkata. “This is a key area that is under probe,” the officer had added. Investigators will speak once again with the other guards who were part of Adhikari’s security detail three years ago.

List of such colonies in four other zones is yet to be released. Notably, despite recommendation of registration of FIRs, no action has been taken so far against the developers of these colonies under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA). In the list, around 20 colonies, set up in around 95 acres, are under vigilance radar as there are allegations against an MC building inspector of illegally helping the developers. Under the regularization policy of 2018 too, not many developers had come forward to get themselves registered. And out of those, very less colonies were declared regularized. The matter of illegal colonies had been raised by RTI activist Kuldeep Khaira who had even lodged a complaint with MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal claiming that colonies had been coming up in different areas across the city, and officials had failed to take action against the same. Afterwards, a survey of such colonies was marked and officials were told to come out with a report and certify that they would be held responsible if any other colony is found after submitting the list. Officials took almost 6 months to submit the list that too only for just one zone. Khaira said the officials are very well aware of the illegal colonies in their areas, but are not taking action intentionally. He said, “I gathered the information under the RTI Act from the police. I had also sought information about FIRs against developers since 2018. Surprisingly, action was taken just against eight developers that too by Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority and not by the MC.” He said the officials though recommend FIRs, they never bother to follow up the matter. And despite their letters to the revenue department, the registration of properties continue in the illegal colonies. Municipal town planner S S Bindra said a regular drive is being carried out against illegal colonies and those which are coming up now will be removed immediately. Asked about FIRs, he said the ATPs concerned are there to follow up the matter with police. No action in the past as well After a survey, the civic officials had traced around 150-200 illegal colonies in MC limits in 2019. But despite serving notices to the developers, nobody came forward to apply under the regularization policy. The then MC Commissioner K P Brar had also asked the officials to go ahead with FIR against such developers. The MC had recommended police action against 78 developers in 2018 too, but no FIR was not registered against any of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/list-of-55-illegal-colonies-out-no-fir-despite-recommendation/articleshow/84512085.cms||---

Sabharwal had warned the officials concerned of action if the drive was a non-starter. The cleanliness around Buddha Nullah becomes crucial in rainy season, which otherwise results in waterlogging and flooding in localities around the drain. On Saturday, the officials were on the field at 6am. They checked the sites where garbage was getting piled up. The officials claimed that pile-ups were near Madhopuri, Tibba Road and Peeru Banda area. Heaps of garbage lying at the dumps near the drain or at other locations were also checked. Superintending engineer of operation and maintenance cell Rajinder Singh said they had to stop the drive due to Covid-19. The employees were also busy in the recovery drive, he said adding they have again deputed employees at the main bridges on the drain to keep a check on dumping of garbage.

Two state ministers and Trinamool Congress leaders — Bratya Basu and Indranil Sen — took to Twitter to attack Pramanik on the issue while Bengal BJP demanded that the ministers provide proof of their allegations. Bora took to Twitter as well and said media reports suggested Pramanik was a “Bangladeshi national”. Sharing his letter to the PM on his Twitter handle, Bora wrote: “It’s a matter of grave concern that a foreign national is an incumbent Union minister. Urging PM@narendramodi in a letter to conduct an enquiry to clarify it.” Citing media reports, he alleged that Pramanik was born in Harinathpur (Bangladesh) and had come to India to study computers. He claimed it was “a serious matter” if a foreign national was appointed as a Union minister. State education minister Basu tweeted: “Rajya Sabha MP @ripunbora asking all the right questions! Several news channels have reported that @NisithPramanik is a citizen of Bangladesh. Did no amount of background check happen before his appointment?! And let’s not forget the innumerable criminal cases...Shame!” Bengal information and cultural affairs minister Sen posted: “Shocked and stunned to learn that Union Minister @NisithPramanik might be a citizen of Bangladesh! This is of alarming concern to the security of India if an incumbent Union Minister is a foreign national. How could the @narendramodi Govt. allow for such a security lapse?” Pramanik has not issued any statement on the allegations, but the BJP has rubbished them. Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu said: “These are just unsubstantiated allegations that do not have any base. If they have proof to back their allegations, they should submit that to the President of India instead of making hollow statements to the media.” The BJP leader added: “Even if we considered their allegations to be true for the sake of debate, it is well in tune with the declared policy of the BJP. Any Hindu is an Indian citizen. The Citizenship Amendment Act is in place and these allegations are just a political ploy. These allegations neither have any political nor any legal significance.” BJP state spokesperson Shamik Bhatacharya echoed Sayantan Basu. “Would request the state ministers to first furnish proof.

While the jawan has claimed that he fired in self-defence, the incident has sparked tension in the area. The deceased has been identified as Ashif Halsana (19), a resident of the same village. According to BSF’s police complaint, a patrol team spotted four to five persons trying to cut down the barbed fence at Bhatgachhi village. On seeing the BSF men, the gang allegedly pelted stones and attacked them with sharp weapons.

Gabriel F Nazereth said he built the temple on his ancestral land in the memory of his parents. The pandemic delayed its inauguration. Various rituals were performed from Wednesday to Friday. “Gabriel is thrilled about his wish being fulfilled,” said his friend and journalist Pundalika Marathe, adding, “Gabriel went to Mumbai in search of a job after completing Class 10. After doing odd jobs for a few years, he set up a factory manufacturing blocks and moulds. He lived in Mumbai for nearly 55 years and became a Ganesha devotee. He remains a Christian but also believes in Lord Siddhivinayak, who is the most revered in Mumbai. On returning to his hometown about a decade ago, he decided to build the temple.” Gabriel built the temple on nearly 20 cents, next to his house, at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore. A 36-inch Ganesha idol has been installed. A house for the temple priest has also been built alongside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/thanksgiving-christian-businessman-builds-ganesha-temple-in-karnataka/articleshow/84515481.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

AFT's Lucknow bench comprising Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava, judicial member, and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve, administrative member, has passed these orders while allowing a petition filed by a retired Subedar from the Army Education Corps. The applicant was enrolled in the Corps on July 15, 1971, and was discharged on July 31, 1999, in low medical category on fulfilling the conditions of his enrolment under Rule 13 (3) Item I (i) (a) of the Army Rules, 1954. The medical board held at Base Hospital, Delhi Cantonment, on January 10, 2015, assessed his disability ‘Essential (primary) hypertension at 30% for life and opined the disability to be neither attributable to nor aggravated by service. AFT RULES The applicant was enrolled in Indian Army on July 15, 1971, and the disability started after more than 23 years of Army service in January, 1995. The disability of the applicant should be considered as aggravated by military service. AFT: Grant disability pension in 4 monthsAggrieved by this, he had approached the AFT, seeking grant of disability pension, which is higher than the normal pension received by the armed forces personnel. Counsel for the applicant pleaded that at the time of enrolment, the applicant was found mentally and physically fit for service in the Army and there is no note in the service documents that he was suffering from any disease at that time. He further argued that the disease of the applicant was contacted during service, hence it is attributable to and aggravated by military service. Applicant is also entitled to disability pension and its rounding off to 50%. Responding to the application, the military authorities contended that the ‘Essential (primary) hypertension’ is neither attributable to nor aggravated by service on the ground of onset of disability in January 1995 while posted in a peace location (Secunderabad), therefore, the applicant is not entitled to disability pension. After hearing both parties, the AFT bench observed, "We are of the opinion that this reasoning of the medical board for denying disability pension to applicants is not convincing….The applicant was enrolled in Indian Army on July 15, 1971, and the disability started after more than 23 years of Army service in January, 1995. The disability of the applicant should be considered as aggravated by military service." Tribunal has directed the military authorities to grant disability pension within a period of four months with effect from three years preceding the date of filing of the application, January 8, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/peace-stations-have-stress-strain-of-military-service/articleshow/84515450.cms||Ajay Sura

The move is aimed at addressing issues around female adolescents — of the girls, by the girls, for the girls! Kunariya village, around 18km from the district headquarters at Bhuj, has a population of about 4,000 people. Young females from the village, aged between 10 and 21 years, will contest the elections. This “girls only” council will run parallel to the adult village version, but only address issues pertaining to adolescent girls and women in the village. The polls, scheduled for Monday, is a closely contested affair. The whole village has geared up in poll mode with rallies, door-to-door campaigns, and voters’ meetings. The result is to be declared the same day. Eight candidates were vying for the post of sarpanch, four of whom have withdrawn their candidature. The contest is now among Bharti Garva, 20, Rubina Node, 19, Trushali Suthar, 20, and Afsana Sumra, 17, each of whom is busy convincing 450-odd voters in the village why she should be voted as the sarpanch. Suresh Chhanga, sarpanch of the village, said: “The elected girls will implement schemes that will address issues of girls and women in the village. The idea is to prepare future women leaders”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/inspired-by-tv-series-gujarat-village-gears-up-for-balika-panchayat-polls/articleshow/84515535.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Partap, whom I have known since 1983, and Captain Sahib would make a good team... He is an old, dyed-in-the-wool Congress man.” The meeting came on a day when Navjot Singh Sidhu sat with a group of ministers and MLAs, including some Amarinder loyalists, before his speculated elevation to state party president. Before the last assembly elections in 2016, it was Amarinder who replaced Bajwa on this post. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu retweeted this post by journalist Vir Sanghvi: “I wonder how Partap Bajwa feels about the imminent Sidhu accession. If they were going to give the job to a Jat Sikh, then he was the obvious choice (RG once tried to make him CM), and unlike Capt and Sidhu, he is at least from a different clan. Man proposes, family disposes.” Bittu posted with the retweet: “It makes sense.” On Thursday as well, Sidhu and Amarinder had parallel meetings with ministers and MLAs, but both sides termed these as routine get-togethers. Earlier, after his meeting with Sidhu, minister Sukhjinder Randhawa said his family’s ties with him went back decades and there was nothing unusual in seeing him before the assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-bajwa-can-make-good-team-tewari/articleshow/84513114.cms||Vibhor Mohan

Recognising the historic opportunity to open flourishing interregional trade routes, the parties intend to cooperate to expand trade, build transit links, and strengthen business-to-business ties, it said. “The parties agreed to meet in the coming months to determine the modalities of this cooperation with mutual consensus,” said the state department. Afghanistan’s strategic location has for a long time been touted as a competitive advantage for the US. Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to the north, and China to the northeast. Located at the heart of the historic Silk Road, Afghanistan was long the crossroads of commerce between Asian countries connecting them to Europe, and enhancing religious, cultural, and commercial contacts. The formation of the new quad group is important amid China’s desire to extend its Belt and Road Initiative to Afghanistan. By virtue of its location, Afghanistan can provide China with a strategic base to spread its influence across the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/us-afghanistan-pakistan-and-uzbekistan-to-form-new-quad-grouping/articleshow/84515798.cms||---

Some 143 people died in the flooding in Germany’s worst natural disaster in more than half a century. That included about 98 in the Ahrweiler district south of Cologne, according to police. Hundreds of people were still missing or unreachable as several areas were inaccessible due to high water levels while communication in some places was still down. Residents and business owners struggled to pick up the pieces in battered towns. “Everything is completely destroyed. You don’t recognise the scenery,” said owner of a wine shop in the town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler in Ahrweiler, fighting back tears. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited Erftstadt in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where the disaster killed at least 43 people. “We mourn with those that have lost friends, family members,” he said. “Their fate is ripping our hearts apart”. Steinmeier said it would take weeks before the full damage, expected to require several billions of euros in reconstruction, could be assessed. In Belgium, the death toll rose to 27, according to the national crisis centre, which is coordinating the relief operation there. It added that 103 people were “missing or unreachable”.

The bulldozers have been at work all around him. At 4pm on Saturday, he also heard commotion. When he stepped out to check, it wasn’t another bulldozer but a water tanker that had just arrived in Khori, triggering a jostle as villagers queued up, buckets in hand. Bulldozers took a break in Khori on Saturday as demolitions were halted to make way for the debris to be cleared. But after repeated appeals from residents, the water tanker had made its way to the village. Their houses razed, many of the villagers are staying put in Khori for the debris to be cleared. While some of them are rummaging through the rubble to look for their belongings, others are selling the rods, bricks and other construction material to make some money. Although the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) has made arrangements for food and shelter on the campus of Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Surajkund — 1.5km away — many of the villagers aren’t willing to leave Khori because they are still searching for their belongings in the debris. The villagers have been asking for food and water to be provided to them in Khori itself, but the authorities feel it would encourage them to stay put in the village. After repeated appeals for drinking water, a tanker eventually arrived in Khori around 4pm on Saturday. Within minutes, the villagers had formed a disorderly queue for water. “Forget food, we don’t even have water to drink in this scorching heat. The tanker that came today could be arranged with much difficulty. The authorities can’t deprive us of the basic needs of food and water like this,” said Singh. For Vimlesh Sharma and a few others, going all the way to the Radha Soami campus for food and water isn’t an option. “The authorities have made announcements that we can go to Surajkund for food and shelter. But we have our belongings amid the rubble. How can we leave whatever is left for us to collect?” Sharma asked. On Saturday, 264 villagers had queued up to be registered for rehabilitation in EWS flats. “Around 300 people came to the Radha Soami campus to have food. We can’t provide food and water in Khori village. That would make it difficult for the authorities to carry out the demolitions,” said Vikas Sharma, the secretary of the Red Cross Society in Faridabad. MCF has collaborated with the Red Cross Society to provide food and temporary shelter to the Khori villagers. Meanwhile, demolitions had to be halted in Khori on Saturday because the mountain of debris made it difficult for the bulldozers to move ahead. The Supreme Court has ordered the demolition of 10,000 houses that have been built illegally on Aravali forest land. “The demolition drive had to be halted on Saturday. The debris needs to be cleared first,” an MCF official said. Villagers said they had been allowed by the officials to sell a portion of the construction material to scrap dealers before the area was cleared. On Saturday, the residents did so. “We don’t have anything left. At least, we will get some money by selling off the old metal rods and other materials,” a villager said. MCF teams put up ownership boards at different parts of the village on Saturday. The boards say that the land in Khori is owned by the MCF. Municipal commissioner Garima Mittal could not be reached for a comment despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/bulldozers-take-a-break-in-khori-a-water-tanker-soothes/articleshow/84517760.cms||Vishakha Chaman

The bulldozers have been at work all around him. At 4pm on Saturday, he also heard commotion. When he stepped out to check, it wasn’t another bulldozer but a water tanker that had just arrived in Khori, triggering a jostle as villagers queued up, buckets in hand.

And on the lines of the Noida Authority, GNIDA has, for the first time, added a 10% premium on land situated within a kilometre on both the sides of the 7.2km-long metro corridor. Now on, all the schemes launched by Greater Noida Authority will be rolled out at the revised property rates. As per the new rates notified by the Authority on Thursday, land premium for all the categories except commercial has been increased by 4.15%. For those looking to buy land close to the metro corridor, officials said the value of property will go up by 14.15% as GNIDA will apply a 10% premium on such plots. While prospective buyers will have to pay an extra amount, the existing allottees staying close to the metro will also have to account for the increased transfer charges. The Authority will demand 2% extra transfer charges from such allottees. The value of plots located along the metro corridor that spans between the Hindon river at one end and Pari Chowk on the other, will be steeper. As not much land is available on this route at present, the secondary market transactions will be more expensive now on. Greater Noida’s additional CEO Amandeep Duli said, “The decision to increase the land rates was taken after carrying out multiple surveys of the localities. We found out that the transactions near the metro corridor are taking place at higher rates than at other places. That’s why a 10% premium has been added on such plots.” Sharing more details, Duli said that the revised rates will be applicable in the forthcoming schemes. “The rates of commercial properties have been left unchanged due to the poor sentiments in the commercial real estate segment. Also owing to the pandemic, the demand for leasing office space and commercial space has come down substantially. Hence we did not increase the rates of commercial plots.” GNIDA hiked property prices significantly in March 2020 across the city. The city is divided into four zones — A, B, C and D — as per the demographic profile and economic activity. This time, the Authority has increased rates only to accommodate the inflation rate and jacked up prices by a further 4.15%. Real estate experts feel that the land rates should have been left unchanged. “Due to the pandemic, a lot of businessmen and entrepreneurs have suffered losses and so have the majority of the families. Increasing the land prices further even by a small margin does not send a good message to the investors,” said Pankaj Kapoor of real estate data analytics company, Liases Foras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/land-along-metro-route-to-cost-14-more/articleshow/84512930.cms||Shalabh

---||Noida||Noida: Three offer executive lift; rob him of Rs 15,000, train tickets||NOIDA: Three men allegedly robbed a private company’s executive of Rs 15,000 and some jewellery on Saturday. The victim, identified as Mohammed Tanzeem, who had an early morning train to catch, was standing at the Sector 12/22/56 T-point around 5.30am to for a commute till Anand Vihar railway station. According to the complainant, two men approached him and asked if he wanted to go to Anand Vihar as they were also headed there, to which Tanzeem replied in the affirmative. After a while, a WagonR car approached them and the three men got on board. Soon after, the accused drove the vehicle towards the Noida-Delhi border via Jhundpura and stopped the car. Tanzeem alleged that the accused claimed that since checking was going on in the area, he should keep all his money in a bag. “After stopping there for some time, the driver took another route towards Delhi. However, they drove towards the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and later the two men overpowered me and snatched the cash bag from me,” he told police. “I was beaten badly and they took Rs 15,000 cash from me. I had a train to catch but they took my tickets as well,” Tanzeem added. He said the accused allegedly attacked him with a blade due to which he suffered several marks on his face, neck and hands. ACP-2 (Noida) Rajnish Verma told TOI that the accused have been captured in multiple CCTV cameras in the Delhi area and as well as in Noida.

---||Gurgaon||Japanese company booked for ‘overcharged’ products||GURUGRAM: A Japanese medical equipment maker was booked by Gurugram police on the directions of a court on Saturday for allegedly inflating product price and distributing under the name of an unregistered importer. According to a probe by the drug controller, the firm declared an MRP of Rs 9,500 for the product – a guidewire used in catheters and surgical procedures – to the authorities, but in the market, the product’s label carried Rs 10,000 as MRP (the samples were collected from the market by the drug controller). Based on data available with the department, the purported overcharged amount for the product was Rs 6.16 crore. On June 10, during the inspection of a hospital by the drug controller, another product – a guiding catheter – was found with a label of another company as an importer. Its MRP on the label was Rs 8,000, though, according to the drug controller, the company had declared an MRP of Rs 7,450. The drug controller held this as a violation of The Drugs (Prices Control) Order 2013. A complaint was submitted to police by the Food & Drugs Administration in Gurugram in June after an opinion from the district attorney was taken, but no FIR was lodged. Sharad Mehrotra, president of the Chemist Association of Gurugram, approached a local court last week and additional session judge Ashwani Kumar on Friday directed an FIR to be registered. “In view of the facts coupled with voluminous documents which have been enclosed with the complaint, this court finds that without proper investigation, justice cannot be done in this case for which loading the FIR is prerequisite,” said the court order. TOI reached out to the company for a comment but did not receive a response. A case was registered at Sadar police station on Saturday under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 467 (fraud), 468 and 471 (forgery) of the IPC and sections of Prevention of Corruption Act against the company, its authorised signatory and sales head.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/japanese-company-booked-for-overcharged-products/articleshow/84513251.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Noida||Ropeway to link Vaishali, Mohan Nagar stations?||GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) is planning to build a ropeway to connect Vaishali metro station on the Blue Line with Mohan Nagar on the Red. The development authority had earlier planned a metro corridor to cover the 4.5km stretch, but dropped the idea since it was proving to be too costly. The GDA has hired a private agency to prepare the detailed project report in a month. Officials said while a metro corridor would have cost Rs 1,800 crore, a ropeway could be built for around Rs 450 crore. “In December last year, Ghaziabad MP Gen VK Singh (retd) had asked officials to explore the option of a ropeway between the two stations. The idea was appreciated at the highest level in Lucknow and we were asked to prepare a feasibility report,” a GDA official said. The development authority had mulled the idea of a ropeway for two other routes. They were Noida Sector 62 station to Vaishali and Shaheed Sthal (New Bus Adda) metro station to Ghaziabad railway station. “The Vaishali to Mohan Nagar route was selected because it is a straight line and there is ample space available along the median for the ropeway to run,” said AK Choudhary, a senior GDA official in the know of the ropeway project. The ropeway, officials said, would be like any other one has seen in the hill stations. “The actual cost of the project can be known only after the DPR has been submitted. But even if the project cost exceeds the estimated Rs 450 crore, it would be much cheaper than building a metro corridor,” Choudhary said. Although the finer details are being worked out, officials said the ropeway — 4.4km long — would have two junctions at Vaishali and Vasundhara for passengers to board. “About 10 ropeway cabs, with a seating capacity of 15 people in each, will operate on the corridor. They will be available every three minutes,” Choudhary said. The travel time between Viashali and Mohan Nagar stations is expected to be less than 10 minutes. On the road, it takes about half an hour to cover the distance. Experts dubbed the project ambitious. Ratnesh Singhal, a road and design consultant based in Ghaziabad, said, “Ropeways are going to be the future of urban transportation. Not just environment-friendly, they are cost-effective too. Land for roads is becoming scarce day by day and the traffic load is ever increasing. Ropeways are the best option and they are very much possible between the Vaishali and Mohan Nagar stations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/ropeway-to-link-vaishali-mohan-ngr-stns/articleshow/84511468.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Noida||Zurich & UP sign shareholding deal for Noida airport||NOIDA: The subsidiary of Zurich International Airport AG has signed a shareholding agreement with Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), the government’s special purpose vehicle for the airport project in Jewar. The deal was signed in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow. NIAL will own the golden share in Yamuna International Airport Pvt Limited (YIAPL), the subsidiary that will develop and operate the airport. A golden share will provide veto power to the UP government and ensure no hostile takeover of the company takes place. “The Noida International Airport will accelerate the development of industrial infrastructure, boost tourism, ease air traffic and create more jobs in the state. Airport operations will generate a multi-dimensional progress, leading to the economic development of UP,” the chief minister said. The title of 1,334 hectares, the land required for the first phase of the project, was transferred to NIAL on Saturday. NIAL will now issue the licence to YIAPL to start construction and authorise it to use the land for the 40-year concession period. Arun Vir Singh, the chief executive officer of NIAL, said YIAPL would soon be given possession of the land. “Only a handful of families are left in Rohi. They have sought a few days’ time. We will clear the site and hand it over to YIAPL for construction to begin at the earliest,” he added. Christoph Schnellmann, the YIAPL CEO, said, “We have been working on the site since last year. We expect construction activities to start in the next few months. The UP government is in the process of concluding rehabilitation and resettlement activities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/zurich-up-sign-shareholding-deal-for-noida-airport/articleshow/84511548.cms||Shalabh

---||Gurgaon||‘Mining changed Yamuna’s course’||GURUGRAM: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed Haryana to review its monitoring mechanism on illegal mining after government officials allegedly failed to act against illegal mining in Sonipat for over three years and submitted false reports with the tribunal. The order was issued in a case about mining activities allegedly changing the course of the Yamuna river in Sonipat. A company that had bagged a government contract was mining in the area, but there are laws that govern it and any activity that changes the course of a river is illegal. Officials of the Sonipat mining department and the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) have been accused of filing false reports with NGT claiming there was no change in course of the river or violation of norms. Sonipat resident Krishan Chander had approached the tribunal earlier last year alleging that DSP Associates, the mining company, diverted the natural flow of the Yamuna by digging a pit that was 20 feet deep and 1km long, and building a bund. In June, NGT sought a factual report from HSPCB on the issue. The board filed a report in October stating the natural flow of the river wasn’t obstructed and a separate road had been constructed for transportation of the mined material. The report was challenged by the petitioner, following which NGT formed a committee in December to prepare a fresh report. The panel submitted its report in March 2021, in which it highlighted that the course of the river was changed for illegal mining, proving the earlier report false. It recommended that an environmental compensation of Rs 1.64 crore be imposed on the company. The committee also observed that illegal mining continued with the connivance of government officials for three years, a sand bund was illegally erected, in-stream mining was carried out, and river flow was illegally diverted. In spite of this, HSPCB falsely reported that there were no violations, it said. In a hearing on July 14, NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the Haryana chief secretary to review the existing monitoring mechanism in the light of the facts disclosed in the case. “The chief secretary may also look into the conduct of the errant officers who failed to take action against illegal mining and gave false reports to this tribunal earlier,” the order said. The tribunal further directed that the state environment department, along with the Sonipat district magistrate, prepare and execute a restoration plan for the area affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mining-changed-yamunas-course/articleshow/84511708.cms||Bagish Jha
