The deluge swept away most of the village in the Nuristan province, destroying around 200 homes, and caught most residents off guard because they were sleeping. By Thursday night, villagers had recovered around 80 bodies; as the search continues, local officials expect the death toll to surpass 200. “It is wiped out; nothing remains after floods,” said Abdul Naser, a resident of the district who visited the village Thursday. “No aid has arrived yet, and there are no measures for caskets, coffins and funerals.” The flash flood is the latest blow for Afghanistan, where fighting between government forces and the Taliban has displaced hundreds of thousands of people in recent months and pushed the country to the brink of a humanitarian crisis, aid agencies say. Since international troops began withdrawing in May, the Taliban have made a swift military advance, gaining control of more than half of the country’s 400-odd districts. But as the militant group presses on in its offensive, raising the possibility of a complete Taliban takeover, many have questioned whether they could effectively govern the war-stricken and foreign aid dependent country if they seize power. The flood, in Kamdesh district, offered an early test for the Taliban’s ability to provide relief services — a sign of effective governance — in the areas they control. On Thursday afternoon, local officials called on the Taliban to grant aid groups access to the district to provide emergency services. But by the afternoon, search and rescue teams had still not been able to reach the remote village largely because the Taliban control the roads into the district, according to a statement from the Ministry for Disaster Management. Local disaster management committees in nearby Kunar and Laghman provinces were working on getting their rescue teams to the area. “The area is under Taliban control, if the Taliban allow us, we will take aid to the area,” said Hafiz Abdul Qayum, the governor of Nuristan province. In a statement Thursday evening, a Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said that the group welcomed aid organizations’ assistance. Floods in northern and eastern Afghanistan are not uncommon this time of year. In August last year, flooding in Charikar, a city on the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains, in northern Afghanistan, killed at least 92 people and injured 108 others. But the flash flood in Nuristan comes as extreme weather has taken a grim toll around the world this summer and scientists warn that warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions is changing the climate. Heavy rainfall is a visible sign of that change, they say, because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture — producing more powerful rain. This month alone, floods deemed once-in-a-millennium or rarer killed at least 170 people in Europe and caused billions in damages after homes, businesses, vehicles and electricity and sewer systems were wiped away. Floodwaters trapped terrified passengers in submerged subway cars, swept cars away and caused power outages in Zhengzhou, China. And monsoon rains set off a flash flood in the Grand Canyon in the United States. In recent decades, flash floods have become increasingly common in Afghanistan after widespread deforestation largely destroyed the open woodlands and closed forests that once slowed the flow of water down mountainsides. With weak governance and entrenched conflict putting people in additional peril, Afghanistan consistently ranks as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, according to the World Bank. Of the 110,000 Afghans who have been affected by some sort of natural disaster so far this year, 75% experienced flooding, according to the United Nations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/at-least-80-killed-as-flash-floods-destroy-village-in-afghanistan/articleshow/84871175.cms||---

Home and political commissioner and secretary M S Manivannan said amid efforts to de-escalate the border tension since Monday’s violence in which six cops from Assam were killed, certain Mizo individuals and organizations were constantly issuing provocative statements against the state and its people. He said the decision to issue a travel advisory was taken after learning from video footage available with Assam police that many Mizo civilians were allegedly heavily armed with automatic weapons. “Given the critical prevailing situation, the people of Assam are advised not to travel to Mizoram as any threat to personal safety of people of Assam can’t be accepted,” the advisory states. On Wednesday, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla had convened a meeting with chief secretaries Jishnu Baruah of Assam and Lalnunmawia Chuaungo of Mizoram and the DGPs of the two states. Both states agreed to maintain deployment beyond the dispute zone, as was being done before the flare-up.

---||World||Senate OKs bill to secure Capitol, help Afghans with visas||WASHINGTON: An emergency spending bill passed by the Senate 98-0 on Thursday would bolster security at the Capitol and repay outstanding debts from the Jan. 6 insurrection. The $2.1 billion bill would also increase the number of visas for allies who worked alongside Americans in the Afghanistan war.  Democrats and Republicans struck an agreement on the legislation this week, saying the money is urgently needed for the Capitol Police and for the translators and others who worked closely with US government troops and civilians in Afghanistan.  The bill loosens some requirements for the visas, which lawmakers say are especially pressing as the US military withdrawal enters its final weeks and Afghan allies face possible retaliation from the Taliban.  The House is expected to vote on the legislation in the coming days and send it to President Joe Biden.  The money for the Capitol - including for police salaries, the National Guard and to better secure windows and doors around the building - comes more than six months after the violent insurrection by former President Donald Trump's supporters and is scaled back from a House-passed bill and previous Democratic proposals.  Democrats have said that if Congress doesn't pass the bill, money would start running out for officers' salaries by August and that the National Guard might have to cancel some training programs.  "We can't let that happen," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said before the vote. He said the agreement "shouldn't have taken this long" but that passing the legislation is living up to Congress' responsibility to keep the Capitol safe "and to make sure that the people who risk their lives for us and protect us get the help they need."  The bill's passage comes after four police officers who fought off the rioters in the Jan. 6 attack testified in an emotional House hearing on Tuesday and detailed the "medieval" battle in which they were brutally beaten and verbally assaulted. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested on Wednesday that the hearing had perhaps "jarred the Senate to move in a bipartisan way to pass this legislation."  A more generous bill narrowly passed the House in May, but no Republicans supported it and some liberal Democrats voted against it as well. In the Senate, Republicans rejected Leahy's earlier $3.7 billion proposal before they negotiated the final version.  Pelosi said the Senate bill is months overdue.  "It's not what we sent, it's certainly not what we need, but it's a good step forward," she said. "It doesn't mean that we're finished, but it does mean that we can't wait another day until we strengthen the Capital Police force, strengthen the Capitol."  The legislation would boost personal protection for lawmakers who have seen increasing death threats since the insurrection, install new security cameras around the complex and replace riot equipment the police lost in the fighting that day. It would fund new intelligence gathering and boost wellness and trauma support for the Capitol Police, as many troops are still suffering in the wake of the attack. And it would reimburse the National Guard $521 million for the thousands of troops that protected the Capitol for more than four months after the siege.  Unlike the previous proposals, the legislation would not provide money for temporary fencing in case of another attack or create a new quick reaction force within the police or military that could respond to events at the Capitol. Police were overrun on Jan. 6 as the National Guard took hours to arrive.  For the allies in Afghanistan, the bill would allow 8,000 additional visas and provide $500 million for their emergency transportation, housing and other essential services.  Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the appropriations panel, who negotiated the legislation with the Democrats, said it would be "shameful" not to help the Afghan allies and that they could be killed by the Taliban as the U.S. withdraws.  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said senators "intend to keep our nation's promises to brave Afghans who have taken great risks to help America and our partners fight the terrorists."  The House overwhelmingly passed separate legislation last week to provide the visas, 407-16. Biden decreed an end to the US military role in Afghanistan by Sept. 11. The Pentagon says the troop withdrawal is more than 95% complete and is to be finished by Aug. 31.  The White House issued a statement of support for the legislation, saying the Biden administration backs the Capitol security improvements and "remains committed to supporting the Afghan people, including by fulfilling our commitment to Afghan nationals who worked for or on behalf of the U.S. Government."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senate-oks-bill-to-secure-capitol-help-afghans-with-visas/articleshow/84871777.cms||---

Some of the state toppers are not only classmates but also close friends who studied for the exam together. The 1st, 2nd and 7th rank holders from Karnataka — Rishab Devaiah, Rakshit Vikas Agarwal and Swagath Srinivasan — are classmates (commerce) at St Josephs Boys School and close friends. Rishabh and Swagath were classmates from montessori to class 10 in their previous school, Sishu Griha, as well. The state’s 14th rank holder, Tarun Ashok, was also their classmate in Sishu Griha, and is currently in National Public School, Indiranagar. The three of them went to the same coaching centre, while Rakshit went to its Koramangala branch. All the four boys are keen on joining National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru and given their ranks, they are sure they will land the seats. NLSIU is also having domicile quota for students who studied for more than 10 years in Karnataka for the first time from this year. On Thursday morning, Rishab, Swagath and Tarun met at a friend’s place along with some other pals to celebrate their success together. “It’s the icing on the cake. Not only are we getting to join the best law college (NLSIU), but are going to do it together. We prepared for CLAT together — from discussing topics and sharing mock test results to figuring out mistakes and attending classes online and offline. While I had got into a different school, CLAT preparation was a good way to catch up with them,” said Tarun, who holds all-India rank 124. Rishab, whose all-India rank is 14, is a regular at Model United Nations, quizzes and parliamentary debates. “I took an aptitude test after class 10. I eliminated all courses that I did not want to pursue to find out what I actually like… For CLAT preparation, I watched topper interviews to get tips, wrote mock tests, analysed them, figured out where I was going wrong and made my own mock analysis book,” he said. Rakshit said it was his deep interest in serving society that prompted him to take up law. “Only 20% of the deserving actually get access to legal aid. I believe the reason for my success in the exam is my ability to remain calm. Even though I initially felt the pressure, I learnt how to keep calm. I realised what my strengths are and used them to my advantage,” said Rakshit, whose all-India rank is 20. Swagath said the pandemic came as a blessing in disguise as they got time to concentrate on CLAT in the past one year. “The pattern changed last year and we could focus on the new pattern this time. We also tried to keep abreast of current affairs and built a solid foundation. Law and politics have always interested me and I wanted to pursue a career in it,” he said. His all-India rank is 62.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/these-ktaka-clat-toppers-are-classmates-prepared-together/articleshow/84871898.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Dr Nagarathna Bailey from Hanumantanagar stated in her complaint that she was trying to get a connection for her son who is pursuing an engineering course. She had sent an online request to a service provider on April 29 this year and received a call from the customer care services of the firm the same day. The doctor was told that an executive would be sent to explain the tariff and other plan details. The next day, a person identified as Bhanuchandra M met her at the workplace. While she enquired him about the six-month plan, he suggested she choose another plan where a router would be offered free of cost. She agreed and paid him Rs 74,420, including Rs 33,560 in cash. But the man neither provided any internet connection nor returned her money. She found his mobile phone was switched off and the service provider did not respond to her complaint. Shankarapura police have registered a case of cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/doctor-seeks-internet-connection-loses-74000/articleshow/84871953.cms||---

The National Weather Service said several areas recorded wind gusts in excess of 60 mph that knocked down tree limbs or toppled whole trees, damaging some power lines. Weather observers recorded a 64 mph wind gust at the DuPage Airport in DuPage County about 3 a.m., while the Chicago Executive Airport in Cook County had a 55 mph wind gust. ComEd reported that more than 24,000 of its customers remained without power about 7:20 a.m. The Illinois Department of Transportation said some trees were toppled in Waukegan just before 4 a.m., as the storms pushed across the area. The National Weather Service said “life-threatening” swim conditions were expected Thursday on Lake Michigan as a cold front moves its way through the area, bringing cooler, less humid air. According to a beach hazard statement, waves of 4 to 7 feet and rip currents are expected along the lake in Cook County and in northwestern Indiana’s Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties until Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/severe-storms-leave-outages-tree-damage-in-chicago-area/articleshow/84871553.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Five toy guns imported for movie get cops’ nod||BENGALURU: Five toy semi-automatic guns which were imported from Turkey for a big-budget Kannada movie starring a leading actor and were stuck in the cargo wing of Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) for nearly three weeks are likely to be released in a couple of days as police have given a green signal. While the movie makers were insisting they urgently needed the toy guns to shoot the climax, Bangalore Customs was awaiting a police report confirming they were indeed toys to avoid trouble. Sources in KIA confirmed police issued an NOC on Wednesday night and the toy guns would be released in a few days. Police sources said the guns appeared capable of firing a real bullet but closer examination revealed they were toys. KIA sources said the consignment from Istanbul reached the air cargo wing about three weeks ago. A customs officer spotted five semi-automatic weapons inside it and found that the maker was a weapon-manufacturing company. The parcel was opened and examination revealed what looked like real semi-automatic weapons. “The importer in Bengaluru in whose name the consignment was booked from Istanbul was contacted and he was found to have imported it for a Kannada movie starring a leading actor. Though he claimed they were toy guns, the same was not declared in the bill of entry for the import,” said the sources. The movie makers later told customs sleuths that the toy guns were to be used for filming of the climax scene and were needed urgently as the film’s release date was fast approaching. “But customs officials couldn’t clear them without declaration of Bengaluru City Police, which is the assessing authority in case of involvement of firearms,” the sources added. Bangalore Customs is said to have contacted the deputy commissioner of police (intelligence), Bengaluru. Following this, a police team, including a ballistic specialist, visited the cargo wing at KIA and examined the guns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/5-toy-guns-imported-for-movie-get-cops-nod/articleshow/84871999.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka students will get better chance in other states||BENGALURU: The reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Economically Weaker Section (EWS) within the All India quota would mean that Karnataka students from these categories will get an opportunity to try for seats in their preferred medical colleges in other states. In government medical colleges in the state, 85% of the seats are for state quota and 15% for All India quota. Introduction of the OBC and EWS quota within the All India quota does not impact the state quota in any way. “This does not affect the 85% state quota in government medical colleges in Karnataka. The 15% quota is with the Centre and the change is only in that. Students from these categories will get a better chance to study in good medical colleges in other states,” said the dean of a government medical college. Currently, there are 432 seats in the All India quota in 18 government medical colleges in Karnataka. With the quota, there will be more chances for OBC and EWS category students from other states to join Karnataka colleges. The EWS quota in the state quota is yet to be implemented in Karnataka even though many others have implemented it. The new government will have to now take a decision on it. According to sources, there might be some clarity before NEET is held in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/better-chance-for-karnataka-students/articleshow/84872031.cms||---
---||World||UN demands Turkey, Turkish Cypriots reverse Varosha action||UNITED NATIONS: The UN Security Council on Thursday again demanded that Turkey and Turkish Cypriots immediately reverse all actions to reopen the abandoned resort of Varosha and backed further talks "in the near future" on reunifying the divided Mediterranean island. In a resolution adopted unanimously extending the UN peacekeeping mission in Cyprus for six months, the council stressed "the need to avoid any unilateral action that could trigger tensions on the island and undermine the prospects for a peaceful settlement." The island was divided into a breakaway Turkish Cypriot north and an internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south in 1974 following Turkey's invasion, which was triggered by a coup aimed at Cyprus' union with Greece. Cyprus is a member of the European Union but the breakaway north is only recognized by Turkey, which is not an EU member. Varosha is a suburb of Famagusta, a city that was Cyprus' pre-1974 tourism hub thanks to its pristine beaches and modern hotels. After Varosha's 15,000 Greek Cypriot residents fled in the face of advancing Turkish troops, the area was fenced-off to prevent any access until last October when Turkish and Turkish Cypriot authorities announced its "reopening." Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar followed up with an announcement on July 20 that a 3.5 square-kilometer (1.35 square-mile) section of Varosha would revert from military to civilian control. He made it ahead of a military parade attended by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to commemorate the 47th anniversary of the Turkish invasion. The Security Council resolution reiterated that "no actions should be carried out in relation to Varosha" that violate 1984 and 1992 resolutions calling for its transfer to UN administration - which has not happened - and saying any attempts to settle any part of Varosha "by people other than its inhabitants" is "inadmissible." The council issued a presidential statement on Varosha on July 23, a step below a resolution, which is legally binding. Varosha's former residents have denounced the latest move as a bid to take advantage of their desperation over the area's future and to psychologically pressure them into selling off their properties. Many Turkish Cypriots also condemned the move as undermining ongoing efforts at reconciliation between the two communities. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres held informal talks with Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders in Geneva in April. Those failed to make headway on the island's future, but the UN chief said talks will continue and "I do not give up." Both Turkey's Erdogan and Turkish Cypriot leader Tatar have said a permanent peace in Cyprus can only come through the international community's recognition of two separate states, upending decades of negotiations to reach a federation-based reunification accord with political equality. The Security Council on Thursday noted "with regret that sufficient common ground could not be found at the (April) meeting to allow for the resumption of formal negotiations at this time." But it "fully" supported the secretary-general's ongoing efforts "and the agreement by the parties to convene a further round of informal talks in the near future." The council reiterated the importance of all participants approaching these talks "in the spirit of openness, flexibility and compromise and to show the necessary political will and commitment to freely negotiate a mutually acceptable settlement under United Nations auspices." On another contentious issue, oil and gas exploration in eastern Mediterranean waters that Cyprus claims as its own, the Security Council noted "the easing of tensions" over hydrocarbons, underlined that disputes should be solved peacefully, and called on Greek and Turkish Cypriots "to refrain from any actions and rhetoric that might damage the settlement process." The council said it remains convinced "of the many important benefits, including economic benefits, for all Cypriots and the wider region that would flow from a comprehensive and durable settlement." The UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus, known as UNFICYP, was originally established by the council in 1964 to prevent further fighting between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. After the 1974 Turkish invasion, it took on other duties including supervising cease-fire lines, maintaining a buffer zone and undertaking humanitarian activities. The resolution extends the mandate of the more than 1,000-strong peacekeeping mission until January 31, 2022. It expresses "serious concern at the continued violations of the military status quo along the cease-fire lines, the reported encroachment by both sides into the buffer zone and the risks associated, and the increase in unauthorized construction." Cyprus" UN Ambassador Andreas Hadjichrysanthou called UNFICYP "indispensable" and welcomed the resolution's reiteration of "the grave and dangerous" situation in Varosha and the call for UN peacekeepers to be allowed there. He said Cyprus is ready to resume negotiations on the basis of a bi-communal bi-zonal federation with political equality which it remains convinced "addresses the concerns of all Cypriots in a reunited independent Cyprus without external interference."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/un-demands-turkey-turkish-cypriots-reverse-varosha-action/articleshow/84871956.cms||---
---||World||US capital city issues sweeping mask requirement||WASHINGTON: Masks will be required indoors in Washington, D.C., for everyone 2 years and older starting Saturday, Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Thursday, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus. The mandate will put the nation's capital in line with updated guidance that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released this week in an effort to contain the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Many federal government institutions in Washington and its suburbs have already implemented similar mask requirements and President Joe Biden is expected to announce additional measures for the federal workforce later on Thursday. In addition, the Smithsonian said it would reimpose mask requirements at its museums that line the National Mall and other indoor venues for visitors 2 years and older beginning on Friday "regardless of vaccination status." Face coverings may be removed while eating or drinking in designated areas, it said in a statement on Thursday. By the beginning of July, Washington had hit its lowest rate of community spread of Covid-19 since the global pandemic began a year and a half ago. Over the course of the month, the daily case rate has increased fivefold, at the same time that the test positivity rate rose, LaQuandra Nesbitt, director of the city's health department, said at a public briefing before Bowser announced the new mandate. Current estimates indicate more than half the city's residents have been fully vaccinated, according to public health agency data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-capital-city-issues-sweeping-mask-requirement/articleshow/84872334.cms||---
---||Delhi||#SafeFootForward: How to step out safely amid COVID-19 risks||After months of uncertainty, when markets and malls reopened post COVID-19’s second wave, Delhiites rushed to their favourite hangout spots. As reopening speds up, outings are back not just on weekends but every day. Malls are witnessing around 50,000 visitors on weekends and 20,000 on weekdays. However, with experts predicting a third wave, if you’re planning to step out, it is advised to make reservations and choose non-rush hours. ‘Pre-book your tables to avoid waiting’Almost after a month of reopening of restaurants and bars in NCR, packed evenings and sold-out weekend lunch hours are back. Even as restaurants and bars are allowed to operate in NCR with 50% seating capacity and restricted timing (Gurgaon till 11pm, Delhi and Noida till 10pm), footfall has been good, and on weekends it is quite higher. “Delhi and Gurgaon restaurants are totally packed on weekends, and even diners from Noida choose to drive to their favourite outlets in Delhi and Gurgaon as Noida still has a weekend curfew. Almost 50% of our tables are reserved before the weekend and the other 50% we keep open for walk-ins,” informs Vikrant Batra, owner, Café Delhi Heights, which has outlets across NCR. Saurabh Khanijo, owner of Kylin Experience, says that there has been “an immediate bounce back in footfall after the second lockdown. This time, even the restricted timeline is not a deterrent for people. I see diners coming out for dinner by 7-7.30pm, which would never happen in Delhi earlier.” ‘Afternoon Outings to avoid crowds’People say that it is almost impossible to find a restaurant on weekends as there are no tables. Satyam Kalra, a visitor, says, “I have been going to restaurants to meet my friends, and what I have learnt is to book in advance. You have to be strategic to plan outings if you want to avoid the crowd. So if the same restaurant has a branch in a market and a mall – go for the mall, prefer afternoon and early evening outings over late evenings to avoid the crowd.” Special offers for Vaccinated patronsMall owners say that they are taking all the necessary safety measures amid the pandemic. Malls that turned into vaccination camps are also gearing up to provide incentives for fully and partially vaccinated visitors. Yogeshwar Sharma, Executive Director, Select Citywalk, says, “People are confident to step out, and we are taking all safety measures. Besides, we are currently discussing implementing encouragement packages for vaccinated customers. It would include free parking, retail vouchers and discounted f&b for takeaway.” “We are taking every step to ensure that our vaccination drive becomes a success. We are offering incentives to people who are getting inoculated and contributing towards a safer social environment for fellow citizens,” says Abhishek Bansal, Executive Director, Pacific Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/safefootforward-how-to-step-out-safely-amid-covid-19-risks/articleshow/84863133.cms||Niharika Lal
---||World||Probe: No wrongdoing in Richmond statue-removal contract||RICHMOND: A Virginia special prosecutor has found no wrongdoing in the awarding of a $1.8 million contract for the removal of Richmond's Confederate statues last summer.  Timothy Martin, the elected prosecutor in Augusta County who was appointed to handle the matter, said in a news release Wednesday that he had reviewed the findings of a state police investigation and found no criminal activity.  The investigation into the contract, which was awarded to the owner of a construction firm who had made modest political donations to Democratic Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, was initiated after complaints from a political rival of Stoney's in the middle of an election season.  Jeffrey Breit, an attorney for Stoney, said Thursday the mayor is pleased with the findings.  "It is exactly what I said in July of last year," Breit said, calling the investigation an attempt to "throw a political bullet in the middle of a campaign."  The investigation found that Stoney did not suggest the contractor, Devon Henry of Newport News-based Team Henry Enterprises, Martin wrote.  The investigation also affirmed the mayor's previous assertions that the city reached out to a number of contractors to do the work, all of whom refused, according to Martin. Some either personally objected to the statue removal or feared that removing the monument posed a security risk, he said.  Martin noted that the high value of the contract also attracted scrutiny. He said that while the lack of competition likely drove up the price, taking a profit in a transaction with a government entity is not criminal.  Stoney's administration initially declined to answer questions from reporters about who was behind a shell company, NAH LLC, that records showed the city had contracted with for the removal of the statues. News outlets later uncovered through public records requests that NAH was linked to Henry.  Martin wrote that while the concealment of the contractor's identity led to suspicion "as to whether this was done in order to conceal an improper transaction" the facts don't support such a conclusion.  "Because tensions were running so high at the time, and many people expressed passionate opinions about the proposed removal, the contractor chose to keep his identity hidden, which is not a crime," Martin wrote.  In a statement, Henry said he was pleased the investigation had concluded and "this politically generated dark cloud can be removed."  Henry - whose firm recently handled the removal of several monuments in Charlottesville, including the equestrian statue of Robert E. Lee at the center of the violent Unite the Right rally in 2017 - said he was proud of his team's work in Richmond on "a complex and potentially dangerous job."  Henry, who is Black and has said he formed the shell company for safety and privacy reasons, told The Associated Press last year that he faced death threats after his identity was made public.  Martin said in the news release that in the interest of public confidence, he wanted to emphasize that unlike the mayor, he is a Republican from a conservative jurisdiction.  "I have no bias in favor of him based on some shared ideology or members in the same political party. I have no personal relationship with him, as the two of us have never met," Martin wrote.  A court appointed Martin to handle the review of the state police investigation at the request of the commonwealth's attorney for Richmond, Colette McEachin. She initially declined to take up the matter, citing a donation Henry had made to a political campaign of her husband, U.S. Rep. Donald McEachin, when he was running for state senate.  Henry's team removed most of Richmond's Confederate statues last summer, after protests erupted in Richmond and around the world over the killing of George Floyd in police custody. The city is now grappling with what to do with the remaining pedestals, some of which are enormous.  Richmond, which was the capital of the Confederacy for most of the Civil War, was dotted with Confederate tributes.  One of the city's largest Confederate monuments, a statue of Lee along historic Monument Avenue, is still in place. The monument is the property of the state, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's plans to remove it have been tied up in court. The governor's administration is awaiting a decision from the Virginia Supreme Court about whether the piece can come down.  The court heard arguments in June and could rule at any time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/probe-no-wrongdoing-in-richmond-statue-removal-contract/articleshow/84874139.cms||---

The number of countries from which students participated in the programme also grew significantly, from 12 in 2020-21 to 136 in 2021-22. According to data accessed exclusively by TOI, the number of applications crossed the 50,000-mark this year, up from 20,659 in 2020. Of the 50,739 applicants, 72.8% took the online test conducted on July 25, 2021, up from 23.8% last year. Started in 2018-19, the SII programme, now renamed Pragatii (Performance Rating of Applicants through Global Aptitude Test for Indian Institutes), struggled despite the government providing scholarships to foreign students to pursue their higher education in Indian institutions. The first year saw no participation, and the second and third too received lukewarm response. Only 800 applied for 12,000 scholarships in 2019, while only 1,200 applied for 2,500 scholarships in the following year. However, there seems to be a turnaround this year. According to experts, keeping only those institutions with 3.26 NAAC grade and up to 100 rank in the NIRF as eligibility for the scheme were the primary reasons for the poor response. The secretary (higher education), ministry of education, Amit Khare said: “NIRF ranking is the academic ranking. But when a student comes to India, whether from European countries or US or Africa, they are looking not only for the academic ranking, but also the type of living conditions which are there in terms of hostels, transport etc. So, the change that we are bringing is partly academic ranking and also the choice of the students. We cannot ask students to come to only the Indian Institute of Science or IITs. It is possible that some other institutions may have better facilities and a foreign student may find it more comfortable.” “When a foreign student comes, she or he has to go to the FRRO (Foreigners Regional Registration Officer), to some hospital for medical certificates, and then look around for accommodation. But most other countries have a dedicated international students office and everything is done there. So, we set up international students offices in 164 universities in 2020-21,” explained Khare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/146-rise-in-applications-for-study-in-india-programme/articleshow/84874105.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

It had reduced the number of weekly flights from about 40 to under 10 when the second wave of Covid-19 here saw the United States imposing restrictions on travelers from India starting May 4. Now, the airline will operate at least 21 flights per week to the US, with the maximum increase in flights to New York (JFK and Newark or EWR), followed by those to Chicago and San Francisco, say people in the know. United Airlines, the only other airline with nonstops between the two countries, is not altering India flight frequencies for now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/student-rush-air-india-doubling-flights-to-us-from-august-7/articleshow/84874526.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The minister, in a written reply to a query, said about 3,036 such PILs have been filed since 2019. Giving further details on PILs related to fundamental rights pending in various high courts, Rijiju said the Punjab and Haryana HC has the highest 1,312 PILs pending as of 24 July, followed by the HCs of Madras and Rajasthan with over 1,100 PILs each.

Rijiju said the total pending PILs in the apex court is 2,879 as of July 23. While the high courts of Allahabad, Delhi, Kerala, Punjab & Haryana and Bombay said they don’t maintain a separate databank on PILs regarding violation of fundamental rights, the Calcutta HC said 204 PILs had been filed on the subject since 2019; six in the Chhattisgarh HC; 77 in Gujarat HC; 165 in the Gauhati HC; 646 in the Andhra Pradesh HC; 68 in the J&K HC and 630 in Rajasthan HC. Responding to another question related to electoral reforms, Rijiju said proposals on “quadruple qualifying dates for registration of voters against the single date available as of now and ban on display of election matter 48 hours before the close of poll in media” are under consideration of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-8k-pils-on-fundamental-rights-violation-pending-in-supreme-court-govternment/articleshow/84874525.cms||---
---||India||Dalit children more likely to be stunted, shows study||NEW DELHI: That India has the highest number of stunted children in the world, (40.6 million children, as per NFHS data) representing one-third of the global total of stunted children under the age of five, is well known. Now, a data narrative published by Ashoka University’s centre for economic data and analysis shows that stunting is much more likely among Dalit children in areas where caste-based untouchability is higher, such as the BIMARU states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh). This shows how discriminatory practices such as poor sanitation or a mother’s lack of access to health services affect a child’s height and health. According to NFHS data, the average incidence of stunting in India is 13% higher compared to the average of 30 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Stunting was attributed to multiple causes such as birth order and son preference (first-borns are less likely to be stunted but then stunting kicks especially if the other children are girls) disease prevalence (open defecation and lack of clean water) and genetic differences. In their paper titled The Missing Piece of the Puzzle: Caste Discrimination and Stunting, authors Ashwini Deshpande and Rajesh Ramachandran found that rates of stunting are far lower among upper caste Hindus as compared to SC/STs, OBCs, UC Muslims. The stunting incidence was 26% for children of upper caste Hindus as compared to 31% of children in SSA. In comparison, 40% children belonging to SC/ST communities suffered from stunting, 36% from the OBC community and 35% from the upper caste Muslim community. “58% of SC-ST households have no access to a toilet facility, compared to 23% upper caste Hindus, and maternal literacy is 83% for upper caste Hindus as compared to 51% for SC-ST,” Deshpande said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dalit-children-more-likely-to-be-stunted-shows-study/articleshow/84874689.cms||Himanshi Dhawan
---||India||No manual scavenging deaths in last five years, govt tells House||NEW DELHI: Sharing that 66,692 people were engaged in manual scavenging before a ban came into effect in December 2013, the ministry of social justice and empowerment in response to a written question in Rajya Sabha has said that no death has been reported due to manual scavenging during the last five years. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act 2013 bans the practice. On July 28, to a question as to how many people are currently engaged in manual scavenging, the minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale reported the number based on two surveys carried out in 2013 and 2018. Stating that this data is based on reports from states, the reply says the the maximum number of manual scavengers were in UP (37,379) followed by Maharashtra (7.378) and Assam (4,295). To the question about the number of people engaged in the practice who died in the last five years, Athawale said, "No such deaths have been reported due to manual scavenging." The statement immediately set off comparisons with the Centre’s recent "no deaths due to oxygen shortage" statement. Times ViewThe two different responses in Parliament create an artificial difference between manual scavengers and sewage cleaners which is misleading. Those who die inhaling noxious fumes in the sewers cannot be separated from those who clean dry latrines, which despite being banned, continue to exist in some pockets of the country. Both are engaged in the same job of cleaning excreta. For the record, manual scavenging was outlawed in India in 1993. In 2018, Raman Magsaysay award recipient Bezwada Wilson had told this newspaper that Safai Karamchari Andolan, the NGO he runs, had gathered evidence that at least 1,790 such deaths had occurred over the past two decades.In a reply to a similar question in Lok Sabha in February last year, while maintaining there had been no reports regarding deaths due to manual scavenging, the ministry said "the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis has received reports regarding the death of persons while cleaning sewers and septic tanks." The differentiation indicated that deaths due to surface scavenging might be rare. But it is not clear why this explanatory information was not part of Thursday’s reply. Earlier this year during the budget session, the ministry informed Lok Sabha that as many as 340 people died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks during the last five years as per the cases reported by the states and UTs up to December 31, 2020. Maximum cases were reported from UP at 52 deaths followed by Tamil Nadu (43), Delhi (36), Maharashtra (34), and 31 each in Gujarat and Haryana. The 2020 answer gives state-wise details of deaths and compensation paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-manual-scavenging-deaths-in-last-five-years-govt-tells-house/articleshow/84874821.cms||---

Out of this number, Uttar Pradesh accounted for over 4 lakh such children. This data was shared by the women and child development ministry in response to a question in Rajya Sabha. WCD minister Smriti Irani said “as per ICDS-RRS Portal (as on 30th November, 2020), 9,27,606 severely acute malnourished (SAM) children (6 months-6 years) have been identified in the country, out of which 3,98,359 are from the state of Uttar Pradesh. Under the Integrated Child Development Services, supplementary nutrition is provided to children including severely malnourished children in the age group of 6 months-6 years.” She further shared that under the flagship programme Poshan Abhiyan, aimed at reducing malnutrition, the ministry has released Rs 5,312.7 crore to states and union territories from 2017-18 to 2020-21, out of which Rs 2,985.5 crore has been utilised up to March 31. Under Poshan Abhiyaan, target is to bring down stunting of children under 6 years from 38.4% to 25% by the year 2022. In another question related to the subject of malnutrition, the ministry shared that according to National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16), prevalence of undernutrition among women was 22.9% as compared to male (20.2%), which was an improvement from the levels of 35.5% and 34.2% respectively reported in NFHS-3 (2005-06). To ensure consistent and accurate recording and reporting of the critical programme data, the ministry has initiated efforts towards quality data collection via ICT based application Poshan Tracker for real-time monitoring and providing real-time information relating to various parameters of service delivery and malnutrition under Mission Poshan 2.0.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-9-lakh-kids-most-from-up-acutely-malnourished/articleshow/84874886.cms||---
---||World||New Yorkers say they've been ignored in stop-and-frisk fight||NEW YORK: Eight years after a judge ruled New York City police violated the constitution by stopping, questioning and frisking mostly Black and Hispanic people on the street en masse, people in communities most affected by such tactics say they've been shut out of the legal process to end them.  Lawyers for plaintiffs in two landmark stop-and-frisk lawsuits said in court papers Thursday that community stakeholders have had "very little contact" in the last three years with the court-appointed monitor overseeing reforms and that reports he's issued don't reflect their experiences.  They're demanding greater input, including an advisory board comprised mostly of reform advocates and public housing residents, annual community surveys and biannual audits of NYPD stop-and-frisk and trespass enforcement activity - the results of which would then be summarized in public reports every six months.  "There has been a disconnect and a drift of this reform process run by the monitor and the impacted communities - the people who are experiencing these patterns of police activity," Corey Stoughton, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, said in an interview.  The monitor, Peter Zimroth, was appointed in 2013 by U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin after she ruled that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk tactics were a form of indirect racial profiling that violated the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law.  Scheindlin also ordered what's known as a joint-remedial process seeking input from more than 2,000 people in communities most impacted by police stop-and-frisk and trespass enforcement practices. That process, which led to more than dozen reform proposals, ended in 2018.  Since then, according to lawyers involved in Thursday's court filing, Zimroth has excluded community members' perspectives from his semi-annual assessments. Instead, they said, he has relied on NYPD data, statements of police personnel and civilian complaints that have been seen by the court as a dubious measure of whether a stop was motivated by race.  A message seeking comment was left with Zimroth, a law professor and the director of the Center on Civil Justice at New York University. A message was also left with the NYPD.  Plaintiffs in the stop-and-frisk lawsuits held a rally Thursday outside police headquarters on to announce the court filing and demand an end to stop and frisk abuses. They were joined by the city's public advocate, Jumaane Williams, several members of city council and police reform organizations.  The community board proposed in Thursday's court filing would consist of seven members, including three living in public housing and two from the police watchdog organization Communities United for Police Reform.  The board, similar to ones overseeing police reforms in Seattle and Cleveland, would have a leading role in shaping changes to police discipline, the court papers said.  "If we and other representatives of directly impacted communities are not meaningfully consulted and involved in the Monitorship moving forward, the Monitorship will not result in meaningful changes to the NYPD's unconstitutional and racially discriminatory stop-and-frisk and trespass enforcement practices," Loyda Colon, executive director of the Justice Committee, said in a court declaration.  At its peak, the NYPD's use of stop and frisk resulted in millions of police stops of mostly Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.  They dramatically decreased after Scheindlin's rulings in the cases challenging their constitutionality, David Floyd v. City of New York and Kelton Davis v. City of New York.  The NYPD reported little more than 9,500 stop-and-frisks last year, down from about 684,000 in 2011. There were about 13,500 stops in 2019.  Still, activists say, the people police are stopping continue to be predominantly non-white.  "We have not seen the change we hoped we would see," Sala Cyril, lead organizer with the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, said in a court declaration. "People in the community are definitely still being stopped illegally."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-yorkers-say-theyve-been-ignored-in-stop-and-frisk-fight/articleshow/84875091.cms||---
---||India||New normal? Parliament does business amid din||NEW DELHI: Amid din, Lok Sabha passed two bills on Thursday within a few minutes before being adjourned for the day as opposition members continued their protests on multiple issues, including Pegasus spyware row and farm laws. Rajya Sabha too passed the Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2021, aimed at helping the MSME sector, in the midst of disruptions. The bill has already been passed by Lok Sabha. While the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2021, moved by Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, took 13 minutes to be passed, the second one, Inland Vessels Bill, 2021, moved by Shipping and Waterways Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, got the House’s nod with a voice vote in six minutes. RSP member N K Premachandran condemned the move of passing the legislations in that manner when House was not in order. Premchandran wanted to move an amendment to the Inland Vessels Bill. In Rajya Sabha, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman moved the bill to amend laws to help the MSME sector soon after the Lunch recess. As the Opposition MPs crowded the Well and shouted slogans, she sought to underline how the bill would provide relief to the sector with a smoother capital cycle and healthier cash flow. “It is a very important bill which will benefit the MSMEs of this country because a difficulty is constantly expressed by the MSME that their receivables are getting delayed. As a result there is a provision of selling their receivables to a third party. If the third party is going to make an immediate availability of funds, they shall be able to move their business smoothly,” said Sitharaman. The bill was passed after a mere 15-minute discussion, during which TRS MP K R Suresh Reddy, while supporting the legislation, said it should have been more comprehensive in benefiting the MSMEs. AIADMK MP M Thambi Durai pointed out the delayed payment woes of MSMEs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-normal-parliament-does-business-amid-din/articleshow/84875132.cms||---

This includes five cases filed against the Times of India and one against the Economic Times. In its manifesto for the 2021 assembly election, DMK had promised to withdraw all such defamation cases filed against media houses. In most cases, complaints for criminal defamation are filed on behalf of the government through the city public prosecutor by issuing a government order (GO). In some cases, the ministers or the persons aggrieved would initiate such proceeding in their personal capacity. The government can’t withdraw cases filed by people in their personal capacity. However, cases filed on behalf of the state can be withdrawn by issuing a set of GOs cancelling the GOs sanctioning filing of criminal defamation complaints. Now, in view of the order issued by CM M K Stalin, the state government would issue a set of GOs cancelling the older GOs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tamil-nadu-withdraws-90-defamation-cases-targeting-media-outlets/articleshow/84875338.cms||---

The pilot project will be launched during the 2021-22 academic session. At a function to mark one year of NEP 2020, Modi on Thursday said, “A tool has been developed for translating engineering courses in 11 languages. This emphasis on mother tongue as the medium of instruction will instil confidence in the students from poor, rural and tribal backgrounds. Even in elementary education mother tongue is being promoted and the Vidya Pravesh programme, launched today, will play a big role in that.” The PM also said that NEP 2020 is one of the major factors in the “maha yagna” (great exercise) of nation-building. Launching 10 initiatives under the NEP 2020, Modi highlighted the openness and absence of pressure in the policy and remarked that it will also unfold the “making of new India”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-focuses-on-tech-education-in-mother-tongue-in-nep-speech/articleshow/84875157.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy was the first in the country to have a jumbo team of five deputy CMs in 2019. A senior BJP functionary privy to discussions on cabinet formation said deputy CMs will be selected from five major social groups — SCs, STs, Vokkaligas, Lingayats and the OBCs. According to him, the party of Lingayats-Brahmins will soon have a pan-Hindu appeal catering to all communities since it has been struggling to cross the magic figure of 113 seats in the assembly polls since 2008. By making Basavaraj Bommai the chief minister, the party central leadership has kept former CM BS Yediyurappa and Lingayats happy.

The court made the observations while hearing a plea moved by G Devarajan, a resident of Sembium, alleging that temples had been illegally constructed on pedestrian platforms and public roads in Otteri. Admitting the plea, the bench directed the Greater Chennai Corporation to inspect and ascertain the extent of encroachment by such structures. The corporation has also been directed to file a report on action taken to remove the encroachment. According to the petitioner, a 30-feet public road in Chellappa Street in Otteri has been encroached upon on both the sides by illegally constructing three temples – Shri Sithi Vinayagar Temple, Manimudi Maamari Aalayam, and Shri Ayyappan Sannithanam. Due to the encroachment only 14 feet of the road is accessible to the public, he said. It is hindering free flow of traffic on the busy road and emergency vehicles like ambulance, fire service and other rescue vehicles cannot pass through the road during emergency situations, he added. Despite repeated representations, the corporation has failed to take any action to remove the illegalities. It appears that they have no intention to take any step for removal of any encroachment from the road or road margins, he said. The petitioner added that this is the situation despite the fact that the corporation has constituted a special task force to remove such encroachment and a monitoring committee has also been established to monitor the same. The primary objective of the force is to identify and remove encroachments on public roads, streets, and pedestrian platforms, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gods-dont-ask-us-to-encroach-upon-roads-build-temples-hc/articleshow/84875541.cms||Suresh Kumar

Kerala recorded on Thursday more than 22,000 new cases for the second consecutive day. The state with an active case load of 1.54 lakh is contributing 37.1% of the total active cases, with a growth rate of 1.41 percent in the last seven days. The state is also reporting a high positivity of 12.93%, while six districts have more than 10% weekly positivity. Central sources said Kerala, in mid-May 2021 was reporting a high of more than 43,000 new cases a day and this began to decline there on to the first week of June. But from June third week to date, daily new cases are rising in a gradual and consistent manner with Kerala recently reporting more than 22,000 new cases in a day. This is more than 50% of the peak witnessed by Kerala in mid-May. The health ministry is concerned that since June first week, Kerala is also reporting a high number of daily Covid deaths. In the first week, daily new Covid deaths were 227 and remain more than 150 deaths a day. Of the 4,00,000-odd active cases in India, 1.5 lakh are in Kerala alone. The Centre has also warned the state of rising number of cases and advised stringent containment measures along with compliance to physical distancing and other Covid-appropriate norms, an official said. The team sent to the state is headed by Dr S K Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), one of the country’s top experts in monitoring public health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-surge-prompts-centre-to-send-team-to-kerala/articleshow/84875718.cms||---

The MP from Godda raised the issue during Zero Hour, saying that the term used by the TMC MP was an insult inflicted on the entire Hindi-speaking people from UP, Bihar and Jharkhand. “I want to draw the attention of all members of this House. This is my 13th year as an MP and the way I was called... yesterday by a woman, by Trinamool Congress, I have not seen this in my life,” Dubey said amid din due to protests by the opposition over Pegasus and other issues. He demanded action against the TMC member for “unethical behaviour”. The term Dubey claimed was used against him was later expunged by the Chair. As soon as Dubey started speaking on the subject, Moitra, who was protesting in the Well of the House over the Pegasus controversy, rushed to her seat and put on the microphone to listen to what the BJP MP was saying. The BJP MP said, “Sir what is our crime? Is it a crime that we as labourers, as a Bihari, as Hindi-speaking persons from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, have toiled hard. Our homeland imparted education to Lord Ram.” The BJP MP had spoken for a few minutes when the House was adjourned. Later, Dubey accused Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, chairman of the Standing Committee on IT, of allowing his personal staff in the panel meetings and demanded his removal. “Under rule 268 of Parliament, all persons other than members of the Committee and officers of the Lok Sabha Secretariat shall withdraw whenever the Committee is deliberating. However, Tharoor always allows his personal staff to stay in the committee meetings, which is against the rules,” Dubey told TOI. He said there was a a member of Tharoor’s personal staff, who tried to click pictures of the panel members when they went to attend the committee meeting on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/act-against-moitra-for-her-unethical-behaviour-bjp-mp/articleshow/84875730.cms||Akhilesh Kumar Singh

Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is also the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), said on Thursday that the alliance had no role to play in a border tussle “between two states and not two parties”. “This is not political issue. The boundary dispute is between two states. We are not counting votes. This is long-standing dispute. What is NEDA’s role here? Politics is at a different level. When MNF fights against Congress or when BJP takes on Congress, then NEDA comes in," Sarma said. "Here, the conflict is between two states and not between BJP and MNF. I cannot leave Assam’s land for the sake of strengthening NEDA. I may be NEDA convenor but first I the CM of Assam." Sarma pointed out that the border dispute existed even when Congress was governing both states, with Tarun Gogoi as Assam CM and Lalthanhawla his Mizoram counterpart. "In 50 years, Congress, despite being in government both sides, could not settle the issue." Mizoram deputy CM Tawnluia said the fact that MNF was a constituent of NEDA would not, in any way, influence the government’s decisions on the current border imbroglio with its neighbour. Tawnluia told reporters that the state government would not hesitate to take any action in the interest of Mizoram just because MNF was one of the constituents of the alliance. On whether MNF would pull out of the NEDA due to Sarma's allegedly belligerent attitude, Tawnluia said the matter was yet to be discussed.

When the two ministers reached Kharge’s chamber, other opposition leaders were also present. “The ministers urged all the opposition leaders to discuss and end the impasse as several key legislations are to be cleared and issues of importance are to be discussed,” a senior BJP functionary said. He said the government had already agreed to hold debate on all issues and wondered why the opposition parties were running away. “Government representatives have reached out to the opposition on several occasions as it wants Parliament to function smoothly,” the BJP leader said. Although there was no assurance from opposition leaders to allow smooth functioning of the two Houses as they stuck to their stand of a debate and statement of PM Narendra Modi on the Pegasus controversy before taking up any other business. Earlier in the day, during the Business Advisory Committee meeting before the start of the proceedings, it was agreed that the opposition MPs will express regret over the incident of papers being thrown on the Chair and ministers, which took place on Wednesday. However, the two sides once again indulged in heated exchanges in the Lok Sabha as Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi interrupted Congress leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Choudhary that he should first apologise to the Chair for the incident. Speaker Om Birla referred to the Wednesday incident and warned of serious action against those showing disrespect to the Chair time and again. “I am extremely hurt about yesterday's incident … it was an insult, disrespect to the chair. If you have any problems with the chair, you can come to my chamber. But such behaviour will not be tolerated,” Birla said. Choudhary said the tenure of Birla has witnessed record productivity but the ruling party was stubborn and not allowing the opposition to speak on subjects on which it has been insisting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/senior-ministers-reach-out-to-opposition-but-no-breakthrough-in-sight/articleshow/84875808.cms||---

Banerjee also urged Gadkari for a three-tier transportation system, which will enable vehicles to simultaneously travel under the ground, on the surface, and on flyovers in congested areas. This could be the “best solution” considering that land acquisition in Bengal is difficult, she said. “We have also asked to build some flyovers in Kolkata,” she said. Sources said that during the discussion on the expansion of the NH that connects West Bengal with Bangladesh at the Petrapole-Benapol border, Banerjee said the land acquisition is almost impossible as habitations have come up. On this, the highways ministry suggested that elevated highways could be the way out, the sources added. Banerjee told reporters after the meeting, “I requested Gadkari-Ji that it will be good if we get a manufacturing unit in our state to make electric vehicles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-asks-gadkari-for-more-infra-projects/articleshow/84875966.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||India||Celebs among 250 hit in sextortion racket||MUMBAI: Five youths, two of them engineers and one a minor, were recently arrested for allegedly running a nationwide racket in which they filmed men in the buff, indulged in sextortion and sold the obscene video clips on the internet. Police said the accused had made video clips of nearly 250 men and the money was stashed in bank accounts in India and Nepal. Some of their victims are models and celebrities from the TV and film industry. They were picked up from Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh by the Mumbai cyber police teams. Each one had a defined role. “Two of them operated profiles on social media where they posed as women and befriended men,” said a cyber police officer. Over time, they would start sexting with the men and convince them to share their obscene videos, with the assurance that all interaction was confidential. The accused also made video calls and filmed their targets, using technology, the police said. The clips were used to blackmail victims for money. Two other accused had floated a group on a messaging app where they sold the video clips to at least 80 people so far. The cyber police have come across 12 accounts on social media platforms besides six email accounts operated by gang members posing as women. “The accused used apps and other technology to convince targets that a woman was calling up,” said an officer, but could not immediately specify details of the technology or apps used. Police have also come across online posts advertising sale of obscene video clips. “Around Rupees 30 lakh from sale of videos has been traced. Some of the sale proceeds were routed through digital wallets operated under fake identities,” said the officer. An FIR was registered on June 5 and the probe went on for over a month. “We want to appeal to citizens not to respond to video calls, social media messages or texts from strangers,” said DCP (cyber police) Rashmi Karandikar. “If anyone is blackmailing you for money, approach the nearest police station and lodge a complaint. Do not pay up out of fear,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/celebs-among-250-hit-in-sextortion-racket/articleshow/84875983.cms||---
---||India||BJP evasive on Pegasus, to blame for logjam: Congress||NEW DELHI: Congress on Thursday blamed BJP for the logjam in Parliament and said the government was “avoiding” discussion on the use of Pegasus spyware since it has “much to hide”. Accusing BJP MPs of “collectively insulting” Parliament with their conduct in the meeting of the House panel on information technology on Wednesday, which had to be postponed after high drama and some name calling, Rajya Sabha MP Abhishek Singhvi said opposition would cease its protests if only the government would agree to discuss the use of Pegasus spyware. “I am making a proclamation here, you start the discussion in Parliament today and by tomorrow we will discuss everything else. Why are you avoiding Pegasus?” Singhvi said. “The government is not only hiding, they have much to hide, they have no answers, they have no basis for not even having a discussion inside Parliament … The government is avoiding a discussion in Parliament as it knows that we will pin them down,” he said. On Thursday, Congress also convened a joint meeting of its parliamentary party groups in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, with senior MPs Mallikarjun Kharge, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Jairam Ramesh, Digvijaya Singh, K C Venugopal, P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari, Manickam Tagore, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Shashi Tharoor, Ambika Soni and K Suresh in attendance. Kharge said the opposition’s only demand was a discussion on Pegasus surveillance in Parliament, in the presence of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. “Pegasus is being discussed in more than 50 countries. What is there to discuss, the home minister should come to the House, discuss, give replies to questions. After that, it will be up to us to take further steps,” he said. “We have taken MPs views on future strategies. They want a discussion on Pegasus. Prime Minister and home minister's presence is necessary during the discussion. This issue comes under the ministry of home affairs. Probe on Pegasus is being done in other countries including France and Germany, than why not in India,” the LoP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-evasive-on-pegasus-to-blame-for-logjam-congress/articleshow/84876005.cms||---

While advocate Manoj Jha was shot dead by unidentified people in Tamar on Monday, a murder case was lodged by the Jharkhand police on Thursday in the case of the death of an additional district judge in Dhanbad Uttam Anand. On Thursday, a division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad heard the matter of Anand’s death. The bench pulled up the Dhanbad SSP — who was also present at the hearing — for the delay in registering the FIR as it was filed more than 12 hours after the incident.

A SC bench comprising the CJI and Justice Surya Kant expressed disappointment over the efforts of legal services authorities, both at the national and state level, to educate the inmates about their eligibility for remission and the procedure for making applications seeking remission of sentences after undergoing a requisite period of incarceration. “Legal services authorities aren’t educating the inmates about their right to get remission. Procedurally it’s not difficult to put in a mechanism by which the inmates could be made aware of their right and the appropriate time to make such an application. This can be achieved by keeping records of the period of incarceration of each convict by jail authorities and the legal services authorities routinely accessing the data to advise eligible convicts to apply for remission,” the CJI-led bench said. Appearing for Tihar jail in Delhi, additional solicitor general Jayant Sud informed the court that all jails in Delhi have installed e-kiosks which would display details of period of incarceration, the offence for which a person was convicted and the furloughs availed by a convict when he opens the ekiosk through biometric access mechanism. But, the CJI appeared dissatisfied with the lackadaisical approach of authorities in facilitating a convict to exercise his right to remission. “Let me call a meeting of concerned authorities and examine this issue for evolving a mechanism to help entitled convicts in seeking remision,” Justice Ramana said. There are 1,350 prisons in the country consisting of 617 Sub-Jails, 410 District Jails, 144 Central Jails, 86 Open Jails, 41 Special Jails, 31 Women Jails, 19 Borstal School and two others. The prisons have a capacity to lodge 4,03,739 prisoners, but there are actually 4,78,600 of them at the end of December 2019. Among them, 4,58,687 were male and 19,913 were female. During the Covid pandemic, the SC had also ordered release of prisoners/undertrials facing imprisonment for petty offences to prevent spread of Covid in the overcrowded prisons. On July 16, a bench headed by CJI Ramana had asked all states to furnish within a week details of the norms employed for releasing prisoners accused of minor offences from overcrowded jails in accordance with the cour’s March 23, 2020 order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-why-keep-inmates-entitled-to-remission-of-sentence-in-jails/articleshow/84876191.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The KCBC said the action of the Pala diocese was part of the family welfare activities and schemes for “Protection of Life” declared in the Kerala Catholic Church in connection with the direction from the Vatican to observe the year as “Year of the Family”. The chairman of the pro-life committee and KCBC family commission, Bishop Paul Antony Mullassery, said it was evident that there was a lack of purity in attempts to unnecessarily make a controversy out of family welfare projects formulated in the Pala diocese. “In 2011 also there was a project in which large families within the Church were felicitated. What the Church always encourages is responsible parenthood. Parents have the right to receive kids and nurture them as per their faith according to the circumstances. Attempts to deny that right need to be discouraged,” Mullassery said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-bishops-panel-backs-aid-for-families-with-4-children/articleshow/84876261.cms||---
---||World||Taliban admit killing Afghan comic beaten in viral video||KANDAHAR: The Taliban on Thursday said they had killed an Afghan police officer, better known for posting humorous videos online, after clips emerged on social media showing him being beaten and his dead body. Fazal Mohammad, popularly referred to as "Khasha Zwan", was stationed in southern Kandahar province but was taken away by the Taliban after returning home about two weeks ago, according to an officer serving with him. Last week, viral videos emerged showing Mohammad, his hands tied behind his back and sitting between two men in a car, being slapped repeatedly. Another clip purported to show his dead body. "He was not a comedian, he fought against us in several battles. He had tried to flee when we detained him, prompting our gunmen to kill him," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Thursday. "He was an active policeman and responsible for deaths of many people," he told AFP. Police commander Sailab, who has one name like many Afghans and who worked with Mohammad, said the comic was never deployed in combat and was more of an entertainer for the checkpoint's officers. The militants initially denied they had anything to do with his murder, until the videos went viral. The killing comes as the Taliban (who strictly forbid any form of entertainment when they controlled Afghanistan) are making sweeping territorial gains across the country. Second Vice President Sarwar Danesh said in a Facebook post that it "displayed the nature of the enemies of this land and their hostility to culture, art and freedom". Mohammad's murder also triggered outrage on social media. "The innocent face of Khasha hurts the heart of every human. They (Taliban) have shot him dead, they are the cruelest people in the world," a post on Facebook said. The Taliban have been accused of targeted killings, including journalists, judges and activists since signing a landmark deal with Washington last year that paved the way for the withdrawal of foreign troops. Violence has further surged since early May, when the insurgents launched a campaign across the countryside after foreign forces began their final pullout.

---||India||Landmark decision, will create new paradigm: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: Terming the move to provide reservation in medical seats a “landmark decision”, PM Narendra Modi on Thursday said this will immensely help thousands of youths every year get better opportunities and create a new paradigm of social justice in the country. The move bears the personal imprint of the PM, who had on Monday directed ministries of health and HRD to implement the quota. A promise to this effect was conveyed to the Madras HC last week. Union home minister Amit Shah welcomed the decision, saying, “By fulfilling this long-pending demand, PM Modi has shown the commitment of the government towards the welfare of backward class and economically weaker sections.” The move comes close on the heels of the record representation of OBCs in the Modi ministry. OBCs are crucial for BJP’s plans for the UP polls and the larger objective to expand its social base. However, the party has also taken care to reassure its traditional constituency among the upper castes by extending the quota for economically weaker sections to medical and dental admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/landmark-decision-will-create-new-paradigm-pm/articleshow/84876328.cms||---
---||World||Portland bans homeless camps in forest areas amid wildfires||PORTLAND: Portland, Oregon, has banned homeless people from camping in forested parks to both protect them from potential wildfires and prevent them from accidentally starting blazes during a summer of drought and record-breaking heat.  The City Council adopted the rule Wednesday for "high-risk hazard zones," including in and around Portland's famous Forest Park and in heavily forested wetlands and natural areas around the city. The ban will apply during wildfire season or whenever a county burn ban is in effect. The 8-square-mile (21-square-kilometre) Forest Park in the heart of Portland is one of the largest urban forests in the US.  There have been frequent reports of fires at unsanctioned campsites and at clusters of RVs around the city from illegal burning, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.  The city stressed that the rule was to prevent fires from starting in the city but also to protect homeless people from blazes started near encampments by others.  Nonprofit groups working with the city will visit the camps, provide information about fire risk and help residents relocate voluntarily before any aggressive sweeps take place, the newspaper said.  "I do not like sweeps, and I do not like that we have a shortage of housing that people can afford to live in," Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty said. "But I cannot stand by and do nothing as people are at risk of dying by fire."  Detailed maps of high-risk areas prepared by the city's fire marshal will help campers know where they can't live, said Kaia Sand, director of Street Roots, an advocacy group for people experiencing homelessness and weekly alternative newspaper. But she said the solution is "half baked" unless the city also provides safe places for displaced residents to go.  "The fact that our city removes people without good alternatives for them to live has always been a problem and continues to be a problem," she said.  Historic drought and recent heatwaves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/portland-bans-homeless-camps-in-forest-areas-amid-wildfires/articleshow/84876437.cms||---

Mahadevapura zone has the highest number — 29 as on Thursday — of such containment zones, while west zone has the least at three. Gaurav Gupta, BBMP chief commissioner, suggested that the number could go up and it was not a reflection of increasing cases. “We are working to intensify containment measures and to increase containment zones to help closely monitor positive cases,” Gupta said. “We plan to monitor infected people till they recover and thereby limit the spread of the virus.” Palike officials said they are now forming micro containment zones if even three people test positive. Initially, a containment zone was formed after a cluster — 10 or more positive cases — was detected. The aim of increasing containment zones is to closely monitor each pocket and to contain the spread of Covid-19 more efficiently. Randeep Dev, special commissioner (health), BBMP, said, “In a city like Bengaluru, we have to ensure that the spread of the disease is contained at the micro level. The whole purpose of a containment zone is to create awareness and to bring about a behavioural change among the citizens.” BBMP officials say some containment zones have three clusters of three cases each in the same building. The clusters are high at the intersection of Vijnanapura and Vijnananagara wards. There are six active clusters here. The intersection of Banaswadi, Horamavu and HBR Layout wards also have seven active clusters. “Containment becomes very important along with fumigating common areas and other common facilities,” Randeep said. So far, the civic administration has not released names of the micro-containment zones in the city but are in talks about making it public. Once the data is out, citizens can be more cautious, and a breach of a containment zone can also be avoided. Delta variant present in 364 more samples:Genomic sequencing of infected swab samples has confirmed the presence of the Delta variant of the coronavirus in 364 more cases, the state’s daily Covid bulletin on Thursday revealed. This takes the total number of samples with the Delta variant to 1,089. Members of state Covid-19 Whole Genomic Sequencing (WGS) team said these samples were processed in June. “These samples are from across the state, including Bengaluru. Genomic sequencing is a routine exercise which is being carried out to detect new variants of the virus,” said a member. The member added, “This means that the Delta variant is still in circulation. Covid-appropriate behaviour needs to be taken seriously. Lowering ones guard may lead to another surge.” Karnataka reported 2,052 new cases on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/25-rise-in-bluru-containment-zones/articleshow/84876861.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

The ambassador also stressed that differences must be properly managed. “It is an objective fact that we have differences on issues like the boundary question. But differences are not and should not be the whole story of China-India relations. We should place the border issue in an appropriate position in bilateral relations and seek a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution through dialogue and consultations. We should consolidate the achieved results in disengagement, find a solution acceptable to both sides on the issue that needs emergency response through negotiation and consultation, gradually move towards regular management and control, in order to further ease the situation and avoid any recurrence of tensions due to misunderstanding and miscalculation,” he said. CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI chief D Raja, DMK Lok Sabha MP S Senthilkumar, and All India Forward Bloc leader G Devarajan, along with Counselor of Bureau I of the International Department of the Central Committee of the CPC Du Xiaolin attended the seminar. Lauding the CPC’s achievements and China’s economic development, the leaders said political parties should put forward their own visions and principles in the context of prevailing national conditions, and be committed to improving the political, economic and social conditions of the people and promoting social equity and justice. They also said China and India should adhere to the ‘Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence’ to strengthen economic and trade ties and local, people-to-people and party-to-party exchanges and cooperation. The principles include the need to enhance mutual understanding and trust, handle differences through dialogue and consultation, and strengthen coordination in multilateral affairs, so as to realise the peaceful coexistence of China and India as big neighbours. Weidong also emphasised China’s support to India in its fight against the second wave of Covid-19 by providing large amounts of supplies and assistance. China and India must focus on development, strengthening cooperation and promotion of bilateral economic, trade and other pragmatic cooperation, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/left-netas-in-attendance-china-envoy-talks-of-ties/articleshow/84876888.cms||---

Kundra and co-accused Ryan Thorpe have challenged their arrest as illegal in the case of alleged "production and streaming of porn content". In its affidavit, the state said police complied with the law and had issued a notice under section 41A (1) of CrPC to both, which was accepted by Thorpe but "refused" by Kundra. The state’s reply, filed by Mumbai police inspector property cell, CID, on Thursday, said "refusal to accept the notice implies" refusal to cooperate with investigation and that apart, on July 19 both the accused "started deleting from WhatsApp group and chat causing evidence of offence to disappear" and hence brought to the crime branch and arrested. "Police never gave him notice under Section 41A (1) Criminal Procedure Code and have never in its first remand application mentioned any such," said senior counsel Aabad Ponda for Kundra who is actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband. Arguing at length before Justice Ajay Gadkari, he said "assuming, without admitting" that Kundra refused to sign on the notice, the legal option before the police was "not to whisk him away" but to approach the magistrate for permission as mandated under Section 41A (4). Ponda and advocate Subhash Jadhav also said, "Nowhere in its first or second remand do the police say that Kundra or his colleagues tried to destroy or delete any texts".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mockery-of-legal-process-raj-kundra/articleshow/84876893.cms||Swati Deshpande

The accused, Rameswar Kayal, has been remanded in police custody for two days after being produced in a Bongaon court on Thursday. According to police sources, two women — the victim and her friend — residents of Gopalganj in Bangladesh, were trying to cross over the Jhaudandanga border near Gaighata to enter Bangladesh illegally when BSF jawans from 158 Battalion detained them on Wednesday afternoon. In the complaint lodged by the victim at Gaighata police station, the BSF jawans took them to Kharer Math BSF camp, where Kayal started interrogating them. Later, he allegedly raped her in the camp when nobody else was around, she claimed. “My friend and I are associated with the sari business in Gujarat. We were trying to sneak into Bangladesh with the help of an unauthorized agent, who took Rs 30,000 from us. But we were caught by the jawans. Later in the night, when I was being interrogated alone, I was raped,” she said. After being released from the BSF camp, the woman went to the Gaighata police station and lodged a complaint. Police later arrested the accused. “Kayal has been booked under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and remanded in police custody. The woman’s confidential statement has been recorded by the magistrate under Section 164 of CrPC,” said Samir Das, the chief public prosecutor of Bongaon ACJM court.

Addressing a briefing, ministry of external affairs”Such an exercise can neither hide the illegal occupation by Pakistan nor the grave human rights violations, exploitation, and denial of freedom to people in these occupied territories. Pakistan has no locus standi on these Indian territories. We call on Pakistan to vacate all Indian areas under its illegal occupation.”The election exercise, Bagchi said, is nothing but an attempt by Pakistan to camouflage its illegal occupation and the material changes undertaken by it in these territories. On the CPEC, which India has opposed on the grounds that it violates its sovereignty, the MEA spokesperson said, “We resolutely oppose any attempts by other countries to change the status quo in areas illegally occupied by Pakistan as also to Pakistan bringing up any material change in Indian territories under its illegal occupation. We call upon parties concerned to cease such actions.” Read AlsoImran departs from Pak stand on J&amp;KISLAMABAD: Departing from Pakistan's declared policy on Kashmir, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday said that Islamabad would let the people of Kashmir decide if they want to join Pakistan or become an "independent state".

---||World||GOP governors lend support to Mississippi anti-abortion law||Led by South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a dozen Republican governors are wading into a court fight over a Mississippi law to restrict abortion, the outcome of which could have implications for similar measures across the country.  On Thursday, attorneys for McMaster submitted an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court in support of Mississippi, which wants to enforce its 2018 law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Mississippi's Republican attorney general filed papers last week asking the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 court decision that legalized abortion nationwide.  Mississippi's sole abortion clinic is challenging the legality of the 2018 law, arguing that it unconstitutionally restricts access to abortion. The nation's high court will likely hear that case in the fall, with a decision probably in 2022.  Arguing the issue of abortion is best left to the states, rather than federal-level entities, the attorneys for the dozen Republican governors wrote that citizens have the ability to vote out state lawmakers with whom they disagree over abortion policies.  "The Court should take this opportunity to correct the mistakes in its abortion jurisprudence and recognize that the text and original understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment have nothing to do with abortion," McMaster's attorneys wrote. "Rather than creating a federal constitutional right, the Court should leave regulating abortion to the States, where the people may act through the democratic process."  McMaster's attorneys also argued that the high court's landmark abortion decisions have "upended the careful balance that the Constitution strikes between the Federal Government and the States."  The arguments are similar to the ones made by Mississippi's attorney general.  About a dozen other states have passed similar or more restrictive abortion bans, which could take effect if the US Supreme Court were to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Earlier this year, McMaster signed the "South Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act," which requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a heartbeat in the fetus, something typically detected about six weeks after conception. If it's found, the abortion can be performed only if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, or the mother's life was in danger.  Planned Parenthood attorneys sued immediately, and the entire law has been blocked from taking effect during the lawsuit, which is on hold pending the Mississippi case.  In 2019, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation that would outlaw almost all abortions, with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest. A federal judge has blocked that measure from taking effect.  "There is nothing wrong with giving this issue back to the people," McMaster's attorneys wrote, adding that allowing states to handle the issue individually "should lower the proverbial temperature in these debates," lessening the consternation over abortion in judicial confirmations and presidential campaigns.  Also signing onto McMaster's brief are the governors of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/gop-governors-lend-support-to-mississippi-anti-abortion-law/articleshow/84876962.cms||---

The incident occurred last weekend before her two official events in Hawaii, where she went after attending the start of the Olympics in Tokyo, spokesperson Michael LaRosa said.

---||World||Florida virus cases soar, hospitals near last summer's peak||MIAMI: Hospital admissions of coronavirus patients continue to soar in Florida with at least two areas in the state surpassing the previous peaks of last summer's surge, prompting calls by local officials for the governor to declare an emergency. A large hospital system in Jacksonville said its hospitals were at maximum capacity, its emergency centers also at a critical point as the state grappled with the new and more infectious delta variant of the Covid-19 virus. In Brevard County, two hospitals began setting up treatment tents at its emergency departments. And at a Fort Lauderdale park, a long line of cars snaked around a testing site, recalling the first weeks of the pandemic last year. Florida hospitals reported more than 8,900 patients with Covid-19 on Thursday, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. The Florida Hospital Association said the state peaked at 10,179 cases last July. The patient number on Thursday was five times higher than a month ago, and it quickly climbed from a little less than 5,500 in just one week. "What's extraordinary is the speed at which we are currently seeing new cases,'' said Dr. Vincent Hsu, executive director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiologist at AdventHealth in Orlando. "The slope is pretty steep, and we haven't seen the end of it. This is still coming.'' AdventHealth said Thursday it had reached a new high on Thursday since the pandemic began with about 1,000 Covid-19 hospitalized patients across its system in central Florida. Twelve hospitals in the state are reporting critical staffing shortages to the federal government. The rapid rise in hospitalizations and cases has prompted officials in Miami-Dade and Orlando to issue new orders requiring masks at indoor county buildings. The mayor of Orange County, home to Walt Disney World, is forcing all nonunion county employees to get vaccinated by August. And Walt Disney World also announced this week that it would again be requiring the use of masks indoors. Just 48 percent of the state's population is fully vaccinated, and hospitals say the vast majority of the patients with Covid-19 are unvaccinated. Despite calls for him to declare an emergency, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has vowed not to reinstate any pandemic restrictions. In early June the state stopped providing daily figures of cases and deaths, switching to weekly reports. He signed a law in May a measure that invalidated local Covid-19 orders and gave him power to nullify future ones. On Wednesday, the governor mocked new federal guidelines recommending use of masks even for those vaccinated against COVID-19. He also took aim at Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist, who recently said the U.S. is in an "unnecessary predicament`` of soaring cases fueled by unvaccinated Americans and the virulent delta variant. DeSantis said Florida would "choose freedom over Fauci-ism." "I think it's very important we say, unequivocally, "No to lockdowns, no to school closures, no to restrictions, no to mandates,''' DeSantis said. "We'll be holding the line. We will not back down.'' His words drew enthusiastic applause during his appearance in Salt Lake City, Utah, before the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group that pushes conservative policies in Republican-controlled state legislatures. DeSantis said he opposes those measures because they were ineffective and "had catastrophic consequences`` for the economy. Charlie Crist, a Democrat challenging DeSantis next year, condemned his speech in Utah in a statement sent Thursday. Crist served as a Republican governor from 2007 to 2011, before joining the Democratic party. He has served in the US House since 2017. "Our hospitals are being overrun by sick patients, families are losing their loved ones, and our children are facing another difficult and confusing school year. But where's Governor DeSantis? He's profiting from selling merchandise that demonizes our nation's top doctor", he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-virus-cases-soar-hospitals-near-last-summers-peak/articleshow/84876989.cms||---
---||World||Israeli agencies raid NSO offices over Pegasus row||NEW DELHI: Israeli government agencies have raided some offices of surveillance software vendor NSO Group “to begin assessing” security breach allegations against the company’s Pegasus spyware in the wake of an international media consortium claiming to have blown the whistle on multiple governments snooping on prominent personalities, journalists and political rivals. The Israeli ministry of defence announced the raids through a tweet. The Jerusalem Post reported that representatives of Israel’s defence establishment had visited the NSO headquarters on Tuesday. A spokesperson for NSO confirmed the raids to the Israeli news website The Record on Wednesday. “Representatives from the Israeli ministry of defence visited our offices. We welcome their inspection,” the website quoted the spokesperson as saying. “The company is working in full transparency with the Israeli authorities. We are confident that this inspection will prove the facts are as declared repeatedly by the company against the false allegations made against us in the recent media attacks.” Though there is little clarity on the nature of the raids, Israeli news outlet Calcalist cited an anonymous source to term the move “more of a formal meeting than an in-depth audit of NSO’s documents and computer systems”. Sources said the raids were on the NSO Group’s Herzliya offices, near Tel Aviv. The company currently holds a licence from the Israeli government, as is the norm in several countries where companies that sell offensive security software such as hacking tools or surveillance software. It is mandatory for such companies to register themselves with the government and procure a licence to operate. In 2019, human rights activists had approached an Israeli court demanding that the Israeli government revoke NSO’s export license citing similar misuse of its software for human rights abuses. The court, however, ruled in favour of the company in 2020. Earlier this month, a global collaborative investigative project claimed to have found evidence that the Pegasus spyware targeted over 300 mobile phone numbers in India. The alleged list comprises new railways & IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Union MoS Prahlad Singh Patel, besides several opposition leaders, including Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, a constitutional authority, journalists and business people. The BJP-led government has since rubbished the allegations that the Pegasus spyware was being used to snoop on politicians and journalists, terming the report “sensational” and an attempt “to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”. Amnesty International, which was part of the investigative consortium, issued an official statement refuting the government’s claims. “Amnesty International categorically stands by the findings of the Pegasus Project, and that the data is irrefutably linked to potential targets of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. The false rumours being pushed on social media are intended to distract from the widespread unlawful targeting of journalists, activists and others that the Pegasus Project has revealed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/israeli-agencies-raid-nso-offices-over-pegasus-row/articleshow/84876894.cms||---

BJP MLC Sanjay Prakash alias Sanjay Mayukh had raised the issue of overcrowding in jails and asked the government to provide proper facility to jail inmates, especially during Covid-19 pandemic. Replying to Mayukh, minister Yadav said nine new jails would come up at Rajgir, Rajauli, Madhaura, Maharajganj, Hathua, Chakia, Pakridayal, Mahnar and Simri Bakhtiyarpur. “Authorities of the districts concerned have been asked to identify land for the purpose,” Yadav added. He said the construction of mandal jails in Bhabhua, Jamui and Aurangabad was in the last phase. “Apart from these, a mandal jail in Arwal district and an anumandal jail in Paliganj in Patna district are also being established,” the minister added. On protection being given to jail inmates, Yadav said 90% of the jail inmates have been given the first dose of Covid vaccines and 15% second doses. He added 20 jails have been marked as quarantine jails, where new inmates are kept for a few days to complete the quarantine period before being shifted to main jails. In another question raised by JD (U) MLC Lallan Sarraf regarding deployment of police force as per the population and area of district concerned and shortage of cops in Madhepura district, Yadav said of 1,42,216 posts of police personnel across the state, 84,165 are filled. “In Madhepura, 774 of the sanctioned 1,114 posts are filled,” he added. Replying to a query on cases of celebratory firing in state, Yadav said 39 such cases were lodged in 2020-21 and 29 arrested so far.

---||Patna||Mukesh Sahani leaves for Delhi, likely to meet Amit Shah||PATNA: Hours after issuing a veiled threat to those trying to cause an alleged split in the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) on Wednesday, its chief, Mukesh Sahani, left for New Delhi. Sources said Sahani, who is also the animal and fisheries resources minister, would try to meet Union home minister, Amit Shah, during his stay in the national capital. However, his meeting with the BJP think tank has not been confirmed officially. Before leaving for Delhi by an evening flight, Sahani met his party MLA, Musafir Paswan, and the son of Mohd Shahabuddin, Osama Shahab. The VIP chief was unhappy over the remarks of some BJP leaders that he would meet the same fate as LJP MP, Chirag Paswan. Reiterating that he would not bow down to anybody, Sahani said, “Humare saare vidhayakgan ekjut hain (all our MLAs are united).” Meanwhile, rumours were doing the rounds about Sahani’s meeting with RJD chief, Lalu Prasad, in Delhi on Thursday. Lalu, however, claimed, “Bahut sare log milne aate rahte hain. Lekin Mukesh Sahani abhi tak nahi mile hain.” Moreover, Ajeet Sharma of the Congress offered the VIP chief to come to the Grand Alliance as “his grievances are not being redressed in the NDA”. Sahani was so angry with the BJP leadership after being not allowed to participate in the statue installation ceremony of former MP Phoolan Devi in Varanasi that he threatened to treat them in the same manner in Bihar. He even boycotted the NDA legislators’ meeting in Patna ahead of the monsoon session. When contacted, the national spokesperson of the VIP, Dev Jyoti, told this reporter on Thursday, “The NDA is intact and all its four constituents will sit together and discuss the internal issues. The VIP will continue to be a part of the government led by chief minister Nitish Kumar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sahani-leaves-for-delhi-likely-to-meet-amit-shah/articleshow/84869962.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Lalu Prasad backs Nitish Kumar’s demand for caste-based census in India||PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar got support from his friend-turned-foe and RJD supremo, Lalu Prasad, on his fresh demand from the Centre for a caste-based census in the country. Talking to mediapersons in New Delhi after getting the first shot of Covishield at the vaccination centre in the Parliament House on Thursday, Lalu said, “We have been fighting for a caste-based census for long. It will empower those who are lagging behind in development.” It was Lalu’s first interaction with the media after being released on bail in a fodder scam case by the Ranchi high court. He is recuperating at the residence of his eldest daughter and MP, Misa Bharti, in Delhi. The former Union minister claimed that those at the helm of affairs at the Centre were giving contradictory statements on the matter. “Wo kabhi kuchh to kabhi kuchh botle hain,” he alleged. The CM on Saturday had reiterated his demand for a caste-wise enumeration of population, triggering a political debate in the state. He had pointed out that a resolution was passed twice by the assembly and sent to the Centre with a request to conduct caste-wise enumeration of population in the country. Slamming the Narendra Modi government, Lalu alleged that the country had been pushed back so far development was concerned. “Desh ko patri par laane mein kafi samay lagega,” he said. Asked about his visit to Patna, the RJD chief said his health condition was improving. “All I can say at this moment is that I will surely visit Patna after my health improves. Our party has its base there,” he asserted. In response to a query, Lalu said Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had proved his mettle in his absence. “Wo humse aage nikal gaye hain,” he said, recalling his younger son’s performance in the 2020 Bihar assembly polls. Meanwhile, JD(U) MPs, Chandeshwar Prasad, Dilkeshwar Kamat, Sunil Kumar Pintu, Alok Kumar Suman and Sunil Kumar, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to ensure caste-based census in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-backs-nitishs-demand-for-caste-based-census-in-country/articleshow/84869875.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Covid-19: At 75.9%, Bihar has 3rd highest seroprevalence in India||PATNA: Bihar has the third highest sero-positivity or the presence of antibodies in India. These are the findings of the sero-survey conducted by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) from June 14 to July 6 across 70 districts of the country. According to the survey, Madhya Pradesh has the highest seroprevalence (79%), followed by Rajasthan (76.2%) and Bihar (75.9%). Now, the ministry of health and family welfare has instructed all the states to carry out their own surveys and generate district-level data that can help in formulating localized health programmes. The additional chief secretary of the state health department, Pratyaya Amrit, told TOI on Thursday that sero-survey would be carried out in 12 districts and the results submitted in 20 days. Districts, which will be surveyed, include Supaul, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Munger, Bhagalpur, Patna, Kishanganj, Gaya, West Champaran, Nalanda, Saran and Kaimur. In each district, 370 people, including 50 healthcare workers, will be picked randomly. Meanwhile, health experts have claimed that seroprevalence is enough to reduce the impact of the anticipated third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Krishna Panday, the director of the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, said, “Vaccination against Covid-19 is important for protection against the disease. Going by the latest figures of the sero-survey, it is safe to say that the state has reached herd immunity. Many reports have stated that if 80% population becomes immune to a virus, herd immunity is achieved.” Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, claimed that it was good that many people had developed antibodies through natural infection. “As per the latest findings of the sero-survey, the spread of the infectious disease is under control. In this situation, a possible third wave of Covid will have a minimal impact,” he said. Dr A K Ashu, the joint director of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology, also pointed out that achieving 75% seroprevalence was a good sign for Bihar and one of the reasons for a steady decline in the daily Covid count. Echoing similar views, Dr Sunil Kumar, the secretary of the Indian Medical Association-Bihar, said sero-positivity would lessen the impact of the third wave. However, all the health experts stressed on the need for vaccination for better results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/at-75-9-bihar-has-3rd-highest-seroprevalence-in-country/articleshow/84869180.cms||Sheezan Nezami

BLW general manager Anjali Goyal on Thursday inspected the Central Hospital of BLW, and also the functioning of PSA oxygen generation plant. The oxygen plant with a capacity of 610 liters per minute has been installed at BLW Central Hospital. This plant was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the city on July 15. It has been set up through corporate social responsibility funds arranged by the district administration. This will help increase beds with oxygen from 40 to 100 at the BLW hospital, adding significantly to Covid preparedness. The GM also reviewed the preparations for the special paediatric ward for potential Covid affected children. On advice of the district authorities, BLW has made arrangements for 18 oxygen beds, six ICU beds, seven BiPAP machines and three high-flow nasal cannulas for the children. Procurement of additional medicines and other necessary equipment required has been done. These facilities are a critical infrastructure given that the paediatric population is more than 3,600 under BLW hospital care. According to BLW spokesperson Rajesh Kumar, BLW has scaled new heights in the concerted efforts to overcome the virulent second wave in coordination with district administration. Moreover, ambulance services and steady supply of medicines and oxygen has ensured safe recovery of patients admitted at BLW hospital. On the request of the district administration, BLW gave five ventilators to Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital for Covid emergencies. Also, 50 oxygen cylinders were also made available, along with supply of two air reservoirs rf 420 Ltr. capacity each, for setting up an oxygen generation plant. “Taking forward the government’s goal of vaccination in mission mode, BLW has taken all measures to fully utilize doses of Covid vaccine supplied by the state government,” he said, adding that more than 50,000 persons have been vaccinated so far, with the larger share being non-Railway persons. BLW continues to be the one of the most sought-after vaccination centres amongst residents of Kashi. He said that 3-T mantra — test, trace and treat — has led to comprehensive coverage and timely detection of Covid spread among residents on and off the BLW campus with smooth recovery. Special drives to test 1,500 asymptomatic persons on campus, in shops led to timely identification of potential Covid spreaders and curbing further spread of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/blw-stocks-up-to-tackle-third-wave-of-covid-19/articleshow/84871176.cms||---

The city received 373.8mm rain till Thursday, which is 7% higher than the normal for the month. Kolkata received 87.4mm rain till 5.30pm on Thursday. The downpour intensified in the evening with the rain getting heavier after 7pm and continuing till well after 11pm. It was accompanied by wind at speeds of 30-40kmph. KMC officials said till Thursday night, the rain count could easily have exceeded 100mm. Weathermen said more rain was expected on Friday, which could take the count higher. July is the wettest of monsoon months in Kolkata with a normal rain count of 361mm. A well-marked low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal has been triggering regular showers in the city since Wednesday. On Thursday, the rain got more intense with frequent spells of moderate shower. Some parts of the city received heavy downpours, which led to waterlogging. “We expect another spell of heavy rain early on Friday, after which the showers will recede. The low-pressure system that generated clouds which floated into Kolkata and south Bengal through Bangladesh on Thursday, will be moving towards the western parts of the state. So West Burdwan, Bankura and Birbhum are likely to receive heavy showers on Friday,” said Regional Meteorological Centre director G K Das. He added the rain could cease in Kolkata by the second half of Friday. “The surplus could exceed 7%, which is normal. It had been relatively dry with sporadic showers during the first half since there were no low-pressures. Then we had two, which made up the deficit and has led to excess rain,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/july-gets-7-excess-rain-more-expected/articleshow/84871649.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Business||Eco headed for 2003-like investment cycle: Kotak||Mumbai: Veteran banker Uday Kotak has said that the Indian economy in 2021 is where it was in 2003, at the early stages of an investment cycle. Given this backdrop his bank will shift its approach and make bolder bets. “You will see a significant shift in our approach, one of greater aggression, one that is even sharper on execution. We will not shy away from taking bolder bets. We have a deep conviction in the India growth story and confidence in our risk management capabilities. And we believe the time is right to experiment more,” said Kotak in his letter to shareholders. According to the MD & CEO of Kotak Bank, the growth driver for India will be infrastructure — both physical and social. Kotak, who had just before the pandemic expressed caution over a slowing economy, said that today Kotak Bank has a much lighter balance sheet and with sufficient capital to grow substantially faster. “The other area that takes precedence for us is higher investments in strengthening our digital and technology platforms and offerings. The future may be uncertain, but we can be confident that it belongs to technology,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/eco-headed-for-2003-like-investment-cycle-kotak/articleshow/84872715.cms||---

Popularly known as the Kalasa-Bhandura Nala projectin Karnataka, the project was undertaken by the Karnataka government to improve drinking water supply to the districts of Belagavi, Bagalkot, Hubballi-Dharwad, and Gadag. During his maiden visit to Hubballi on Thursday after being sworn-in as chief minister on Wednesday, Bommai told reporters that he was quite aware of the issue and knows how to complete the project (Mhadei). “My priority will be to complete this project at the earliest as soon as the Centre issues the gazette notification in this regard,” he said. In February, the dispute was resolved after the central government notified the final award of the Mhadai Water Dispute Tribunal that allocated 13.42 thousand million cubic feet of water to Karnataka, 24 tmcft to Goa and 1.33 tmcft to Maharashtra. Last year, then Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar had also asked Karnataka to start work on the Kalasa-Bhandura Nalaproject after gazette notification of the tribunal and necessary forest and wildlife permissions. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/top-priority-to-finish-mhadei-proj-ktaka-cm/articleshow/84874922.cms||---

While the college principal, Ashok Kumar, was removed from the post and asked to join the postgraduate department of Sanskrit, the accountant, Syed Ali Abbas, was suspended. The bursar, Mohd Nazim, was also removed from the office. Sociology teacher, R N Sharma, was appointed the new principal in place of Kumar. The VC told this newspaper that action had been taken against the three on the basis of preliminary findings of an inquiry into the “fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 62.80 lakh from the bank account of Patna College”. The matter came to light when a cheque of Rs 16,000 given to a guest faculty member of the college bounced. On inquiry, it was found that there was no money left in the college account as a sum of Rs 62.80 lakh was withdrawn from it on April 29 last. The amount was reportedly transferred from the PU branch of the Indian Bank to its branch in Ahmedabad. A clone of the cheque was deposited by someone at the bank. The VC said, “Although the principal came to know about the matter on July 17, an FIR was lodged with the local police after a couple of days on the insistence of the university authorities. Both the bursar and the accountant never reported the withdrawal of such a huge amount from the college account for months together.” A three-member inquiry committee constituted by the VC is already probing the matter and will submit its report shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dereliction-of-duty-vc-removes-patna-college-principal-bursar/articleshow/84869244.cms||B K Mishra
---||Surat||Gujarat: 372-year-old British cemetery in tatters||SURAT: The English Cemetery at Katargam Darwaja was already a haven for tipplers and marijuana smokers during the day.  Now the resting place of former governors of Bombay Presidency, former collector of Surat and many other officials of erstwhile British East India Company and their family members is a comfortable den during the night too. Thanks to cyclone Tauktae and subsequent heavy rainfall, a major portion of the cemetery’s southern wall collapsed and even after a month, the remnants of the wall remain as it is. This has given easy access to anti-social elements as the cemetery’s gate is locked. TOI Photo- Gaurang JoshiOfficials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), however, say that the wall had collapsed recently during the heavy rain. The collapsed wall missed damaging the tombs by less than a foot. But a part of it which hangs on the support of a neem tree poses danger to an unnamed granite tomb. TOI Photo- Gaurang JoshiAs the 372-year-old cemetery premise lay exposed now, the ground where the English are buried also acts a playground for the local kids. Meanwhile, if a visitor passes by one of the mausoleums in front of the gate, the smell of burnt marijuana cannot be missed. “Earlier such people used to jump the gate to enter, but since the wall has collapsed it has become easier for them at night,” said Kalpesh, who lives right beside the cemetery. TOI Photo- Gaurang Joshi“The wall collapsed in recent downpours and we are going to reconstruct it. There are some formalities, but we are on the job and the work will begin soon,” said Dr A M V Subramanyam, superintending archaeologist of Vadodara circle of ASI. When asked what action ASI is planning to take against the anti-social elements, Dr Subramanyam said, “We will take up this matter with local police to increase the patrolling.” The ASI, however, has taken up the issue with Surat city police several times in the past and cops have even picked up abusers. But after they are released on bail, they are again seen at the same spot. An ASI source said that the central agency can hardly do much since law and order is police department’s job.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/372-year-old-cemetery-in-tatters/articleshow/84870731.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata pockets waterlogged, one hurt in balcony collapse||KOLKATA: Large parts of the city went under water on Thursday morning following incessant rain since Wednesday night. The waterlogging worsened due to the presence of a high tide in the Hooghly — first at noon and again in the afternoon. On Kailash Kabiraj Lane near Girish Park Metro station, the rain led to the collapse of the second-floor balcony of a century-old three-storey building, which had been deemed ‘dangerous’. A pedestrian was seriously injured in the incident.The height of the tide in the afternoon was 17.3ft and all lock gates along the Hooghly remained shut from 2.15pm to 6.15pm, till the effects of the tide receded. A waterlogged stretch of road on ThursdayThe closed lock gates, coupled with few spells of heavy rain in the afternoon, led to inundation of several pockets in north and central Kolkata, including Kumartuli, BK Pal Avenue, Chitpore, Strand Road, BBD Bag and more. This apart, residents had to wade through knee-deep water in several parts of Chittaranjan Avenue, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Muktarambabu Street, Bidhan Sarani and Beadon Street. Thoroughfares in major central and south Kolkata areas, such as Park Street, Camac Street, Theatre Road, Elgin Road, Asutosh Mukherjee Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Gariahat Road and Golf Green, also faced severe waterlogging. Traffic was disrupted in a mojor way. On Park Street, a full-grown tree was uprooted in the rain, further blocking the road. A couple caught in the rainPeople living along Tolly’s Nullah, particularly Kalighat, Chetla and Tollygunge areas, had to move out of their houses and makeshift huts as tidal water entered their homes. Residents of large parts of Behala and Kidderpore, once again, suffered due to inundation of their neighbourhoods. The condition of some low-lying areas located off EM Bypass was equally bad. Large stretches of Mukundapur, Madurdaha, Patuli and Kalikapur went under knee-deep water. According to a KMC sewerage and drainage department official, considering the continuous rainfall for most of Thursday, a majority of the heavy-duty pumps at the city’s major drainage pumping stations were made operational. In addition, the KMC will need to press into service portable pumps to flush out storm water from low-lying areas, like Behala, Kidderpore, Garden Reach, Tollygunge, Jadavpur and EM Bypass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-pockets-waterlogged-1-hurt-in-balcony-collapse/articleshow/84871676.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cinemas set to open with 50% capacity, Covid-rule compliance||KOLKATA: After three months of closure, the state on Thursday allowed cinemas in Bengal to reopen with 50% seating capacity and compliance with Covid protocol from July 31. However, reopening might still take some time. Director Raj Chakraborty said, “The first notification on Thursday had missed the point regarding reopening of cinemas. We are thankful that despite being so busy in Delhi, our chief minister listened to Tollywood’s request to remove the restriction from cinemas. An additional notification was issued about this later.” Piya Sengupta, Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA) president, who had written to the CM on this issue on July 1, thanked her and added, “We are thankful that our minister, Aroop Biswas, supported our cause.” Chairman of the exhibitors’ section of EIMPA Ratan Saha has called a meeting of all single-screen exhibitors at EIMPA on Monday. “Some exhibitors don’t have cash to pay dues to distributors. Availability of staff and infrastructure has to be assured. We may consider opening from August 6 if all members agree,” Saha said. Multiplexes, too, are happy with the news. “We are whole heartedly welcoming the state government’s decision. In Bengal, we should be in a position to reopen by August 6. We will evaluate our preparations and will look to start operations across all 16 cinemas in Bengal at the earliest on the basis of operational readiness. Considering Bengal’s significance in INOX’s national business landscape, this decision will ensure a faster return to normalcy for the company,” said Amitava Guha Thakurta, regional director at Inox (East). Sujit Kumar Bhukta, GM (east) of Carnival Cinemas, is looking at a “stage-wise reopening” from August 5. Distributor and exhibitor Satadeep Saha said, “We have formed a committee in EIMPA with eight members who will promote cinema-viewing in theatres. We will soon release content on social media to encourage people to return to cinemas.” However, city exhibitors would prefer to wait till a steady flow of Bollywood and Tollywood content is available. But actor Rituparna Sengupta said, “Lack of Bollywood content should not lead to shutdowns again. Tollywood has an independent existence which has to be honoured.” The news of Maharashtra government allowing cinemas to reopen too has made Kolkata exhibitors optimistic. Jaya Cinema’s owner Manik Banik said, “My cinema got partially burnt in a fire on July 2. But one auditorium is fine. If Maharashtra generates enough content, I will be keen on reopening my theatre,” Banik said. There is a big chance of theatres outside Kolkata wanting to reopen earlier by screening old Hindi or Bengali movies. Bardhaman Cinema’s owner Madhusudan Das said, “It might be costly for us to agree to the terms and conditions of screening new movies. But we need to pay our staff and maintain the hall. I am keen to reopen with old content.” The state on Thursday, however, extended the Covid restrictions till August 15 and asked all to comply with night curbs, which come into effect from Saturday, from 9pm to 5am. But it gave relaxations to the government programmes held indoors with up to 50% seating capacity.

---||Business||Tatas buy Tejas for Rs 2.9k cr to push enterprise telecom play||Mumbai: Tata Sons is buying Tejas Networks, a publicly listed company offering data networking products to telecom operators and internet service providers for Rs 2,923 crore, to bolster its enterprise telecom play. According to the contours of the deal, Tata Sons is buying 72% in Tejas by subscribing to preferential shares and warrants besides acquiring shares from founders and public shareholders. It is purchasing Tejas shares at Rs 258 apiece, which is at a premium to its Thursday’s closing price of Rs 246 on the BSE. After exiting the wireless services space in 2019 by transferring the business to Bharti Airtel, Tata Sons has been focusing on providing telecom services to enterprise customers. Tejas is Tata Sons’s first major deal in telecom after the exit from consumer mobile business. Currently, its telecom and connected interests are spread across Tata Communications, Nelco and Tata Teleservices. Tejas was founded by three first-generation entrepreneurs — Sanjay Nayak, Arnob Roy and Kumar Sivarajan — in 2000 in Bengaluru. The company, which went public in 2017, posted a profit of Rs 38 crore on sales of Rs 527 crore in fiscal 2021. Tata Sons said Tejas’s existing management team will continue to lead the company even after the change in ownership. The founders own 5.6% in Tejas and their stake will reduce to 2.6% after the deal. The transaction will be done in multiple stages. Tata Sons will first acquire 12.5% in Tejas by subscribing to preferential shares worth Rs 500 crore. It will then subscribe to warrants to the tune of Rs 1,350 crore. As and when Tata Sons exercises the warrants, its stake in Tejas will go up to 45.3%. It will also buy some shares from Tejas promoters, which will increase its stake to 46%. Further, Tata Sons will make an open offer for 26% of the outstanding Tejas shares in line with India’s takeover norms. If it gets the entire 26%, then its interest in Tejas will rise to 72%. Interestingly, in the past, Tata Sons promoter Tata Trusts had partnered with Tejas to roll out public Wi-Fi hotspots in rural and semi-urban India. Tejas said it sees a large opportunity in the telecom sector with the new cycle of investments in 5G and fibre-based broadband rollouts. And it will utilise the money raised from Tata Sons to invest in research and to enhance its manufacturing and operational capabilities to cater to this large market opportunity. The deal comes a little over a month after Tata Sons through TCS partnered with Bharti Airtel to implement 5G solutions in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-buy-tejas-for-rs-2-9k-cr-to-push-enterprise-telecom-play/articleshow/84872830.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Patna||Use of date seeds can delay ageing process: PU study||PATNA: A team of research scientists from Patna University has recently found that the seeds of date (Phoenix dactylifera L Arecaceae) can delay the ageing process. Usually people discard the date seeds after consuming the fleshy pulp of the fruit. The scientists assert that date seed has a higher percentage of protein and fat as compared to its pulp. The protein fraction of the pits contains the preponderance of essential amino acids. Date seed is also rich in dietary fibres. Its oil has a high UV absorbing potential, making it a good option in the cosmetic world, too, they observed. According to the studies made by this team and published in a recent issue of the Arabian Journal of Chemistry (with a high impact factor of 4.7), the polyphenol and flavonoid molecules present in date palm act as antioxidants to curb the damage brought about by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to a certain extent. The efficacy of polyphenols present in date seed in delaying the effects of ageing was checked through intensive lab research. The organism used in this study was Caenorhabditis elegans owing to its distinct advantages over other organisms. The results revealed that exposure to date seed extract preferentially promoted their healthy ageing. Various physiological functions like pharyngeal pumping, body bending, sarcopenia and lipofuscin accumulation were considered as hallmarks of ageing in this organism. Contrary to the established fact that reduction in pharyngeal pumping increases lifespan, their treatment increased the lifespan along with increase in the pharyngeal pumping rate, showing that the increase in lifespan is not due to caloric restriction. The treatment also increased the fecundity and enhanced stress tolerance, the studies further revealed. The PU team comprising Birendra Prasad and Amber Jabeen of botany department, Nikhat Parween of biochemistry department and Kumar Saurav of biotechnology department, pointed out that date has long been used in contemporary medicine for the treatment of infertility. Birendra said the results of the studies clearly demonstrate that regular consumption of date along with its seed in powder form can boost health and delay the process of ageing in the elderly people. The phytochemical compounds like genistein, selenium and vitamin A present in the fruit are known to protect sperm membranes and maintain sperm count. Phytosterols and phytoestrogens also regulate estrogen imbalance in the body. The generation of free radicals in the body also affects cogenesis and embryonic development. The polyphenols in the date fruit and its seed quenches the free radicals and boost fertility. Worms fed on a high concentration of date seed extract have shown to have increased egg laying capacity. Furthermore, syringic acid also demonstrated an increase in brood size, suggesting that it might also be responsible for this effect in the crude treatment to some extent, the team added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/use-of-date-seeds-can-delay-ageing-process-pu-study/articleshow/84869923.cms||B K Mishra

Departmental heads and ministers too will participate in these meetings so that problems of this industrial city could be resolved speedily, she added. The governor had on Wednesday convened an industrial symposium with industrialists and entrepreneurs of the city at CSJM Kanpur University auditorium in which more than 30 entrepreneurs had participated. The governor called upon them to participate in social development and expected that they would upgrade the facilities of anganwadi for poor children and become a partner in development of children. She stated that Kanpur’s industrial world should cooperate voluntarily for the upgradation of facilities of 1,200 anganwadi centres so that the lower groups of the society could be developed. Earlier, managing director of M/s Super House, Mukhtarul Amin apprised the governor that despite the problem of Covid-19, the leather sector of Kanpur was growing with the cooperation of the government. Establishment of a mega leather cluster will not only invite investment at a large level but also generate employment. Vice-president, Counsel for Leather Export, R K Jalan said that the state government was giving priority due to the significance of the leather sector. The Central as well as state government had given sanction for the establishment of a mega leather cluster and the administration was performing all expected proceedings speedily. Director Jet Knitwear Balram Narula said that Kanpur was the third big city in the sector of hosiery and provides employment to micro entrepreneurs. Since the sector had been included in one district one product (ODOP) scheme, there was a possibility of speedy development. In future, it would compete with Tirupur and Kolkata clusters. Before it, divisional commissioner Dr Raj Shekhar welcomed the chief guest and apprised her that Kanpur was constituted as a district in 1803 and since then its industrialization had begun. Due to its textile mills such as Elgin Mills, Swadeshi Cotton Mills, JK Cotton and Kanpur Woollen Mills, the city was known as the Manchester of East. A leather factory was raised to supply shoes and saddlery to the military and since then it is known as the leather hub in the world. Kanpur contributes 20 percent in leather export and 90 percent in saddlery and harness export. Besides government officials and university officials, around 30 entrepreneurs of the city including Ashraf Rizwan, Javed Iqbal, Anwarul Haq, Aviral Jain, Naveen Khanna, Sanjay Dubey, Vijay Pandit, Laxman Das Rupani, Gulshan Kumar Dhoopar and Murari Lal Agarwal were present in the symposium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/problems-of-industrial-city-to-be-resolved-speedily-guv/articleshow/84871158.cms||---

Nabin, who is the state’s road construction minister, stood up at his seat, and raised the issue in the state assembly in the pre-lunch session. No one, not even Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha, took notice of the one-line statement made by Nabin. The latter immediately took his seat. In the legislative council, Mayukh stood up and drew the attention of the acting chairman, Awadhesh Narayan Singh, saying that the House should condemn Moitra’s statement. RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh challenged Mayukh’s claim, as a result of which Mayukh sought protection from the acting chairman. Dubey had alleged on Wednesday that ‘Bihari goonda’ term was used by Moitra against him at the recent meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on IT headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor. Moitra, in her tweet, refuted the allegations, saying the meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on IT headed by Tharoor never happened in the first place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-netas-condemn-tmc-mps-remark/articleshow/84869815.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Students of class X & XII can now find their roll numbers on CBSE website||Prayagraj: Ahead of class X and XII results, the authorities of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) have shared the process following which the students of these two classes can know their roll numbers. Since CBSE had cancelled the board exams of class X and XII owing to Covid, affiliated schools across the country were asked to promote their students and award marks on the basis of a formula derived by the board. However, it was not known how the student would find their result as the board had not allotted the roll numbers or admit cards. Now, by following the process shared by CBSE, the students can find out their roll numbers and check their results which will be announced in couple of days. In a letter issued on Thursday, the board’s controller of examinations, Sanyam Bharadwaj, stated, “It was decided that the results for both the classes will be declared on the basis of an objective criteria set by the board. Since examinations were not conducted for both the classes, the admit cards for the students were not released by the board. The board is in the process of declaring the results. The students will only be able to access their results with the help of board’s roll numbers issued to them.” The letter further mentions that since the admit cards have not been released, the students are not aware of the roll numbers allotted to them by the Board. Accordingly, the board has created an online facility for the students to find out their roll numbers. “The roll number finder facility is available on the board’s website, and can be accessed through the link: httpo1/cbseitilnicbse/20211rfinderilanding.aspx2. “The students will have to enter the same credentials which were uploaded in the list of candidate (LOC) data for finding their roll numbers. They can also download the roll number slips which have been made available on the CBSE website,” said regional officer of CBSE, Prayagraj, Shweta Arora. To ensure availability of information and to avoid last-minute rush, schools have been requested to inform all the candidates about the roll number facility through email, SMS and phone calls. The board informed that the result of the students will also be available in their DIGILOCKER.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/students-of-class-x-xii-can-now-find-their-roll-numbers-on-cbse-website/articleshow/84871351.cms||---

Police have arrested two persons—Sudhakar Naik, 63, a resident of Curchorem, and Shambunath Singh, 32, a resident of Delhi—late Wednesday evening after the survivor lodged a complaint. Both Naik and Singh were produced before the judicial magistrate at Quepem on Thursday and were remanded in five days police custody. Police sources said Singh had lured the survivor to Goa by promising her a job. After the survivor reached Goa on July 26, Singh accompanied her and took her to his sister’s flat, around 1km from Quepem town. On Wednesday, Singh invited his friend Naik to his sister’s flat and they had liquor. Later, the survivor was sexually assaulted, police said. Naik and Singh were arrested after the survivor escaped from the flat and informed the police control room. They have been charged under sections 376 (rape) and 343 (illegal confinement). The incident comes at a time when Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant is facing all-round criticism for his comments on Wednesday blaming the gangrape of the two minors on Benaulim beach in South Goa on the parents and absolving the government and police of any responsibility. “When 14 year olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police,” Sawant, who also holds the home portfolio, had told the assembly. Four persons, including a state government employee, have been arrested for raping the two minors and Sawant said the government staffer has been suspended.

---||Goa||Goa: Now, RBI cancels Madgaum Urban Co-operative Bank’s licence||PANAJI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cancelled the licence of The Madgaum Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd and has said that the bank will cease to carry on any banking operations from Thursday. The RBI has also written to the office of registrar of cooperative societies – Goa to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank. The RBI cancelled the licence as Madgaum Urban could not comply with banking norms. “The bank with its present financial position would be unable to pay its present depositors in full and public interest would be adversely affected if the bank is allowed to carry on its banking business any further,” the RBI said. The central bank said that 99% of the bank’s 56,600 depositors will receive their funds. This is the second cooperative bank in the state to lose its banking licence. The Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank lost its banking licence in April 2020 for reasons similar to The Madgaum Urban Cooperative Bank. “The RBI has, vide order dated July 27, cancelled the licence of The Madgaum Urban Co-operative Bank Limited. Consequently, the bank ceases to carry on banking business, with effect from the close of business on July 29,” chief general manager Yogesh Dayal said. With the cancellation of the banking licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 56,600 depositors of the former bank will commence as per the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) Act. On liquidation, every depositor will be entitled to receive deposit insurance claim amount of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs 5,00,000 from the DICGC. “Madgaum Urban was in discussions with the Thane Janata Sahakari Bank and Cosmos Bank, which is one of the largest cooperative bank in the country, but the talks fell through,” bank’s managing director Kishore Amonkar said. “We had asked for capital infusion and former chief minister Manohar Parrikar was pursuing it, but then he fell sick.” Henceforth, Madgaum Urban cannot accept any deposits nor disburse any funds or loans. The bank has deposits to the tune of Rs 189 crore, while the bank’s quantum of bad loans or non-performing assets stand at Rs 45 crore. The bank has nine branches and 85 staff and was trying to recover loans from the defaulters. During an inspection in 2014, it was observed that the gross NPAs (non-performing assets) of the bank were above 15% and the assessed CRAR of the bank was at 6.1%. “This is the second cooperative bank to lose its licence in Goa and this is a big loss for the small depositors and borrowers. The government did not do anything to help us,” Amonkar said. The RBI has been monitoring the financial position of the bank since November 2009 and had imposed financial sanctions on the bank which were extended every six months. The central bank had prohibited the cooperative bank from opening ATMs, extending branches, acquiring new premises or payment of dividend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-rbi-cancels-madgaum-urban-co-op-banks-licence/articleshow/84875061.cms||---
---||Business||Gold demand in India rose 19.2% YoY in Apr-June quarter||Chennai: Gold demand in India rose 19.2% YoY in April-June quarter, due to low base effect. The impact of Covid was severe as it muted demand during Akshaya Tritiya and wedding season in Q2. “Essentially, we haven’t achieved pre-Covid levels of demand. Unlike last year, customers are growing to accept the Rs 46,000-Rs 50,000 per 10g price levels of gold (as the new base price),” Somasundaram PR, regional CEO, India, World Gold Council, said. The last quarter was marked by widespread regional lockdowns following a rise in Covid infections. Unlike the previous year when a national lock down took businesses by surprise, this quarter was relatively better as businesses were more prepared, he added. Digital solutions and relaxation in Covid-lined restrictions in certain pockets in the country helped 25% growth in jewellery demand to 55.1 tonne. Investment demand grew 6% to 21 tonnes as prices softened. Overall, gold demand in India in H1 2021 was 216.1 tonne, up 30% versus H1 2020. Though it is still a multi-year low, it reflects an underlying demand momentum that will likely support a sharp spike in demand once normalcy is restored when Covid eases, said jewellers . Demand from central banks has also been growing steadily, as they sought to diversify their portfolio by adding more gold reserves. RBI added 29 tonnes to its gold reserves in the June quarter. On top of buying during the quarter, several reports indicate that central banks or official institutions plan to increase their gold holdings in the future, the WGC’s quarterly report stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gold-demand-in-india-rose-19-2-yoy-in-apr-june-quarter/articleshow/84873544.cms||Mamtha Asokan

While the Indo-Nepal border is 1,751km-long, the construction of 729km of road parallel to the border in Bihar was sanctioned in 2014 and it was to be completed by December 2022. Till March 31, 2019, only around 25km of the road was constructed, as there was delay in the acquisition of land required for the INBRP road, coupled with various kinds of irregularities in the acquisition of land. The worst situation was reported in the acquisition of land in West Champaran district. This has been brought out in the report of the Comptroller and Accountant General (CAG) for 2018-19, ending March 31, 2019. The three CAG reports containing reports on general matters, on finance-related aspects and also connected with the public sector undertakings (PSUs) were tabled in the state assembly on Thursday by deputy CM-cum-state’s finance minister Tarkishore Prasad. After this, accountant general (audit) for Bihar, Ram Avtar Sharma, talked to mediapersons. The original cost of the project was Rs 886 crore and the quantum of land required for the construction of the INBRP road was 2,759 acres. However, even as 2,497 acres of land (91%) was acquired, it had irregularities of various kind as a result which the construction of the road was delayed the report said. Even though the land had been acquired, the ownership rights were not transferred to the state government, it said. In seven districts, the land acquisition could not be done. The combined effect was the delay in the start of the work and escalation of the cost of the project by Rs 1,375 crore. The revised cost of the project has escalated to Rs 2,244 crore. Further, the company assigned the task of executing of the project was given an advance of Rs 92 crore, but the utilisation certificate was not submitted. The company, in fact, abandoned the work, as the land was not available for conducting the construction work, the report said. The company prepared the DPR, but it did not contain the road alignment. As the DPR showed, the road to be constructed was far away from the check-post. Overall, the company had identified 121 bridges for construction. Work on just 101 bridges has been completed. Besides, as many as 23 bridges did not have approach roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/delay-in-road-project-costs-bihar-govt-rs-1375-crore-cag/articleshow/84869407.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Business||Union Bk net up 255% at Rs 1,181cr||Mumbai: Union Bank of India has reported a net profit of Rs 1,181 crore for the quarter ended June 2021, an increase of 255% from Rs 333 crore in the corresponding quarter of previous year. The profits were driven by an improvement in treasury income and recovery of bad loans, even as the second wave of Covid stunted business growth and pushed some loans into default after the moratorium ended. Among the recoveries, there was a Rs 256-crore gain following a recovery from Kingfisher Airlines. The bank’s deposits rose little over 1% to Rs 9 lakh crore from Rs 8.9 lakh crore in the year-ago period, while advances were flat at Rs 6.3 lakh crore. Announcing the results, the bank’s MD & CEO Rajkiran Rai said that while treasury income was expected to moderate from current quarter levels, other fee-based income would rise as economic activity picks up. “If there is no impact of the third wave during the current quarter, the bank should be back to pre-Covid levels by September,” he said. The bank’s gross non-performing assets reduced by 135 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) to 13.6%, while net NPAs reduced by 28bps on a year-on-year basis to 4.69% as on June 30, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/union-bk-net-up-255-at-rs-1181cr/articleshow/84872949.cms||---

Nearly 20,000 litres of oil in the tanker spread on the road, causing chaos. The incident came to light after a video of the incident went viral on social media on Thursday. Local villagers gathered at the accident spot and started collecting oil in containers. An UPEIDA rescue team straightened the tanker and washed the road to avoid mishap. The rescue team of UPEIDA diverted the route of vehicles in view of the possibility of any kind of eventuality. “We washed the road by taking the tanker to the side. Oil spilled on the road and filled the pits along the expressway through drains meant to drain water. Hundreds of people from dozens of nearby villages along with drums and containers reached the spot and collected the oil and escaped,” said team members. UPEIDA security officer RK Chandel, however, said the tanker driver was alone. “He hasn’t suffered injuries. The tanker has been parked near the toll barrier,” said the security officer further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/tanker-overturns-20k-litresof-mustard-oil-spills-on-road/articleshow/84871017.cms||---

He added the department is fully geared up to meet the challenge posed by the likely third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. “The state government succeeded in controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 pandemic under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and CM Nitish Kumar. The state government is well set to combat the third wave of the pandemic as well,” Pandey said. He added several plants established to produce medical oxygen for hospitals and other health centres would be ready by August 31. “At least 524 ambulances fitted with advance life support systems are being purchased with an expenditure of Rs 524 crore. This will be over the existing available ambulances,” Pandey added. He also presented details of the ongoing projects at various medical college hospitals and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) and Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) for improving health infrastructure in the state. It also includes Purnia Medical College and Hospital. “While the construction of 11 medical college and hospital is underway, the government has already sought permission from the Centre to allow additional seats for MBBS and undergraduate courses,” the minister said. As to improving the health infrastructure in 243 assembly constituencies, Pandey said Rs 3,959 crore would be spent on opening wellness centres, improving and strengthening the existing additional primary health centres and opening 122 community health centres. Pandey gave the details while giving the government’s reply to the House debate on the Rs 3,673-crore first supplementary budget demand of his health department pertaining to the current fiscal. The supplementary budget demanded by Pandey was above and over the budgetary allocation already made for the health department in the Rs 2.18-crore state budget passed in March this year. The cut motion against the supplementary demand of the health department was moved by Congress member Vijay Shankar Dubey. The supplementary budget demand of the health department was part of the slightly over Rs 27,050-crore first supplementary budget that was demanded by deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, who is also the state’s finance minister, for the current fiscal. The House passed the first supplementary budget by voice vote. The five-party opposition comprising the RJD, Congress, CPI(ML), CPI and CPM members walked out of the House during the government’s reply given earlier by Pandey to the debate on the health department’s demand for the supplementary budget. Participating in the House debate, the opposition party members pointed out that the health department had failed to meet the challenge posed by the first and second waves of the coronavirus pandemic. During the second wave of the pandemic, the patients had died for want of medical oxygen, they alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-to-spend-rs-3959-crore-to-boost-health-infra-minister/articleshow/84869526.cms||Abhay Singh

Speaking from New Delhi at a virtual ‘karyakarta milan samaroh’ held at the party office in Patna, the JD(U) national chief said the state’s development largely depended on the economic growth of farmers. The Union minister urged the farmers to focus on organic farming to get more benefits. He also asked them to improve the quality of their produce. “Packaging and marketing are equally important,” he said. Around 300 functionaries of 150 block-level vegetable growers’ cooperative committees, led by their president Manoj Kumar Mehta, became members of the party on Thursday. RCP said the Union government had set up a separate cooperative ministry for the economic development of the farmers across the country. Addressing the newly-inducted members, the state president of the JD(U), Umesh Singh Kushwaha, highlighted a slew of schemes launched by the Nitish Kumar government for the benefit of the farmers.

Supratim Barik (40) and Arkadeep Mukherjee (25), both lawyers from Baruipur court on special hearing at the Alipore court, were taken to a private hospital in Ekbalpore where they underwent multiple tests and later discharged. “It was only because of the timely intervention of CJM Subrata Mukherjee that the two lawyers could be saved. The CJM was in his chamber around 1.30pm when he heard their cries. He came out to find Barik stuck to the pole outside the tin enclosure of the typists and notary assistants and seemingly unconscious while Arkadeep, who had attempted to free Barik, was shivering in pain. The CJM took a wooden chair from his chamber and threw it at the duo and they fell away from the pole,” said Subrata Sardar, secretary of the bar association in Alipore. Although the area wasn’t waterlogged, cops suspect the iron pole attached to the tin shed had loose entangled wires around and got electrified. Another lawyer, who later appeared before the CJM’s court in the second half for a hearing, said the CJM had confided in him that he was still trembling at the impact of the incident but was happy he could save two lives. Mukherjee was, however, not available for comments. The lawyers said they would be meeting the cops and the Alipore district magistrate on Friday to seek a redressal of the waterlogging woes and immediate repair of the electrical fittings on the court premises. In a separate incident, a 56-year-old security guard was electrocuted and died at the spot on Wednesday night in Jorabagan. Kashinathi Jyoti was pulling down the shutters of the garage in which he worked when he possibly got electrocuted, said cops. Police sources said Jyoti was living at the garage during the pandemic. “On Wednesday, a live wire fell on the shutter. As soon as he touched the garage shutter, he was electrocuted. He lay there for some time before his colleagues checked where he was. He was declared dead at RG Kar Hospital,” a source said. Meanwhile, the Rabindra Sarobar police said they are investigating the circumstances under which a 45-year-old pavement dweller, Gunnu Roy, was found dead at the Jatin Das Road-Lake View Road crossing around 7am on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/magistrate-uses-wooden-chair-to-save-2-lawyers-from-electrocution-death-on-alipore-court-campus/articleshow/84871625.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

It has also been working on a plan to reduce school syllabus by covering the important topics. In a recent report released by Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), it was revealed that only 14% kids in Bihar have access to internet. Another recent Unicef- Bihar report had found that nearly 75 lakh children may experience learning loss due to the pandemic. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said it was evident that large number of children in Bihar are deprived of education and experiencing academic loss due to the pandemic. He told this newspaper on Thursday that the department has prepared catch-up course for students of classes II to X, focusing on bridging learning gap of conventional subjects. “Under this course, students will be taught the syllabi of their previous as well as current classes. Another way to catch students up is to make sure all those who are behind get tutoring in small groups,” Choudhary said, adding additional classes will be conducted only with the students’ consent. The minister said if children are willing to take additional classes, it can be arranged even on holidays and Sundays. “The department has also planned for longer school hours to boost learning. Everything will be done in such a manner that kids do not feel burdened by longer classes. The last resort we have is to cut down the syllabus while covering important topics if there is time constraint,” he said. The department has also created a mobile application, e-library of teachers and students (e-LoTS), and web portal besides offering e-books, study materials and audio-video classes to students ensure continuous learning at home. “Special classes on Doordarshan (DD) channels are also running to make up for the loss in studies due to Covid pandemic,” the minister said. He added in a poor state like Bihar, maximum children do not have access to electronic devices and internet connection. “Digital learning has its own limitation in the state. This is the reason we have sent a proposal to the project approval board of the centrally sponsored-Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, to ptovide tablets to kids studying in elementary schools,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/catch-up-classes-longer-school-hours-on-anvil-bihar-education-minister/articleshow/84868956.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||Hybrid working moves info to where people are||Mumbai: Flexibility now extending beyond offering employees the choice to work from anywhere, a changing definition of ‘employee’, and organisations creating hyper-personalised experiences in a transition towards a hybrid work model. These were among the key takeaways from the ‘Preparing for the Future’ session at Assocham’s event titled ‘WorkVision 2021: HR for New Normal & Beyond’. HDFC Bank CHRO Vinay Razdan said one of the significant shifts in the post-Covid era has been the concept of hybrid work model, which has also found acceptance now. But, he added, it was Peter Drucker who said 30 years ago how the whole business of moving people to where information is, that is, the workplace, was not working out and how it should actually be the other way around. “In the concept of hybrid working, information has moved to where people are. It has come to play because Covid happened. It has created an opportunity. I’m sure many companies will get back to their normal ways of working. Many will alter the way they structure and design their organisations. As far as our bank is concerned, we want to utilise this opportunity and see what it has for us,” said Razdan. Amit Das, director-HR & CHRO of BCCL (Times Group), spoke about how digital adoption has happened at a breakneck pace since Covid and it is redefining the digital-led innovation road map for the media industry. A significant outcome of the Covid disruption, said Das, is the deep understanding and differentiation of work, workforce & workplace. “While a large part of our workforce moved away from the traditional physical workplace due to Covid-led restrictions, our work has been at optimal capacity and productivity, since we were able to proactively adopt business continuity measures. As part of the essential media service, we had the onerous responsibility to deliver credible and authentic news to our readers and viewers on a daily basis without interruption. To ensure this, we had identified business-critical employees who were required to attend work at our offices, plant locations and field locations. We also have a large part of our workforce who could work remotely, and were required to visit their work locations occasionally, without compromising on the outcome and productivity,” said Das. In future, in a hybrid work ecosystem, Das said the organisation would follow a 20-20-60 approach, with 20% of the workforce permanently working from office, plant & field locations, 20% permanently from home or anywhere, & 60% working occasionally from office through a hot-desking arrangement managed through digital rostering. SAP SuccessFactors India VP James Thomas said Covid has accelerated the human dimension for the employees in terms of the experience they are going through at work, in their career, etc. “The moments that matter for an employee are becoming a lot more front and centre of a digitisation strategy. So, it is no longer the operational data of productivity alone. Those are stable states, but there is a very fluid human element coming in, in terms of how deeply do I understand the employee? Am I able to really get the pulse of employees in my organisation? How do I balance technology and digitisation with employee experiences? What we are really looking at is building platforms which bring in real time impact to the people dimension in the way the future of work, future of workplace and future of workforce is reshaping,” said Thomas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hybrid-working-moves-info-to-where-people-are/articleshow/84872885.cms||---

He said that the state government has sought permission from the Centre to give teaching and non-teaching staff the second dose of vaccine after a gap of 30 days. “At this point in time we have no intention of holding offline classes. We will hold consultations with the Centre when the ICMR guidelines come on how to conduct offline classes, then we will decide,” Sawant said. The CM was responding to a call from MGP MLA Ramakrishna Dhavalikar asking for schools and colleges to start teaching in classrooms as students in the hinterland are unable to access online classes. “This is a pandemic. In consultation with all, including ICMR, we will have to take a decision. I cannot say anything at this moment (about offline classes),” Sawant said. “I have personally spoken to the new health minister and if he gives us permission we can give them the second dose. After that, in consultation with the Centre, we can think of starting classes,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-offline-schools-to-start-after-icmr-nod/articleshow/84875198.cms||---

Police suspect that Shashi and Raj, along with the latter’s friends, had a few drinks during which Raj found a tattoo of his stepmother’s name inscribed on Shashi’s arm. A heated argument soon broke out between the nephew and the uncle over the tattoo. Raj attacked his uncle with a heavy object before strangling him with a cable, suspected to be a mobile charger cable. After Shashi lay dead on the floor, Raj booked a car from a rental company. The accused and his friends wrapped Shashi’s body into a plastic roll and pushed it into the vehicle. They roamed the streets of the city, scouting for a safe location to dispose of the body. Sometime after Tuesday midnight, the accused zeroed in on the jungles of Naiwala under the limits of the Bhankrota police station to get rid of it. Police said that the body was kept in the trunk of the car. Near Naiwala, they dug up a pit large enough to bury Shashi. According to Beniwal, around this moment, a shepherd passing through the area saw some suspicious activities. The shepherd raised the alarm and other villagers soon arrived at the spot. They caught Raj and Praksh, while another accused managed to flee. Police recovered the body and informed the victim’s family. They arrived from Port Blair following which an FIR was registered and the post-mortem was conducted. Police said Shahsi had a business in Port Blair, whereas Raj’s father also runs a business there. The accused used to work with his father but regularly visited the family’s native resident in Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-killed-uncle-after-seeing-stepmoms-name-tattooed-on-his-arm/articleshow/84874038.cms||---

The meeting will be chaired by Patna Mayor Sita Sahu and municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma will be the coordinator. During the meeting, a debate will be held between the two sides, which is to be followed by ballot paper voting for the no-confidence motion. If more than 38 ward councillors vote for the motion, the incumbent deputy mayor will be removed. The district administration has imposed Section 144 in the its 100-metre radius of the Bankipore circle office for the floor test. The voting will take place amid tight security. A magistrate will also be deployed to ensure fairness in the voting. Few days back, at least 29 ward councillors had moved a no-confidence motion against Meera charging her with corruption. They had also accused the deputy mayor of causing disruption in civic body’s development works and misusing her post. Meera Devi refuted all the charges levelled against her by a section of the councillors. She told this newspaper that allegations against her were. “I am ready to face the floor test. I will defeat the motion as I have been constantly working for the development of the city,” she said. Former deputy mayor and councillor of ward number 28, Vinay Kumar Pappu, who was supporting Meera, said the motion was brought because she opposed the garbage collection and holding tax charges. “In a democracy, people have the right to raise issues. But the mayor only wants the yes-man,” he said. All the supporters of the mayor group are also confident that Meera will be voted out in the floor test. They have even readied the names of their candidates for the chair of deputy mayor. Indradeep Chandravanshi, member of empowered standing committee of PMC, said, “We are confident that deputy mayor will lose her chair because of her incapability. Five names have already been shortlisted for new deputy mayor and we want someone who support us rather than sabotaging the PMC’s development work. As only 8-9 months are left for civic body election, we are concentrating on development issues,” he said. Ashish Sinha, councillor of ward number 38, said, “Around 54 councillors are in favour of the motion and even Meera’s supporters are now standing against her.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/deputy-mayor-of-patna-to-face-floor-test-today/articleshow/84869460.cms||Faryal Rumi

According to sources, the minor, who was a resident of Bariyarpur village under Riga block in Sitamarhi district, breathed his last in the paediatric intensive care unit of the SKMCH after struggling for life for four consecutive days. He had been put on ventilator support ever since he was admitted to the hospital for treatment. With this, Sitamarhi district alone has lost three children due to AES since January this year. Saloni Kumari (12), a resident of East Champaran district, had died last week. Confirming Ankit’s death, the superintendent of the SKMCH, Dr B S Jha, told this reporter on Thursday that the doctors had tried their best to save the child, but “he was brought to the hospital in a critical condition on July 24”. He attributed the sudden rise in AES cases to high temperature coupled with humidity and laid stress on the need to create awareness among the people. A health bulletin released by the Muzaffarpur district administration stated that altogether 57 children had been infected with AES since January, 2021. Muzaffarpur topped the list with 26 cases, followed by Sitamarhi (9), Vaishali (8), East Champaran (7), Sheohar (3), West Champaran (2), Samastipur (1), and Madhepura (1). The deceased belonged to Muzaffarpur (3), Sitamarhi (3), Sheohar (2), East Champaran (2), West Champaran (1), and Vaishali (1) districts. The officials of the health department, however, claimed that the casualty was far less this time due to the occurrence of rainfall in the affected region on regular intervals and the awareness campaigns launched by the authorities concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aes-claims-another-life-at-muzaffarpur-hospital/articleshow/84869117.cms||Ramashankar

---||Patna||Higher educational institutions change admission pattern amid Covid||PATNA: The Covid pandemic has compelled several institutions of higher education in the state to change the pattern of admitting students to undergraduate and postgraduate courses during the 2021-22 session. While some institutions have waived the practice of holding entrance tests for admission, others have switched over from the offline to online mode of admission in strict adherence to the Covid protocols. Patna University (PU) has decided not to hold entrance test for admission to any of its undergraduate academic programmes running under regular (conventional) or self-financing (vocational) pattern in view of the pandemic. Organising entrance tests for thousands of students either in offline or in online mode would be a difficult proposition for the university as it would be very difficult for the authorities concerned to ensure full safety of students called for the test. PU students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar said necessary amendments in the existing university ordinance for facilitating admission to the undergraduate courses without entrance test are underway and the governor is likely to approve a transitory regulation to this effect soon. “However, this amendment would remain valid only for the current year,” he said. Online submission of forms for admission to UG programmes in different colleges of PU, such as Patna College, B N College, Magadh Mahila College, Patna Science College and Vanijya Mahavidyalaya will commence on Sunday and the last date for submission of forms is August 20. In Patna Women’s College, the online entrance tests for admission to the BCom honours, BSc honours and BA honours courses started on Thursday and conclude on Saturday. “The college has, however, extended a week’s time for such candidates who could not submit their applications online within the prescribed time schedule. The college will hold a separate offline test for these candidates soon,” said college principal Sister M Rashmi. The process of online submission of forms for admission to the undergraduate courses in different colleges of Patliputra University is also going on, with July 31 being the last date of submission of applications. A N College principal S P Shahi said the programme of admission to various self-financing courses of the university is yet to be announced. But, in probability, admission to all the courses would be made on the basis of marks obtained in Class XI examination, he said. Admission to as many as 105 courses right from certificate level to PG courses of Nalanda Open University (NOU) commenced in online mode on Thursday. The admission would conclude on July 31, according to NOU registrar (examination) Neelam Kumari. Mahatma Gandhi Central University, Motihari, would announce its admission schedule for masters and PhD courses on August 1. While admission to the PhD course would be made on the basis of online entrance test, admission to the post-graduate courses and some UG courses, including B Com, BLib Sc and media studies, would be on the basis of marks secured in their last qualifying examinations, said university’s PRO Shephalika Mishra. Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) will, however, admit students to all its courses on the basis of online entrance tests likely to be held in October, said PRO Mudassir Alam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/higher-educational-institutions-change-admission-pattern-amid-covid/articleshow/84869066.cms||B K Mishra

Hearing a contempt application filed by M/s Haji Sons, a dealer of Indian Oil Corporation at Jhansi, Justice Prakash Padia directed to serve the warrant through the chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Lucknow. In the contempt petition, it was alleged that in spite of the court order dated January 27, 2021 to decide the case of the petitioner regarding cancellation of his dealership of Indian Oil Corporation, no order has been passed. As per facts of the case, the petitioner’s dealership was cancelled by order dated December 26, 2019 on the ground that at time of inspection, an electronic chip was found in one dispensing unit of the petitioner for short delivery of product. The order of cancellation was challenged on the ground that the same was passed without considering his objections. The High Court by order dated January 27, 2021 had quashed the order of cancellation and directed for fresh consideration, which was not complied. While issuing the bailable warrant, the court was of the view that in spite of service of notice in contempt proceedings, neither order was complied nor any affidavit was filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-issues-bailable-warrant-to-ioc-official-in-contempt-case/articleshow/84871291.cms||---
---||Patna||Cut taxes on petrol and diesel: Opposition MLCs to Bihar govt||PATNA: Opposition members raised the issue of inflation and hike in prices of petroleum products in the state legislative council on Thursday. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra demanded adjournment of the House over this issue and asked the state government to intervene in the matter and give relaxation on taxes collected on fuel so that common people could get some relief. Mishra said as prices of petrol and diesel were being regularly increased, edibles like pulses and oil have become costlier. He said 26% tax on petrol and 19% on diesel is being levied by the state government and it should be curtailed. Through a written answer which was tabled in the Upper House, deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad said prices of petrol and diesel were not increased from February 27 to March 23 and it also remained constant from April 15 to May 3 in the state. While the price of diesel on April 1 was Rs 86.12 per litre, it has now reached Rs 95.51 per litre. Similarly, petrol price has increased from Rs 92.89 per litre on April 1 to Rs 104.25 per litre now. Prasad said prices of petrol and diesel depend on several factors and base price determined by the oil companies is one of the major factors. He added while the price of crude oil in the international market was 20 dollar per barrel in April, it has now crossed Rs 70 dollar per barrel, leading to the increase in the base price. Regarding the reduction in tax being levied on the fuel, the government stated that even if relaxation is given, it will be meagre and of much help in the long run as the price of crude oil is increasing. Minister incharge Ashok Choudary, who was replying on behalf of the government, said several initiatives were taken to tackle Covid-19 and this led to additional burden on the state’s finance. “Reduction in taxes on fuel would impact these welfare schemes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-mlcs-to-bihar-govt-cut-taxes-on-petrol-and-diesel/articleshow/84869628.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Business||Small biz hit as banks freeze current a/cs||Mumbai: Small businessmen are facing the heat as banks rush to adhere to RBI’s July 31 deadline on a directive on current accounts. The central bank has said that banks cannot open current accounts for borrowers who have loans with other banks. RBI’s directive on opening a current account was announced last year and was to be implemented by January this year. However, with banks dragging their feet, the central bank has imposed July 2021 as a final deadline. In terms of RBI rules, a borrower can have a current account with only that bank which accounts for at least 10% of their total borrowing. Many large corporates have their borrowing spread across multiple banks and therefore have no problem. However, small borrowers who use one bank to borrow and another for transactions will no longer be able to do so.The RBI has said that the rules are necessary to bring discipline in the market. Bankers say that this will prevent diversion of funds by borrowers by defaulting with one bank and receiving payments through another. According to S Harsh Vardhan, who operates a small enterprise, a private bank froze his account this month citing the RBI circular. Although his loan is with a public sector bank, he has been doing his import transactions through a private bank which offered superior online banking and documentation services. “Now we have to send our employee to the bank branch to do our transactions,” he said. “As soon as borrowers obtain a CC/OD (cash credit/overdraft) facility from a bank, they become slaves to that bank. Why should customers have to beg for their own money?” said a businessman on social media. “Our account without an overdraft facility was frozen. Although the bank chased us for credit facilities, we did not need it. Can RBI not ensure discipline without inconveniencing customers?” asked another borrower. Other customers have complained about their inability to facilitate standing instructions in an account where they enjoyed CC/OD facility. Businessmen with multiple proprietorship firms are considered as one entity as banks are collating their exposure based on the borrower’s PAN card.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/small-biz-hit-as-banks-freeze-current-a/cs/articleshow/84872775.cms||Mayur Shetty

In its state convention held at Power Training Institute, Hydel Colony in Bhikharipur area here on Thursday, VKSSS passed a resolution to join the countrywide work boycott agitation on August 10 in case the Bill is not withdrawn immediately. Convenor Shailendra Dubey said that apart from all employees and engineers of all power corporations of UP, other supporting staff will also join the proposed agitation. The speakers said that office-bearers of the National Coordination Committee of Electricity Employees and Engineers had already met power secretary of government of India Alok Kumar in Delhi on Wednesday to express their protest against the bill. Now, the series of sit-in and satyagrah will start at Shram Shakti Bhawan in New Delhi from August 3 to August 6 by the power employees from north, east, west and southern zones, respectively. If their demands would not be met even after holding the series of protests, the work boycott agitation will take place in India on August 10, they added. They said that the power employees are demanding that instead of passing this bill in a hurry to make major changes in electricity laws, the government should send it to Parliament’s standing committee on electricity to seek opinion of power employees and consumers on it. They alleged that ending the provision of licence for power production in the Electricity Act, 2003 resulted in privatisation of power production due to which purchasing of power became a costly affair. Now, with the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 the provision of licence is being ended for power distribution, they said adding, it will pave the way for privatisation of power distribution. More than one private company will enter this sector and start using the infrastructure and network of government without any licence, they said adding, those companies will supply power to only those industrial and commercial consumers, which would be profit-making for them. These provisions will deteriorate the financial condition of power distribution by the government departments, which would not be in the interest of farmers and poor consumers, they claimed. Chandrashekhar Chaurasia chaired the convention and Rajendra Singh conducted it. Important among others, Prabhat Singh, Jai Prakash, Jawahar Lal Vishwakarma, Mayashankar Tiwari, AP Shukla, AK Srivastava and RK Wahi also addressed the convention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/power-employees-threatennationwide-stir-from-aug-10/articleshow/84871188.cms||---

IG Varanasi Range SK Bhagat, who investigated the charge levelled against the RI by the ASP, submitted his report to the DGP through ADG Varanasi Zone Brij Bhushan on Thursday. Talking to TOI, the ADG said, “The IG has submitted his report after completing investigation in the episode of heated argument between the ASP (Operations) Chandauli Anil Kumar and RI Ravindra Kumar. The IG suspended the RI and also recommended departmental action against him. The IG’s investigation report in this episode has been forwarded to the DGP for further action.” Even after submission of his investigation report, the IG camped in Chandauli and held a marathon meeting with SP Chandauli Amit Kumar and other senior officials from morning till late evening on Thursday. On Wednesday, the ASP’s complaint letter, which he had sent to the DGP, ADG Varanasi zone besides chief minister and SC/ST commissions alleging that the said reserve inspector (RI) had threatened him with casteist remarks, had created sensation after it was also made viral on social media. Taking serious note of it, the ADG asked IG Varanasi range to investigate the matter. The IG reached Chandauli on Wednesday morning and after recording the statements of the ASP, RI and other persons concerned completed his probe by late evening. During his investigation, the IG found that after the ASP (Operations) Chandauli detected irregularities in the records of police lines, a heated argument took place between him and the RI. As the showdown took place in a closed room where only the ASP and RI were present and both levelled serious allegations against each other, the IG had to exercise hard in collecting details of the incident. When contacted, the IG he said that on the basis of findings of his detailed investigations, the RI was suspended and department action was also ordered. “Other recommendations made in the report submitted to ADG are confidential,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ri-suspended-on-charge-ofthreatening-asp-in-chandauli/articleshow/84871211.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Khuda Lahora inundated as silt rises||Times News Network Chandigarh: Waterlogging is more of a norm than an exception in the Khuda Lahora based colony. However, authorities concerned have not been able to resolve the issue for the past several years. This residential area is situated in a low lying area and rising silt in Patiala Ki Rao Choe over time has caused the ground to sink deeper. The storm pipelines spew water from Punjab into the choe, exacerbating the problem. Since the colony is situated along the Patiala Ki Rao Choe rivulet, the civic body authority has laid down a storm pipeline in the area for proper drainage. This does not help much in the rainy season as water level in the choe rises after rain in Punjab and Chandigarh, causing the pipeline to release water, which enters the residential area. Both the engineering department of the Chandigarh administration and the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation are jointly involved in relief exercise, but lack of coordination over last year put a spanner in the works. UT failed to de-silt the area and demolish the bridge over the choe, which became major reasons for waterlogging in the area. The civic body authority also failed to lay fresh lines or divert the lines to stop the problem of backflow during heavy water accumulation in the choe. Area residents said that officers of both Chandigarh administration and municipal corporation visited the area multiple times, but in vain. “Many people have to face sleepless nights when rainy season comes and this problem could not be solved for years,” said Deepak Kumar, a resident of Khuda Lahora colony. “We didn’t get anything except assurances to resolve the issue in past many years from officers of both Chandigarh administration and Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh. We fail to understand why authorities concerned did not work together to resolve the issue,” said Pritam Chand, president of the RWA, Khuda Lahora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khuda-lahora-inundated-as-silt-rises/articleshow/84871584.cms||---

It has the capacity to check 500 samples in one cycle and provide the results in two days. While chief minister Uddhav Thackery is scheduled to inaugurate the facility on Wednesday, BMC is still awaiting a confirmation from the chief minister’s office (CMO). The genome lab is being viewed as a necessity with BMC because of the possibility of the third wave. “At present, BMC is dependent on genome laboratories located outside the city and the results take weeks,’’ said BMC’s additional commissioner, Suresh Kakani. Genome laboratories are a part of Covid-19 surveillance in many global capitals and countries as they help detect mutations and emergence of variants in the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in Maharashtra, the emergence of the Delta variant was established only after the peak of the second wave. “If we get prompt results, we can take quick decisions to amend public health measures such as containment zones and restrictions, and thus check spread of the disease,” said Kakani. Incidentally, the cost for testing each sample will work out to Rs12,000, but the one-year expenses for running the lab are part of the Rs 12-crore CSR initiative of Illumina, an American biotech company. The company has sent one main equipment along with another for spare parts. A BMC official said that the machine, which was held up in Singapore for over a month due to lack of cargo flights, was being installed in the infectious diseases hospital. “We will start testing as soon as the inauguration is done on August 4,” said Kakani. While the genome sequencing will not have any consequence on treatment protocols, it is considered an important tool for academic research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-genome-lab-to-open-on-wed-promises-results-in-2-days/articleshow/84874173.cms||---
---||Nagpur||On dedicated track, cyclists run into parked vehicles & hawkers||Nagpur: In what is being considered as a blemish on the Union Urban Affairs Ministry’s Rs1 crore Cycle4India Challenge award for Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) for encouraging cycling, the 18km dedicated bicycle track in the city is either being used for parking of four-wheelers, two-wheelers or encroached upon by hawkers. Cyclists are unhappy with the laurel and termed the dedicated bicycle track nothing but an eyewash. NSSCDCL had spent Rs1 crore it received through corporate social responsibility funds to demarcate the track. As per Smart City mandate, the track is required to be kept free for bicycle riders round the clock. But this is not the case, as TOI found in a reality check done a day after the city got recognition among 11 cities for their work. After covering the entire 18 km patch, TOI found that it is almost clear in Civil Lines area. However, on Amravati Road from Law College Square to Maharajbagh Square, it was either occupied by four-wheelers or encroached upon by hawkers. NSSCDCL’s head of environment department (Smart city) Pranita Umredkar stated that the Smart City created the track as a pilot project on roads with shared traffic movements. “It is not permanent,” she said and added that the project was taken up to bring about behavioural change. The NSSCDCL will also approach the traffic police to take action against illegally-parked vehicles on the track. Umredkar also appealed to citizens not to park their vehicles on the track. Cycling enthusiast Aniruddha Raich, who has taken various initiatives to promote cycling culture in the city, said that the NSSCDCL doesn’t deserve the award. “NSSCDCL merely created an artificial bicycle track on the existing road meant for vehicular movement,” he said. Raich said that now cyclists and private vehicle owners, especially those who have been coming to Civil Lines for morning walks since decades, are fighting for space demarcated on the track. “Morning walkers argue that they need space to park their vehicles. This means NSSCDCL merely marked a portion of the road for track rather than ensuring that it is exclusively used by cyclists,” he said. Rohit Deshpande, a cycling buff, appreciated the NSSCDCL for creating a dedicated bicycle track. “It is a good idea for promoting green transport in Nagpur which is losing its green cover due to various development and infrastructure works,” he said. He, however, feels that the authorities should consider increasing the track’s width. “The track is very narrow at several places,” he said. Deshpande pointed out that dust accumulated at the road corner, particularly on the cycling track, makes cycling difficult and unsafe. He demanded that the NMC solid waste management department should daily sweep the track. Some of the cyclists TOI spoke to said that uneven surfaces and potholes are also a cause for concern. The traffic police should regularly take action against parking of four-wheelers and hawkers on the track, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-dedicated-track-cyclists-run-into-parked-vehicles-hawkers/articleshow/84874152.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The brothers, who have been arrested, told the police that she had brought the family "dishonour". Police are now investigating the role of cops at the station for leaking information about the couple to the girl’s family. “After they were arrested, the elder brother said he killed his sister because she brought shame upon the family by marrying their uncle,” a senior police officer told TOI on condition of anonymity. Archana Yugal, a BA student, belonged to a prominent farmers’ family in Budaun’s Palia Gujar village. The family has been written about because her mother Madhubala had married twins, Kunwarpal Singh and Chandrapal Singh, after they both fell for her. Archana’s father’s cousin Devendra Kumar, who lived in the same village, would often call on her family. They fell in love. But the relationship was taboo. Anticipating resistance from their families, they ran away to Bareilly on June 22 and got married at a temple there. For nearly a week, Archana’s family looked for her. On June 30, her elder brother Ravit Kumar filed a complaint at the Dataganj police station against Devendra and three of his family members, accusing them of abduction. When Archana and Devendra got to know, they sought protection from the Allahabad high court. The plea was granted. “We didn’t receive the high court order but the couple informed the local police about it. They said they wanted police protection. That is why they were asked to come to the police station,” Budaun SSP Sankalp Sharma said. So, around 11pm, possibly looking to avert the eyes of their families, the two of them made their way to the Dataganj police station. But her brothers, father and his twin brother were lying in wait. “They were attacked outside the police station,” the SSP said. It happened within minutes. Before Archana could speak to them or ask anything, Ravit and Pushpendra, the younger brother, had stabbed her in the chest and slit her throat as her father and uncle watched. Devendra was rescued by the police. “We have ensured his security,” Sharma added. “Ravit and Pushpendra were arrested from the spot with the murder weapon.” They, along with Kunwarpal and Chandrapal, have been booked for murder. The SSP said, “We are looking into the role of the investigating officer and other cops at the police station. Who leaked the information to the girl’s family that the couple was coming to the police station is very important.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/honour-killing-at-thana-kin-murder-girl-whod-got-protection-from-hc/articleshow/84869441.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Congress let me down, leader says in suicide message||LUDHIANA: A coordinator of a Congress’s sports and culture cell in Dakha committed suicide while alleging that the party had let him down. But a senior party leader said that he had not blamed the party and had only asked the party to take care of his family. Meanwhile, police have booked three persons — Preetam Singh, his nephew Baljinder Singh and panch Mohinder Singh — for abetment to suicide and arrested Baljinder and Mohnider. The deceased — Daljeet Singh Happy Bajwa of Jangpur — have termed all the three as Akali workers. Before ending his life, Daljeet in an audio message addressed to newly-appointed PPCC president Navjot Singh said he has served the party for 30 years and he couldn’t even get atta-dal started for his family. He claimed that earlier, so many false cases were registered against him which destroyed him, but the party didn’t do anything for him. In his message, Daljeet said even after four-and-a-half years of Congress government, no poor deserving families associated with him in Jangpur have been provided the atta-dal scheme, but those with good cars and houses (of Akalis) have got the same. He said despite Congress being in government, he was named in false attempt to murder case and party couldn’t help him get justice. In the audio message, Daljeet further alleged that he had bought land and Akalis were creating hurdles. The deceased indicated that they were ready to get a second case registered against him. He named those persons in the audio message and said his soul will rest in peace after they are brought to book, Daljeet said. He further said that he had worked for Congress for long, but the party had defeated him. He requests the PPCC president to take care of his family, especially his brother’s son, as he himself didn’t marry as he was committed to the party. Daljeet said that since Sidhu has appointed as party’s state president, they might be heard now. He adds that he cannot leave the party, so he is ending life. Reacting to Daljeet’s audio message, political secretary to chief minister Captain Sandeep Sandhu, who contested elections from Dakha constituency, said Daljeet did not blame the party, but some Akali Dal workers who were after his life and had lodged complaints against him. Sandhu said Daljeet expected from the the party to take care of his family. Captain Sandhu said they will do whatever they can to ensure justice to the departed leader and strictest action would be taken against those found guilty. Meanwhile, MLA Dakha Manpreet Singh Ayali said refuted the allegations levelled by Daljeet Singh, claiming that he was himself involved in wrong activities. He said since they are in opposition, so they are not being heard. Police officials said Daljeet went near Hissowal village on a tractor and ended his life by allegedly consuming sulphas around 1pm. They added that after he was found unconscious and was shifted to a hospital where he died. Sidhu visits family, offers Rs 10 lakhPPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu who along with cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu visited the house of Daljeet Singh at Jangpur and offered his condolences to his family. He also announced Rs 10 lakh relief from Congress for his family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cong-let-me-down-leader-says-in-suicide-message/articleshow/84874195.cms||---

A neurological condition, Bell’s palsy is characterised by temporary facial paralysis and is associated with vaccination. Many countries have reported Bell’s palsy as a Covid vaccination side-effect. The software engineer, Bhavesh Chakor, took his first shot of Covishield on July 24 at Mamta Hospital. His father, Rajesh, said: “The next day, my son felt some uneasiness on his face and, on Thursday, he showed symptoms of facial paralysis.” After the protest outside the hospital, Chakor was asked to undergo an MRI scan. “We are awaiting the scan report,” Rajesh said. The KDMC has sent a query to Mamta Hospital. Hospital officials were unavailable for comment.

---||Nagpur||PM should visit flood-hit areas, sanction funds on priority: Min||Nagpur: State cabinet minister Vijay Wadettiwar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should visit flood-affected regions in Maharashtra and push for early sanction of relief fund from the Centre. Speaking to mediapersons on Thursday in Nagpur, Wadettiwar clarified that the funds received ‘recently’ from the Centre are for the October 2020 floods, and not for the Konkan disaster “as is being said by some people”. Wadettiwar said, “Our request is that the PM should tour the affected areas and see the current situation. He’s the PM of India. When a similar disaster struck Gujarat, the PM went there and sanctioned relief of up to Rs1,000 crore without waiting for any survey. The disaster has led to massive damage to both lives, crops and property. We will do our survey and send an official request to the Centre for funds. But we want that a team from the Centre must come here on priority and release funds after assessing the damage.” A letter requesting for a central team to survey the damage will be sent shortly, said Wadettiwar. On reports that Maharashtra government has already been given Rs700 crore, Wadettiwar said, “We are thankful to the PM for that amount but that’s for October 2020 when floods had hit Marathwada and Western Maharashtra. Back then, we had sent a request for Rs3,721 crore and so far, we have received money in two tranches of Rs700 crore and Rs420 crore.” Surveying the damage is running into some ground challenges, said Wadettiwar. “Accessibility is a problem as many areas are full of muck up to two feet. In many homes, important documents related to property, identity (ration cards, Aadhaar cards etc) are missing. The floods affected many local administrative offices as well where records have been destroyed. Still, our officers are working round the clock and surveying the area,” said Wadettiwar. He reiterated the cabinet decisions of providing immediate assistance to families by giving some cash and ration kits. Wadettiwar also stressed on taking cognizance of expert studies regarding eco-sensitive Konkan zone. “The subtle environment balance in that region seems to have gotten disturbed. Hence, studies and suggestions by different committees now need to be looked into. We have discussed these things in the cabinet already,” said Wadettiwar. Wadettiwar said relief will also be provided to damage caused by rains in Vidarbha. “The same parameters will be applied to farmers here. In my area, Chandrapur, around 7,000 hectares of agriculture land has been destroyed as per the information received. I will be touring different areas today and tomorrow. On Sunday, I will hold a review of eastern and western Vidarbha regarding crop damage, and relief will be provided accordingly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pm-should-visit-flood-hit-areas-sanction-funds-on-priority-min/articleshow/84874235.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Meerut||32 times more lead than safe limits in Kali river 'killing' those in 30 UP villages||Meerut: For years, villages along the Kali river, a tributary of the Ganga, have grappled with an unusually high incidence of cancer and skin disease. A lab test has now confirmed what has long been feared — the waters have turned toxic. The amount of lead is 32 times the permissible limit, arsenic is six times the safe threshold and oxygen levels are down to zero.The National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories, part of an autonomous body under the Centre, conducted the tests on behalf of environment advocacy non-profit Neer Foundation. It found the river water had 3.2 mg per litre lead (the safe limit is 0.1 mg per litre), arsenic was 1.2 mg per litre (the permissible limit is 0.2 mg per litre) and 15 mg per litre grease. “Because of this, even the groundwater has become contaminated. At least 30 villages in the Meerut region alone have been affected,” said Raman Tyagi, director of Neer Foundation. “What is important is the source. If no industrial waste is being dumped into the river, as the pollution control board claims, where is the heavy metal and other carcinogenic substance coming from?” The regional pollution control board had earlier given a clean chit to all industries located in the region — paper mills, dyeing units, sugar mills — and, instead, blamed civic authorities for the polluted water.“The water runs pink here,” said Sameer Tyagi from the Kol village, beside which the Kali flows. “No one expects to live beyond 60. There are so many cases of skin disease and cancer. We have complained to the authorities often but no one listens.” Nearby, at Eklota village, Rakesh Dhankad said it has been a decade since the problem started. “We lost so many loved ones to cancer. All because of our proximity to the river. It’s nothing but toxic water.”Government officials denied the lead, arsenic and grease levels had anything to do with industrial waste. “There are many monitoring agencies — IIT-Roorkee, Central Power Research Institute and Central Pollution Control Board — monitoring pollution generated by industries in real time … Emanation of untreated effluent is out of the question,” Yogender Singh, regional officer of the pollution control board, told TOI. “The river originates from Antwada village in Muzaffarnagar. By the time it reaches Meerut’s Lawar village, it dries up. There is no river water from that point on … What we see is sewage from villages and towns. It is the responsibility of civic authorities to clean that up.” But how would sewage lead to carcinogenic elements in the water? “Many things people do involve chemical processes, like dying hair or throwing away electronic waste. These chemicals get into drains and find their way into rivers.”When asked about this accusation, Meerut municipal commissioner Manish Bansal only said, “We have one operational sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 72 million litres per day. Another will come up soon."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/32-times-more-lead-than-safe-limits-in-kali-river-killing-those-in-30-up-villages/articleshow/84869482.cms||Sandeep Rai

An official source said Robin-Monisha couple, of Kandal area in Ooty, had sold their elder daughter, who is aged three years, to Monisha’s sister two years ago, while the second daughter, who is aged two years, was sold to a couple in Tirupur one and half years ago. The third child, a four-month-old baby boy, was sold to a couple in Salem three months ago, the source said. When the local residents came to know about the sale of kids, they alerted NGO Bharathiar Nala Sangam, which brought the issue to the notice of the district child protection department on Wednesday. The district child protection department officials held an inquiry the same day and rescued all the three kids on Thursday. They also lodged a complaint with the Ooty all-woman police. Prabhu, district child protection officer, said the couple had sold their children for money with the help of some middlemen. “We have rescued all the three kids. The girls are sent to the children’s home in Ooty, while the baby boy is kept in the Ooty Government Medical College and Hospital for the time being.” He said they would take up the issue with the district administration to decide on the further course of action. The Ooty all-woman police have, meanwhile, booked Robin and Monisha under Sections 317 and 370 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 81 of Juvenile Justice Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/couple-sell-son-two-daughters-arrested/articleshow/84874242.cms||---

He said it has proved that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh did not want justice for lakhs of Dalit students whose future was getting destroyed. Sukhbir was in Bathinda on Thursday to welcome some leaders in joining Akali Dal. Speaking about Rs 64 crore SC Scholarship scam, he said it was shocking that despite a request from the anti-corruption branch of the CBI’s Chandigarh office the government was yet to transfer the entire file regarding the case to the agency. He said minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, facing the allegations of corruption should have been sacked immediately after the CBI started investigations on the complaint of the Union social justice and empowerment ministry on June 30. He said a criminal case should be registered against him. Badal said Punjabis could never forgive Dharamsot for destroying the future of lakhs of scheduled caste students. “The SAD is committed to ensuring justice in the case and we will ensure all those who embezzled money meant for Dalit students are brought to justice once we form the government in the state”. The SAD president also announced that the government would order a time bound inquiry into the Rs 400 crore JCT Electronics liquidation scam once it formed a government in the state. Demanding the immediate sacking of the industries minister, Badal said a CBI or a high court monitored inquiry should be held into the scam to ensure justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/state-not-sharing-record-of-sc-scholarship-scam-with-cbi-sukhbir/articleshow/84874241.cms||---

An internationally accepted conservation tool, CA|TS prescribes the best practices and standards to manage tiger reserves. While CA involves social, cultural and biological significance, area design and legal status, management, community tourism and protection, TS deals with habitat management and tiger populations. CA|TS is implemented at 125 sites across seven countries. In India alone, it is implemented at 94 sites. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) under the environment, forest and climate change ministry had adopted CA|TS in 2020. With an area extending to 688.59sqkm, MTR is home to 103 tigers, while ATR, which spreads across 1,479.87sqkm, houses 23 tigers. Scoring 100% in eight of the 17 categories, MTR scored the highest of 92.35% and attained the standard. K K Kaushal, field director, MTR, said, “MTR is one of the topmost tiger reserves both in terms of biodiversity and management and it is evidenced in our highest score. This motivates all of us not only to sustain our performance but do even better.” I Anwardeen, field director (incharge), ART, said the reserve had undergone a serious process of conservation and management over the years, helping it attain the international standards. “The field staff have played a major role and they deserve the credit.” Among the other tiger reserves that were accredited with CA|TS were Parambikulam Tiger Reserve in Kerala, Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Karnataka and Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in West Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mtr-atr-get-cats-accreditation/articleshow/84874266.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After triple talaq, abolish polygamy & child marriage, say Muslim women||Mumbai: On the second anniversary of the passing of the anti-triple talaq law, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) demanded a law against polygamy, child marriage and nikah halala — a custom in which a divorced woman has to marry another man, consummate the marriage if she wants to remarry her former husband. After Supreme Court made triple talaq illegal in 2017, the Union government passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 on July 30, 2019 making triple talaq or instant divorce a criminal offence. A man can be jailed for three years for uttering ‘talaq’ thrice to his wife in one sitting. BMMA was a petitioner in Supreme Court, seeking ban on triple talaq. “BMMA has demanded codification of Muslim family law which will prohibit discriminatory practices like triple talaq, polygamy, halala, muta (temporary marriage) and child marriage. We also want the Supreme Court must take up the PIL against polygamy and halala and give its verdict as soon as possible,” BMMA co-founder Noor Jahan Safia Niaz said, adding that BMMA’s city unit saw 40 polygamy cases in 2019 and 2020. “Many men may not choose triple talaq to divorce, but resort to polygamy.” Activists said police are reluctant to file FIRs on complaints of women who face harassment. Advocate Rukhsar Memon said in a statement.“Cases drag first at police stations, then in courts. The victim and her family lack time and resources to follow up with the police who do not cooperate. Women need speedy remedy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-triple-talaq-abolish-polygamy-child-marriage-say-muslim-women/articleshow/84876331.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Dehradun||Going Green: How U’khand-based start-ups are strengthening rural economy||Dehradun: In the past few years, Uttarakhand has witnessed the launch of several start-ups aimed at strengthening the state's rural economy while striking a balance between profitability and ecological conservation. The growth of one such start-up — Madogiri — has been quite impressive. Launched in August 2020 by a group of local youths, Madogiri is involved in a range of businesses, including running a pizzeria, organising trekking activities, selling indigenous products, among others. However, the USP of the enterprise is its eco-friendly approach towards all its businesses. The products served at their food joints are all made from indigenous ingredients. The company also sells products like pickles, honey and others that are made without harmful chemicals by the locals of the hill areas. The company officials claim that at least 500 residents of hill districts in Uttarakhand are associated with their business operations. Besides, the venture also conducts plantation drives across the state. In fact, Madogiri has been working in close coordination with the state forest department since their successful plantation drive in Mussoorie in July 2020. Speaking to TOI, Stuti Panwar, senior Madogiri official, said, “The name Madogiri — which loosely translates to a mountain of thoughts — sums up our enterprise in a way. We want to bring about a positive change through our start-up, pushing the local economy while focusing on sustainable development.” Shivam Nath, in-charge of Madogiri's organic products business, said, “Our business model will strengthen the rural economy, thereby increasing employment opportunities in the hills.” Yet another state-based venture, Bhuli, aimed at strengthening the state’s rural economy, is working to revive the craftsmanship of the Himalayan region. The company — founded by Tanya Kotnala in 2017 — ropes local artisans for the manufacture and sale of handicrafts. Recently, Bhuli sold more than 1,000 calendars that were part of its “Costume Culture of India” series. Similarly, Vill 'O Tale, a startup launched by Shuddha Satwa Ghosh and Soumen Karmakar, is reviving tourism in ghost villages to check migration from hills. "Uttarakhand has several picturesque ghost villages. We believe that locals, who have gone to other places in search of employment opportunities, can be brought back here and migration can be checked as tourists would love to stay in homestays in these unmarketed villages," said Ghosh.

Wanting to build a home and expand his business, he had taken a loan of Rs 12 lakh from an informal moneylender after his bank loan approval didn’t go through. In two years, he had paid back Rs 37 lakh — he was being charged a 120% annual interest. But the principal amount remained unchanged. He saw no end to his debt. Predatory loans are designed to fail. They mean no paperwork, no background checks and instant money but they also trap borrowers in debt cycles impossible to get out of. And they are taking down borrowers from UP’s small towns, literally “killing” them. “Ashish was murdered. Those moneylenders killed my son. It was not suicide,” said Ashok Gupta, his father, a retired doctor. The moneylender, Avinash Bajpai, has been arrested. Prince Sonkar, 26, owned a small vegetable and fruit shop in Lucknow. In August last year, he consumed poison and died after months of harassment by moneylenders who had lent him Rs 20,000 to expand his business. “He’d paid them back twice the amount,” his mother Jyoti said. “The men who drove him to suicide are now out. There was no proof.” Because of how these loans are given out — there is no paper trail — evidence of harassment is difficult to come by. These loan markets are anyway not regulated the way they should be. “Under the UP Regulation of Moneylending Act, 1976, anyone can write to the sub divisional magistrate, fill a form and become a licensed moneylender. The rate of interest is not overseen by the government,” said Rajveer Singh, a lawyer who helps those targeted by loan sharks. “The lenders take a minimum 20-30% interest. When they find soft targets, like the unlettered or those in urgent need, they shoot it up to 100%.” The absence of paperwork also means borrowers often can’t seek help from the police, unless things turn dire. Like in the case of Devender Saini, a daily wage labourer, who walked into the Meerut SSP’s office on Tuesday and consumed poison before the cops, telling them he had repaid Rs 2.5 lakh against a Rs 1-lakh loan in 18 months and was still being harassed by the moneylender, Rinku Gujjar. Saini didn’t make it, leaving behind his wife and four children. With a sense of shame and failing associated with borrowing, many of those who fall into the trap do not tell their families — it ends up allowing lenders to go scot free. Chandrapal, who went by his first name, was a 65-year-old teacher from Bareilly. “On June 30, he killed himself. He left behind a suicide note, saying that he had to take the step because of debt. His family had no idea,” said Sanjeev Yadav, investigating officer in the case. “In such cases, we have to go with what the moneylender claims.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/120-interest-on-loans-moneylenders-are-making-a-killing-in-up-small-towns/articleshow/84869524.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan Administrative Service exam bribe: School principal among three held||JODHPUR/JAISALMER: The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Thursday arrested three persons, including the principal of a government school, in a bribery case related to Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS) examination. The agency also seized the bribe amount of Rs 20 lakh which was returned by the mediator after he failed to keep his promise of ensuring 70% marks to the ‘beneficiary’ in the RAS interview. Interestingly, while one of the accused is the principal at the Government Higher Secondary School, Panawara in Bayatu sub-division of Barmer, the other two are also associated with two private schools in Barmer and Jodhpur. DIG (ACB) Vishnu Kant said that a team had chased a vehicle after they received information that two persons were on their way to Barmer with a huge amount given in return for ensuring higher marks in the RAS examination. “Our team intercepted the vehicle at a police post in Kalyanpura on Jodhpur-Barmer highway on Thursday afternoon and found Rs 19.95 lakh in possession of two persons after searching the vehicle," said the officer. They were identified as Jogaram Saran, the principal of the government school, and Thakararam, owner of Mother Teresa Senior Secondary School in Barmer. “On inquiring about the money, they disclosed that the money had been given to one Kishnaram of Jodhpur for ensuring over 70% marks to one Harish, who cleared the RAS-2018 examination. Since Kishnaram failed to keep his promise, he called them from Barmer to return the money which they received from him on Thursday and were returning back to Barmer,” Kant said. On further investigation, it was found that Harish was the nephew of Thakararam, one of the accused. Thakararam had contacted Jogaram to find out if someone could ensure Harish got over 70% marks in the interview. Jogaram contacted Kishnaram, who is a physical instructor at a private school in Jodhpur. Kishnaram had promised at least 70% marks in interview for Harish citing contacts in RPSC and demanded Rs 20 lakh for it. But he failed to do so as promised and Harish secured only 54% marks in the interview. Jogaram then demanded the money back and Kishnaram agreed to return the money. Jogaram and Thakararam had come to Jodhpur to receive the amount on Thursday. Kant said all the three have been arrested and Kishnaram was being interrogated with regard to his contact in RPSC and the grounds for him giving assurance to get 70% marks for Harish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/ras-exam-bribe-school-principal-among-3-held/articleshow/84874355.cms||---

Formula Student (FS) is Europe’s most established educational engineering competition for formula style racing cars which celebrated its 23rd anniversary this year. IIT-Bombay Racing participated in the concept class (virtual mode) along with 65 other teams from 18 countries. In the previous season they were the ﬁrst Indian FS team to win the engineering design event, and this season, they defended their title. IIT-Bombay Racing has also secured the second place with 234 points in the virtual lap time simulation; a new category introduced this year and the best acceleration mentioned for covering 0-75 metre in 4.127 seconds. “The prevailing situation didn’t stop the students from putting their best foot forward and they kept learning as they operated in a hybrid mode. The team looks forward to bringing these designs into reality and improving even further while running the car at Silverstone Circuit, UK,” said IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri.  FS UK is a kitemark for real world engineering experience, combining practical engineering experience with soft skills, including business and project management. IIT-Bombay Racing plans to go driverless by 2024. It has a dedicated team of 12 design engineers supervised by a core team member working on various driverless technologies such as perception, which creates a map of the environment with the images captured from a camera using deep learning, control algorithms to navigate the vehicle through the detected environment and actuator controls which finally control steering and the brake pedals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/iit-b-racing-wins-uks-edu-engg-contest-against-65-teams-in-mumbai/articleshow/84876373.cms||---

Her brother dialled for 108 ambulance service which was promised to them, but never arrived which led to the loss of crucial hours. Eventually, the couple hired a private ambulance to the hospital, but it was too late. The woman succumbed to her injuries.The ongoing strike of ambulances has crippled the healthcare services in the state. The private firm, GVK EMRI, has fired over 570 staffers since Monday who are protesting against the state government for not regularising their jobs apart from pending wage hike and a few other issues.Talking to TOI, Gulfam Ali, brother of deceased Aayesha, said that his sister along with her husband was walking near the highway when a tractor hit her leaving her injured. The family called up 108 but failed to get an ambulance. They immediately took an auto and reached a local hospital.“The ambulance didn’t turn up, but we managed to reach the local hospital. The doctors there told us that it’s a police case, so they won’t help until we file an FIR. I had a heated argument with the doctors as all I wanted was to save my sister. Hence, we decided to take her to the district hospital,” said Gulfam.The kin of the deceased added that he again called 108 ambulance service multiple times but every time, he was asked to keep waiting.“We wasted over an hour’s time and then we booked a private ambulance which took Rs 1,000 from us. But she died on the way,” added the wailing brother.Meerut medical college and district hospital are flooded with patients who are either reaching the hospital on bikes or in e-rickshaws as there are no government ambulances available in the city and private players are asking for hefty amounts.Meanwhile, as the strike of ambulance drivers entered its fourth day, the private company running 112 and 108 ambulances in UP, GVK EMRI, fired over 570 people across the state as the protesting staffers of the firm are not ready to join back duties.“GVK EMRI is known for saving lives and we are committed to the task. Anyone trying to disrupt the ambulance services that save the lives of the general public will not be tolerated at any cost. All the demands of the ALS employees have been met. Still, under the influence of some people, the workers went on strike. About 570 employees who disrupted services have been sacked. If anyone tries to disrupt the services further, action will be taken against him also. Most of the employees have rejoined their duties. My appeal to the remaining employees is to join duty immediately,” said TVSK Reddy, senior vice-president, GVK EMRI.On the other hand, Hanuman Pandey, president, UP Ambulance Workers’ Association, said, “We have been working for the government since 2012. We have worked even amid pandemic. In return, we have faced FIRs and terminations. We are all experienced workers. Then why not hire us for those 250 ambulances that will now be run by a new firm? We seek discontinuation of the tender process in ambulance services, permanent jobs, no pay cuts, overtime allowance and other perks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ambulance-strike-disabled-woman-hit-by-tractor-dies-husband-dials-108-for-ambulance-which-fails-to-arrive/articleshow/84869579.cms||Ishita Mishra

The last SAD-BJP government had cleared these agreements. Cheema said: “This game of letters is another betrayal of the people of Punjab and a ploy by the Congress government to buy time.” He accused the CM of running away from calling a cabinet meeting on this issue. The LoP said: “The Punjab cabinet hasn’t met for the last 41 days. This had not happened until now.” Demanding the convening of the assembly session, Cheema asked Amarinder if he could tell the public where the white paper on PPAs had disappeared after being flashed in the assembly. The AAP membersuggested that the review and cancellation of the power purchase agreements be done under the Punjab and Haryana high court’s supervision. Seeking action against “the betrayers of Punjab”, Cheema claimed: “Crores of rupees could be recovered from the Badals, the power companies, the officials, and the brokers who had looted Punjab’s treasury in these eight to 10 years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cancel-ppas-in-cabinet-meet-assembly-session-aap-to-cm/articleshow/84874315.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab docs to lay siege to district admin buildings from Monday||Chandigarh: Punjab government doctors on Thursday threatened to lay siege to the district administrative buildings from August 2 if the government failed to resolve their pending issues as promised by health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu. The doctors are at loggerhead with the state government over the implementation of the recommendation of the Sixth Pay Commission that has resulted in reduction of their allowances, especially non-practicing allowance (NPA). Joint Government Doctors Coordination Committee, Punjab — which comprises organisations like Punjab Civil Medical Services Association, Punjab State Veterinary Officers Association, PCMS Dental Association, Medical Teachers Association and Rural Medical Doctors Association — announced that from Monday the members of the committee will lay siege to the district offices and will not allow anyone to enter the premises. “If the matter is not resolved, the local units will start occupying the civil surgeon offices and will make sure that no official work is done,” said senior vice-president of the PCMS Association Dr Gagandeep Shergill. If the impasse continues till August 4, doctors will occupy the director health services office in Sector 34 here on August 5. PCMS will also kick start a signature campaign against privatisation from Monday at the district hospital in Pathankot. Doctors will also continue to run parallel OPDs five days a week. The committee has allowed doctors to sit in their OPD rooms but have been asked not to use slips issued by the government. All patients will be dispensed medicine from funds raised by the union. So far, around one lakh patients have been examined in these parallel OPDs and medicines worth around Rs 15 lakh has been dispensed. Doctors will continue to perform emergency medico/vetro legal cases and Covid duty. The committee will ask civil surgeons and other senior officials of the department to join their agitation. They will start charging ‘Union’s levy’ of Rs 5,100 from civil surgeons and Rs 2,100 from SMOs and programme officers. PCMSA president Dr Gagandeep Singh said despite the ongoing struggle, the government has not yet resolved their issue. He said after the assurance given by the health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, the doctors had postponed the sit-in for a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-docs-to-lay-siege-to-district-admin-buildings-from-monday/articleshow/84874411.cms||---

Soon after Dhami’s visit to the gurdwara on July 24, a video that showed schoolgirls performing folk dances to welcome the CM surfaced on social media. A three-member team from the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhs, was sent to look into the alleged violation of maryada (the Sikh Code of Conduct) and the resignations were handed to it on Tuesday. Sewa Singh, the former head of the committee, told TOI that the dancers were to perform at the chowk right outside the gurdwara. “No permission was sought from us to hold any event inside the gurdwara and we did not grant any such permission," he said. Videos of the dance, however, started doing the rounds on social media soon after. As the news spread, Sikh sangats from several areas of the state as well as neighbouring Uttar Pradesh gathered at Nanakmatta to register their protest. Some Sikh groups were stopped by police at the state borders. One of the protesters from the rural area of Nanakmatta said, “Our religion prohibits dance at gurdwaras or in presence of Guru Granth Sahib yet dancing troupe was allowed at one of our holiest places. We have nothing against CM visiting the shrine, but it was the responsibility of the gurdwara administration to ensure religious sentiments don’t get hurt,” said Satwant Singh Baagi. Various departments of the Udham Singh Nagar district administration kept passing the buck on who had organised the functions to welcome the CM. An official of the information department on condition of anonymity told TOI that the district administration had no role in organising the dance. While Dhami was not reachable for a comment, additional chief secretary to the CM, Anand Bardhan, told TOI he was not aware of the controversy. “This has only come to our notice after media reports.” Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said the government had “utmost respect for all religions” while adding that no comments can be made on the matter “without discussing it with the CM”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/didnt-break-maryada-dist-admin-at-fault-ukhand-gurdwara-panel/articleshow/84866653.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Meerut||In Baghpat, Yogi enters poll mode, calls upon party workers to strengthen up to booth level||Meerut: With an eye on the forthcoming UP assembly elections — most likely to be held in February-March 2022 — chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday called upon his party workers to strengthen the organisation’s structure up to the booth level. The CM was interacting with BJP workers on the sidelines of his visit to the Baghpat district hospital to take stock of the preparedness for the so-called third (Covid-19) wave. Yogi, meanwhile, directed officials to expedite the process of oxygen generation by the new plant that was being set up at the facility. His public address was, however, aimed at pleasing electorates by counting the achievements of his government, in general, and developments that have taken place in Baghpat in the past four years, in particular. And, he didn’t forget to pat the backs of the elected BJP representatives by giving them the credit. “The way elected public representatives are working for the people of the district, they deserve appreciation.” “Today, youths from Baghpat are shining all over,” said Yogi while pointing out that it was not so earlier. “Earlier, they could be seen running and practising on the roads, but they never used to get jobs. After we started police recruitment in the state, I saw a good representation from Baghpat. On the contrary to the earlier regime when a particular section used to get all the privileges, today all sections are getting equal opportunities.” Counting the developments that have taken place in the district, the CM said: “We have worked for Baghpat in all sectors. For instance, the capacity to produce sugar has almost doubled by rejuvenating Ramala sugar mill. Be it the electrification of railway lines, or starting a new train to Delhi, or the development of an ITI college and the construction of a stadium, we have strived to change the face of the district and will continue to do so.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/in-baghpat-yogi-enters-poll-mode-calls-upon-party-workers-to-strengthen-up-to-booth-level/articleshow/84869688.cms||Sandeep Rai

If the pilot project is successful, the meters in residential areas of the city will also be replaced with scada metres. Apart from this, it has also decided to construct two Water Treatment Plants (WTP) at Bara Bungalow and Panchavati with a total capacity of 90 million litres per day (MLD). While the capacity of WTP at Bara Bungalow will be 50 MLD, the capacity of the Panchavati plant will be 40 MLD. The total cost of both the projects, WTP and installation of Scada water metres, is estimated at around Rs 165 crore. The NMSCDCL is also in the process of floating a tender for both the projects. NMSCDCL CEO Sumant More said the priority is to start the new smart city projects. “We are in the process of floating tenders for the projects in the next couple of weeks,” he said. Around three years ago, the NMC had conducted an audit of the water pipelines in the city to check water leakages. The survey had been conducted through a private agency. During the survey 40% non-revenue water (NRW) losses were found due to leakages and thefts. The Scada water meter will keep a check on non-revenue water and it will help the civic body to reduce water leakages and thefts. Two industrial areas of Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Satpur and Ambad, are located in the jurisdiction of the NMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-smart-corp-to-install-7000-scada-water-meters/articleshow/84866666.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||Post-Covid heart failure symptoms common, most recover with follow-up: Docs||Nagpur: Almost two months after the peak of second wave in Vidarbha, patients with long-time implications of Covid-19 are presenting with different ailments. Cardiologists are seeing increased number of Covid recovered patients with symptoms of heart failure. Patients as young as in mid-thirties are coming with symptoms like chest pain, breathlessness etc. Cardiologist Dr Pankaj Harkut explained that “heart failure” sounds like the heart is no longer working and there is nothing that can be done. “But, heart failure means that the heart isn’t pumping as well as it should be,” he said and added that 80% of post-Covid heart failure patients recover spontaneously if given timely medical attention. According to him, nearly one-fifth of the heart failure patients require prolonged treatment while the rest recover with simple follow-up. Often patients consider chest pain or restlessness as a revived cardiovascular disease or heart trouble. “Even after a month of recovery from Covid-19, I was still suffering from shortness of breath. My cardiologist advised me an angiography. Eventually, no blockages were found. But now I am doubly sure that whatever shortness of breath I am going through is due to long-term effect of Covid-19 and not due to heart blockage,” said Kishor Udar, a retired banker. Another cardiologist Dr Amar Amale said that such patients will recover after careful follow-up in nearly three months. “I have seen some or other diseases exacerbating post-Covid. Many have cancer manifesting and many have chronic fatigue. Cardiac patients are coming with heart failure and other manifestation either due to Covid or poor follow-up,” he said. According to doctors, the initial few months of post-Covid recovery phase increases risk of clots and, hence, even young patients need to take care during this phase. “Covid-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about it. So, it’s not wise to take it casually. Severe fatigue is common after Covid just as it is after any serious illness. People experience shortness of breath, chest pain or palpitations. All these symptoms are related to heart. So, it’s better to once consult your family physician,” said general physician Dr Prakash Gulhane. RECOVERY PHASE# Consult family physician - If shortness of breath worsens when lying down or on exertion - If shortness of breath is accompanied by fatigue or ankle swelling- If chest pain is non-severe but increasing in frequency or relieved by rest# Consult a cardiologist - Shortness of breath along with oxygen saturation reading under 92%- Bluish lips or face due to sudden onset of fatigue and heavy chest - When chest pain is severe, with nausea, light headedness or sweating||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-covid-heart-failure-symptoms-common-most-recover-with-follow-up-docs/articleshow/84869620.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Kochi||Only authorized abattoir in Kochi on verge of closure||Kochi: With corporation authorities continuing with theirindifferent attitude, Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) is going ahead with measures to close the slaughterhouse at Kaloor, the only authorized abattoir in Kochi. Last year, KSPCB had served notice to the corporation seeking reason for not closing the abattoir where cattle were being culled in an unscientific and unhygienic manner. KSPCB had summoned the corporation secretary for hearing before taking a final decision. Last week, board officials conducted an inspection at the slaughterhouse, owned by the corporation. “During the hearing held last year, the corporation authorities had sought time for taking rectification measures. We gave them the time they sought. But, when we inspected the slaughterhouse a few days ago, we could see that they haven’t taken any rectification measures,” a KSPCB official said. “We had chalked out both short-term and long-term mitigating measures. We had asked them to at least set up a facility to collect waste on the slaughterhouse premises itself rather than draining out the entire waste into drains and waterbodies. But the authorities have failed in implementing any of them. Now, we are left with no other option but to go ahead with the steps to close down the abattoir,” the official said. Kochi corporation authorities said that they would soon take measures to construct a modern abattoir in Kaloor. “As a preliminary step, we had asked those running stalls in the slaughterhouse to move out last month. But, they moved the court challenging our decision. Anyway, the court didn’t allow their prayer for staying out decision,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Asharaf. “There is a project, which has been included in the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) scheme to construct a slaughterhouse on a par with international standards. Mayor M Anil Kumar held detailed discussions in this regard. We would expedite the measures to construct a new slaughterhouse with all the facilities,” Asharaf said. He said that measures had already been taken for shifting the abattoir to the nearby GCDA market temporarily. Meanwhile, there are objections against the slaughterhouse coming up in Kaloor, which is the heart of the city. “The slaughterhouse should be shifted to another place where the land value is less.

Shortest duration of 21 days between both doses is said to be the prime reason for people going for Sputnik V though Covaxin and Covishield are available in their areas.Double advantage of ongoing treatment and vaccination at the same centre is also driving the demand.Dr Tushar Gawad, director-administration, Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, said many patients from Madhya Pradesh have taken their first dose of Sputnik V at their hospital. “Though after 21 days they have to visit again for the second dose, it is not a deterrent for them. In the last 15 days, we have crossed 900 jabs. On the first day itself we had over 100 registrations. Even now the online slots get filled very quickly on a daily basis,” said Dr Gawad.Dr Shravan Kumar Enumula, facility director at Amercian Oncology Institute, said, “We started 15 days back and got amazing response to Sputnik V from the first day itself. We had good number of online bookings and they get filled instantly. Day by day enquires are increasing from MP, from the city and neighbouring districts. Some companies are also asking us to conduct drive. Every day we are undertaking 120 to 140 vaccination,” said Dr Enamula.Dr Meraj Shaikh, an intensivist, ICU, at Care Hospital, said that they got queries from individuals who wanted their entire family to be vaccinated with Sputnik. “We always had double the demand than available doses,” he said.Getwell Hospital has placed an order of 10,000 Sputnik V doses due to plenty of queries. Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, chief pulmonologist and hospital director, said, “I got enquiries from Jabalpur and Narsinghpur too. We had advised our patients to get vaccinated at other centres but they preferred Sputnik V and at out hospital only. Soon, we shall get the doses as the special fridge to store vials at -28 to -40 degrees Celsius too has arrived.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-turns-sputnik-v-hub-for-people-from-neighbouring-districts-states/articleshow/84869683.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

While 19 applications are for starting traditional arts, science and commerce colleges, four are for law programmes, and two others are night colleges. The university will set up expert committees to inspect these colleges and the reports will be presented to various MU bodies before they are sent to the state government for a final nod. “The numbers are less compared to the previous year due to the pandemic,” said a management council member. Proposals for new colleges are mostly from Thane, Raigad, Sindhudurg and Palghar. There is a proposal to set up a commerce college each in Kurla, Ghatkopar and Borivali; and for an arts and commerce in Shivajinagar and in Borivali each. Proposals to set the law colleges are from Kandivali, and three are from Thane.

---||Kochi||Curbs in opening shops as Kochi corporation falls in C-category||KOCHI: With Kochi corporation falling in C category, restrictions for opening shops have become more stringent. According to shopowners, this would affect the business especially at a time when Onam is around the corner. The merchants have demanded that there should be a change in fixing the category in cities like Kochi. Until Wednesday, the corporation was in the B category . “Now, only shops dealing with essential goods can open daily. Some of the shops like textiles, which were allowed to work three days a week when the corporation was in B category, will be allowed to open only once in a week. This will affect the business community, especially during Onam season which is largest shopping season in the state,” said Ernakulam merchants’ union secretary Mohammed Kamran. “Now, authorities are fixing the category of a local body based on the highest cases reported from its limits. The case of Kochi is different from grama panchayats and other local bodies where the total area and population is very low. Increase in number of cases in Fort Kochi may not affect the business and normal activities in Edappally, which is far away. In cities like Kochi with vast areas under its limits, there should be area-wise categorisation,” Kamran said. It was since July 18 that many of the shops in the city opened throughout the week. They were not allowed to open on Saturdays and Sundays since mid-April. “Now, the business is picking up and we are preparing for Onam sale. At this juncture, it will be a big blow to us,” a shopowner from Kaloor said. As per the review meeting held on the previous day, Kochi corporation, along with 40 more local bodies in the district, now falls in C category for a week. Meanwhile, 2,359 fresh Covid-19 cases have been reported from various parts of Ernakulam district on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/curbs-in-opening-shops-as-corp-falls-in-c-category/articleshow/84871921.cms||---
---||Nagpur||HC orders probe against lawyer for suppressing facts||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has ordered an inquiry against a lawyer for allegedly suppressing facts while filing a bail application of a rape convict. Justice Rohit Deo has asked principal district and sessions judge here to conduct an inquiry into the allegations against the lawyer practising in the lower courts and submit a report by Friday by 2.30pm before the case is heard. Recently, the same judge had slapped Rs50,000 fine on 22-year-old student Shubham Soni, who’s accused of murder, after he filed a bail plea in HC. He also censured his lawyer for the same reason for suppressing facts while not informing the HC of the second bail application. “I was constrained to record strong reservations and disapproval of the unhealthy and indeed contemptuous practice of the bench hunting/forum shopping by filing successive bail applications before different judges/courts without disclosing the requisite details,” justice Deo said. The directives came while hearing a petition for bail filed by Swapnil Ramteke, who’s accused of raping a 13-year-old girl on July 12. The accused was booked under Section 376 along with Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act by the Wathoda police last year. He moved the HC after his first bail plea was cancelled by session judge RR Patare on March 19, 2021. The suppression of facts came to fore after additional public prosecutor Nitin Rode brought to fore that the petitioner had suppressed that his second bail application was pending before another sessions judge SR Trivedi. Later, Ramteke’s counsel, who was engaged by his brother to plead in HC, also endorsed the fact. Surprisingly, the second bail application was filed by the lawyer concerned, who had filed the first one in the sessions court, but without consulting either the petitioner or his brother. Even the petitioner’s signature or of his brother weren’t taken on the second application. “If what is submitted is factually correct, serious issues of professional misconduct and/or contemptuous attempt to subvert the administration of justice may arise. Without a preliminary inquiry, it wouldn’t be fair to make any further observation,” justice Deo said. He directed the principal judge to submit a photocopy of the entire record of first and second applications filed by Ramteke and to record prima facie finding whether those are preferred without instructions and whether entire facts are disclosed. The registrar (judicial) was told to convey HC’s directives to the principal judge immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-orders-probe-against-lawyer-for-suppressing-facts/articleshow/84874404.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Aurangabad||Permit to new sugar factory derecognised by Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has derecognised an industrial entrepreneur memorandum (IEM) of September 8, 2010 granted to Swami Samarth Sugars and Agro Industries Limited for starting a new sugar factory at Warkhed (Ramdoh) in Nevasa tehsil of Ahmednagar district. The court declared the IEM as “inoperative”. In a judgment pronounced on July 23, the HC bench of justices SV Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni also set aside all the extensions granted from time to time to the new sugar factory while observing that the authorities demonstrated “unnecessary indulgence” in favour of the new sugar factory despite unambiguous provisions under the Sugar Control Order (SCO), 1966. “No right subsists in favour of the new sugar factory pursuant to the IEM dated September 8, 2010,” the bench said, adding the respondent (Swami Samarth Sugars) is restrained from carrying out its work and all further activities pursuant to the said IEM. The HC, however, granted the respondent-lawyer’s plea for a four-weeks stay (with effect from July 23) on its order to enable the new sugar factory management to move an appeal in the Supreme Court. The lawyer had argued the factory has already made heavy investment, but the HC had said in an order in March 2018 that “ if further construction is made, the same shall be at the risk of the respondents and subject to the decision of the petition”. On July 23, the HC said, “Needless to state, further activity would not create equity in favour of the respondents. After the lapse of four weeks, the present order granting stay to the operation of the judgment shall axiomatically stand vacated.” As per the IEM, granted under clause 6 of the Sugar Control Order (SCO), 1966, the management of the new sugar factory was to take effective steps within two years of acknowledgement of the IEM by the competent authority and start commercial production within four years. However, this did not happen and in 2014, the factory applied for an extension of the IEM as well as a change of location from Warkhed (Ramdoh) to Malewadi Dhumala, also in Nevasa taluka. The Loknete Marutrao Ghule Patil Dnyaneshwar Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Limited, which has been operating since 1973 at Dnyaneshwar Nagar in village Bhende of Newasa, raised an objection to this through a series of petitions and the HC clubbed them together for a common judgment and order. Among other things, the petitioner’s lawyers R N Dhorde and P S Dighe had argued that the IEM of September 8, 2010 stood de-recognised and lapsed from the moment the new factory failed to take effective steps within two years of acknowledgement of the IEM and failed to commence commercial production by 2014. Also, the shifting of location was not allowed under clause-6 of the SCO, 1966. The petitioner pointed out that the proposed location of the new factory was within 25-km aerial distance of the existing factory and the same was in violation of the SCO as well as environmental laws. The HC not only upheld these arguments, but also observed the members of the new sugar factory were not farmers from the same region. It held that the extensions could not have been granted after the IEM stood auxiomatically lapsed and there was no way an extension could have been granted beyond one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/permit-to-new-sugar-factory-derecognised-by-high-court/articleshow/84866699.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||India||School enrolment data indicates 45% OBCs, 19% Dalits in India||NEW DELHI: We might not know what proportion of India’s population are OBCs with the idea of the caste census jettisoned, but the caste composition of primary school students is readily available and a rough indicator. It shows that 45% were OBC, 19% scheduled caste (SC), 11% scheduled tribe (ST) and the rest — which would include Hindu upper castes as well as the bulk of the population of other religious groups except Buddhists — roughly 25% in 2019-20. The United District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+), which maintains data on schooling, has been collecting caste details of all school students for over a decade and since enrolment at the primary level is 100%, the caste composition of primary students from class I to V should broadly reflect that in the larger population. To the extent that age structures of the more deprived sections are slightly more skewed towards younger age groups, it could overstate their shares, but not by much. Since the census enumerates SCs and STs, their proportion in each state is available. TOI analysed the UDISE+ data and found that the proportion of SC and ST students at the primary level is quite close to their proportion in census 2011, the variation in almost all states being within a couple of percentage points. Smaller states and UTs have been excluded from this analysis since minor differences in absolute numbers could make a significant percentage change. The Mandal commission had estimated that OBCs constitute 52% of the population. Though the proportion of OBC students is lower than that estimate, the quota for them is clearly not proportional to their share in the population, unlike for SCs and STs. Southern states have the highest proportion of OBC students with Tamil Nadu at 71% followed by Kerala with almost 69% and Karnataka with 62%. In the north, Bihar at 61% has the highest proportion of OBCs, followed by Uttar Pradesh with 54% and Rajasthan with 48%. Read Also27% OBC, 10% EWS reservation in medical seats from all-India quotaDays after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the health and education ministries to move on implementing OBC and EWS quotas in medical and dental colleges, the government announced the reservations expected to benefit nearly 5,550 students every year.“If we want to address the inequities in access to education and care about the outcomes of different social groups, having data on caste is very important. Without data, you cannot formulate policies to address these inequities. So, it is great that UDISE has this data and for the same reasons there ought to be a caste census for the larger population too. We have to find better ways of eradicating caste biases in society than avoiding census,” said Prof Rohit Dhankar of the School of Education in Azim Premji University. Until 1931, the census always had data on caste. However, since independence, the census has collected data only on SCs and STs. A socio-economic and caste census (SECC) collected data that was to be published in 2016, but the government decided to withhold it on the grounds that there were serious classification issues to be resolved. The 2021 census was supposed to include caste, but that has now been jettisoned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/school-enrolment-data-indicates-45-obcs-19-dalits-in-india/articleshow/84877162.cms||Rema Nagarajan

According to police, the two men, including the arrested accused, Anil Dubey (35), a former manager at the bank, who were known to the victims, headed straight for the locker. They threatened the women and forced the manager, Yogita Vartak, to open the locker. As the men filled two bags with cash and gold and were about to flee, the women raised an alarm. One of the accused pulled out a razor and slashed Vartak’s neck. She collapsed on the floor. Cashier Sweta Devrukh too was assaulted on the neck with the razor. The cashier’s screams alerted passersby who nabbed Dubey and hand him over to the police, but his unidentified accomplice escaped. Police have recovered the bags containing the cash and gold from Dubey. The car in which he had arrived was found parked at a distance. While Vartak was declared dead on arrival at hospital, Devrukh is being treated at the primary health care centre and her condition is said to be serious. Both are residents of Vasai region.

---||Kochi||Kochi: Affordable luxury cruise in the offing||KOCHI: At a time when the tourism industry is struggling to survive due to the prevailing pandemic, a new seagoing party vessel is getting ready in Kochi to set sail with the hope of a positive turnaround in the sector. Classic Imperial, constructed by Neo Classic Cruise & Tours Pvt. Ltd., is a 50 metre-long and 11 metre-wide vessel in its final construction phase at a yard set up in land leased out at Ramanthuruthu in Vallarpadam. Built under the Indian Register of Shipping classification, the vessel is expected to set sail in December. Though the construction began in March 2020 with a deadline of 10 months, the lockdown and the pandemic affected the work, forcing the team to extend the deadline. Constructed at a cost of around Rs 10.6 crore featuring the latest sounds and lights systems along with a 60-tonne air conditioner and plush interiors, it can accommodate up to 150 passengers at a time. Nishyjith K John, managing director of the company, said the new vessel aims to give people a sea experience in Kochi at a low and affordable cost compared to regular cruises that are much more expensive and target the affluent class. He said there is a huge scope for cruise tourism in Kochi, and the vessel intends to explore the potential. “We conduct backwater cruises and sea cruises strictly as per rules and regulations of the Kerala Port Authority & Cochin Port Trust. We even have a mini vessel named Classic Paradise licensed to sail 16 km into the sea. It was my dream to build a more premium seagoing vessel as there is a huge demand for cruise tourism. The pandemic affected the work, but we hope to get the vessel ready to sail before the New Year,” John said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/affordable-luxury-cruise-in-the-offing/articleshow/84871976.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

While Zeeshan Ali was appointed as amicus curiae, special counsel Kartik Shukul pleaded on the Maharashtra government’s behalf.According to Dogra, who appeared in person, such incidents are rampant in Chandrapur and therefore, there is an urgent need now to hold the state machinery accountable. She pointed out that there is a fault in the collection of data regarding the number of human deaths actually caused by dangerous animals like tigers, leopards and sloth bears. There’s also a palpable lacuna in identifying culprit animals and this has led to unwarranted capturing of innocent tigers, leopards and bears, she pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/clarify-on-54-firs-on-human-deaths-due-to-wildlife-attack-hc/articleshow/84869732.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Malls, theatres in Mumbai to open, longer hours for shops, eateries||MUMBAI: With Covid cases in Maharashtra plateauing for over a month now, the state government on Thursday approved easing of curbs in 25 of 36 districts, including reopening malls and multiplexes, extending hours for restaurants and shops, and permitting dining out on weekends. The government will also relax the limit for gatherings at social and cultural events, but all restrictions will continue to apply on Sundays. The 25 districts where relaxations will be effective include Mumbai, Thane, Nashik and Nagpur where Covid-19 indicators like positivity rate and case growth rate are lower than the state’s average. The remaining 11 districts—Pune, Solapur, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Raigad, Palghar, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Beed and Ahmednagar—have a higher weekly positivity rate and case growth rate than the state average. A decision on rolling back restrictions was taken in a meeting with the Covid task force chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday. A formal order providing details of relaxations is expected in a day or two, said officials. Health minister Rajesh Tope who attended the meeting said shop timings will be extended from 4pm to 8pm and dining-in at bars and restaurants allowed for longer hours at 50% capacity. Non-essential shops as well as restaurants may be allowed to stay open till 4pm on Saturday. Sunday restrictions will continue. The guest limit for social and cultural events will also be increased. “It has also been agreed to allow malls, theatres to open at 50% capacity. The state will also be insisting that shop owners ensure their staffers are fully vaccinated. The government will also discourage the use of AC (air-conditioning) where large groups of people have been allowed like wedding halls. It is better for establishments to open their windows and allow for better circulation,” said Tope. However, there is no consensus within the government on allowing the general public to use local trains. A decision will be taken on it after a meeting with railway officials. “There was a suggestion that fully vaccinated people should be allowed to board the local trains, but checking of passengers will require huge manpower. Concerns were also raised regarding the rise in cases in Kerala and so it was decided to push train travel back for some more weeks,” said Tope. “Several rounds of discussions were held before finalising the restrictions. We are closely monitoring any surge related to the third wave and preparing for it also, but economic relief had to be extended to the business community,” said Tope. As per the Covid update, the weekly positivity of the state was 3.8% and weekly growth rate as on June 27 was 0.11%. However, some districts like Satara are at 8% weekly positivity and a growth rate of 0.44%, the highest in the state. “Some of the districts where relaxations will not be given are still a cause of concern for us. If required, restrictions may be further tightened in those districts,” said Tope. Officials quoted Thackeray as saying authorities should ensure that guidelines to be followed by establishments are complied with strictly so that relaxations do not lead to a surge in cases. Tope said the state government is also trying to vaccinate at a faster speed to reduce the severity of a potential third wave.

The Lok Adalat Day will be observed on August 1 at the lower, trial and high courts on August 1. The state revenue and forest department too has issued a government resolution citing high number of pending cases related to land acquisition and advised to get maximum cases resolved on Lok Adalat Day. This will ensure that in cases where the state has to pay compensation, the interest will be less. Even home department’s deputy secretary Sanjay Khedekar has a communicated to all police commissioners as well the superintendents of police to ensure police bandobast for Lok Adalats that are set to witness high number of land acquisition matters. The bandobast has been ordered to avoid any friction or law and order situation between the rival parties turning up for mediation. HC assistant government pleader Abhijit Phule, who has been closing working on the subject, said, “It is priority of the state government to resolve land acquisition reference cases and motor accident claim tribunal cases on priority.” During the Lok Adalats held in the past four years, the Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has successfully resolved about 6,000 cases. Each year, on an average, four to five Lok Adalats are held at the taluka, district and high court levels. However, due to Covid-19 related restrictions, the numbers of Lok Adalats have been limited to one or two. Assistant government pleader Bhushan Virdhe said, “For the upcoming Lok Adalat, we are lining up at least 500 cases through counselling and mediation at the HC. The number of cases have been limited due to Covid-19 norms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/try-resolve-most-land-acquisition-cases-state/articleshow/84866750.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The accused, Mohammad Naushad, a labourer, was arrested on Wednesday evening after his father went to police station in Dhanora area and filed a complaint against him. During investigation, the mother of the child, Nazrana, told police that her husband was adamant on selling their child. She also claimed that Naushad was an alcohol addict and wanted money for gambling to become rich. “She was against this decision and there used to have regular fights between them over it. On Tuesday afternoon, Naushad sent Nazrana to borrow a phone charger from a neighbour in Dhanora Mandi area. She became suspicious and returned quickly. And she caught Naushad choking the child, who was unconscious by then,” a police officer said. Nazrana rushed her son to a hospital, but doctors declared the child dead on arrival. It was then that Naushad’s angry father went to police station and got an FIR registered. Station house officer (SHO) Jaiveer Singh said, “The couple got married four years ago. They had two children. Naushad is a labourer and addicted to alcohol. He is a fond of gambling too. To get rid of his poverty, he wanted to sell his son. When he could not find a buyer, he choked his one-year-old child to death in frustration.” The SHO added, “A case has been registered. The accused has been sent to jail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-tries-to-sell-his-toddler-for-rs-3l-kills-him-in-anger-when-no-one-comes-forward/articleshow/84869750.cms||Harveer Dabas

In an old inspection report presented to management council on Thursday, MU said there were deficiencies pointed out by inspection committees in 32 out of 56 engineering colleges that were inspected in 2017-18. A year later, 31 of the 54 engineering colleges that were inspected had some deficiency that was noted by the expert committee. “The laxity of the university and its administration is evident as inspections were carried out but the management council was not informed and no action was taken,” said management council member Vaibhav Narawde. “It is sad that despite deficiencies, thousands of students would have suffered, and yet paid entire fees because of non-action by MU.” Most colleges do not have requisite infrastructure as prescribed by All-India Council for Technical Education in terms of number of labs or classrooms. In many cases, colleges did not have enough faculty, violating prescribed student-teacher ratio. Other management council members noted that the matter came to light as it came up during the state’s session as some members pressed on the need to inspect engineering colleges. Higher & technical education minister Uday Samant wrote to MU to seek details regarding technical colleges and the last inspection carried out, and action taken against colleges where deficiencies were noted. “While inspections were carried out and detailed reports were submitted, MU merely sat on the documents, allowing colleges to continue business despite deficiencies,” said a senior MC member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-university-will-act-against-32-engg-colleges-inspected-in-2017-18/articleshow/84876479.cms||---

Following the orders of the Dehradun municipal commissioner, Vinay Shankar Pandey, the officials from DMC had carried out a survey of hostels active in the city in nearly 20 localities. During the survey, the officials found that a number of residential properties have been converted into hostels for commercial purposes, while the tax being charged from them is for residential properties. The officials said that the sporadic increase in the number of hostels active in the city has made it unsafe for people living around these hostels and many of them do not get the police verification done. Dehradun police have also initiated a drive to create awareness among the property owners to get tenant verification done on priority. The matters become more crucial for hostels with students and professionals staying from different parts of the country. The localities which have maximum numbers of such hostels include Prem Nagar, Thakurpur, Shyampur village, Suddhowala, Clement town, Subhash Nagar, Defence Colony, Mussoorie Road, Patel Nagar and Vasant Vihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/crackdown-on-unauthorised-hostels-now-dmc-to-charge-commercial-tax/articleshow/84869783.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot: Protection of big cats is paramount for govt||JAIPUR: As Ranthambore National Park (RNP) and Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) are witnessing a healthy growth in the number of big cats in the wild, the state government and forest department on the occasion of International Tiger Day expressed their commitment for their protection. In June, the tiger count breached the century mark in the state recording a total of 104 big cats. The two major tiger reserves, Ranthambore and Sariska, house 72 and 23 big cats, respectively, Kailadevi reserve houses four tigers, Dholpur (3) and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) and Ramgarh resrve one each. On the occasion chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted, “On InternationalTigerDay, our resolve to protect this magnificent animal only grows stronger.We need to raise awareness about tiger conservation & protection of their natural habitat. Former PM Indira Gandhi ji’s Project Tiger initiative was a significant step towards this goal.” In the past three years, the births of 36 tiger cubs have been recorded and Rajasthan now has the ninth highest population of big cats among all states. STR chief conservator of forests (CCF) RN Meena said, “The population of big cats has doubled in a decade at Sariska, where the country's first tiger reintroduction plan was launched. Our team has responsibly taken a challenge of habitat improvement after relocating villages, situated inside the reserve . Similarly, for effective monitoring plans are afoot to develop more tourism zones in the park.” After a proposal to upgrade Ramgargh Vishdhari Sanctuary to a tiger reserve recently received approval from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), the park managers at RNP are hoping for better tiger management in future. A forest official said, “The RNP is witnessing the highest number of population in history. The government had announced plans to develop the sanctuary as a tiger reserve to provide additional habitat to Ranthambore tigers, improve ecosystem and strengthen tourism.”  NTCA member Diya Kumari said, “A 4-member committee is surveying the sanctuary and will submit a report after 30 days to explore its suitability to be converted into a tiger reserve. The development of the reserve should be carried out in a planned manner to attract potential tourists to the district and state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/protection-of-big-cats-is-paramount-for-govt-cm/articleshow/84874471.cms||---

The parents have pointed out that it will put their children's lives at risk while the school owners have stressed that schools being closed for a long time affects the child's education. TOI spoke to people with expertise in different fields on the subject. “It is a very good decision because in the past 1.5 years, students have not been in their regular school routine. They are being exposed to screen time for several hours daily, which is harmful, and constantly being confined to home has made them inactive. The schools need to start with offline classes because it is not possible to complete the academic syllabus of secondary classes. I also appeal to the government to announce guidelines for boarding schools as well,” said DS Mann, senior vice-president of the Principals Progressive Schools’ Association (Uttarakhand). When asked about the risk of Covid-19, he replied, “Currently, one only has apprehension that a possible third wave might come. And even if it comes, how long does it take to close down the schools? It can be done overnight.” “We are also looking forward to the school reopening. When you speak particularly about girl students, there have been numerous cases in the last 1.5 years in Uttarakhand, where girls have dropped out from their schools. There is only a possible fear of the third wave and it would be great if the SOPs are strictly followed by the schools," said Pushplata Rawat, an expert in child education and state coordinator of Room to Read NGO. "It is important for schools to reopen as soon as possible because it is not only about a child’s education, even the socio-economic and emotional wellbeing gets affected,” Rawat added. “It is not advisable for children to stay at homes for such a long time and continue to get exposed to mobile or computer screens for 3-4 hours daily. It definitely affects their eyes. But, why should we risk their lives against the third Covid wave. Even today, the Covid cases are rising in many states. Also, schools could have waited to reopen till September when most experts predict a fresh wave may arrive,” said Sunita Sah, a Doon-based child expert doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/plan-to-reopen-schools-for-classes-vi-to-vii-evokes-mixed-response/articleshow/84869804.cms||Mohammad Anab

Both victims are women. Locals nabbed one of the robbers, a former manager of the bank and currently working as a manager in another private sector bank in Naigaon, and handed him over to the police. Police said the robbers struck at the bank, located close to Virar railway station, around 8pm. The manager, Yogita Vartak, and cashier, Sweta Devrukh, were inside the bank with shutters half down. The other staffers had left for the day around 7.30pm, said Virar police inspector Suresh Warade. An officer at the crime scene said the manager and cashier were winding up when the duo barged into the bank, which is located on the ground floor. According to police, the two men, including the arrested accused, Anil Dubey (35), who were known to the victims, headed straight for the locker. They threatened the women and forced Vartak to open the locker. As the men filled two bags with cash and gold and were about to flee, the women raised an alarm. One of the accused pulled out a razor and slashed Vartak’s neck. She collapsed on the floor. Devrukh too was assaulted on the neck with the razor.The cashier’s screams alerted passersby on the busy road who managed to nab Dubey and hand him over to the police, but his unidentified accomplice escaped in the melee. Police have recovered the bags containing the cash and gold from Dubey. The car in which he had arrived was found parked at a distance. While Vartak was declared dead on arrival at the nearby Sanjeevani hospital, Devrukh is being treated at the primary health care centre and her condition is said to be serious. Both are residents of Vasai region. Preliminary investigations found Dubey used to work as a manager in the ICICI bank branch in Virar till a few years ago. Police said Dubey knew about the functioning of the bank and was aware that employees stayed back till late during the end of each month for accounting related work. Police are examining footage from the bank’s closed circuit television (CCTV). The security guard is also being questioned. It is not known if the security guard was away when the men entered the bank. The process of registering the FIR was underway at the time of going to press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bank-robbers-kill-manager-injure-cashier-as-both-women-raise-alarm/articleshow/84876489.cms||Sandhya Nair

According to the FIR, a few men arrived at a roadside shop in Dariyapur village under Kotwali (rural) and asked for paan and cigarettes. They sought a Rs 20 credit which the shopkeeper, Nisar Ahmed, declined. As the customers abused the shopkeeper, his son Afsar, a BSF jawan, also joined the tussle. The firing that followed left the jawan and his father injured. The jawan’s father died the next day in hospital. No one knew the whereabouts of the accused, except a red car for the clue.Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar Singh said that it was difficult to nab the killers as there was no CCTV footage and no other clue.“No one knew their names. They had never been seen nearby. All we knew was that a red Alto car was used in the crime. The team of cops then decided to look out for all the red Alto cars in the city. Scores of red car owners were interrogated for over a week. With no lead, we decided to move to the borders. Near the Noida border, we found a red car’s scrap in a junkyard. The junk dealer helped us and we managed to get hold of the four of nine accused on Thursday,” added the SSP.The car, in pieces, along with the gun used in the crime was also recovered.“Those arrested include Pankaj Valmiki, Amit Valmiki, Akash and Bhura.

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: In many districts, private hospitals play minimal role in vax drive||PUNE: At least 23 state districts have reported extremely low participation by private hospitals (0-10% doses of the total doses given) in the Covid vaccination programme. The data on their role is since May 1, when the liberalised pricing and accelerated national vaccination strategy came into force. Numbers show that in Beed, Jalna, Parbhani, Nandurbar and Osmanabad, government centres have administered nearly 100% of all the vaccine doses. But in major cities like Pune and Mumbai private hospitals have administered 48% and 54% of the total doses respectively since May 1, despite the drop in footfalls they saw when the government announced free jabs at government centres from June 21. In the rural areas, many seem to be preferring the free jabs. Private hospitals in these parts have also been impacted by the pricing structure, officials said. A state official said, "Many districts are showing very low private sector participation because private hospitals in these rural regions have no incentive left to be engaged in the drive, especially after the Rs 150 service charge cap on each dose administered.” The Centre is procuring 75% of the vaccines being produced by the manufacturers in the country. Domestic vaccine manufacturers can also provide vaccines directly to private hospitals (25% of monthly production) once they place orders on CoWIN. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle (which includes Pune, Satara and Solapur districts) said, “Private hospitals in small cities may not be participating in the drive due to lack of demand for paid jabs and incentives. Larger private hospitals have the freedom to directly purchase from manufacturers through CoWIN, while smaller hospitals can route an aggregated order through the state government on CoWIN, and are supplied the vaccines through state or corporation delivery channels. If many of the private sites are not willing to participate in the drive, they cannot be forced." Deshmukh said private hospitals in metros are the ones making most of the vaccine purchases. "We recently received an order of about 32,000 doses for smaller private hospitals in Pune circle, out of which a large chunk - 22,500 - had been ordered by Pune’s private hospitals. The rest were from Satara and Solapur. Bigger cities have a higher demand for paid vaccination than the smaller ones." He also said demand from corporates was also boosting private sector drives in the big cities. Experts said the trend raises questions on vaccine inequity as bigger, and richer, cities like Pune and Mumbai seem to have greater access to the private sector vaccine quota than smaller districts. R Ramakumar, an economist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), who has been closely tracking Covid vaccination, said, “Per capita income in cities like Mumbai and Pune is higher and they have a higher proportion of those who are likely to be able to afford vaccine prices at private hospitals. Also, these are industrial and commercial centres with large companies that place bulk paid orders to vaccinate their employees. The absence of higher levels of income, large private hospitals and large commercial activity, in districts like Beed, could mean close to zero demand for paid vaccination." Ramakumar said such factors could be increasing vaccine inequity in the state, as a bulk of doses allocated by the Centre for the private sector in Maharashtra may be going only to bigger cities, where demand for paid jabs is relatively high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/in-many-districts-pvt-hospitals-play-minimal-role-in-vax-drive/articleshow/84884186.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: GPS watch data shows improved field presence||CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh municipal corporation recorded 90% to 95% presence of sanitation and other field employees in their respective allotted areas in May and June. All these employees have been given GPS human tracking watches and their salaries and payments are being made strictly according to the watch data. In April, the general house of the municipal corporation had unanimously decided to ensure complete adherence of orders to tie GPS enabled watches during work hours. Thereafter, the watches were made mandatory for eligible employees. Officials concerned were instructed to pay salaries of the field staff according to their location and presence in their respective areas. The data, a copy of which is with TOI, shows that daily monitoring of each employee resulted in drastic improvement in their field presence. The data shows that 4,000 field employees were allotted GPS-enabled watches in May. Of these, 1,067 were regular employees of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, 1,111 were working on contractual basis, 1,431 were outsourced employees and remaining 391 were working on daily wages. In June, 3,999 employees were given watches, out of which 119 were in the category of regular employees, 965 were contractual, 1,441 were outsourced and 394 were daily wagers. All these employees belong to different departments like sanitation, enforcement, electrical, horticulture, public health, building and roads etc. Data also shows that in May, 203 devices were replaced due to technical faults and in June, 153 were replaced. Besides, lost cases of 16 devices were reported before senior MC officers. “Due to the multiple technical issues, we had to replace the watches. Non-charging of battery, issues with battery, issues in operating the watches were some of such reasons,” sources said. Falling in line In the first month after the watches were made compulsory in May, around 110 employees of the sanitation wing were found missing for a few days. In June, the number decreased to around 40. Their salaries for days absent was cut and remaining salary was given to them with a strict injunction to remain present every day in the field or report immediately to their senior officer if the watches had any technical problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gps-watch-data-shows-imroved-field-presence/articleshow/84872025.cms||Deepak Yadav

Minister for the zoo, animal husbandry and dairy development J Chinchurani told the assembly on Thursday that training is provided to all zookeepers regularly, and all cage designs follow the Central zoo authority mandates. Cages are designed in a way that the zookeepers would not have to come into direct contact with animals, the minister said. While responding to a query on the safety of zookeepers, the minister said all measures are in place to ensure their safety, and the government is mulling constituting an expert committee for a probe. Recently Harshad, a 44-year-old zookeeper entrusted with the care of reptiles, died after getting bitten by a king cobra while he was cleaning the back cage. Due to the lockdown, cobras are housed in the back shelter. The zoo authorities said Harshad might have got bitten while cleaning the back cage. According to the staff, the enclosure has an exhibit enclosure, a keeper’s cabin and a back cage. The back cage, a wire mesh structure fitted with a shutter, is set on a raised platform behind the exhibit enclosure. When the exhibit enclosure needs cleaning, the snake is guided to the back cage by lifting the shutter. In the same way, the opening and closing of the shutter are designed to guide the snake back and forth. The authorities had said Harshad might have put his hand inside the cage without guiding the snake out. In the wake of the recent tragedy, zookeepers in charge of snake enclosures are instructed to always work in the presence of a supervisor. The authorities also directed the keepers that if any of them work alone in an enclosure beyond the stipulated schedule, they should promptly inform their immediate supervisor. Harshad, who lay unconscious after being bitten by the king cobra, was later spotted by another zookeeper returning after work in the nearby bear enclosure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-mulls-expert-panel-to-probe-zookeepers-death/articleshow/84872063.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a bid to increase the share, the state industry department has started ‘Niryatak Bano’ (become an exporter) initiative and set a target to create over 22,000 exporters. Even though goods are exported from Rajasthan, many manufacturers sell their products to traders based in other states. The indirect shipment route deprives not only the manufacturers but the state the full benefits of the exports. “Despite the challenges of the pandemic Rajasthan registered a 5% increase in exports during year 2020-21. We are now targeting to create 22000 exporters through the Niryatak Bano inititive,” said Parsadi lal Meena, state Industries minister. The state has a large number of micro, small and medium industries that contribute to majority of the existing exports from the state. However, there are a significant number of MSMEs yet to export directly. Through the initiative, the state government seeks to handhold aspiring exporters through the documentation process and assist them to become exporters. Ashutosh Pednekar, secretary Industries and MD RIICO, said, “Various departments of the state and Central government associated with exports have been brought under a single platform through this mission. The entrepreneurs looking to start shipments can log in the portal of the mission and the concerning RIICO or industries department office will assist them through the process.” He said through the campaign, the industries department will resolve complications and help entrepreneurs. “Several reputed online marketing platforms and even banking services have been associated with the campaign to facilitate the entrepreneurs,” added Pednekar. The share of direct exports Rajasthan maybe small, but exports have increased despite Covid situation. Archana Singh, commissioner, Industries, said, “On Export Preparedness Index, Rajasthan secured 4th position in country and first among the landlocked states. The infrastructure is ready there and entrepreneurs must take advantage of it.” The state government has set up ‘One Stop Shop’ where an entrepreneur can get necessary clearances from 14 departments under one roof. Aspiring exporters need to use these facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-eyes-creation-of-22k-more-exporters/articleshow/84874514.cms||---
---||Kochi||Corp may revive decade-old housing project at Poonkulam||Thiruvananthapuram: More than a decade after the city corporation launched a housing scheme under Basic Services to Urban Poor (BSUP) at Poonkulam, the civic body is planning to revive the project. It has decided to engage an external agency the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram to conduct a stability audit on the construction that had not proceeded since 2010. The civic body had signed an agreement with accredited agency Nirmithi Kendra in 2008 for Rs 2.96 crore. The project included 120 houses in six blocks along with basic facilities for the community. In 2009, the corporation paid Rs 39.32 lakhs in advance. Works up to the lintel on the third floor of the first block, and the plinth beam of the second block were completed. The engineering wing has communicated that the structures done almost a decade ago will have to be certified for stability if works need to be resumed. While the project was initially slated to be completed at Rs 2 crore, the cost was revised to Rs 9 crore by 2014. The cost will further rise, and the corporation has decided to levy the amount required for stability certification from the agency entrusted with the construction in 2008. Poonkulam was one of the 23 colonies included under the BSUP. The project aimed at integrated provision of basic services and amenities and provided for housing, roads, water supply, street lights, solid waste management and anganwadis. About Rs 1.2 lakh was granted for houses with two rooms, kitchen and toilet ranging 30 sq m to 60 sq m plinth area with 12% beneficiary contribution. Projects with a total estimate of Rs 208 crore were planned to be implemented in four phases. While 23 colonies with brand new apartments were to be constructed across various wards as per the plan, by 2015 when the deadline ended, not even less than half of the target had been covered. The BSUP scheme could be only implemented partially in five colonies Rajaji Nagar, Karimadom, Kannammoola, Kalladimukham and Poonkulam till 2015. Out of 28 blocks at Karimadom Colony, 12 blocks were dropped. Seven blocks had been completed, and the corporation had to seek permission to complete the ongoing work on nine blocks. Construction of colonies in 13 coastal wards too had to be dropped. At Kannamoola, seven blocks out of the total 23 blocks had been completed in 2015, and no further construction was initiated. The city corporation faced a dilemma at Poonkulam since construction had reached a stage where the buildings lacked roofing. As regarding the projects meant for housing colonies at Thycaud and Kadakampally, the city corporation could not even finalise the list of beneficiaries. At Rajiv Nagar Colony, 22 blocks out of the total 30 blocks were completed in 2015 and no work would be initiated on the remaining blocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-may-revive-decade-old-housing-project-at-poonkulam/articleshow/84872037.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: In many districts, private hospitals play minimal role in vax drive||PUNE: At least 23 state districts have reported extremely low participation by private hospitals (0-10% doses of the total doses given) in the Covid vaccination programme. The data on their role is since May 1, when the liberalised pricing and accelerated national vaccination strategy came into force. Numbers show that in Beed, Jalna, Parbhani, Nandurbar and Osmanabad, government centres have administered nearly 100% of all the vaccine doses. But in major cities like Pune and Mumbai private hospitals have administered 48% and 54% of the total doses respectively since May 1, despite the drop in footfalls they saw when the government announced free jabs at government centres from June 21. In the rural areas, many seem to be preferring the free jabs. Private hospitals in these parts have also been impacted by the pricing structure, officials said. A state official said, "Many districts are showing very low private sector participation because private hospitals in these rural regions have no incentive left to be engaged in the drive, especially after the Rs 150 service charge cap on each dose administered.” The Centre is procuring 75% of the vaccines being produced by the manufacturers in the country. Domestic vaccine manufacturers can also provide vaccines directly to private hospitals (25% of monthly production) once they place orders on CoWIN. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle (which includes Pune, Satara and Solapur districts) said, “Private hospitals in small cities may not be participating in the drive due to lack of demand for paid jabs and incentives. Larger private hospitals have the freedom to directly purchase from manufacturers through CoWIN, while smaller hospitals can route an aggregated order through the state government on CoWIN, and are supplied the vaccines through state or corporation delivery channels. If many of the private sites are not willing to participate in the drive, they cannot be forced." Deshmukh said private hospitals in metros are the ones making most of the vaccine purchases. "We recently received an order of about 32,000 doses for smaller private hospitals in Pune circle, out of which a large chunk - 22,500 - had been ordered by Pune’s private hospitals. The rest were from Satara and Solapur. Bigger cities have a higher demand for paid vaccination than the smaller ones." He also said demand from corporates was also boosting private sector drives in the big cities. Experts said the trend raises questions on vaccine inequity as bigger, and richer, cities like Pune and Mumbai seem to have greater access to the private sector vaccine quota than smaller districts. R Ramakumar, an economist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), who has been closely tracking Covid vaccination, said, “Per capita income in cities like Mumbai and Pune is higher and they have a higher proportion of those who are likely to be able to afford vaccine prices at private hospitals. Also, these are industrial and commercial centres with large companies that place bulk paid orders to vaccinate their employees. The absence of higher levels of income, large private hospitals and large commercial activity, in districts like Beed, could mean close to zero demand for paid vaccination." Ramakumar said such factors could be increasing vaccine inequity in the state, as a bulk of doses allocated by the Centre for the private sector in Maharashtra may be going only to bigger cities, where demand for paid jabs is relatively high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-many-districts-pvt-hospitals-play-minimal-role-in-vax-drive/articleshow/84874522.cms||Neha Madaan

The reconstructed building would be renamed Sardar Kulwant Singh Kohli Vidyapeeth Vidyarthi Bhavan. Members stated, “Why should the students’ centre be renamed to the owner of a businessman who ran a hotel and bar?

In March, Chopra had lodged a complaint over her obscene videos being published online. “The principles of natural justice would entail the applicant to be given a fair and impartial opportunity to appear before the investigation officer without causing prejudice to her and be informed about the entire case against her or otherwise so as to enable her to cooperate and assist in the investigation process without fear of arrest,” the anticipatory bail plea said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-model-sherlyn-chopras-plea-for-pre-arrest-bail-rejected/articleshow/84874562.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||In a first, approves banquet facility in Sec 47||CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation is all set to bring to the city its first banquet hall, as the general house on Thursday discussed and approved the agenda item for the project of around Rs 76 crore in Sector 47. It will come up on 1.5 acres where old Jung Ghar is situated, opposite the main market of the sector. As per the approved project, the current structure will be demolished. Since the civic body has been facing acute financial crunch, the general house approved that they request for either dedicated funds or the project be handed over to the engineering department of the Chandigarh administration for construction. As per the initial drawings and plan, three banquet halls will come up on the ground floor of the site, with a capacity of around 800, 300 and 200 persons. The project has been planned in a manner that three functions can be held simultaneously. Besides, three floors of underground parking facility with a capacity of 350 vehicles is also part of the project. Former city mayor and BJP councillor Davesh Moudgil who has been taking up this matter for long, said, “The matter was taken up with the chief architect of the Chandigarh administration, who approved and issued two sets of drawings. A gymnasium, library, yoga and meditation centre, senior citizens’ hall, and open-air rooftop facility are some of the key features of the project, which will help the city residents. This unique project will also bring in a huge amount of revenue, which is currently going to neighbouring Punjab due to unavailability of a banquet hall in Chandigarh.” Survey doneThe engineering department has conducted a survey of the site to assess its approach roads, sanitation facilities, underground services, among others. Since it’s a big project, infrastructure facilities are crucial besides the banquet halls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-a-first-mc-approves-banquet-facility-in-sec-47/articleshow/84872085.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: As 15% fee cut order comes, parents seek schools’ audit||Mumbai: Even as the state ordered private schools to cut fees by 15% this year, parents’ bodies have called for a financial audit of these schools, which can result in a higher fee reduction. Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) (Amendment) Act, 2018, calls for periodical audit of schools. “The state has to audit accounts of private schools and upload balance-sheets online, but nothing is being done,” said Prasad Tulaskar, who was among parents who filed a special leave petition in Supreme Court against a March order of Bombay high court staying the state GR of May 8, 2020, on fee hike. Tulaskar said schools not making fee structures public should not be allowed to hike fees. “If schools are audited, balance-sheets will reveal they can further reduce fees,” said Tulaskar. On Wednesday, the state cabinet decided to direct private schools to cut fees by 15% in 2021-22. While some schools have reduced fees, many have denied online access to students whose fees are pending. Advocate Anubha Sahai of India Wide Parents’ Association said they have been demanding an audit of private schools for long. “Some private schools can offer a 30-40% fee cut, especially during the pandemic,” said Sahai. Parents’ bodies have been demanding an amendment to the Fee Regulation Act which they say is anti-parents and management-friendly. Parent-Teachers’ Associations (PTAs) role in deciding fee hikes in schools should be done away with. “Parents as members do not protest against a fee hike. Teachers as members have to be in favour of a fee hike. So any fee hike in schools gets approval without much resistance,” said Tulaskar. Parents felt the state’s directives to schools in the absence of an ordinance had no meaning. Last year in May, the state’s GR on not hiking fees during the pandemic was challenged in court. “The state has not been able to implement last year’s GRs. On what basis is it coming out with fresh notifications this year that have no legal sanctity, asked a parent. Parents continue to knock on Bombay high court doors over not allowing children to attend online classes over fee issues. While the state education department is looking at complaints by parents of boards like CBSE and ICSE, the state is still to act on schools affiliated to Maharashtra board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-15-fee-cut-order-comes-parents-seek-schools-audit/articleshow/84876547.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Once a proud school owner, now a grocer||HYDERABAD: After successfully running a school for more than two decades, life has turned upside down for S Mallesham. Proud owner of a school until Covid-19 struck last year, he had to open a small grocery store for survival. Mallesham is one among the hundreds of school owners who have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Mallesham has rented out his Sircilla school building for some financial relief. “I can no longer afford to run a school,” he told TOI. His school-- Surya English Medium School, had about 220 students during the last academic year. However, with majority of them not paying fees, he was forced to borrow money to keep the school up and running. “Now I have a debt running into several lakhs,” he said, adding how it was tough to keep the school running during the academic year 2020-21. “I was in the hope that students would start paying fees once physical classes start, but with Covid-19 disrupting this academic year as well, all my hopes dashed. Further, no one is ready to invest anymore,” said Mallesham, who has been running the school since 2000. TOI got in touch with several other budget school managements, who were forced to shut shop during the pandemic, owing to severe financial crisis during the last and current academic years. In the state, about 1,500 budget schools have met with the same fate and thousands of others are on verge of closure as there are not many new admissions for the academic year 2021-22. “I couldn’t even pay rent of my building in the last one year or so, as 60% to 70% students are not paying fees. Hoping that situation will slowly improve, I borrowed money from others. But, now I am no more able to run my school,” said Samboji Shekhar, correspondent, Mother Teresa School, Karimnagar. Samboji ShekharHe said that 200 students were enrolled in his school during the last academic year and that most of them have sought admission in a government school this year. Shekhar now runs a marriage bureau as the school has Rs 30 lakh debt to clear. Likewise, Vijay Pal Reddy, one of the promoters of Green Sedge High School, Huzurabad, is now working under a contractor for Rs 25,000 salary per month. Reddy said the directors had no option except to close the school as they are not even able to pay rent or EMIs as parents were not paying the fee dues. They even had to sell a school bus to repay a part of the loan—Rs 5 lakh. “One of our director’s plot, which was pledged as bank surety, was auctioned off by the bank and he couldn’t digest it and died of a heart attack. Another director passed away due to Covid-19 infection,” he said. Left with no alternative, they had shut the schools and even got a closure letter. “We had 500 students enrolled with us at the time of closure. Now I have shifted to Hyderabad with my family and works under a contractor to make ends meet,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/once-a-proud-school-owner-now-a-grocer/articleshow/84876601.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Rain, floods skew Covid positivity rates in nearly 10 districts||PUNE: Bad weather brought down Covid testing in 10 to 12 districts, mainly in western Maharashtra and the Konkan region, and went on to affect their overall weekly positivity rates, officials from the public health department said on Thursday. Solapur, for example, collected 49,580 samples for testing this week. Last week, it had collected 95,590. "Solapur's weekly positivity rate now is 6.8%, compared to 3.6% it had the week before," a health official said. Officials said testing was "definitely" impacted in districts that experienced heavy showers and flooding recently. Kolhapur, among the worst-hit, carried out 60,083 tests, compared to the 1,19,236 it had done last week. The situation is expected to improve. "Flood waters are receding. All labs have now been asked to ramp up testing again," an official with the public health department said. Due to the low testing and the resultant rise in positivity rates, some of the regions (including Solapur and Beed) were also flagged as districts of concern. But officials explained the high positivity rates were actually the result of low sample collection, due to bad weather. “Certain areas of Pandharpur and Malshiras [both in Solapur] had some active cases, but the district has not been on the radar for the last one month. We have been maintaining a WPR of 3.5%-3.8%. This week it has risen to 6.8%," an official said, adding that only about 5,000 to 6,000 tests were conducted there due to the heavy rain. Plans are now on to increase the number to 12,000 tests. Officials from the Pune divisional commissioner's office said heavy rain has also affected contact tracing, with much of the surveillance now relying on random testing. "Overall testing has dipped across Pune division, which is worrying. But overall positivity in districts in western Maharashtra has come down, as noticed in northern Maharashtra," a senior official said. The Centre has already issued a letter to all states to adopt the strategy of test, track, treat and vaccinate. It has also called for strict adherence to Covid precautions. "We have directed all districts to ramp up testing as the tests per million number is low in 26 districts, compared to the state average. The tests per million for the week in the state was 3.65 lakh and only nine districts have registered more than that number," an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rain-floods-skew-positivity-rates-in-nearly-10-districts/articleshow/84874601.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Consider plea for refund of exam fee: Bombay HC to state board||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday directed the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education to consider a plea for refund of fees taken from students for the SSC and HSC exams, which were eventually cancelled. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni heard a PIL by Pratapsing Chopdar (80), a retired principal of a school in Miraj, Sangli district, that despite cancellation of both exams the fees had not been refunded. Chopdar’s petition said parents have struggled to pay for their children’s education. “Even in prevailing Covid-19 since March 2020 many parents are facing more financial difficulties. Despite this, parents have deposited the fees. In such a situation, the board should decide on returning the fees,” said his June 22 letter to the board’s chairman. His petition said it is the duty of the state to refund the amount and non-refund would result in “unjust enrichment of the state’s instrumentality, which is entrusted with imparting education and certification of the same and not intended to be a profit-making corporation”. His advocate Manoj Shirsat said fees of Rs 420 for SSC and Rs 520 for HSC may be a meagre amount, but in rural areas it is “big hard earned money” for parents. He said “nearly Rs 150 crore is collected as exam fees”. Some 16 lakh SSC and 14 HSC students had enrolled for the exams. State advocate Bhupesh Samant said the fees is “a very nominal amount” and steps were taken for internal assessment and declaration of results. “Something else is also done which requires manpower, energy and the results were given,” he said. Shirsat said schools were tasked with internal assessment and to send marks to the board for result declaration. “Major expenses of answer papers, printing, et cetera, were avoided,” he said. The CJ said, “If they have undertaken measures, they are entitled to a certain fee.” Disposing of the PIL, the judges directed the board’s chairman to consider Chopdar’s representation by giving him an opportunity of hearing. In the event refund cannot be accepted, he shall pass a reasoned order. The judges directed the exercise to “be completed as earliest as possible and preferably within four weeks”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-to-state-board-consider-plea-for-refund-of-exam-fee-in-mumbai/articleshow/84874703.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Most children were rescued from buses and trains en route from Bihar and Jharkhand to Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The rescue is done with the help of local police by the BBA in several districts of the state especially in Jaipur and Udaipur. “The spread of vast network build over the years in Bihar and Jharkhand is helping us in providing leads. The leads are shared by the anti-human trafficking unit which accompanies us to raid the place or the transport,” said Manish Sharma, director of Victim Assistance, BBA. The trafficked children are as young as nine years to 18 years of age. The most common thread among them is extreme poverty and the allurement of a better life. “It is always astonishment that in a majority of the cases the children don’t even know that where they are heading to,” said Sharma, who expressed shock that at a time when travelling was minimal the trafficking of children didn’t show any decline. The rescued children are handed over to the social welfare department. Those whose parents give the consent that they can be at rehabilitate centre is kept by the BBA. The body has refused to share the names and details of the rescued children in the period due to undergoing the legal process. “Sending back a rescued child goes through a cumbersome process. In many cases, the parents or guardians didn’t respond for months delaying the process,” said an official. The shocking element is that many children rescued in the given period were re-rescued and sent back to their respective states by the authorities.

The long-pending issues that need to be addressed are water management, farming techniques, post-harvest management, new markets and farm producers organisations (FPOs).In the face of challenges such as changing climate, threat to sustainability, unproductive use of agro-inputs, depleting natural resources and increasing market competition, the necessity to chalk out futuristic solutions and implementation becomes vital and urgent.New varieties and hybrids of crops need to be developed based on the use of marker assisted breeding technology (MABT), bio and nanotechnologies to improve productivity, value addition and shelf-life with quality output as well as precision farming technologies for major crops, which would double the income for farmers. To achieve this, the government has to effectively intervene in farming practices, post- harvest management and creation of new integrated markets, upgrading and creating new agriculture institutions and varsities to improve the talent pool and human resources to support farming and allied industries.According to 10th Agriculture Census (2015-16) about 70% of the population of the state is dependent on farming and allied activities for their livelihood. In the light of shrinking farming area, which came down to 14% from 40%, farmers require continued support for enhanced crop husbandry, not only leading to self-sustainability, but also to maximising farm produce.A quantum leap in innovation in the current agricultural research system in the state is needed to focus more on society’s needs while taking into account vast changes due to globalisation, technological development and growing emphasis on value addition. To minimise the unit cost of production and maximise the yield per hectare, research should be undertaken.Equipping and monetising farmers appropriately will enable them to learn from the global knowledge market and compete with it in due course of time. Measures like research activities in climate change, sustainable soil health, precision farming, secondary agriculture and land management will further help to address the challenges of the 21st century.The change on the ground must begin with post-harvest management of the produce as still a substantial farm produce goes waste in warehouses, cold storage and other facilities. Chennai has vast warehousing, cold storage and other facilities, whereas the districts fall short on these. The infrastructure created in Chennai should be replicated to other second tier cities such as Coimbatore, Madurai, Trichy and in other district capitals to evenly distribute food. This will go a long way in achieving zero food wastage.The next step is to create integrated food markets that will have integrated food terminals and will include wholesale market for horticultural produce, farm produce and agri-related produce such as milk, fish, poultry and meat products. The terminal will also have cold storages, dry port, warehouses, ripening chambers for fruits, pack houses and value addition units and traditional food courts.The creation of such markets in the state will help farmers access a 24x7 market and their produce never to be chucked on the roadside for the want of price and a place to sell. Of course, the Uzhavar sandhais are a launch pad, but even if the sandhais are upgraded, whether there will be space for all farmers, and also if farmers are toiling in the farmlands will be able to find time during the day to sell his produce, is under question. Going forward, government needs to set up a market place where farmers can sell their produce anytime and can store his produce there. A paradigm shift is required to take the market place to another level to find his produce an innovative and constant market that gives him qualitative returns.Integrated markets or food terminals can play a pivotal role acting as a springboard for farmers in the export market. This integrated food market will also contain a farmers’ market where they can sell their produce and value-added goods in dedicated retail outlets. More than the government procurement outlets, where malpractice is rampant, these markets will infuse a sense of professionalism in how they sell their produce and get their payment on time. This will also encourage agri-based tourism and fuel export growth. At present, Tamil Nadu has 575 farm producers’ organisations (FPOs) and they have done well in developing agri-based industries and markets for various farm and farm-related products and aided in the development of cattle farming, horticulture, fisheries, forest and milk production. These organisations have succeeded in improving livelihoods of farmers, agricultural workers and the lease holders. These charitable, non-governmental and registered entities under the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983, are made up of the primary stakeholders and they are the direct beneficiaries. With support, monetary and technological, these FPOs will thrive and create appropriate markets and ensure industrialisation of agriculture. Also, it is the imperative to put in place the licensing and monitoring systems for organic produce for the benefit of the consumers.To equip farmers with improved technologies, institutions have to be upgraded and new ones should be set up. The Tamil Nadu government has announced a horticulture university at Jinoor in Krishnagiri and establishment of an agricultural varsity for the south by upgrading the existing agri college at Othakadai near Madurai and the proposed Dr Kalaignar Karunanidhi Agricultural University at Kumulur near Trichy. The government has also announced the renaming of the centre for organic farming at the Coimbatore Agricultural University after the organic farming stalwart Nammalvar — all of these institutions need to start functioning soon to address the huge shortfall in human resources servicing the agri sector. A separate university for organic farming to blend science and technology with traditional farming concepts would be a boon for the state.(The author is a journalist and a columnist based in the UK)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/what-tns-farm-budget-should-have/articleshow/84872121.cms||---

Ali recalled the day when he was rescued by the BBA activist from a bangle-making unit in the dark lanes of Delhi. “I was so scared that I thought I was captured by some other pimps who would torture me and force me to work long hours without rest at some other place,” he said, whose fear disappeared only after his parents arrived and assured him that he was in safe hands. Ali comes from a family of six members. His father works in a bangle factory and earns about Rs 2,000 per month. “Rest of my family resides in a small village in Bihar. The financial conditions of the family forced my parents to send me with my uncle to Delhi. I remember my uncle had promised my parents I will go to the school and will learn some skills to earn a good living.” His life changed upside down after his uncle sold him to a bangle making unit as a bonded labour. “Here I was made to work for more than 16 hours a day without any rest. I had never seen any school which was promised. Neither food was provided on time nor were they ever allowed to talk with my parents,” said Ali. He uses to get Rs 50 a week for working 100 hours a week. Narrating his tale, Ali said, “I had developed sores all over my face and mouth, as a result, I was down with high fever. He fell asleep at the workplace. My employer got so angry that he hit me with scissors.” After he was rescued, the BBA offered him a set at their child care home in Viratnagar, his family consented for the same. Here he was admitted to the non-formal education class. He picked up very fast and was admitted to a government school in the 4th standard. He surprised everyone by securing first division in the fourth standard. Thereafter he never looks back. Ali was awarded a laptop by the government for obtaining high marks in school. Participate in children’s day organized by bar council of India and met the Chief Justice of India. His mission is to make his native town Sitamarhi in Bihar child labour free. “I understand that my mission is not easy considering the scale of poverty in my town but I am committed to work on the ground and to bring out institutional changes in achieving my aim,” said Ali, who collaborates with different NGOs working in the field and provide them assistance in the documentation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/once-a-child-worker-ali-now-committed-fighting-social-evil/articleshow/84874603.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SIT seeks Waze testimony in builder extortion case linked to ex-top cop||Mumbai: A Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing an extortion case registered against former police commissioner Param Bir Singh, is likely to apply to a magistrate’s court seeking to record the testimony of the arrested former assistant police inspector Sachin Waze. Investigators have found five hours of recorded conversations in which an arrested builder with alleged links to Singh is heard talking of Waze spilling the beans on a minister.The conversations were recorded by developer and complainant Shyam Sundar Agarwal while meeting with Sanjay Punamiya on March 23 and April 3. Agarwal has accused Punamiya of using his connections with Singh to frame him in cases and extort money. Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap told the court on Thursday, “Information in the current case is highly classified and we cannot disclose it at this stage. This is just the tip of the iceberg. The claims (allegedly by Punamiya in conversation with Agarwal) on the political front are very serious.”He said 492 GB of data was retrieved from Punamiya’s phone for analysis. Jagtap said in one conversation, Punamiya is heard saying he had settled 1,000-1,500 MCOCA cases. Jagtap described the accused’s actions as “destroying the system with the help of some police officials.”“Waze se baat ho gayi hai, CBI ko andar gusaenge, teen char ministers ke naam lenge (a message has been sentWaze, CBI will enter, it will take a toll on 3-4 ministers,” is from another conversation. Police said Waze was in the custody of the National Investigation Authority (NIA) since March 13 in a case involving planting of explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's bungalow. Waze has backed Singh’s allegations against former home minister Anil Deshmukh and told the NIA court that Deshmukh had demanded Rs 2 crore in exchange for reinstating him in the force. Vaze’s letter also levels corruption allegations against Sena minister Anil Parab.Punamiya is heard saying the government will fall following Singh’s allegation against Deshmukh that he had asked for Rs 100 crore to be collected from bar owners. Punamiya boasts about his contacts and the likelihood of CBI taking over the case. He also assumes the responsibility of ensuring the fall of a prominent state minister and speaks about the possibility of Singh getting a posting in Delhi.Prosecutor Jagtap told the court, “the wanted accused are government servants and we need to call them for inquiry.” Rizwan Merchant, appearing for Punamiya, said the complainant, Agarwal, consented to settle the dispute. “You have voluntarily handed over a cheque of Rs 15.5 crore to me and now you are saying it was extortion. Without conducting any preliminary inquiry, police registered an FIR. This is a sham…by government of Maharashtra in tandem with the police department. We have nothing to do with Param Bir Singh,” said Merchant.Builder Punamiya and his associate Sunil Jain were produced before the 8th Metropolitan Magistrate court on Thursday and remanded to 7 days police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sit-seeks-waze-testimony-in-builder-extortion-case-linked-to-ex-top-cop/articleshow/84874656.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM urges Centre to release 50% of insured amount to flood-hit||Mumbai: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has urged Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to direct insurance companies to pay at least 50% of the insured amount to flood-affected citizens as immediate relief without waiting for the paper work to be completed. In a letter to Sitharaman, Thackeray said insurance companies should also accept the panchanama’s done by the revenue department officials as it may not be possible for the affected people to keep damaged items till the company staff arrives. A similar directive was given to the companies during the floods in Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala, said Thackeray. He said insurance companies will need directions from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA). He also asked Sitharaman to issue directives to banks to provide working capital to the affected traders, and even interest concessions for a few months to benefit the traders. Thackeray, who held a meeting with insurance companies and state-level bankers committee, gave them directives to help flood-affected people to start afresh. He also urged the banks to provide loans at concessional rates and start operations from their branches in the flood-hit districts. Meanwhile, the death toll in the rain-related incidents in the state remained at 213, with eight people still missing. Thackeray will be visiting flood-affected Kolhapur district on Friday. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said that the Rs 10,000 aid the state has announced as immediate assistance will be disbursed from Friday. Thackeray urged the companies to ensure that the process of seeking insurance is smooth so that people who are already distressed are not made to run pillar to post for completing paperwork.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-urges-centre-to-release-50-of-insured-amount-to-flood-hit/articleshow/84876608.cms||---
---||Pune||No data on vaccination pregnant women in India||Pune: There’s virtually no data available on how many pregnant women have opted for Covid-19 vaccination in India, ever since their inclusion in the vaccination programme on July 1. This is because the Union government has yet to assign pregnant women a separate category on the CoWIN portal. Pregnant women are currently being vaccinated under the age groups; the lack of a separate category has rendered it impossible to keep a consolidated record. There is no concrete tool to assess trends in terms of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among expecting mothers across demographics in the country, and solutions to address them. In Maharashtra, the state health authorities have asked district officials to manually maintain records. However, when TOI sought this data, the state authorities did not have it, citing CoWIN shortcomings. “Currently, we do not have any information on exactly how many pregnant women have been vaccinated. They are being vaccinated not under a separate category, but age-groupwise, on CoWIN,” state immunisation officer Dilip Patil told TOI. The Maharashtra government has requested the Union health ministry to introduce a pregnant women category on CoWIN to allow them to keep tabs on district-wise vaccination trends among pregnant women. “We have asked district officials to ensure that they keep a manual record of pregnant women, but it is not up to the mark. The state government has requested the Union government to assign pregnant women a separate category,” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune circle, said. All the developed countries have a post-vaccination record-keeping system in place for pregnant women. It is a pre-requisite for long-term follow-up and assessment, experts said. “This is important because pregnant women form a large segment of the population which is at high risk of infection due to Covid,” said gynaecologist Kiran Kurtkoti, vice-president of the Association of Maharashtra Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies. Gynaecologist Pankaj Sarode, vice-president of Pune Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society, said, “Covid vaccine is approved as an emergency vaccine. There is no prior data available, as is the case for other vaccines. It is more important in the case of pregnant women, as they are a special class, to carry out long-term follow-up and assessment. Besides, if vaccination statistics are made available and published, it may encourage prospective vaccine-takers to go for it.” Despite repeated attempts, N K Arora, chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, could not be reached for comment.

The car had taken a deep dent and the official wasn’t happy. But it turned out he was more unhappy when he learned that the boy was a bonded labourer put to work by his parents. The director, Dr BKS Vardhan, wrote to the Kalaburagi deputy director in his department to get the boy admitted to a government school. “I also instructed the officials to file a complaint against the cattle owner,” Vardhan said. An FIR has been filed against the boy’s father, and farm owner Mallanna Natikar of Mandewal village under sections of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and antichild labour act. On Tuesday, Vardhan was passing through Jewargi on work when the buffaloes darted across, hitting the car. As he stopped to take a look at the dent, he noticed the boy herding the cattle. “He said he had dropped out in Class 6 from a school in Hasaragundigi in Afzalpur taluk,” Vardhan told TOI. “Had he continued, he would be in Class 8 now. He said he was sent to work for a year for a farm owner who had paid Rs 35,000 to his parents. He has already spent a month and a half there. The boy has now been sent back home.” Vardhan said he contacted the block education officer (BEO) of Jewargi taluk once he came to know of the boy’s plight. Jewargi BEO Venkayya Inamdar said: “We are talking to the parents and hostel facilities will be arranged for him. He can resume studies at his previous school or relocate to where parents are staying.” Watch Karnataka: Buffalo mishap leads to rescue of child labourer||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/buffalo-mishap-leads-to-rescue-of-child-labourer/articleshow/84877435.cms||Shreyas HS

Cases saw an upward spiral in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts and the statewide tally rose from 1,531 to 2,052 in just 24 hours. While 396 fresh cases were reported in Dakshina Kannada on Thursday, there were 174 cases in Udupi. Bengaluru Urban recorded a spike, with 505 cases, up from 376 the previous day.   Alarmed by the surge, government officials discussed measures to check the spread. Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar told TOI the state government suspects it may be because of the high infection rate in Kerala. “The situation in Kerala is worrisome. Apart from escalating border restrictions, we’re thinking of measures, including reintroduction of certain curbs in Dakshina Kannada,” said Ravi Kumar After a series of unlock measures, spike in cases was not unexpected. Next week will be crucial to see if the rate stabilizes, starts falling or continues to rise. While Dakshina Kannada reported eight fatalities, Udupi recorded one. The active caseload of Dakshina Kannada increased from 2,363 to 2,551. Udupi’s active caseload increased from 893 to 1,000. The toll of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts increased to 1,410 and 414, respectively.   Deputy commissioner KV Rajendra told TOI the test positivity rate in Kerala is between 13% and 14% and people, who have taken a single dose of vaccine from Kasaragod district, travel frequently to Dakshina Kannada. “Strict measures will be adopted to enforce mask-wearing and socialdistancing norms in public places. We plan to stop all public gatherings in the district,” the DC said. Dakshina Kannada district had recently allowed buses between Kasaragod and Mangaluru. People from Kerala arrive here on trains too. The test positivity rate in Kasaragod was 11.1% on Thursday and the district reported 929 positive cases. The border district has 7,001 active cases. “Even educated people are behaving irresponsibly,” said Rajendra, adding people are becoming so careless that they’re not wearing masks in public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/alarm-as-covid-cases-rise-in-coastal-dists-bluru-dk-a-red-zone/articleshow/84877438.cms||---

Gaikwad held a meeting with education officers across the state. Schools in Kolhapur, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Satara, Sangli, Pune, Raigad, Thane and Palghar suffered huge losses due to the floods. Grains stocked in schools under the mid-day meals scheme were also destroyed in the floods, said Gaikwad. Physical schools in some of these districts had reopened on July 15 for classes IX to XII. A survey of the schools showed damages to classrooms.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Municipal corporation house selects IIT-Ropar for garbage plant upgrade report||CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation general house on Thursday selected Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and request for proposal (RFP) for upgrade, operation and maintenance of Dadumajra garbage processing plant for Rs 26.77 lakh, excluding GST. The institute has given a detailed report to the MC about the scope of work and the decided technology. The civic body had asked three institutes—IIT-Ropar, Punjab Engineering College (PEC) and Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala—to send their quotes for preparing DPR and RFP. However, only IIT-Ropar and PEC responded. The PEC quoted Rs 88 lakh for the work and IIT-Ropar Rs 26.77 lakh. The sanitation department placed the quotations before the house for consideration and IIT-Ropar was selected. Joint municipal commissioner Sorabh Arora told the house that he talked to the institutes, briefing them extensively about the requirements. “I spoke with the experts of the institutes and IIT-Ropar’s technical team also visited the plant a couple of days back. They have different experts for different works to prepare DPR and RFP and are technically sound,” he said. The MC wanted that the DPR must keep in scope issues like environment-social impact, technical as well as financial assessments, and IIT-Ropar has given its detailed plan for preparing their document for the civic body. As the waste-to-energy plant has some environmental issues too, which were pointed out by the experts in the last special house meeting, sources in the MC said it was the most crucial aspect of the study and its parameters could not be overlooked. While discussing the matter, house members urged the officers concerned to ensure that expertise of IIT-Ropar experts was available in future too, if any technical issue erupts in the functioning of the plant after its upgrade. Municipal commissioner KK Yadav said, “The upgrade of technology of the existing garbage plant is the most critical part and I am happy that the MC has decided to take help from the premier agency, IIT-Ropar, for the work, which will give holistic plan for all three types of garbage—dry, wet and horticulture. Though the institute is asking for around three months’ time to prepare both DPR and RFP, we will request them to get both the documents as soon as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-house-selects-iit-ropar-for-garbage-plant-upgrade-report/articleshow/84872178.cms||Deepak Yadav

The man identified as Vijay Rathod, on Thursday lodged a complaint at Bhivapur police station, alleging humiliation by a group of villagers, who were forcing him to pay compensation for cancellation of marriage in 2020, the police said. Those who have been booked included Dawla Jadhav (Naik), Jhuma Meghawat, Tarachand Meghawat, Sdaram Chavan, Kisan Pawar, Balashaeb Rathod, Devram Rathod, Bahadur Rathod, Nelsingh Pawar and Chelsingh Pawar, all residents of Mandwa. Police said the victim got engaged to a woman from his community in February 2020 and the marriage was fixed in May 2020. However, due to Corona induced lockdown, it got postponed before getting cancelled in December 2020. However, the woman’s relatives demanded Rs70,000 from him as compensation, which Rathod refused to pay and instead expressed his willingness to marry the same woman. However, the members of the local community allegedly tried to pressurize him to pay the money. But when he refused, 10 members of their community boycotted the complainant and his family in a meeting held last year. After the meeting, the complainant’s family was not allowed to speak to any person belonging to their community, visit the temple or attend any functions or celebrations of the community members at the village. Police said, based on Rathod’s complaint, an offence was registered against the 10 persons under sections of the Maharashtra Prohibition of People from Social Boycott (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act,2016, and under various IPC sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/10-booked-for-socially-boycotting-family-in-mandwa-village/articleshow/84872216.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Hyderabad||Hit by Covid, 14 lakh more turned to NREGS in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Loss of livelihood during the Covid-19 lockdowns forced lakhs in Telangana to opt for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) with 14 lakh more turning to the Centre’s flagship scheme for a living during the pandemic. From 40 lakh in the pre-Covid-19 year of 2019-20 to 54 lakh in 2020-21 period, officials said the 14 lakh increase also underscores how even teachers and graduates are opting for the NREGS work for a living. Experts said that increased numbers could be attributed to many factors such as reverse migration and more rural people seeking jobs for a living. The severity of the current situation is reflected in the data on employment provided in the scheme over the years. The number of people who worked under the scheme never exceeded 44 lakh in any year since the state’s formation. It was around 37 lakh in 2014-15. Interestingly the same numbers fell from 45 lakh in 2018-19 to 40 lakh in 2019-20, reflecting how the rural population looked at other avenues like starting their own business. Dr Bibhu Prasad Nayak, chairperson, school of livelihoods and development, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Hyderabad said the employment provided under MNREGS scheme is demand-driven (different categories of works provided), but in the unprecedented Covid-19 scenario, it has become more supply-driven from various corners. “The governments have also responded well by providing jobs to large number of people. In the absence of other activities in villages, more people might have turned towards this scheme,” he added. However, the flagship rural livelihood scheme attracted wide attention when private teachers were reported working for daily wages across villages in many districts of the state as early as June 2020. “I went to my village in Nalgonda in October 2020, I worked there for two months as I had a significant debt to repay and I was not getting a salary,” V Ramesh a private teacher working in the city said, adding that he had a job card in his village before he took to teaching. Revealing an interesting dimension of the scheme, Jyothis Sathyapalan, associate professor of National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) said that before the onset of Covid- 19, a small per cent of graduates was working under the scheme. “Serious study on the link between reverse migration (urban to rural) and increasing job seekers in the scheme is required. Just like Telangana during Covid-19, the number of individuals employed under MGNREGS increased in many states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hit-by-covid-14l-more-turned-to-nregs-in-t/articleshow/84876631.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Surat||Surat: Tombs symbolized rivalry between British and Dutch||SURAT: The English cemetery at Katargam Darwaja can be considered the last of the cemeteries of foreign traders to come up in Surat. The first recorded tomb in the Armenian cemetery is of the 16th century while that in the Dutch cemetery is of 1642. In the English cemetery the oldest recorded tomb is of 1649 of Francis Breton who was the president of British East India factory at Surat. The Armenian cemetery has just one mausoleum while the Dutch and English cemeteries have many such structures. Researchers have concluded that the architecture of the tombs in the two cemeteries show grandiose and opulence of the two foreign trade companies who were rivals and the mausoleums acted as symbols of this rivalry. At the English cemetery, obelisks, pillars and cupolas have been made either as per the wishes of the company officials or their relatives. The cemetery has around 94 tombs, 14 of which have these architectural structures. Some of the tombs have epitaphs but many of them just have numbered stones. The grandest of these are of Oxenden Brothers, one of whom was the president of the factory, and Gerald Aungier, who was also the president and later the governor of Bombay Presidency. Although Breton’s tomb is the oldest in the cemetery, he was not the first British to die in Surat. The English factory was established in 1613 and researchers have claimed that many employees of the factory had died during the famine of 1631. But where were they buried has not been found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/tombs-symbolized-rivalry-between-british-and-dutch/articleshow/84870781.cms||Jay Pachchigar

---||Chennai||Along Palar river check dams hold key to agri revival||Chennai: A check dam across the river Palar in Kodayanchi in Tirupattur district is all that 79-year-old farmer K N Dharmarajan has been demanding for decades. Like him, several thousands of farmers depending on agriculture in the upper Palar river basin — the lifeline of northern districts — have been pleading in vain with successive governments to construct check dams, at every five kilometre along the river.Chief minister M K Stalin’s direction to the water resources department to construct check dams wherever feasible has revived their hopes to get back to their preferred livelihood. If constructed, the check dams could breathe life into the fading agricultural practices in this part of the state that is solely dependent on the river. Farmers have petitioned the CM special cell also to get their long-pending demand fulfiled. An example of how check dams can transform the lives in a region is in the Palar basin itself. Two years after check dams were constructed across the river in Isur-Vallipuram and Vayalur in Kancheepuram district, farmers in the surrounding villages are now raising crops in all three seasons. The lush green paddy fields on either side of the river are a testimony to water conservation practices. According to PWD officials, the 222km stretch of Palar riverbed in TN irrigates around 4.5 lakh hectares of land in northern Tamil Nadu, particularly in Tirupattur, Vellore, Ranipet, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts. However, the state government’s failure to construct check dams has left the farming community in the lurch. Several hundred acres of fertile land are left uncultivated and they are being used as grazing fields by farmers, for close to three decades.Dharmarajan, recounting the farming activities, said paddy and sugarcane were the main crops in the region, which was part of the erstwhile Vellore district. Traditional rice varieties — Kichili Samba, Seeraga Samba, Karuppu (seeraga) Samba, and Motta — were raised decades ago. "We used to cultivate paddy and sugarcane as alternate crops. The yield of sugarcane was 30 to 40 tonnes per acre in those days (till 1980)," he said, bemoaning the four acres of land he sold due to water scarcity.In 2002, a proposal was submitted to the TN government, to construct check dams at 13 places across the river, and the cost was estimated at around `26 crore. Experts from Anna University aided the TWAD board to identify the sites using remote sensing technology. "The TN legislative petition committee had also recommended the same to the TWAD board, following representation from farmers, but nothing has happened till date," Palar A Ashokan of Ambalur said. A senior official of the Water Resource Organisation said the department would take up construction of check dams across the river at Ambalur, Vengili, Iryankadu, Poigai, Vegamangalgam and Athipattu Valavanur. Two dykes would be constructed at Shenbakkam and Puttuthakku in upper Palar reaches.Officials have finalised the sites for the check dams in a bid to store rainwater from the catchment areas of Palar’s tributaries — Agaram river, Malatar, Mannar, Goundaniyanathi, Ponai and Cheyyar."We have completed site inspections and commenced preparing project reports. The proposals for the identified sites will be submitted to the government within a month," said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/along-palar-river-check-dams-hold-key-to-agri-revival/articleshow/84872227.cms||---
---||Pune||New link, but connectivity issues ground efforts to register for CET||Pune: The registration for the common entrance test (CET) for admissions to first year junior college (FYJC, Std XI) has once again run into trouble as students mainly from rural areas are facing issues with the online process due to poor or no network. The website had initially faced technical difficulties and the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education had to halt the registration process for a few days before a new link for registration was created and enrolment was revived. However, after four days of operation, students have once again complained about a slow site. The state board officials have said there was no issue with the servers and problems could be at the user’s end due to poor network. S B Deshmukh, president of the school principal’s association, said, “The website had initial problems and after it was restarted again the students have been complaining about the poor pace and also issues with connectivity as a result of which the process was hampered. The problem is more evident in rural areas and especially the rain hit regions as the network has not been restored yet.” Siddesh Raut, a student from Jalna, said,“The rains have caused heavy damage in our village and for the past three days we have not been able to fill up the form. We are hoping the board extends the deadline for the form submission.” Another student from Satara, Anisha Nair, said the moment she logs in to the website it takes several minutes to load and when it loads and she starts entering her details, the site hangs. “The problem has been persisting for two to three days and we have also informed our school about it. We have been asked to try for another two days,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-link-but-connectivity-issues-ground-efforts-to-register-for-cet/articleshow/84873993.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Mockery’ of legal process in arrest: Kundra’s lawyer||Mumbai: There has been a “mockery” of legal requirements before arrest as mandated by law and the Supreme Court, said businessman Raj Kundra’s counsel on Thursday before the Bombay high court. Kundra and co-accused Ryan Thorpe have challenged their arrest as illegal in the case of alleged “production and streaming of pornographic content”. In its affidavit, the state said police complied with the law and had issued a notice under Section 41A (1) of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to both, which was accepted by Thorpe but “refused” by Kundra.The state’s reply, filed by Mumbai police inspector, property cell, CID, on Thursday, said “refusal to accept the notice implies” refusal to cooperate with investigation and that apart, on July 19, both the accused “started deleting from WhatsApp group and chat causing evidence of offence to disappear” and were hence brought to the crime branch and arrested.“Police never gave him notice under Section 41A (1) Criminal Procedure Code and have never in its first remand application mentioned any such,” said senior counsel Aabad Ponda for Kundra who is actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband. Arguing at length before Justice Ajay Gadkari, he said “assuming, without admitting” that Kundra refused to sign on the notice, the legal option before the police was “not to whisk him away” but to approach the magistrate for permission as mandated under Section 41A (4). Ponda and advocate Subhash Jadhav also said, “Nowhere in its first or second remand do the police say that Kundra or his colleagues tried to destroy or delete any texts”.Ponda cited a Supreme Court judgment of 2014 in Arnesh Kumar case to say a magistrate has no power to remand a person to custody if, when an offence attracts up to seven years’ imprisonment, police do not comply with Section 41A, which is a notice to be first issued to ensure attendance and explanation before a police station. For Thorpe, counsel Abhinav Chandrachud argued though he accepted the notice, he had not deleted any messages on July 19 as police are now alleging and hence police have to comply with Section 41A (3) and mandatorily give reasons for his arrest, which they have not. Ponda said Chief Justice of India N V Ramana in May had laid down no arrest can be made in the pandemic in violation of principles of arrest. HC will hear public prosecutor Aruna Pai on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mockery-of-legal-process-in-arrest-kundras-lawyer/articleshow/84874739.cms||---

---||Pune||Fresh road digging on hold till pending work is complete||PUNE: The civic administration has decided to prioritize road repairs after coming under fire from various quarters about the condition of city roads. Following complaints from citizens, activists and elected members, Pune Municipal Corporation’s standing committee — chaired by Hemant Rasane — has decided hold all new road digging plans until the roads that are dug-up have been repaired. TOI has been highlighting the condition of the city roads for the past two days. Activists have approved the decision but remain sceptical on just how well this will be implemented. Nearly 115km of roads have been dug up across the civic limits to lay pipelines for the 24x7 water supply project and to replace old drainage lines. These works were allowed even after the usual May 31 deadline because the projects were deemed crucial. “Two-wheeler riders and motorists are facing major problems while driving on these roads. PMC should hold the contractors responsible for substandard work,” Sandip Khardekar of Creative foundation, a citizens’ group, said. Elected members have criticized PMC for failing to take timely steps to complete road digging and restorations. Some, like city NCP chief Prashant Jagtap, blamed BJP for not paying attention to the status of roadworks. “Despite repeated complaints, only hollow promises made by BJP leaders,” Congress city unit chief Ramesh Bagwe said. “The pipelines in the old city areas are being replaced after around six decades; this project is complicated and will take time. Work related to Metro is also going on at the same time, which has increased the problem,” a PMC official said. “The administration should ensure dug-up roads are repaired properly. Only then will fresh digging be allowed. Works which were permitted but have yet to start will be postponed till pending work is completed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fresh-road-digging-on-hold-till-pending-work-is-complete/articleshow/84872247.cms||---

UT’s chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai, in a recent letter to the ministry, reiterated that the area falling in Punjab and Haryana was yet to be notified. UT also said that 90% of the area falls in the two states, therefore to protect it, it was important to notify ESZ immediately.Recently, adviser Dharam Pal had directed the UT forest and wildlife department officers to take up the matter afresh with the Union government for early declaration of ESZ. Last year too, in a meeting convened by the MoEFCC’s wildlife division to discuss the issues related with forest and wildlife management being undertaken in the states and union territories, the UT administration had submitted a request for declaring ESZ around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary at the earliest.The ministry issued a final notification for Chandigarh alone, while Punjab and Haryana to date have not declared such zones in their respective territories. The Chandigarh administration, in the past too, had urged the two states to regulate human activities in the catchment area as the Supreme Court had also upheld that huge construction should not be allowed close to the sanctuary. In December 2019 too, the UT had urged the ministry to expedite the process of ESZ.Haryana had recently planned to declare areas ranging from 1 to 1.5 km as ESZ and also sought comments from the department concerned. The UT administration has already opposed the Punjab government’s proposal to declare only a 100m ESZ on its side.When ministry declared ESZ only for UTOn January 25, 2017, the Union ministry had issued the ESZ notification for Chandigarh. On September 17, 2015, the ministry had issued a draft notification only for the sanctuary area that fell under UT and not for the section that came under Punjab and Haryana. Thereafter, the UT had submitted its objections, urging the ministry to issue a notification for the entire ESZ to protect the sanctuary, whose 90% area fell under the jurisdiction of Punjab and Haryana. Turning down its demand, the ministry declared ESZ only for Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/expedite-process-to-notify-esz-around-sukhna-sanctuary-ut-asks-ministry/articleshow/84872273.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Pune||Pavana, Panshet stocks up; caution for low-lying areas in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad||PUNE: The water storage in Panshet and Pavana dams increased to 90% on Thursday, prompting the state irrigation department to issue an alert in the low-lying areas along Mutha, Mula and Pavana rivers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad about a possible rise in the water levels in these rivers following discharge from the reservoirs. The Pavana dam started releasing water into Pavana river at the rate of 1,617 cusecs on Thursday afternoon after its storage increased to 87% of its capacity. The dam received 25mm rainfall till the evening. The storage in Panshet reached 92.6% on Thursday evening. Officials in the irrigation department said water release from the Panshet dam could begin any time. Water released from Panshet dam flows into Khadakwasla, from where it is released into the Mutha river. The storage in Khadakwasla has already reached its capacity. The irrigation department continued discharge from Khadakwasla at the rate of 1,929 cusecs on Thursday. Water release was also initiated from Bhama Askhed dam, Pune city’s fifth source of water. Its stock reached 6.23 TMC on Thursday, which was 82.4% of its total capacity. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said they have alerted the citizens in the low-lying areas of Hingne, Vadgaon, Deccan Gymkhana, Kamgar Putala and Patil Estate slum about the possibility of an increase in discharge from the dam. “We have identified chronic spots and possible locations in the low-lying areas, which might experience flooding. Teams have been deputed at every ward office to monitor the situation and relocate citizens from the flood-prone areas in case of a rise in water level,” a civic body official said. Officials from the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) have also alerted the citizens staying along the Pavana river about a possible rise in water level following discharge from the dam. An official from the irrigation department said, “We are monitoring the water levels and inflow of rain water in every dam. Discharge from dams will be increased in a phased manner. The discharge will be reduced if rainfall activity in the catchments drops.” The collective storage in the four dams in the Khadakwasla circle reached 85.9% on Thursday evening. The storage in dams increased to 25.06 TMC as against their total capacity of 29.15 TMC. Koyna discharge hiked, Krishna may cross danger mark The increase in the discharge from Koyna dam to 49,000 cusecs is going to push water level of Krishna river once again above warning level and the residents along the banks of the river must remain alert said Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary on Thursday. Sangli city municipal commissioner Nitin Kapadnis has even appealed citizens from localities which witness flood water when Krishna river attains 42, to not to return back to their homes and stay in the temporary shelters. The irrigation department on Thursday morning increased the discharge from Koyna dam which is currently 86% filled. Chaudhary said, “The Krishna water level has dropped below the warning level of 40 feet at Irwin Bridge. However, since the dams upstream have started discharge, the river may breach the warning level again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pavana-panshet-stocks-up-caution-for-low-lying-areas/articleshow/84872280.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Pune||Remnant of radio galaxy discovered||Pune: Scientists working at the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics have discovered a remnant radio galaxy at the peripheral region of a cluster of galaxies named Abell2065, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The research was published in the July 2021 issue of the Astrophysical Journal. The discovery is important because the dying phase is relatively short-lived and hence is difficult to detect. Dharam Vir Lal, who made the discovery, said, “Only a few such remnants are known. Finding more remnants and restarted radio galaxies is important to shed light on their dynamics and evolution, and hence the duty cycle of active galaxies. We know that active galaxies are rare (about 10% of all galaxies) and that remnant radio galaxies are even rarer as they are short-lived. Hence, this dying phase remains a poorly understood phenomenon. By increasing the detection of these rare sources, we will be able to understand different evolutionary histories of active galaxies and of different mechanisms that drive the evolution of the remnant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remnant-of-radio-galaxy-discovered/articleshow/84874030.cms||---

Justice Kodandaram on Wednesday referred such matters that came to his notice to the high court registry with a direction to place them before the chief justice whose bench was hearing PILs on the issue. He also found fault with civil courts for granting status quo even after a division bench of the high court had earlier asked them to exercise caution while dealing with illegal structures. Saying that scores of civil suits were being filed in Hyderabad civil courts with the ultimate aim of getting them dismissed, the judge said a closer look at the statistics furnished by GHMC had shown that owners of illegal structures who approached the civil courts against demolition notices were never really bothered about the end result of cases. “They were interested only in getting an interim order and complete the construction. Once the construction is done, the owners and their lawyers stop attending court hearings and invite orders of dismissal for default in appearing. A dismissal order is all that they precisely need once their purpose is served,” the judge said. He said the GHMC or the municipal administration department were found on the wrong side because the records did not show any earnest effort to get the injunction orders vacated. “The case will now go before the CJ,” he said while hearing a contempt case filed by R Narendra Babu. The judge himself got a sample check done in Amberpet circle of the GHMC where as many as 189 illegal structures had been constructed. The sample check threw startling statistics of illegal structures and clever methods used by builders to complete the constructions. “They are using the courts to achieve their goals. Whenever they receive a demolition notice from GHMC, these owners or builders are approaching the civil courts urging them to restrain GHMC from interfering in their properties. If courts ask officials and owners to maintain status quo, it means both parties have to stop their work. But in Hyderabad, such status quo is read as a stay on GHMC alone. The owners use the very same orders that restrained them to complete their illegal structures,” the judge said. GHMC officials and its ground staff too were more than willing to read the court orders this way though the real import of the court orders may not have been exactly be the same, he said. “Some times, a mere notice from the civil court is enough for them to stay away from their duty,” he said. “It’s better they are heard by a division bench for arriving at a comprehensive solution,” the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-seeks-data-on-illegal-bldgs-in-150-wards-of-ghmc/articleshow/84876673.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Parents dub 15% fee cut proposal as ‘eyewash’||PUNE: Parents’ associations have dubbed the state government’s announcement on Wednesday of a 15% cut in private school fees as “eyewash” as they believe no school will implement the order. The parents pointed out that even last year the state government had told schools to follow the fee pattern of 2019-20, but many had hiked fees. They further demanded that an audit of all schools be carried out after which a decision to cut fees should be taken depending on how much fee the school collects, their expenses and profit. Meanwhile, private schools’ representatives have described the move as “illegal’. They said the state government does not have the authority to slash fees charged by private schools. Anubha Sahai, president, India Wide Parents’ Association, said, “The blanket rule will not help. They also need to amend the Fee Regulation Act to allow individual parents to approach the district fee regulation committee to file complaints regarding fee issue, instead of making it compulsory for at least 25% of parents to lodge complaint for the application to be accepted by the Divisional Fee Regulatory Committee,” Sahai said. Advocate Markas Deshmukh said that since there is no provision in the Maharashtra Fee Regulation Act, 2011, regarding reduction in fees, the decision to cut 15% fees in private schools in Maharashtra will not stand in the court if the schools decide to challenge it. Rajendra Singh, president, Independent English Schools Association of Maharashtra, said that the decision will hit budget schools hard. “Many schools will have to close down because of the heavy financial burden on them. There should be clear mention of what should happen to wilful defaulters among parents. We have asked our legal team to look into it so that we can take appropriate action,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parents-dub-15-fee-cut-proposal-as-eyewash/articleshow/84874016.cms||Ardhra Nair

The SUV, Toyota Innova Crysta, purchased for the MC president is serving the Mohali additional deputy commissioner (ADC). Even the driver appointed for MC president’s official vehicle is attached with the ADC. The expenses incurred by the vehicle as well as the salary of the driver, Sohan Singh, are being drawn from the MC president’s official account, said Kharar SAD convener Ranjit Singh Gill. New president Jaspreet Kaur Longia has been using her private vehicle to commute to the office. Jaspreet Longia, who was elected amid political drama after two months’ delay due to an uproar by the Congress councillors on the election day, said, “When the vehicle is assigned to Kharar MC president, then why is it being used by the ADC?” MC executive officer (EO) said they had received orders from the district collector to do so. Gill said, “We have an absolute majority in the house, and still the Congress is playing cheap tactics to trouble our representatives. When the Congress failed to have their own president, they stooped low by depriving our president of her official privileges. The official vehicle is serving the ADC and expenses are being drawn from Kharar MC’s account.” On June 17, Longia, SAD councillor from ward number 19, was elected president of Kharar municipal council. On February 17, the council polls had resulted in a hung house, as out of total 27 seats, Congress won 10 seats, SAD eight and one went to the AAP. Eight seats were won by Independents, who helped her finally win.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/suv-meant-for-kharar-mc-chief-serves-mohali-adc/articleshow/84872294.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

---||Delhi||Delhi Police constable, three aides thrash 28-year-old to death||NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old man was thrashed to death in New Kondli and his body was dumped in Modinagar in Uttar Pradesh by a Delhi Police constable and three of his associates on June 4. The constable, Monu Sirohi, has been arrested and sent on a seven-day remand after almost two months of committing the crime. He has been dismissed from service for engaging in criminal activities. The body of the victim is yet to be recovered. The SHO of New Ashok Nagar, Pramod Kumar, under whose jurisdiction the crime occurred, has been suspended for not registering an FIR and probing the matter. The victim, Ajeet Kumar, was a resident of Kondli. His friend, Atul, who was accompanying him, was also assaulted by the accused, but he managed to flee. Action into the horrific incident was initiated after a video of the rogue cop and his associates, which was shot by a local resident, Gaurav Gupta, went viral. Police claimed the crime occurred in the aftermath of a road rage incident. DCP (East) Priyanka Kashyap said a missing person report was lodged by Ajeet’s brother, Ashok, on June 13. Two days later, another complaint was filed by Ashok on the suspicion that his brother might have been abducted and killed. An FIR of abduction was registered only on July 27 after the matter reached senior police officers. It came to the fore that the SHO had taken no action on both complaints of the family. During initial investigation, it was found that Ajeet and Atul had stepped out for eating ice cream when an altercation occurred with the cop and his three friends — Vikas, Vineet and Harish. Sirohi claimed all involved in the brawl were drunk. An officer privy to investigation said, “The accused men claimed that Ajeet and his friend came in front of their car, leading to an argument where they abused each other. To teach them a lesson, the constable and his friends started thrashing them. While Atul managed to escape, Ajeet was kicked, slapped and hit multiple times. They then put Ajeet inside the car. When Sirohi realised that Ajeet was dead, to avoid any legal action he drove the car to Modinagar and disposed of the body in Gang Nahar post-midnight on June 4. The body is yet to be traced.” A source said Ajeet had a case of attempt to murder lodged against him in 2017. Atul also had criminal antecedents. In a statement issued on Thursday, Delhi Police said that IPC sections related to murder and criminal conspiracy had been added to the FIR of abduction. “Sirohi was a constable posted at Pandav Nagar police station. The car in which Ajeet was abducted has been seized. Harish, an AC mechanic, has been arrested too. We are looking for the other associates of the accused,” said the DCP. “Inspector Pramod Kumar, SHO, New Ashok Nagar police station, has been placed under suspension for delay in registration of the case on the complaint of Ashok Kumar. A departmental inquiry has been initiated against him. Sirohi has been dismissed from service,” added Kashyap. Vikas and Vineet had been traced and would be arrested soon, said the source. The constable and his friends would often drink together. He had threatened to take Ajeet to the police station, but drove to Modinagar after realising that he had died. The route taken by Sirohi was being traced to recover the body. Since it had been raining and Gang Nahar was quite long, divers were still trying to recover the body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cop-3-aides-thrash-28-yr-old-to-death/articleshow/84874863.cms||---
---||Mumbai||PM should visit flood-hit areas, sanction funds on priority in Mumbai: Min||Nagpur: State cabinet minister Vijay Wadettiwar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should visit flood-affected regions in Maharashtra and push for early sanction of relief fund from the Centre. Speaking to mediapersons on Thursday in Nagpur, Wadettiwar clarified that Rs 700 crore received ‘recently’ from the Centre are for the October 2020 floods, and not for the Konkan disaster “as is being said by some people”. Wadettiwar said, “Our request is that the PM should tour the affected areas and see the current situation. He’s the PM of India. When a similar disaster struck Gujarat, the PM went there and sanctioned relief of up to Rs 1,000 crore without waiting for any survey. The disaster has led to massive damage to lives, crops and property. We will do our survey and send an official request to the Centre for funds. But we want a team from the Centre to come here on priority and release funds after assessing the damage.” A letter requesting for a central team to survey the damage will be sent shortly, said Wadettiwar. Surveying the damage is running into some ground challenges, said Wadettiwar. “Accessibility is a problem as there is up to two feet muck in many areas,” said Wadettiwar. He reiterated the cabinet decisions of providing immediate relief to families by way of cash and ration kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pm-should-visit-flood-hit-areas-sanction-funds-on-priority-in-mumbai-min/articleshow/84876731.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

She carried a fake ID card of being a member of re-allotment committee of CHB and would tell people that she has good relations with the Governor, the UT administrator and other IAS officers. She was earlier the president of Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA) of Sector 51. Madan Gopal Gupta, a resident of Phase III, Mohali, said in his police complaint, “I met Manjit at a temple in Sector 51 in 2019. She introduced herself as a member of the re-allotment committee of CHB. As I was keen to buy a CHB flat, I discussed it with her. She said she would help me buy a flat in Sector 51. Thereafter, she showed me four flats in the area. She also told us that three booths will be allotted to us, one each to me, my wife and son.”The complainant finalised the deal of one flat at Rs 59 lakh. “Manjit asked us to deposit the money before March 31, 2021, and gave her account details. For a flat and booths, I deposited Rs 87 lakh in her account through multiple transactions,” he added. Manjit told him that the flat would be allotted to him under the house allotment scheme for citizens. “After taking the money, she could not handover to us the flat possession and started making excuses. After waiting for many months, we inquired about her at the CHB and found that she was not a member of any of its committees. When I asked her to return the money, she issued me cheques, which were dishonoured,” he said.Gupta filed a complaint at SSP public window and the case was transferred to EOW.After verifying the facts, the EOW registered a cheating case against Manjit in May and arrested her after completing the investigation.The EOW produced her before a local court and obtained her two-day police remand.EOW SP Ketan Bansal said, “A cheating case was registered against Manjit. It is being investigated if she is involved in more allotment frauds and if more people are involved in the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ex-prez-of-sec-51-rwa-poses-as-chb-panel-member-dupes-couple/articleshow/84872295.cms||---
---||Pune||Fraudsters use MitM ploy to cheat bank in Pune||PUNE: Cyber fraudsters used the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) ploy to cheat a public sector bank located on Karve Road of Rs9.93 lakh on July 4. MitM is a form of fraud in which the perpetrator positions himself in a digital conversation between two users either to eavesdrop or to personate one of the parties, making it appear as if normal exchange of information is underway. In this case, the bank had received an email on July 4 purportedly sent by an account holder (a generator set manufacturing company) seeking transfer of Rs9.93 lakh from its account to an account in another bank. The unsuspecting bank officials went ahead with the money transfer via two NEFT transactions. The matter came to light when the company received alerts about the two money transfers and its officials approached the bank to inform them that they had made no request for money transfer. After verification, the bank’s manager (51), a resident of Kondhwa, approached the Deccan Gymkhana police station and registered a case of cheating on Wednesday. “It is a case of MitM. Somebody copied the details of the company’s email id, changed the account number to which the money was to be sent and forwarded the email to the bank,” said inspector Sanjay Mogale of the Deccan Gymkhana police station. The FIR stated, “The company is an old customer of the bank. Generally, the company officials send emails to the bank to initiate any payment transaction to their clients or service providers.” “On July 4, the bank received an email looking very similar to the company’s email asking bank officials to transfer a sum of Rs9.93 lakh to another account. The bank transferred the money via two transactions, one worth Rs7.48 lakh and another worth Rs2.45 lakh,” said Mogale. He added, “To avert crowding at its premises, the bank asked its old customers to send emails to affect any major transaction instead of visiting the bank. Somebody copied the details of the company’s email and logo. There were very minute changes in the mail. The fraudsters just changed the bank account number and sent the email to the bank and the bank affected the transaction.” The fraudsters withdrew all the money from the account where it was transferred, the police said. A case has been registered on the charge of cheating and forgery under the Indian Penal Code and under relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act. Mogale said, “We have asked the bank to which the money was transferred to give us details of the suspect account. Further, the account has been frozen as of now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fraudsters-use-mitm-ploy-to-cheat-bank/articleshow/84872335.cms||---

Police said besides Singh, the complaint mentions former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and inspector Rajkumar Kothmire. This will be the fourth FIR against Singh.The state CID had probed the complaint and found substance in Jalan’s allegations that Singh, Sharma and others extorted money from him. The state CID submitted its report to director general of police Sanjay Pandey last Friday, said a police officerRM Somavanshi, senior inspector of Thane nagar police station said, “There is a legal procedure involved as after taking down the statements, it shall be referred to senior officials. After they give a green signal the offence will be registered. In the afternoon, Ketan Tanna started recording his statement. Later Jalan’s statement will be recorded. Most likely case will be registered on Friday.”The officer refused to disclose the contents of the statement or the names of the accused. “Let the offence get registered, we shall reveal it,” he said.Earlier, Jalan said he “received a call from police to give my statement. We have been framed by Singh, Sharma and other officials in nexus with their agents including Vikas Dabhade, Bimal Agrawal. etc. It is very easy for cops to frame anyone in any case and extort money. I was booked in a false MCOCA case and am fighting for justice.” Jalan added that, “They extorted Rs 3.5 crore from me and Rs 1.18 cr from Tanna. I had approached the chief minister and home minister with our complaint. Finally the police took cognizance of my complaint and registration of FIR is underway.”.The officer said the CID inquired into Jalan’s complaints when Sharma and Kothmire were attached to the Thane anti-extortion cell in 2018. Then, Thane police had claimed Jalan took help of gangster Ravi Pujari in recovering money placed on bets from one Ritesh Shah while arresting him, Tanna and other bookies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cops-start-to-register-fir-against-param-bir-on-bookies-complaint/articleshow/84874850.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cop action against two for shorts row||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police decided to initiate departmental proceedings against a constable and a civic volunteer posted at Kasba police station for refusing entry to a morning walker and his friend, who had wanted to lodge a complaint, because he was wearing shorts. A preliminary investigation by a divisional ACP found that they were “guilty of committing an act that showed the police in a poor light” by refusing the complainants on the grounds that they were “dressed inappropriately”. Flanked by his friend, Avishek De Biswas, a resident of Deshapriya Park, Barnik Dutta, a resident of Picnic Garden had gone to the police station on July 17 evening in shorts to report a theft at his family temple. The police personnel asked them to come back in trousers if they wished to lodge the complaint. The duo did accordingly but one of them took to the Kolkata Police’s Twitter handle and raised the issue. Prompted by the reactions on social media, cops started a probe into the incident. “Departmental proceedings have been started against the two police personnel,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan. Though reports claimed that the constable had been fined and the civic volunteer benched for a few days till further probe, senior officers refused to ascertain its authenticity. Both the Kasba police personnel have also been asked to report to the DCP’s office in this regard. The complainants expressed satisfaction over the police action but raised the question who no action has been taken against the officer at Lalbazar’s social media cell for tweeting an “objectionable reply”. “The ACP as well as the DCP of the area spoke to us. We have been informed about the departmental enquiry. Though we were told that the officer of the social media cell has been warned, we do not know whether any action was taken,” said Dutta. “The legal procedure will be followed in this case,” said an officer. Senior officers at Lalbazar clarified again that there was no dress code for complainants. “We are an emergency service. We have no such rules,” said a joint CP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-action-against-2-at-kasba-ps-for-shorts-row/articleshow/84872367.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The suspect, Vardaram Punaji Chaudhary (48) of Kondhwa, was produced before a magisterial court in Pune Cantonment and was remanded in police custody till July 31. “Since the DRV (used for storing CCTV footage) was also stolen, we suspected that someone familiar with the inside of the shop must have committed the theft. The suspect, knowing the location of the DVR, would’ve likely stolen it to destroy the evidence,” inspector Chetan More from the Kondhwa police told TOI. “We gathered information about all the past and present employees of the shop and examined their cellphone data records and bank details. The breakthrough came when we found that Rs95,000 were transferred from Chaudhary’s bank account here to another bank account in Rajasthan,” More said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ex-staffer-of-shop-arrested-for-robbery/articleshow/84874074.cms||---

The standing committee and the general body approved the project, aimed at giving electric bikes on rent to citizens. The initiative includes installing 500 charging stations. Leaders of the opposition parties claimed that the project was approved, and contracts allotted without following due process. They have demanded that the project be either scrapped or the procedural lapses be addressed before it can go forward. “The process of tendering or asking for letters of interest has not been carried out. This is not way to execute the project. It appears that BJP has come up with this initiative keeping specific contractors in mind,” Prashant Jagtap, city unit chief of Nationlist Congress Party (NCP), said. “The environment-friendly initiatives by the ruling party are good, but BJP has improperly managed all stages of this this project. Rules and regulations have not been followed,” Aba Bagul, the leader of Congress in PMC, alleged. The BJP — the ruling party in PMC -- has refuted the allegations. “The project was initiated with the aim to give the public more public transport options. Citizens will get environment friendly options to commute within city. Due administrative process has been followed,” Hemant Rasane, chairman of the civic standing committee, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/oppn-against-pmcs-e-bike-rental-project/articleshow/84874049.cms||---
---||Delhi||S corpn to rope in pvt players to maintain heritage buildings||New Delhi: For maintenance and operation of its notified heritage buildings, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is planning to rope in private players who will repair the complex and carry permissible commercial activities after paying monthly rentals. On pilot basis, an old SDMC building in Mehrauli will be leased out for a period of 20 years and for a monthly licensing fee of Rs 3 lakh. The building, which was constructed in 1910-12, was lying vacant for decades, said officials. The proposal for leasing out this building was approved in the standing committee meeting on Thursday. The civic body has around 475 heritage buildings with many of them over 100 years old. They require permission from Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) for repair/restoration, especially those falling in Grade-2 category, said officials. “We even have 16 ‘enemy properties’ that mostly belonged to people who left for Pakistan. But the corporation is not in a position to carry out repair work due to financial crunch and has decided to lease them out to concessionaires who can carry permissible business activities in lieu of repair and maintenance,” said the standing committee chairman Col BK Oberoi. “The initiative has been taken up in accordance with the details in the draft master plan for Delhi 2041, which allows conservation and restoration of such buildings by periodical repair work of heritage buildings. The Mehrauli building can be developed beautifully for commercial purposes,” said the chairman. “After a joint meeting under the chairmanship of additional commissioner recommended use of heritage buildings/premises, this premise was decided to be leased out on a licence basis for period of 20 years with an enhancement @15% in fees after every five years through e-tendering for commercial use such as running retail shopping, restaurant, guesthouses, coaching, bank, stockists and dealers of medicines, commercial offices, clinical laboratory, clinics or polyclinics and repair/other services,” stated the proposal that will now be placed in the House meeting for final approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/s-corpn-to-rope-in-pvt-players-to-maintain-heritage-buildings/articleshow/84872501.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Hyderabad||Telangana set for meeting on water share||HYDERABAD: The Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) will hold a meeting with Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (AP) in the second week of August, top sources said on Thursday. Official said the respective delegates will discuss water allocation for the current year 2021, detailed project reports for all irrigation projects and objections being raised on the projects and hydel power generation by both the states. The meeting assumes significance as the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has recently directed the KRMB to inspect the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) project site independently, without seeking help from AP and submit a report on August 9. The Telangana government even offered to provide helicopter for the KRMB team to reach the site. This would also be the first meeting after the Centre issued a gazette notification on jurisdiction and powers of both Krishna and Godavari boards and the first under new KRMB chairman MP Singh, who took charge on July 7. The board earlier proposed its meeting on July 9, but it was postponed after the Telangana government sought deferment of the meeting. It asked the KRMB to convene the meeting after July 20. The government also requested a full board meeting instead of a three-member board meeting and incorporate all the issues being raised by Telangana in the agenda such as stopping the alleged illegal construction of RLIS and water sharing issues. Irrigation special chief secretary Rajat Kumar agreed on a full board meeting, instead of the three-member committee. “We are expecting the board meeting after August 9 as the Board will have to submit the report to the NGT on August 9. The KRMB is likely to seek agenda points from both the states in a day or two,” a senior official of the Telangana irrigation department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-set-for-meeting-on-water-share/articleshow/84874872.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||Teething troubles mar vax drive at small hosps; over 94,000 get the shot in Pune Metropolitan Region||PUNE: The vaccination drive against Covid-19 is yet to gather momentum at small private hospitals and nursing homes in Pune, with most facing teething troubles in understanding various online processes involved in the initiative. Besides, as many as 94,235 residents of the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) took the Covid shot on Thursday. With the shots administered on Thursday, the total number of vaccinated beneficiaries in the PMR has gone up to 61.61 lakh. Among them, as many as 15.44 lakh beneficiaries have taken both doses of the vaccine. Small hospitals/nursing homes that had been struggling to procure Covid vaccine doses for almost two months started getting the Covid vaccine doses from Monday. Despite having the permission to inoculate, these hospitals had remained out of the vaccination drive for various reasons since June 1. “I could vaccinate only 10 beneficiaries on the first day when I could have easily managed about 50. This is because the vaccination is process-intense and technologically driven. Missing any small part on the Co-WIN portal can land us or the beneficiary in a problem. Hence, there is a lot of apprehension and anxiety,” said Nivedita Oswal, director and paediatrician of Hadapsar-based Parasmani hospital that got 1,000 doses of Covishield on Monday. Oswal emphasized on the need for some learning support from the civic authorities. “The Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department did provide the authorized hospitals some training on technical side almost a month ago. But we need some animated videos explaining the processes so that we can resort to them when we get stuck or face difficulty,” Oswal said. “A total of 12 small nursing homes in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have started inoculating beneficiaries. It will take them almost a week to achieve the target of vaccinating at least 100 people daily as there are a lot of technical isses involved in the drive,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), an association of small hospitals in Pune. “Lack of clarity and communication gaps are major deterrents, with the technical hurdles only adding to problems. Civic officials should support small hospitals with some learning videos in the initial period as it is a learning phase for them,” Patil said. Pune Municipal Corporation’s immunisation officer Suryakant Devkar said, “There will be Covishield vaccination at 197 PMC-run centres on Friday, while six centres will hold Covaxin drive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teething-troubles-mar-vax-drive-at-small-hosps-over-94k-get-the-shot-in-pmr/articleshow/84874891.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cocktail therapy on ID Hospital patients||KOLKATA: Doctors at Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital (IDBG) administered a monoclonal antibody cocktail — a new and expensive therapy to counter the virus by protecting the patient from severe infection and hospitalization — to two mildly Covid-infected senior citizens on Thursday . While at least two private hospitals have offered the therapy to a few patients, this is for the first time that the cocktail therapy is being given to the Covid-19 patients in a government health set-up in Bengal. On July 1, TOI had reported the state government’s plan to study the effectiveness of the therapy on the high-risk category of Covid-19 patients. On Thursday, it was given to an elderly couple aged 79 and 69 years from North 24 Parganas. Both of them have been mildly infected but have co-morbidities. “The two patients have co-morbidities including ischemic heart ailment and hypertension with mild infection, which are ideal conditions for administering this therapeutic drug. It is to be given on a day care basis. But since the patients arrived in the hospital late in the evening, and they are not from the city, we have decided to keep them in the hospital overnight,” said infectious diseases specialist Sayantan Banerjee. The health department has got 300 vials of the drug from the Union health ministry. The cost of a multi dose pack that can treat two patients is Rs 1.2 lakh. Three other government-run hospitals would also be assessing the effectiveness of the drug. “This drug is expected to prevent hospitalisation or the need of intensive care,” said senior clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi, one of the team to guide and coordinate with the four hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cocktail-therapy-on-id-hosp-patients/articleshow/84872428.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Pune||260km of thoroughfares in seven tehsils damaged||Pune: Altogether 48 roads, spanning 260km in length, across Bhor, Velhe, Mulshi, Maval, Khed, Ambegaon and Junnar talukas of the district, have been damaged during the last week’s heavy rainfall, the Pune circle officials of the Public Works Department (PWD) said, citing a preliminary assessment report. In terms of cost, the damage has been pegged at around Rs55 crore. Bhor, which experienced heavy to very heavy rainfall, reported most damage, with 117km length of the road battered. Besides, 190 small bridges across rivulets connecting villages and hamlets have also been damaged. A total of 46 bridges have been damaged in Mulshi tehsil alone, followed by 35 in Junnar, 33 in Bhor, 31 in Ambegaon, 16 each in Velhe and Maval and 12 in Khed. Atul Chavan, superintendent engineer, PWD, said, “Our first priority is to repair roads where landslides have cut off access to villages. Altogether 12 earth movers have been deployed to clear the debris in Bhor and Velhe. We will carry out temporary repair work on 48 roads as permanent repair is not possible because of the monsoon.” Amol Narvade, zilla parishad, member from Velhe tehsil said that the poor condition of the road has been a major concern in Velhe for the last few years. “ The PWD department needs to speed up the repair work at the earliest,” Narvade said. Chavan said, “The repair of these roads will be carried out on a war footing, considering the connectivity issue. We will have a comprehensive plan for the repair of bridges. Since rainfall has reduced significantly, our staff have expedited the work in Khed, Ambegaon and Junnar tehsils.” PWD officials claimed that repair of bridges would be a challenging task, particularly in Bhor, Velhe and Mulshi, considering accumulation of water at many places. Similar condition prevails in villages located in the backwater areas of Mulshi dam in Mulshi tehsil, Pavana and Andra dams in Maval tehsil, Bhama Askhed and Chaskaman dam in Khed tehsil, Dimbe dam in Ambegaon tehsil, and Manikdoh and Kukdi dams in Junnar tehsil, said a PWD official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/260km-of-thoroughfares-in-seven-tehsils-damaged/articleshow/84872406.cms||Sandip Dighe

The incident happened in the wee hours of Wednesday at Shel Pimpalgaon village near Chakan. The suspects — Ganesh Gundgal (28) and Amar Mohite both from Mohitewadi in Khed taluka — were arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. “A team of the Chakan police personnel were on night patrolling duty. Around 12.30am on Wednesday, the police team noticed two men standing outside an eatery. The officer asked them why they were out at this hour — when the curfew is in effect -- and why they were not wearing masks,” a police officer from the Chakan police station told TOI. “The duo claimed that they were local residents and stared hurling abuses at the policemen.

---||Pune||Heavy rain forecast for some parts of Maharashtra today||PUNE: The India Meteorological Department has downgraded its “very heavy to heavy” rain forecast for Raigad, Ratnagiri, Pune, Kolhapur and Satara to “heavy” rain on July 30. Now, the warning for heavy rains at isolated places is only restricted to Raigad, Ratnagiri, Pune (ghats) and Satara (ghats) for July 31, while Kolhapur has a light to moderate rain forecast on that day. Mumbai and Thane now have a heavy rain forecast at isolated places on July 30, and light to moderate rains thereafter. Isolated places in Raigad and Ratnagiri have a heavy rain prediction till August 1.  The off-shore trough from South Maharashtra coast to north Kerala coast did not gain much strength and its area of influence did not extend to the entire Maharashtra coastline. Also, the westerly winds from the Arabian Sea have not been that strong. The realised spells in these districts (that were earlier put on a heavy to very heavy rain warning after July 29) remained restricted to only heavy rains. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD Pune told TOI, “The well-marked low pressure area over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to upper tropospheric levels still persists. It is likely to move west-northwestwards across Jharkhand, south Bihar and southern parts of Uttar Pradesh during the next 48 hours. The westerly winds are also bringing in moisture to the state apart from the presence of the off-shore trough from South Maharashtra coast to north Kerala coast. These factors are this likely to cause heavy rains at isolated places in parts of Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra, including good rains in ghats of Pune and Satara districts for a couple of days.” The revised forecast is likely to help Maharashtra’s flood affected districts, said state officials, as very heavy rain spells here could have put these regions at risk once again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-rain-forecast-for-some-parts-of-state-today/articleshow/84872430.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kolkata||Registration of properties starts after rollout glitch||Kolkata: Three weeks after the state budget announcement on incentives to the real estate sector through stamp duty cuts and circle rate reduction, registrations of properties began after a glitch that had held up the roll-out was finally resolved earlier this week. Following the resumption of new registrations, the office of the inspector general of registration also notified rules that permit even those registering sale agreements to take benefit of the scheme by paying the applicable stamp duty at the time of possession. At present, 2% stamp duty has to be paid at the time of registering the sale deed and the remaining 4% for the properties priced below Rs 1 crore and 5% for the properties above Rs 1 crore to be paid during the transfer of title or conveyance. The 2% cut in stamp duty and 10% reduction in circle rate will be effective till October 30. Depending on the demand, registration offices in the state will be kept open on Saturdays to make up for the time lost due to a technical snag in the system. “The system was developing error during fresh query generation. It was sorted out on Saturday when he carried out trial runs. A few glitches were noticed on Monday that were ironed out. From Tuesday, new query generations have begun and will now enable people to take advantage of the incentives announced in the budget,” said inspector general of registration T Balasubramanian said. The scheme offers a saving of nearly Rs 1.2 lakh on a flat purchased for Rs 50 lakh. The effective stamp duty will be 4% for the properties below Rs 1 crore and 5% for the properties priced Rs 1 crore and above till October 30 when the scheme expires. Prior to the incentive, the stamp duty was 6% for the properties under Rs 1 crore and 7% for the rest. With 50 new properties usually registered at the four offices of Assistant Registrars of Assurances (ARAs) in Kolkata daily, that would mean a backlog of nearly 900-1,000 home-buyers waiting to get their apartments registered. The numbers could be higher still with realtors expecting sales to increase by 40% following the incentives. Balasubramanian said the registration offices would function for extended hours on Saturdays, if needed, to ensure that people were not denied of getting the benefit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/registration-of-properties-starts-after-rollout-glitch/articleshow/84872447.cms||Subhro Niyogi

A magisterial court remanded them in police custody till July 31. A nursing staffer, Rukhmaji Lavate (24), lodged a complaint with the police. A case of dacoity and charges under the Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act, 2010, have been registered. Lavate said, “I was on duty when three men visited the hospital. They told me that one of them, later identified as Omkar Mandlik, had sustained injury on his leg and requested treatment. I told them that the doctor was not on duty, but they asked for first aid.” He said, “I examined the wound, gave first-aid and told them to pay Rs500 for the charges. They refused to pay and picked up a quarrel with me. The suspects, in a fit of anger, called three accomplices and attacked me with a chair and iron pipe, robbed money from the cash box, medicines and injections before leaving the place.” Hospital owner Sachin Mundhe told TOI, “The police are conducting investigation and we are extending all possible co-operation to them.” Assistant inspector Chetan More said on Thursday, “The CCTV cameras at the hospital captured images of the six suspects. Policemen Nilesh Desai and Satish Chavan analysed the footage and identified two of them. They picked up Akshay Kolhe (24) from his Vadgaon Budruk home on Wednesday night. Kolhe revealed the names and addresses of his accomplices — Vijay Khandagale (24), Omkar Mandlik (21), Rahul Chaudhary (24), and criminals on record Shubam More (19) and Pradeep Londhe (20).” “We arrested them after establishing their involvement in the robbery on the basis of the CCTV footage,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-nabbed-for-attacking-staffers-robbing-cash-medicines-from-undri-hospital/articleshow/84872456.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Cops are probing how Bhattacharya had sought help from these cops to zero in on his targets and that he might have been involved in a murder plot. “The fake IPS officer, who posed as a NIA official, was planning the murder of one person and he was looking for someone to execute it. It has also been found that he made an assistant sub-inspector and a constable believe that he was a real IPS officer. The two cops thought that he needed the SDR,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Bhattacharya claimed that he is a member of a rifle club and that all his arms are licensed.

---||Delhi||No road rage, this was pre-planned murder: Kin||NEW DELHI: The family members of Ajeet Kumar, who was thrashed to death by a Delhi Police constable on June 4, have alleged that “police had cooked up the road rage and brawl story and more people were involved in this pre-planned murder”. “We kept on pleading for over a month and a half with police to probe the case. Now, suddenly in two days the cops have managed to trace the constable and the other accused. We have lost faith in police. We even took Ajeet’s friend Atul to the investigating officer Ram Naresh, but the cop took him aside and said something. We never saw Atul after that,” said Neetu, Ajeet’s sister. Neetu said on May 21 she got into an argument with Rishi Gupta, a neighbour, after drops of water fell on him while she was drying clothes in a park. The following day, when she went to complain to police about being abused and threatened by Gupta, her complaint was not entertained. She then told her elder brothers, Ajeet and Ashok, about the incident. The family alleged that Gupta and his brothers, Shiva and Gaurav, would often pick fights with them and threaten them that they had “contacts” and could do anything. Incidentally, Gaurav was the one who had recorded the video of Ajeet being thrashed by the constable. Recalling the night her brother went missing, Neetu said, “Till 8pm, we knew that he was at the vegetable market with his friends. He worked at a fruit seller’s shop at Indira Chowk. When he did not return, we thought he must have gone to a relative’s place. Later, we went to the police station, but no one heard us. We lodged a missing complaint saying Rishi and Shiva must have done something.” “After getting no response from the local cops, we posted our complaints everywhere and later met senior officers. What did not happen in over a month occurred within just two days for reasons best known to police,” added Neetu. It was also claimed by the family that Rishi had approached them after Ajeet went missing asking Neetu to take back the police complaint or they would harm the family. “Rishi wanted to compromise. To show us that he could do anything, he called up someone and asked that person to send a video. This was the video of my brother getting thrashed, which went viral later. If he had the video, how is it possible that police did not know or was it that they purposely did not investigate it?” Neetu asked. Ajeet is survived by his mother, two older brothers and a younger sister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-road-rage-this-was-pre-planned-murder-kin/articleshow/84874923.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NGO carries out spraying, fogging in areas skipped in NMC dengue survey||Nagpur: NGO Janhit has once again taken on itself the task Nagpur Municipal Corporaton is supposed to carry out. Amid prevalence of dengue cases in every fifth home in parts of West Nagpur, volunteers from Janhit are spraying larvicide, clearing water contamination and creating awareness among residents. The NGO alleged that the civic officials merely carried out a token survey, and most of the homes and breeding spots were never covered in the exercise. Assistant municipal commissioner Prakash Warade said the civic teams are doing their job. “We are doing regular fogging and spraying in our jurisdiction. Sometimes people take initiatives which is good and can’t be stopped. On Thursday, we also inspected the electrical cable laying at Shankar Nagar ground. We instructed to remove the garbage from the playground. The cables will be cleared by MSEB in some time,” he said. Janhit convener Abhijit Jha, a resident of Manav Seva Nagar, said the NGO prefers to take up civic issues as he and other volunteers are from the same locality. “If my home is not in order than how can we take up the issues of elsewhere? We are seeing the sorry state of affairs and since civic body is failing in its duty we have hit the ground,” he said. Jha contested Warade’s claim saying the civic body is short of manpower and resources. “They tell us chemical is not available for spraying and fogging. On July 23 and 24, the fogging van was supposed to come in the area but it never turned up. NMC is also shortage of manpower. Sewer lines are overflowing. But there are no one to de-choke them. The teams come and survey only a few homes. I request the assistant commissioner to personally come and see the situation,” he said. Regarding dengue patients, Jha said every other home they visited had a fever patient especially children. “People are going to local doctors for treatment and staying at home. NMC’s full focus is on Covid. Decision for vector-borne diseases are taken in high level meetings but never implemented,” he said. Meanwhile, divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Varma held a review meeting and instructed to inspect and take preventive measures at construction sites and open land where water has accumulated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngo-carries-out-spraying-fogging-in-areas-skipped-in-nmc-dengue-survey/articleshow/84872533.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

These include haphazard parking of vehicles, including autorickshaws, along the 6m-wide road, illegal hawking and nuisance created by beggars and youths riding bikes at high speed. Around 15,000 people reside in the 35 housing societies in the lanes and bylanes of the busy chowk connecting Anandpur Charitable Trust, NIBM link road and other areas. Nine of these societies have, for the first time, come together to form the “Guru Nanak Housing Societies’ Association”. They have launched a WhatsApp group for sharing civic issues and held a meeting with their elected representatives at Ashwini Plaza in lane number 11 of the chowk. Resident Jayesh Shroff said, “Large number of people visit a clinic and nearby shops and park their vehicles in a haphazard manner. It has become difficult for us to drive because the narrow road gets blocked at peak hours. Moreover, hawkers and beggars create nuisance in the area. Also, autorickshaw drivers park their vehicles, looking for passengers. We have been fighting for thev redressal of our grievances for the past five years, but in vain.” Meera Mainkar said, “There is no scope for widening the internal Vasantrao Mane road or lane. Those travelling in cars often get stranded during peak hours.” Another resident, Sanjay Mane, said, “Bike-borne youths ride at high speed at night. The noise emanating from the silencers of their high-end bikes has made our lives miserable. We don’t know why the youths create nuisance here. We want the police to act against them.” PMC corporator Nanda Lonkar told TOI, “A proposal will soon be initiated to make Salunke Vihar Road a hawker-free zone and shift the hawkers to the PMC market. Plans are on cards to install dividers to decongest traffic on the road. I will write to the traffic police to take action against vehicles parked in the lane. I will request the Kondhwa police to intensify night patrolling and take action against youths creating nuisance. The civic body will be soon put up no parking sign boards in the lane. We are also planning to initiate a proposal to install CCTV cameras in the lanes around the ABC Farm chowk.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parking-pain-illegal-hawkers-plague-residents-of-kondhwa/articleshow/84872472.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Kolkata||UG admission: Jadavpur University to toe government line||KOLKATA: The government has turned down the appeal of Jadavpur University to allow some sort of screening method like online interview or group discussion for admission to under graduate courses and directed vice chancellor Suranjan Das to follow the government’s guidelines which clearly rules out any admission test or online interview due to the pandemic. In a meeting of humanities and science faculties on Thursday evening, the government’s decision was conveyed to the heads of the departments who had proposed various methods to screen the candidates to evaluate their aptitude in the subject they have applied for. In the meeting it was also decided to admit the students on the basis of their results in class X and XII. The response of the education department requests the vice chancellor to follow the government memorandum issued on July 13 which clearly rules out any admission test and online interview or counselling but admission based on merit. Heads of several departments had requested vice chancellor Das to work out something to carry out some sort of screening before admitting candidates to various UG courses as the markings of various boards were “not scientific and did not convey a student’s aptitude in pursuing a particular subject”. Some departments suggested online test while others proposed an online interview and give it at least 20% weightage during admission. But the university will not be conducting any type of test or other screening method. This was conveyed to all the heads from humanities and science in a meeting on Thursday. “The admission to under graduate courses will be conducted abiding by the higher education department’s guidelines,” said Snehamanju Basu, registrar of the university. Various departments of the university have already drawn up the eligibility criteria factoring in marks in class X and class XII and how much weightage for each examination. The criteria will be uploaded on the university’s website in a couple of days. Jadavpur University has the intake capacity of 981 at UG level in both science and humanities taken together. “The decision will adversely impact academic excellence of the institution,” said Partha Pratim Roy, secretary of Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ug-admission-ju-to-toe-government-line/articleshow/84872512.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: High steel prices eating away profits of domestic industry||RAJKOT: The skyrocketing price of steel has badly dented the profit margins of domestic companies belonging to the engineering and pipe manufacturing industries. The price rise has been fuelled by high exports. The Indian steel manufacturers are exporting around 50% of their produce because of good demand in the USA and China. According to the industry players, the prices have increased by a whopping 60% in the last one year and now they want a ban on export to save the domestic small and medium scale industry. Kutch’s pipe manufacturers are facing problems because of continuous steel price rise. Nimish Phadke, managing director of Federation of Kutch Industrial Association (FOKIA), said that export volume needs to be reconsidered. “In current financial year major steel suppliers have exported 50% of their production resulting in shortage for domestic consumers. We request the government to ban exports for six months for the survival of small domestic players. This is the steepest price since 2008,” Phadke said. Sources said that from Rs 36,500 per ton in July 2020 the price of steel has zoomed to Rs 60,000 at present. With steel being its primary raw material, Rajkot’s engineering industry is bearing the brunt of the steep price rise. Brijesh Dudhagara, former vice president of Rajkot engineering association, said that the profit margins have gone down drastically due to rising price of steel. “We can’t bear the high cost because currently we are not in a condition to recover proportionate price from our customers. I am paying Rs 20 per kg higher for steel but I recover only Rs 11 from my customer as he is not ready to pay more. Prices of some other raw materials have also gone up which is eating away our profit,” Dudhagara said. The demand for engineering products in the domestic market has decreased by 25-30% because of the price rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/high-steel-prices-eating-away-profits-of-domestic-industry/articleshow/84870238.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Kolkata||Bandel boy tops AIIMS entry test, Malda girl seventh||KOLKATA/MALDA: A graduate from Medical College Hospital Kolkata (MCHK) topped the Institutes of National Importance Combined Entrance Test (INI-CET) this year. This all-India competitive examination allows an MBBS doctor to step into a few select elite medical institutes like AIIMS New Delhi to study post-graduation. Amartya Sengupta, who ranked first in INI-CET, is preparing to take up general surgery for his post-graduation at AIIMS New Delhi. “I am quite excited at the prospect of getting into an institute like AIIMS. I would like to study general surgery and later on do my super specialty course in neurosurgery,” said Sengupta. The Bandel resident had passed his Class-X board examination with 96% marks while he scored 97.25% in Class XII from Don Bosco School Bandel before bagging an MBBS seat at MCHK after cracking the WBJEE. The pandemic hit last year just when he started his internship at the state’s first tertiary level Covid hospital. As a part of internship he, like other fellow interns, had to take care of patients in the Covid-19 wards. Another medical graduate from Malda, Dhouli Jha, has ranked seventh in the same examination. Daugther of school teachers Chanchal and Puspita Jhashe, she had secured more than 90% in both Madhyamik and Higher Secondary. Ranked 219 in Joint Entrance, she got a an MBBS seat at NRS Medical College in 2014. Dhouli completed her internship last year and prepared for INI-CET from her Malda home. “I was confident of cracking the test but to be seventh among 40,000-odd candidates was beyond imagination,” Dhouli candidly told TOI. She aspires to pursue her masters in Medicine and get into research later. Her younger sister Dyuti too is studying MBBS from National Medical College. “I must return to Malda and serve people here with my knowledge,” said Dhouli. Apart from the two, others, including Subhajit Roy, Bodhisattwa Midhra and Pradip Maiti — all MBBS graduates from Bengal — ranked 27, 80 and 84, respectively. What makes INI-CET different from NEET-PG examination is that the first is meant for entry to post-graduation courses to only a few medical institutions, including AIIMS New Delhi, PGI Chandigarh and Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, (JIPMER) Puducherry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bandel-boy-tops-aiims-entry-test-malda-girl-seventh/articleshow/84872575.cms||Subhro Maitra

The 49-year-old complainant is a tailor at a garment factory at Ulhasnagar in Thane district. He spent all his savings and also borrowed money from his friends to pay the trio. The money was paid partly in cash and partly through online transfers between June 2018 and January 2020. For the past year-and-a-half, the complainant asked the trio for a refund as his son and nephew did not get any jobs. “The man on Wednesday filed an FIR,” an officer said. The complainant told TOI he and the suspect from Bhosari met through a common friend about five years ago. “The man told me that he was a social worker with good contacts in Mantralaya and could help my son and nephew get jobs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/raigad-man-loses-rs-22l-to-job-bait/articleshow/84872538.cms||Mihir Tanksale

We zeroed on Jaffri because he was not found at his residence. His whereabouts were also not known,” senior inspector Ganesh Mane from the crime branch (unit VI) said on Thursday. “Policeman Kanifnath Karkale received reliable information that Jaffri had visited his wife in Kondhwa. A police team led by assistant inspector Narendra Patil took Jaffri into custody on July 24. The suspect, during questioning, told police that he was riding pillion on the motorcycle and snatched chains from women in different parts of the city in 2019, 2020 and 2021,” Mane said. “Jaffri revealed that he sold the loot to Soni. We arrested the jeweller on July 26 and recovered 14 tolas of gold chain. We have also recovered a stolen motorcycle used in the crime. We have launched a hunt for his accomplice, who is on the run,” he added.

---||Delhi||Fee hike row: Delhi govt set to take over another school||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has decided now to take over the management of another school having announced on Wednesday its intention to assume control of Apeejay School in Sheikh Sarai. On Thursday, it sent a notice to Bal Bharati Public School in Rohini with the concurrence of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. The state government has taken this decision after the institution allegedly failed to comply with the directive to withdraw its “arbitrary” fee hike. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia reiterated on Thursday that the Kejriwal government would not allow schools to increase fees in this manner. “If any school takes such steps, we will take strict action against them,” said Sisodia. According to the notice sent to Bal Bharati, “During the detailed inspection of the records, the Directorate of Education found that the total funds with the school for the year 2017-2018 were Rs 23,81,82,958. Out of this, Rs 20,94,38,802 was estimated to be spent. … the school management had a net surplus of about Rs 2,87,44,156. After this, the Directorate of Education concluded that there was no need for the school management to increase the fees. In this regard, the Directorate refused to accept the fee hike proposed by the school for the academic session 2017-2018.” While the school had to adjust the hiked fees collected in 2017-18, the government received complaints from the parents that the school had increased the fees several times in 2018-19 and 2019-20, and also asked them to deposit the arrears. The order states, “Consequently, DoE issued a notice to the school on May 10, 2019, asking why the recognition of the school should not be cancelled or why the government should not take over the management of the school.” As the response of the school wasn’t satisfactory, Delhi government has decided to initiate the process of taking over the management of the school. The school reacted through a statement, saying, “We are yet to receive any communication from DoE and will consider the entire issue once we receive a direct communication. Bal Bharati Public School has always functioned within the provisions of DSEAR and followed all the judgements given by Hon’ble High Court of Delhi on related issues in the past and will continue to do so in the future also. We would like to assure parents of our students that we will always protect the interests of our students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-set-to-take-over-another-school/articleshow/84875078.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BMC calls off talks with Dr Reddy’s for Sputnik V vaccines||MUMBAI: The BMC has finally abandoned its plan to buy Sputnik V vaccines for the city. After rejecting all nine bids for its global Expression of Interest (EOI) and closing it in June without any success, the BMC had reached out to Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to buy Sputnik V vaccines on an experimental basis. But the civic body decided to give up the idea as the company was unable to commit enough doses within a specified timeline. The BMC wanted to procure one crore vaccine doses, but all nine proposals were rejected since the suppliers could not submit required documents, especially to establish any direct connection with the manufacturers, said an official. Seven of these firms had offered to supply Sputnik V. The BMC had subsequently said in a statement that it held talks with Dr Reddy’s Laboratory which has the sole distribution rights for the Russian Sputnik vaccine in India, and the company had agreed to supply it on an ‘experimental basis’ by June end. “Dr Reddy's Laboratories indicated willingness to supply some stock of Sputnik vaccines on an experimental basis by the end of June. But they could not commit on the quantity of doses. Yet, the company wanted to charge the BMC for supplying the vaccines on an experimental basis. There was no clarity on the timeline too, so we have called off the talks,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects). “There were also logistical issues since a separate cold shortage would have to be set up for Sputnik vaccines. Besides, the Central government has changed the vaccine policy and there is enough supply now. So there is no need to buy vaccines from Dr Reddy’s,” Velrasu further added. An official pointed out since the cold storage facility required for Sputnik vaccines is not the same as the one required for Covaxin and Covishield, the civic body had decided to procure a small quantity of doses on an experimental basis, and scale it up later. In a joint statement in June, the Russian Development Investment Fund and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had said Dr Reddy’s had sole distribution rights for the first 250 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine in India. “We are currently in our silent period, and would not like to comment,” Dr Reddy’s Laboratories said responding to a query from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-calls-off-talks-with-dr-reddys-for-sputnik-v-vax/articleshow/84875029.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Cash and valuables worth Rs30.52 lakh were recovered from them. “The prime suspect, a resident of Sagar in Madhya Pradesh,has cases of robbery and dacoity are registered against him in Maharashtra, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. There were rumours about the doctor having stashed huge cash at his bungalow. This prompted them to plot and execute the dacoity,” Pune rural superintendent of police (SP) Abhinav Deshmukh said on Thursday. The gang had robbed cash of Rs50 lakh and ornaments worth Rs16.7 lakh from the bungalow of Heeralal Khandelwal (73) around 2am on June 17 after threatening Khandelwal and his 66-year-old wife and forcing them to hand over the keys of their locker. The suspects then collected cash and gold ornaments after binding their hands and legs. The bungalow is located at Pradhan Park in Lonavala city. The police identified the arrested suspects as Hemant Kushwah (24), Prashant Kushwah alias Patel (27), Daulat Patel (24), Vijay Patel (21), Govind Kushwah (18) and Pradeep Dhanuk (28), all residents of Sagar in Madhya Pradesh, Sanjay Shendge (47), Sunil Shejwal (40), Mukesh Rathod (45) and Dinesh Ahire (38), all residents of Ghatkopar (West), Mumbai, Ravindra Pawar (42) of Andheri (West), Mumbai, Shyamsundar Sharma (43) of Goregaon (East), Mumbai, Vikash Gurav (34) of Vakola, Mumbai, Nathu Vishwasrao – Deshmukh (52) of Maval and Sagar Dhotre (25) of Hadapsar.

---||Kolkata||Two Kolkata students and one from Kharagpur in CLAT top 50||KOLKATA: Three students from Bengal have made it to CLAT top 50 — two of them are from the city and from the same school. All India ranks 8, 24 and 35 have been bagged by the three boys. All three chose law because they felt country is in dire need of good lawyers. While the Bengal topper (rank 8) Ameya Deb is from St Agnes School Kharagpur, the other two, Debarshi Ghosh Dastidar and Rohit Ray are from the city and both studied in DPS Ruby Park. Ameya’s grandfather is a senior lawyer, who practises at the Calcutta High Court. So, from a very young age he wanted to be a lawyer, too. He had scored a high 97.5% in ISC and studied science in his Plus II but he was determined not to coach for engineering or medicine. “I want to do courtroom practice and do not want to be a corporate lawyer,” Ameya said. “Our legal system is mired in problems and I wish to do my bit to help people who are suffering for lack of legal help,” he said. His first choice is National Law School Bangalore. Debarshi Ghosh Dastidar, who has ranked 24th, had passed his CBSE XII last year and did not enrol into any undergraduate programme for the whole year so that he could prepare for his CLAT exams. “My parents were very scared and thought that I was experimenting too much. But despite my 94% in CBSE XII (science), I did not want to study engineering/medicine. I didn’t get admission in my desired stream (economics) in either St Xavier’s and Jadavpur University. In Presidency, I got physics but didn’t want it because I was only focussed on CLAT preparations. Thankfully, my experiment has paid off,” Debarshi said. His preferred institutes are NLS Bangalore, NUJS, Nalsar University, Hyderabad, NLIU Bhopal and NLU Jodhpur. Despite the fact that his parents are doctors, 35th rank holder Rohit Ray did not want to be one. He studied humanities in his Plus II and prepared for CLAT. “I want to study law and see what the industry wants, but I am not sure if I will become a lawyer. It is possible that after completing my law course, I might branch out into something else,” he said. Rohit would choose NUJS because he didn’t want to leave the city. “I want a more balanced life and that is possible when I am home,” he said, adding that he wants to continue being a track and field and football person. He was in his school team for both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-kol-students-and-one-from-kharagpur-in-clat-top-50/articleshow/84872614.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Mumbai||Five youths film men in the buff, extort, sell risque videos||MUMBAI: Five youths, two of them engineers and one a minor, were recently arrested for allegedly running a nationwide racket in which they filmed men in the buff, indulged in sextortion and sold the obscene video clips on the internet. Police said the accused had made video clips of nearly 250 men and the money was stashed in bank accounts in India and Nepal. Some of their victims are models and celebrities from TV and film industry. They were picked up from Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh by the Mumbai cyber police teams. Each one had a defined role. “Two of them operated profiles on social media where they posed as women and befriended men,” said a cyber police officer. Over time, they would start sexting with the men and convince them to share their obscene videos, with the assurance that all interaction was confidential. The accused also made video calls and filmed their targets, using technology, the police said. The clips were used to blackmail victims for money. Two other accused had floated a group on a messaging app where they sold the video clips to at least 80 people so far. The cyber police have come across 12 accounts on social media platforms besides six email accounts operated by gang members posing as women. “The accused used apps and other technology to convince targets that a woman was calling up,” said an officer, but could not immediately specify details of the technology or apps used. Police have also come across online posts advertising sale of obscene video clips. “Around Rs 30 lakh from sale of videos has been traced. Some of the sale proceeds were routed through digital wallets operated under fake identities,” said the officer. An FIR was filed on June 5 and the probe went on for over a month. “We urge citizens not to respond to video calls, social media messages or texts from strangers,” said DCP (cyber police) Rashmi Karandikar. “If anyone is blackmailing you for money, approach the nearest police station and lodge a complaint. Do not pay up out of fear,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-5-youths-film-men-in-the-buff-extort-sell-risque-videos/articleshow/84875114.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Housing sales may see 20-35% rise this monsoon, says report||PUNE: A report by real estate consultants JLL has predicted that the ongoing monsoon may result in a 20-35% uptick in housing sales. The report said a forecast of good rains has provided some room for monetary policymakers to keep rates unchanged. The prediction is a departure from usual business trends in the construction and housing industry during the monsoon months, as uncertainties and disruptions in construction and supply chains depress housing sales. The report added that a good monsoon may also provide fuel to other economic indicators, such as sales of electronic items and other white goods. In its observations, JLL said forecasts of a good monsoon, which is being realized in most parts of the country, has allowed Reserve Bank of India to keep rates low, with inflation also being largely in check. It added that banks maintaining historically low rates on home loans — mostly under 7% — will keep attracting more buyers to the housing market. However, the report also warned that a possible third wave of the ongoing pandemic in India may upset these projections. “The residential real estate sector can expect buoyancy in the sales of residential properties in the monsoon and the upcoming festive season this year, just as last year where there was a 34% jump in the corresponding period compared to the immediately preceding quarter. The jump in sales can be 20-35% this year depending on how the pandemic pans out. If there is a third wave in the next few months, other economic disruptions could impact sales growth negatively, which may then hover around the lower range of our expectations,” said Samantak Das, head of research at JLL. The report added that the upcoming festive season in parts of India will be a key driver in the housing market, especially in Maharashtra, which has the country’s two most active housing markets — the Mumbai and Pune metropolitan regions. During house-hunting, JLL added, buyers are also looking at considerations of drainage and waterlogging, due to cases of heavy rainfall and flooding in recent times. Branded real estate at 9.25 crore sqft: Anarock Real estate consultancy Anarock has estimated that Tier I, II, and III cities will see launches from reputed and branded real estate entities accounting of for 92.5 million (9.25 crore) sqft over the next two years.

The state department of civil aviation on Thursday announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Ahmedabad-based Aero Freyr Inc., to set up an aircraft manufacturing unit with flight testing and MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) facilities in Gujarat. The recently incorporated company has invested Rs 150 crore to set up a manufacturing facility for two-seater and four-seater aircraft and air ambulances.  “It is encouraging that the Gujarat civil aviation department today signed an MoU for the setting up an aircraft manufacturing unit with flight testing and MRO facilities in Gujarat with Aero Freyr Inc,” states a social media post by Gujsail India. Captain Ajay Chauhan, CEO, Gujsail India, said, “Foreseeing buoyant demand for smaller aircraft for private and other uses in the future, the manufacturing facility is being set up.” The manufacturing plant is currently under construction on a 8.5-bigha land parcel near the airfield at Amreli. “The airfield will be used for testing the aircraft,” Chauhan added. Abhimanyu Detha, CEO, Aero Freyr Inc, said, “We plan to complete manufacturing of our first aircraft by the end of this year. The plant will also be used for assembling helicopters and fixed wing gliders. Smaller aircraft are useful for sporting activities, aerial surveys, corporate use, defence training and pilot training centres.” The company, Detha said, plans to invest Rs 500 crore in the next three to four years in a phased manner. “Beside manufacturing small aircraft, the company will also carry out partial production and assembly of mid-sized aircraft, with components imported,” he added. Aero Fryer Inc has entered technology partnerships with companies in Serbia, Slovenia, the US, Germany and Italy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aircraft-unit-to-come-up-in-amreli-with-rs-150cr-investment/articleshow/84872666.cms||Niyati Parikh

The AP governemnt is not authorised to take water from Krishna to outside the basin,” Telangana engineer-in-chief (irrigation) C Muralidhar said in a letter to KRMB on Wednesday. He said Telangana has been continuously addressing KRMB and the Union jal shakti ministry to restrain AP from diverting Krishna water to outside the basin and give priority to in-basin requirements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-wants-krishna-water-in-5050-ratio/articleshow/84875155.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The principals, though, have raised doubts over the lack of teachers and infrastructure. Earlier, the schools had to seek permission from West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education even to admit an extra student after exhausting the 275 admission limit. “The schools which have up to class XII can admit up to 400 now. Many headmasters approached us requesting us to increase the limit,” said an official of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education. The state has close to 650 schools till class XII.

Considering the ongoing restrictions imposed by the Maharashtra government in view of Covid, the lectures would be conducted in online format only.A circular issued by newly appointed registrar Raju Hiwase clarified that the colleges shouldn’t wait for summer-2021 examination results and grant provisional admissions to the students, subject to their clearing of papers.The circular wouldn’t be applicable to the professional courses whose admissions are conducted by the Directorate of Technical Education through its State Common Entrance Cell like engineering, law, pharmacy, hotel management and others. The NU has asked colleges offering professional courses to commence their academic session from September 1.According to NU officials, the first year admissions would be delayed inordinately, as the Maharashtra State Board is yet to declare standard XII results. Quoting senior officials like VC and pro-VC, TOI on June 26 had reported on NU’s plans to start the new sessions for second, third, and subsequent years from August.Though the Covid cases have significantly dropped in Vidarbha in comparison with the peak in April-May, NU officials said there was no clarity from the government on resuming the physical classroom teaching.Even BOEE director Prafulla Sable had already told TOI that the forthcoming winter 2021 examination was most likely to be conducted online, considering the ongoing phase-III restrictions.The academic session usually begins in June last week, but since last and this year, it was delayed inordinately owing to lockdown. In fact, last year entire classes were held online and even the practicals. The delay in conducting last year’s summer and winter exams had added to the woes of the students, particularity undergoing professional courses, who were suffering as they were unable to perform practicals, the officials told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/varsity-asks-colleges-to-start-online-classes-from-august-2/articleshow/84870432.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Ahmedabad||GMB to call another pre-bid meeting for Nargol port||Ahmedabad: Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), the regulator for non-major ports and maritime activities in Gujarat, has once again decided to call a pre-bid meeting with the port developers who have evinced interest in the upcoming Nargol port in Gujarat. The decision comes at a time when GMB has missed the July 29 deadline for responding to queries raised by four companies at a pre-bid meeting on July 22.Developers, including Dubai-based D P World, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), Essar Ports and J M Baxi Group, have together submitted over 200 queries to GMB. The maritime regulator did not respond to queries during the pre-bid meeting on July 22 and instead assured that they would be answered online on GMB’s official website by July 29. “It seems that the stakeholders were not fully satisfied with the interaction with GMB officials in July. They wish to meet senior officials of the maritime board so we have decided to hold a pre-bid meeting once again on August 5. The presence of senior officials is essential as some of the queries pertain to policy decisions of the state,” said a GMB official. He said that the regulator would put out the response on their official website by August 12. This does not seem to make much sense, said a government official aware of the matter. “The queries have already been submitted in writing by the four companies ahead of the pre-bid meet on July 22. All the authorities have to do is respond to them. I can’t understand the point behind calling another pre-bid meet,” the official added. An expert in the port sector said that GMB seemed to be buying more time given their failure to respond to queries in the July meeting. The request for proposal (RFP) document for development of greenfield port at Nargol on BOOT (Build, Operate, Own and Transfer) basis has several grey areas which could question the viability of the project, said an official working with a port developer. One of the major areas of concern for the developers is that no compensation shall be payable by GMB upon transfer of the asset at the end of concession period. This should be changed and fair value be given as mentioned in the BOOT policy, said sources. Other areas of concern include development of rail and road infrastructure in the vicinity of the port and the lease rental policy, among others. The state government has put the development of the proposed Nargol port on fast track after GMB cancelled the work given to Cargo Motors for the development of the port. This was after the company missed several deadlines for project execution. The government has decided to invite fresh bids by inviting global bids to develop Nargol port with an initial investment of Rs 3,800 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gmb-to-call-another-pre-bid-meeting-for-nargol-port/articleshow/84872696.cms||---

According to Bor Talav police of Bhavnagar, Falguni Rawal, a resident of Kumbharvada area, ended life by hanging herself at her residence on Wednesday. Before taking the extreme step, Falguni had called her mother, who lives in Ahmedabad, and informed about the harassment she was facing from her in-laws. Falguni’s father Bharat Dhandhukia lodged a complaint against her husband Vipul, mother-in-law Madhu, father-in-law Chiman and brother-in-law Umesh. “Three years ago, Falguni and Vipul fell in love and got married against the wishes of their families. Later, Falguni’s parents, fearing backlash from their community, settled in Ahmedabad and cut all ties with their daughter. But a few months ago, Falguni visited her ailing mother and told her parents about being harassed by her in-laws over petty issues,” a source said. Falguni’s parents even convinced her husband to settle in Ahmedabad with them. But the move did not go down well with her in-laws. A few days ago, Falguni and Vipul came to Bhavnagar to attend a function. Falguni’s in-laws again started harassing her and asked the couple to shift back to Bhavnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/husband-in-laws-held-for-abetting-24-yr-olds-suicide-in-bhavnagar/articleshow/84870528.cms||---

In the last two years, the institute has significantly reduced its carbon footprint by initiatives such as door-to-door waste collection, replacing RO water purifiers with UV water purifiers among others. “The culture of a clean campus will not only make IIT Hyderabad a better place to live, but when students leave the campus, this culture will develop wherever they go....it is our duty towards nature, to keep it intact for the future generation. Resource Recovery Park (RRP) is one such small step in this direction”, IIT Hyderabad director BS Murty said, on the facility commissioned recently. Murty said the campus already has a functional sewage treatment plant based on membrane bioreactor technology. The solid waste generated on the campus was separated into dry and wet categories. Wet waste, generated in hostel mess, is shredded and fed into a biogas digester. The generated biogas is used in the students’ dining facility to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. The wet waste from the residential areas is sent to the vermicompost facility at the RRP. The compost is used for gardening purposes. Likewise, all biodegradable wastes were moved to the pits/windrow platform for composting. The institute process biodegradable wastes using microbial and vermicomposting techniques. Once processed, the compost is passed through a sieving machine to remove foreign particles and bigger chunks of waste. The compost is then stored in the compost storage room and later used as fertiliser, the institute said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-campus-gets-new-waste-mgmt-system/articleshow/84875756.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Andheri, Borivli & Bhandup still top Covid hotspots, fewer cases in south Mumbai||MUMBAI: A ward-wise breakup shows 36% of active Covid-19 cases in the city continue to be restricted to five wards of Mumbai’s suburbs, which include Andheri, Vile Parle East, Borivli, Kandivli and Bhandup. Cases in the five wards total 1,898 compared with 5,267 as on July 27, 2020. Meanwhile, A, B and C, the three wards in south Mumbai that comprise areas from Colaba to Bhuleshwar, currently have the fewest cases; B Ward (Dongri) has just eight active cases, according to civic data.  K-West and K-East, on the other hand, are the two wards that had the highest concentration of active cases even when the second wave was at its peak in May this year. Currently, active cases in the K-West Ward, which includes parts of Andheri West, Juhu and Oshiwara, total 467 while K-East, which comprises parts of Andheri, Jogeshwari and Vile Parle East, has 314. Officials said this has a lot to do with the large population of these two wards. “Both these wards have a huge population ranging between seven and eight lakh, respectively. By comparison, wards such as A, B and C with fewer cases have a population of under two lakh, if one goes by the census data,” said a civic official. One reason for the high number of cases in K-East is the ward houses airport cargo operations, the Marol police camp as well as Seepz, which have seen fewer restrictions, considering that these fall under the essential category. According to Census 2011, A Ward has a population of 1.85 lakh while K-East has 8.2 lakh and K-West 7.5 lakh. Marol resident and activist Godfrey Pimenta said that implementation of restrictions was lax on the ground. “Hawkers and shops operated all through the day without any restrictions in several areas. This defeated the entire purpose of restrictions, of allowing shops to operate only till 4pm, as people kept stepping out thereafter as well for making purchases,” said Pimenta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-andheri-borivli-bhandup-still-top-covid-hotspots-fewer-cases-in-sobo/articleshow/84867972.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||Delay in relocation of families from Kawal reserve can hamper conservation: Experts||Hyderabad: Inordinate delay in relocation of about 142 families from Rampur and Maisampet villages of Telangana’s Kawal tiger reserve and encroachment activities by non-tribals, can hamper the tiger conservation efforts in the state, said experts. Though it has been over nine years since Kawal was declared as the 42nd tiger reserve in India, the officials concerned are yet to take up relocation of villages, located in the core area of the tiger reserve. “Relocation of villages from tiger reserve where there are chances of man-animal conflict is an important measure towards improvement of the habitat. Village relocation wherever necessary also helps realise the full potential of the tiger reserve to support tigers and their prey,” said a forest officer, under condition of anonymity. On the other hand, Dr Chelmala Srinivasulu, a wildlife expert and Zoology professor at Osmania University said, “If there are some villages which are willingly wanting to come out, government machinery should facilitate that. The problem mainly arises when people from the fringe villages take their cattle to the core areas. That is a bigger problem.” “If there are small hamlets that are self-contained and people are sustaining themselves on small scale agriculture produce within the earmarked area, it should not be a problem. Also, non-tribals occupying and illegally expanding their agriculture activities needs to be controlled,” added Dr Srinivasulu. “We have been living in the forest for generations but lately, our lives have become stifling here. We beg the government to look into our lives as all our cultivable lands have been encroached. We have to walk for kilometres through the wilderness for almost everything, from going to hospitals to schools or shops,” said Arka Sita Bai, a resident of Maisampet village. In a strong letter to Telangana government on May 28, 2020, Nishant Verma, the deputy inspector general of forests for the NTCA wrote, “I am directed to inform that this authority (NTCA) had sanctioned the funds for an amount of 852 lakhs (central share) towards voluntary village relocation of Maisampet and Rampur. These villages had to be relocated as per the voluntary village relocation guidelines of this authority but till date, the Utilisation Certificate (UC) and the physical and financial progress report vis-à-vis the funds released has not been received by this authority.” However, when contacted, Nirmal district collector Musharraf Ali Faruqui said, “The relocation of both these villages is on high priority and it is under process. The shifting and the RNR (Rehabilitation & Resettlement) have to be notified. Once it is notified, we will immediately conduct a survey as of that date and start the relocation. This process will take about three to four months once the survey is conducted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/delay-in-relocation-of-families-from-kawal-reserve-can-hamper-conservation-experts/articleshow/84875260.cms||Moulika.KV

The police had to be called in to manage the crowd and bring the situation under control. According to the staff at the centre, while slots were allotted to only 800 people — through the online system — 1,200 others walked in, on getting to know about the availability of Covaxin at the venue. Most had taken their first shot in June. “Soon after we opened the doors of the function hall (in West Marredpally) at 9am, people started to forcibly enter the premises. Though we tried to convince them to maintain a queue, our pleas fell on deaf ears. That’s when we had to call the police,” said a staff stationed at the centre. A total of 30 health staff have been deputed to man the five counters to register names, issue tokens and administer the vaccine. On an average, the centre gets between 500 and 800 people. “These people had taken the first dose of Covaxin in June as part of vaccination drive and now they have completed 28 days. But since we have a quote of 800, we issued tokens to only those many people and administered them the dose,” said in-charge medical officer Dr Pavan Kumar. However, some claimed that they did not get the jab despite booking a slot online. “I booked my slot on CoWin and came here as per schedule. Yet, I could not get a token even after waiting in queue for an hour,” said TP Shastry a 48-year-old IT professional from West Marredpally. From the same locality, P V Raju too had to return without being vaccinated. “After seeing the situation here, I have decided to opt for paid vaccine instead of free vaccine. There is no social distancing being maintained here and many are even seen without masks,” he said. Raju had booked a slot online and turned up at the centre by 8.30am. Some even complained about poor arrangements and said there was no provision for drinking water or covered waiting area outside the centre. “Officials should either increase the number of centres or doses to meet the demand,” said an infuriated resident from Addagutta. Around 800 people who failed to get a shot on Thursday were given a token for Friday. The in-charge medical officer signed every token to avoid an inconvenience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chaos-at-marredpally-centre-as-2k-turn-up-for-second-dose/articleshow/84875621.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Hyderabad||Asymptomatic diabetes the new concern for Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: In a worrying trend that has left health experts baffled, hundreds of asymptomatic diabetes cases are coming to light during routine health checks across Hyderabad with no tell-tale symptoms of blood sugar increase, said doctors. Majority of new patients do not have any of the typical symptoms of diabetes like frequent urination, fatigue, excessive thirst or hunger, weight loss and blurry vision. Nutritionists and diabetologists say it could be linked to the change in food intake and limited or no exercise during the pandemic. Take the case of 47-year-old Suhasini Kumar, who had a blackout at home for 45 seconds and her family insisted on a master health check-up the next day. “During the check-up, my blood sugar levels were higher. Since I don’t have a family history of diabetes, the doctors decided to go for a more fool-proof test which proved that I indeed have moderately high blood sugar,” Kumar who lives in Banjara hills said. “It was a jolt for me as I never had the usual signs diabetes symptoms and had I not gone for tests, I would not have known that I am asymptomatic diabetic. Thankfully with change in food and lifestyle, I can reverse it, I am told,” she added. Doctors say more and more people during the lockdown have developed higher blood sugar and are completely in the dark about it. Even overweight children as young as 12 years old are testing positive to asymptomatic diabetes and pre-diabetes. “In the last one and a half year with restricted physical activity and same amount of calorie intake leading to drastic weight gain, we are seeing many people who come for regular check-ups and have a chance discovery of diabetes,” said K Sunitha Premalatha, chief dietician, Yashoda hospitals. She gave an example of chance discovery of pre-diabetes in a 23-year-old who came with leg swelling on Thursday. The boy’s mother too was detected to be diabetic during the check-up. “When we ask for typical symptoms, they don’t have any but the common thing is restricted physical activity. Weight gain of 6-8 kg in a span of one year is seen in these patients,” she added. While a lot of importance is laid on weight gain, increase in waist size for keeping a check on diabetes, the awareness about pre-diabetes is also equally important, say doctors. Higher levels of stress during the pandemic have also played their role, believe doctors. “The number one reason for diabetes is stress. Diabetes can be stress-induced, drug-induced or even Covid-induced. Whenever high levels of stress remain unaddressed in time, it brings out hidden diabetes and hypertension,” said Dr Ashish Chauhan, senior consultant diabetologist at Apollo Hospitals, who has seen 100 new cases since the pandemic. “Many patients also have vague symptoms like depression, irritation, drowsiness, insomnia and sexual dysfunction but they don’t know that it can be a symptom due to less awareness,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asymptomatic-diabetes-the-new-concern-for-city/articleshow/84875464.cms||Amrita Didyala

Ella said they are looking at various permutations and combinations for the heterologous vaccine trials — Covaxin as the first dose and intranasal as the second dose, two doses of just nasal vaccine as well as first dose of the nasal vaccine followed by Covaxin as the second dose. “We have applied for heterologous clinical trials and are waiting for permission. When it comes, we are seeing it as a big game-changer because we will be seeing a totally different immune response that can last longer,” Ella said at the two-day 18th Annual Capital Markets Conference (CAPAM2021) organised by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI). Pointing out that nasal vaccines will be critical for stopping Covid-19 transmission, he said: “If you look at literature of late, nasal is going to be a key factor for control of disease...”...” Ella said the data from the intranasal vaccine would be available after about two to two and a half months. He added that a key advantage was that it would be very easy to produce and scale up and the company can easily produce 100 million doses per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-bio-seeks-nod-for-vax-cocktail-trials/articleshow/84875685.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The announcement was made on Thursday by the Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on the occasion of Global Tiger Day.Of the 14 tiger reserves, 3 each are from Assam and Madhya Pradesh, 2 from Tamil Nadu, and one each from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, UP, Bihar and West Bengal.The Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CA|TS) certification is a new conservation tool endorsed by Global Tiger Forum (GTF) to set minimum standards for effective management of target species for conservation of species both outside protected areas and inside. With this international recognition, the selected reserves can expect to get better funding and support from the Centre as well from players across the world.This is the first time that site assessment was carried out using CA|TS-LOG which helps visualize data and track site-based tiger conservation. India is the first country to roll this out nationally. The Global Tiger Forum (GTF) & WWF India are implementing partners of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for CA|TS assessment in India. Pench CCF & field director Ravikiran Govekar said CA|TS is a “globally accepted conservation tool that sets best practice and standards to manage tigers and encourages assessments to benchmark progress”.“The process for accreditation was underway for the past six months by an independent team of experts headed by former PCCF of Uttar Pradesh Shailesh Prasad. There were 17 parameters and we fulfilled them to get qualified for accreditation. The reserve has 40 tigers,” said Govekar. NTCA member-secretary SP Yadav said unlike management effective evaluation (MEE) of tiger reserves, CA|TS sets minimum standards for effective management of target species and to encourage assessment of these standards in relevant conservation in protected areas (PA) as well as non-PAs. In 2017, Yadav, who was then additional secretary-general of GTF, had identified Bramhapuri and Central Chanda, worst affected by man-animal conflict, for CA|TS accreditation.“Habitats which support tiger populations are the building blocks of wild tiger conservation and effectively managing them is essential for the long-term survival of wild tigers,” added Yadav.CA|TS is being implemented across 125 sites in seven tiger-bearing countries and India has the biggest number with 94 sites. Assessment was completed for 20 tiger reserves this year. The sites went through the prescribed CA|TS process of site registration through external evaluation (including verification of pieces of evidence) to accreditation. This was facilitated by the GTF & WWF India, which are the two implementing partners of the NTCA for CA|TS assessment in India. Rajesh Gopal, secretary-general, GTF, congratulated the 14 tiger reserves and said, “CA|TS accreditation is a global recognition of good tiger governance. This recognition means a lot in the context of adaptation to climate change, sustainability of ecosystem services, and safeguarding disruption of zoonotic cycles, through an umbrella species approach.” Ravi Singh, secretary-general & CEO, WWF India, said, “The CA|TS accreditation to 14 tiger reserves signifies that these reserves have achieved excellence in tiger site management. This accreditation will strengthen management practices in the sites as per international common criteria. WWF India will continue to support the CA|TS assessment process for tiger conservation landscapes.” BURNING BRIGHT* Assam: Manas, Kaziranga, & Orang.* West Bengal: Sundarbans* Bihar: Valmiki* UP: Dudhwa* MP: Panna, Kanha & Satpuda* Maharashtra: Pench* Tamil Nadu: Anamalai & Mudumalai* Kerala: Parambikulam* Karnataka: BandipurAssessed parameters: Importance and status, management, community, tourism, protection, habitat management and tiger population.70% +: Minimum requirement for consideration for accreditation How they fared: All 14 met ‘standard exceeded’ or ‘standard achieved’ in most parameters||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-reserves-get-cats/articleshow/84870893.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Delhi||Water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink? Why southwest Delhi's Rawta village is flooded with problems||NEW DELHI: Most farmers are ecstatic when the rains arrive. Not Sanjay Kumar. The 37-year-old resident of Rawta village in southwest Delhi dreads the monsoons. One heavy shower and his farm gets submerged. This year too, his investment of Rs 25,000 on paddy went to waste. Unneeded water is a bane for Rawta’s farmers throughout the year, with the runoff from the Najafgarh jheel, Najafgarh drain and wastewater from Gurgaon all making it to this side of the border. For two decades, Rawta residents have struggled with a surfeit of water, the level of which rises several feet during the monsoon season. The 5,000 villagers know Rawta has been earmarked as a special Green Development Area (GAD) in the draft Master Plan Delhi 2041, but they would be glad just to have the flooding resolved. While the people grow rice and wheat in the village, very often even the water-intensive paddy farming fails due to submergence for overlong periods. Ravi Phalswal, 32, vice-president of the newly formed residents’ welfare association, is keen to see a change in the village, but like everyone else is sceptical. “Our ancestors have been living here for decades and we have now grown up seeing no change in the civic amenities, job opportunities or urban expansion,” said Phalswal. “The only change has been the increase in the water level, a perennial problem since 2000. We earlier had inundation only in the rainy season, but now the water retains its level through the year, worsening when it rains.” Houses are now built six feet from the ground, though submerged roads remain a problem. Birender Tokas, president, Rawta RWA, alleged neglect by the area MLAs in the past. DDA too hasn’t thought it worthwhile to get the villagers’ feedback on its development policies or MPD41. “With fewer than 5,000 people, Rawta is not a vote bank here, so we are rarely given any time or attention. Garbage is cleared once a week and we still don’t get clean tap water. The nearest hospital is nearly 10km away and while a veterinary hospital exists in the village, the doctor is rarely present,” said Tokas. “DDA needs to find a solution to the biggest problem here, that of flooding, before any GAD can take place.” A dilapidated community centre also stymies efforts at holding events or social functions. While Tokas says he is somewhat aware of the Delhi MPD 2041 vision, 90% of the locals don’t know a thing about GAD and the changes it could usher in. Residents, however, are quick to suggest that if a water treatment plant was put up in Rawta, it could possibly serve large parts of Delhi while making life in the village itself more bearable. As Ramesh Kumar, a shopkeeper now having abandoned farming six year ago, reasoned, “What good are resorts or theme parks here if they are going to face the problem of flooding?” According to MPD41, low-density residential areas with a concentration of farmhouses and rustic stretches along Delhi’s border will comprise GDA. These regions will be characterised by significantly lower floor-area ratio, with much space given to green cover that will use reused wastewater, have a 100% decentralised waste facility and 30% of the energy requirement met through renewable energy sources. Paras Tyagi, co-founder of NGO CYCLE India, said that despite the extension of lal dora provisions in Rawta, the village had no sewerage, drinking water, streetlights, plus the constant despair of flooding. “In early 2000, when MPD21 was notified, farmers were sold the dreams of R-Zone and green belt in low density residential areas,” Tyagi noted. “Many sold their land and families were destroyed as money came easy and also vanished all too easily. In 2007, the urban development ministry suggested reforms for lal dora villages, but nothing was implemented and the farmers have been struggling to support their families.” Tyagi added that Rawta’s farmers were largely unaware of GDA plans or MPD41. They were more concerned about getting value out of their land. “On the one hand, illegal colonies are becoming authorised and on the other, villagers are being forced into distress sales of lal dora land owing to adverse conditions,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/water-water-everywhere-nor-any-drop-to-drink-why-rawta-is-flooded-with-problems/articleshow/84872768.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

This is the second incident of a suspect’s death inside a police station in south Gujarat in 10 days. The deceased identified as Nitin Urde was found hanging from the ventilation window of the bathroom using his denim trousers around 5.45 am, police said. Urde was nabbed along with another suspect by the sleuths of local crime branch of Valsad police on Thursday. Police said that there were 11 people in the gang who had allegedly conducted a recce of a house in Seronda village. “They were walking back towards their car after the recce when they saw our LCB staff and started running. Our staff chased and nabbed two of them,” said Dr Rajdeepsinh Zala, superintendent of Valsad police. LCB sleuths had found a car with its registration plate covered in cow dung, so they became suspicious and kept a watch in the area. Urde and his accomplice were taken to Nargol Marine police station when police received information that other gang members were sighted in forest area near Nargol. Urde was kept at the police station while his accomplice was taken along for the search. Police said that at about 5.45 am Urde went to use the bathroom, a loud sound was heard from inside, but Urde did not respond. The cops then broke open the door and found Urde lying unconscious on the floor with his trousers around his neck. “His trousers got torn because of the weight, but before he fell, he had succumbed. We have registered a case of accidental death and handed over the investigation to the deputy superintendent of police of SC/ST cell so the probe can be handled independently,” said Zala. Before he took the extreme step, Urde had told police that they had come to conduct robbery and their gang is from Palghar district of Maharashtra. A case of robbery attempt will also be registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/suspected-robber-hangs-self-to-death-in-bathroom-of-nargol-marine-police-station/articleshow/84870794.cms||---

The next hearing has been fixed for August 4, said the defendant’s lawyer Hariom Varshney.On February 23, 2020, Tariq, 22, was standing on the terrace of his house when a bullet fired during the violence hit him in the stomach. He was taken to a hospital, where he succumbed to the injuries on March 12. Vinay was arrested on charges of attempt to murder. And after Tariq’s death, the charge was changed to murder. Police also claimed to have recovered the weapon used in the crime, which was registered in Vinay’s name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/court-frames-murder-charge-against-ex-bjym-leader-for-killing-youth-during-ant-caa-clashes/articleshow/84867898.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Demand for home tutors rises as schools continue to run online||HYDERABAD: As schools continue to be shut, private online tutorials and home-tutoring has started to see an uptick in business with several parents shelling out much as Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 a month towards them. Parents admit that they are signing their children up for private tuitions, for fear of them falling behind. “During online classes, school teachers seem to be in a hurry to complete the syllabus. It is almost like they assume that the grasping power of every child is the same. But that is not true. My child, for instance, is barely able to follow what is taught during class. Hence, I had to appoint a private tutor to help him complete his assignments, homework and clear his doubts,” said Vaishali Kiran, parent of a class 4 student who spends Rs 15,000 per month towards home-tutoring. Another reason pushing parents towards private tutoring is the introduction of Telugu as a compulsory language by the Telangana government from class 6 in all schools. The rule also applies to schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CICSE). “Until last year, my husband and I managed to teach our daughter all the subjects at home. But with her moving to class 6 this year and Telugu made a third language, it has become tough for us since we aren’t familiar with the language. That’s why we decided to get a home-tutor who is now charging Rs 600 per class,” said Shashi Gupta, an IT employee. The trend has also emerged as an alternate source of income for teachers reeling under severe financial stress. Amid the pandemic last year, many private schools stopped paying salaries to their teachers, for months on end. With parents seeking private tutors, these teachers say that they have observed a sudden rise in demand. “Last year, parents thought that online classes would go on only for a year. This year, many are worried about learning levels of their children. Math as a subject is in high demand among parents looking for tutors,” said D Shyamala, a private tutor, adding that more number of students from junior class are being enrolled for all subjects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/demand-for-home-tutors-rises-as-schools-continue-to-run-online/articleshow/84875831.cms||Preeti Biswas

The five-member committee, commissioned on December 23, 2016, had a three-year tenure but was given an extension. On an average, 182 cases related to children rescued from the clutches of child-traffickers or who had fled home due to poor domestic environment, were taken up every month. Cases of child abuse, forced begging and child labour were also taken up. Sangeeta Sharma, a member of the outgoing CWC, said: “The committee executed 9,868 cases which included 2,953 of runaway kids and 55 of sexual abuse. At least 1,403 children were shifted to shelters while 4,649 minors were repatriated.” “Further, 278 children of different districts or states were transferred and 187 minors were helped to get adopted by foster parents. The committee also rescued 198 minors who were forced into labour-intensive jobs. Timely intervention secured the lives of 50 children who were forced to marry adults. We also helped 95 minors who were forced to beg on streets,” added Sharma, who has been a child rights activist for decades. She said that besides 9,868 cases, CWC also intervened in 145 cases of children who were victims of dispute between their parents (like divorce). “In 55 months, CWC coordinated with NGOs, district probation office, police and others for the betterment of children. Immense efforts were put into clearing the lacunas in the system, such as preparing strong paperwork to protect children’s interest, legal aid and other things,” she added. The other committee members were Kuldeep Ranjan (president), Vinay Kumar Shrivastav, Sudha Rani and Richa Khanna. The members will continue to guide the new CWC members for a few more weeks. The new CWC members are chairman Ravinder Singh Jadon, Dr Sujeet Kumar Pandey, lawyer Om Prakash Yadav, judicial activist Manju Nigam and child activist Sandhya Misra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cwc-rescued-rehabilitated-over-10000-minors-in-55-month-tenure/articleshow/84875264.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Millet-based diet lowers risk of type-2 diabetes, says ICRISAT||HYDERABAD: While the goodness of millets has been talked about for ages now, this time it is leading research institutions that are rooting for this humble cereal’s effectiveness in fighting the dreaded chronic disease — diabetes. A study, led by Hyderabad-based premier agri research institute International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (Icrisat), which includes a systematic review of research published on millets and diabetes across 11 countries by various research institutions, concluded that consumption of millets helps reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. The study took into account 11 types of millets, with various processing or cooking-levels. “The study shows diabetic people who consumed millets as part of their daily diet saw their blood glucose levels drop 12-15% (fasting and post-meal), and blood glucose levels going from diabetic to pre-diabetes levels,” the study said. As per the findings of the study, the HbA1c (blood glucose bound to haemoglobin) levels lowered 17% on average for pre-diabetic individuals, and the levels went from prediabetic to normal status for people who consumed millets daily. The Icrisat study showed that millets have a lower glycemic index (GI) than staples like wheat and rice. GI helps to measure how much a specific food item increases the blood sugar level. While all cooking methods raised the GI level in food, millets, even after being cooked, still had a low average GI. The study found that millets have a low average GI of 52.7, about 30% lower that the GI of milled rice and refined wheat, and about 14-37 GI points lower compared to maize. The study assumes importance in Covid times as it has been widely seen that people who are diabetic are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19. “On-farm diversity is a risk mitigating strategy for farmers in the face of climate change while on-plate diversity helps counter lifestyle diseases such as diabetes. Millets are part of the solution to mitigate the challenges associated with malnutrition, human health, natural resource degradation, and climate change,” said Icrisat director general, Jacqueline Hughes. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in the world. As per World Health Organisation data, in 2019, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes, and 3.7 million from diabetes and high blood sugar levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/millet-based-diet-lowers-risk-of-type-2-diabetes-says-icrisat/articleshow/84875531.cms||Swati Rathor

While some are assisting with getting essentials, others are volunteering their time to connect those in need with resources or tutoring poor students who have no access to online education. “I have been helping about 10 students — children of my house help and apartment watchman among others — with their studies,” said Suhrit Padakanti, a class 12 student of Chirec International School. He said these students are unable to attend online classes regularly and are, therefore, struggling to grasp concepts. Suhrit and his brother Sudhit, a class 8 student, also donated Rs 3.5 lakh to LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) to support eye health research activities and for eye surgeries of the poor on Friday. “My family recently sold one of our properties. I insisted that the money be donated to a hospital to help the poor,” the teenager said. Last year, Suhrit even organised crowdfunding and raised Rs 60, 000 to provide meals to the poor and daily wage labourers across Telangana. He donated the money to the Akshaya Patra foundation last year. Similarly, Simran a student of class 10 at Oakridge International School, Bachupally has initiated “Covid-Trahi”, which aims to providing financial aid and necessities to families afflicted by the pandemic’s second wave. “I aim to bridge the gap between people who are willing to give and those in need. The constant desire to connect both these worlds motivates me,” said Simran, who along with her schoolmates has successfully distributed more than 700 Covid-19 essential kits. Simran’s schoolmate Sanchit, a class 6 student, meanwhile extended his help to facilitate Balasadan, a girl-child welfare centre at Siddipet with study material, clothes and other essentials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/from-food-to-free-tuitions-students-do-their-bit-for-those-affected-by-pandemic/articleshow/84875798.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Ahmedabad||Kutch man wanted in Rs 2,500-crore heroin cases nabbed||AHMEDABAD: A Kutch man wanted in four cases for smuggling a total of 530kg of heroin, worth Rs 2,500 crore, into India from Pakistan, was arrested by Gujarat ATS at the Delhi airport on Thursday, officials said. Shahid Kasam Sumra, 35, a resident of Mandvi in Kutch district, was also allegedly involved in “narco-terrorism”, as he funded terror activities with the money acquired from the illegal drug trade, they said. Sumra was nabbed by a team of the Anti-Terrorist Squad as soon as he arrived at the airport in the national capital from abroad, an ATS officer said. The officer said he wanted to flee from Delhi airport but was nabbed before that. Four cases were lodged against him between 2018 and 2021 in Gujarat and Punjab, following the seizure of 530kg of heroin worth around Rs 2,500 crore in that period from different places in the two states. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had taken over the investigation in three of those cases, while one case is with the Gujarat ATS. The Gujarat ATS recently learned that Sumra was also involved in “narco-terrorism” as he gave money, acquired through the illegal drug trade, to those involved in terror activities. He was on the run and had been hiding in various Gulf and African countries ever since his name surfaced when ATS seized 5kg of Pakistan-origin heroin at Salaya town in Gujarat’s Devbhoomi Dwarka district in August 2018. An investigation later revealed that Sumra and other accused had smuggled in a total of 530kg of heroin worth over Rs 2,300 crore from Pakistan by sea and unloaded the consignment on the Mandvi coast in Gujarat in August 2018. Later, Sumra and his aides sent the contraband to Punjab in trucks, the ATS officer said. They sent 300kg in three trips to Punjab at the behest of one Simranjit Singh Sandhu, who was recently held by Interpol in Italy. After some time, Sumra’s associates transported 200kg of heroin to Sandhu’s contacts at Amritsar in Punjab, it said. From this consignment, the Punjab STF seized 188kg and 5kg in separate operations, the ATS said, adding that the NIA is now conducting a probe into these cases, and Sumra was also wanted in connection with these. In April this year, the ATS and Indian Coast Guard intercepted a boat near the Gujarat coast and apprehended eight Pakistani nationals with 30kg of heroin, worth around Rs 150 crore. It later came to light that the accused were planning to smuggle the drug into Gujarat at Sumra’s behest, the ATS officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-wanted-in-rs-2500cr-heroin-cases-nabbed/articleshow/84872820.cms||---

According to officials, these agencies charged Rs 300 from LMC as the daily wage for a worker but paid only Rs 200. Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi has directed LMC officials to issue recovery notices to these agencies. This is the fifth ‘scam’ detected by LMC officials in the last one year. Official said around 28 contractual agencies had been underpaying their workers. These companies altogether took Rs 16 crore from LMC for payment of wages but actually paid only Rs 8.35 crore in the three years. The scam was detected when the commissioner ordered a probe after finding sanitation work unsatisfactory at many places in the city during inspections. He asked zonal officers to verify workforce and payments. “Each sanitary worker is eligible for a daily wage of Rs 308. However, the probe found that only Rs 200 or less were being paid to them by private players,” said officers. “Recovery notices are being issued to these agencies asking them to return the extra amount (Rs 7.65 crore) within two weeks, failing which LMC will seize their bank accounts,” the municipal commissioner said. Dwivedi said the provision for making digital payments directly to the bank accounts of sanitary workers is also being made to avoid such scams in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/12-pvt-agencies-duped-lmc-of-rs-7-65cr-in-3-yrs/articleshow/84875311.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

In a reply tabled at the ongoing assembly session, chief minister Pramod Sawant has said that there are as many as 276 vacant posts in the forest department. The department is in need of 91 forest guards, 39 round foresters, 12 range forest officers (RFOs) and four deputy range forest officers, all of these positions help with the work of the department on the ground.

This time, an NRG (non-resident Gujarati) who has been working in Sydney since 2012, was found to have dug a pond in his native Alindra village in Nadiad taluka of Kheda district. Arpit Patel, 30, who works for a private firm in Sydney, and his family members — father Dinesh Patel, 59, who works for a dairy; mother Jayshree Patel, 56, a home-maker, and Arpit’s elder brother, Kinjal, 33, a computer teacher — have been listed as MGNREA labourers. According to MGNREGA documents, they registered in 2012, which was the year Arpit migrated to Australia. Since then, the family has worked for about 184 days under MGNREGA, digging a pond and earned around Rs 96,000. The sarpanch of Alindra village Rajnikant Patel confessed that this irregularity existed, calling it a mistake. “We noticed the irregularity four days ago when the district development officer (DDO) ordered an inquiry in the case. Arpit, who had migrated to Australia, has been named as labourer, but it was been found that he and his family members had been registered as MGNREGA labourers. It was a mistake by the village administration,” said Patel. DDO M K Dave said he has ordered an inquiry in the case and suspects that many more irregularities would be unearthed. “The inquiry will be completed in a week or so after which legal action will be taken against the accused persons,” said Dave. Arpit’s brother Kinjal could not be contacted despite several attempts. Earlier, a massive MGNREGA scam had been unearthed in August and September 2020, where dead persons, doctors, government servants, cops and even schoolchildren were shown as MGNREGA labourers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nrg-in-sydney-digs-pond-in-kheda-village/articleshow/84872866.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Senior officials land in ACB net for accepting bribe||MUMBAI: Demanding and accepting bribe on instalment basis is a new trend among high-ranking revenue and police officials. But, in two recent instances, they landed in the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) net while accepting the first instalment. On Tuesday, an ACB team led by superintendent of police Rahul Khode arrested sub-divisional officer Manisha Rashinkar, who is of the rank of deputy collector, and her assistant Vilas Jankar, under the Prevention of Corruption Act for demanding Rs1.1 lakh from the complainant. According to an ACB official, Rashinkar and Jankar demanded the bribe to allow the complainant to transport sand in Osmanabad district. Following negotiations, it was agreed that the complainant would pay Rs90,000 per month, and as a first instalment Jankar accepted Rs20,000. “We have arrested both Rashinkar and Jankar under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Initially, we secured police custody of both the accused,” the ACB official said. In the second case, deputy superintendent, Rajendra Pal, demanded Rs2 crore from a person whose friend had died in a hit-and-run case. It was found that a few days after the death, the complainant spoke to the wife of the deceased. Pal threatened to implicate him in the case unless he paid Rs2 crore. The amount was finally settled at Rs1.5 crore. Pal’s assistant was caught when he went to accept the first instalment of Rs10 lakh. Both Pal and his aide have been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act. In the recent past, it has been found that initially a huge amount is demanded. After negotiations, the amount is brought down and accepted in tranches. In most cases, the amount is not directly accepted by senior officials, but by their assistants, so that the underling ends up facing the music. “The ACB will have to build a strong case in each instance and ensure each and every case results in conviction,” a senior IPS official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-senior-officials-in-acb-net-for-accepting-bribe/articleshow/84875442.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Zonal agriculture officers are currently assessing the farm losses in all 12 talukas, Kavlekar told Goa legislative assembly during Question Hour on Thursday while replying to a question tabled by Goa Forward Party (GFP) MLA Vinod a Palienkar. “We want to compensate farmers at the earliest, preferably within the next month. The losses are being computed and zonal agriculture officers are on the job,” said Kavlekar. Palienkar. told the House that there’s been a delay in settling claims of farmers and sought to know how long it will take for the agriculture department to pay compensation to farmers who suffered badly in the floods last week. Congress’ Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, participating in the discussion, said for the past three years farmers in the state are suffering due to natural calamities. The government should do something concrete to help them. Replying to queries raised by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, the agriculture minister assured the House that 1,288 pending claims and 119 which are not cleared for being submitted late, will be cleared within a week. The agriculture minister said there was a delay in settling some claims for those that come under schemes funded by the Centre. The delay in receiving funds has been due to the pandemic. Over 80,000 claims were cleared though some are pending. Sardesai, however, said the Goa government should not have any problems getting funds from its counterpart at the Centre, as both have BJP in rule. We want to compensate farmers at the earliest.

---||Delhi||Court raps cops for failing to respond to its queries||New Delhi: Taking strong note against police for failing to file a reply to the queries related to an alleged raid conducted in the middle of the night, a court has said it seemed that the higher authorities up to the level of the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) were showing a “callous and careless attitude” to judicial orders. The court had sought a detailed report from the DCP concerned asking the basis of the suspicion of the alleged raid at the house of one Anwar Khan, why none of the police personnel was allegedly in uniform, why no independent person from the neighbourhood was joined to the raid and why the incident wasn’t videographed. Additional sessions judge Ravinder Bedi noted that the additional DCP (south) had passed certain comments in an earlier hearing that the court was unfair by alleging that the raid was illegal. No response or clarification was filed following the orders dated April 28 and April 30, the court said, directing the DCP concerned again to address the queries. The court further said that when the investigating officer was asked about the status of the compliance report, he feigned ignorance. The court directed the police commissioner to file a detailed report by July 31. The court earlier said the raiding team had consisted of police personnel and it was expected of them to do their duties to uphold the law, but they appeared to have “become predators instead of being protectors”. It had also said the inexplicability of police regarding the alleged raid and injuries inflicted upon the man made the entire raid “suspicious”, particularly when the team could not get anything from him. It had noted that the status report filed by the additional DCP (south) did not address the queries as to whether videography was done to show that the police officials were in uniform. On being inquired, the additional DCP had submitted that the court was unfair in its comments made in the previous order alleging the raid as illegal and on the nature of the raid. Police, in its status report filed in April, had stated that the raiding party kept on knocking on the door of Khan in the intervening night of April 7-8, and they became suspicious when he did not open it. The status report had further stated that when Khan opened the door, he allegedly inflicted injuries on police officials with a blade. A case was registered against Khan for allegedly obstructing public servants in their duties, assaulting a public servant and causing hurt to a public servant. Police further alleged that Khan had inflicted injuries on himself during the raid. The court had noted that prima facie, the alleged raid created grave doubts over the manner in which it was conducted and sought a detailed report from the DCP concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-raps-cops-for-failing-to-respond-to-its-queries/articleshow/84872926.cms||Usha Das

Trust what is taught by your mentors and also take their help in sorting out the right online study material for preparations, shared high rankers of the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) The results of CLAT — a national-level entrance exam for admissions to undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) law programmes offered by 22 National Law Universities across the country — were declared on Thursday. The high rankers said at the time of Covid-19 pandemic when education has shifted to online mode relying on too many websites, Youtube preparation videos and online content can be confusing. Hence, self-study and taking guidance from experts is the success mantra to crack the national level test. “Instead of hunting for preparation tips and study material online, I trusted my coaching mentors and was consistent in focusing on topics suggested by them. Cracking CLAT is not about studying too much, but it’s all about studying every day with a fixed time schedule and proper time division for every subject,” said CLAT All India Rank (AIR) 28 Ananya Tangri. She said. “Surabhi Modi ma’am helped me a lot, from improving my performance in mock tests to providing study material.” Rohan, who bagged AIR 70, said, “Our preparation was more challenging due to the pandemic as the entrance test got postponed several times. Preparing under so much stress is not easy hence in such tough times all aspirants should focus on everyday revision and mock test practice.” He said going by too many online lecture videos, several experts suggesting CLAT tips confuses a candidate. It’s better just to follow a few renowned law professors. All the high rankers said that whether they will go into judiciary or non-judiciary will be decided after completing their law degree from the dream law school. “Our teachers can better judge and make us realize our strengths and weaknesses hence the decision on further career goals will be taken at the law school,” said AIR 72 holder Priyanshu Mishra. With an AIR 221, Siddharth said, “Mock tests are more trustworthy. Trying to view all videos by CLAT experts may not give the desired results.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/self-study-expert-guidance-are-key-to-success-top-scorers/articleshow/84875363.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Delhi||BJP protests House resolution against Asthana as top cop||New Delhi: BJP on Thursday strongly protested against the resolution moved by AAP MLAs in Delhi assembly, which termed the appointment of 1984-batch IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner arbitrary and against the rules. The BJP legislators demanded that the House should instead discuss the problems faced by Delhiites.Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the new police commissioner’s appointment did not violate any directions of Supreme Court because the step was taken only after Asthana had been granted a one-year extension of tenure by the central government.“The appointment is within the parameters laid down in government rules. In the coming days, Delhi will witness improvement in the law and order situation as police will crack down on criminals and corruption,” added Bidhuri.Defending the appointment of Asthana, who belongs to the Gujarat cadre, Bidhuri said the IPS officer had served the nation with full vigor and determination. “He was instrumental in exposing the fodder scam, Godhra conspiracy, Purulia bomb explosions of 2008, and the probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Those who are levelling allegations against Asthana should know that he was given a clean chit by Supreme Court,” he added.“It is shocking that instead of discussing the problems and issues faced by the people of Delhi, the AAP government is trying to divert attention from its failures by raising frivolous issues,” said Bidhuri.Seeking a discussion on various issues, the BJP functionary claimed, “Delhi is facing serious problems pertaining to shortage and supply of contaminated water, failure to clean drains that has led to waterlogging across the city, and an ageing DTC bus fleet that puts a question mark on the safety of the vehicles and people who travel in them. Rations given by the Centre for the poor and marginalised were left to rot in storage facilities and people were served with inflated electricity bills.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-protests-house-resolution-against-asthana-as-top-cop/articleshow/84872902.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Goa||Will amend law to give more powers to poll panel, says Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PORVORIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant informed the state legislative assembly on Thursday that the Goa Panchayat Raj Act and Goa Municipalities Act will be amended to vest powers of reservation and delimitation in the State Election Commission (SEC). He made the statement while replying to the question tabled by opposition leader Digambar Kamat in connection with the reservation of municipal polls that were held earlier this year. The rights of reservation and delimitation for civic elections presently rest with the directorate of panchayats and the department of urban development. TOI had reported on July 24 that the state cabinet had granted approval to the Goa Municipality (Amendment) Bill, 2021, with an aim to devolve partial powers to the SEC to carry out delimitation and reservation. Municipal reservations were modified after the Supreme Court disallowed the Goa government’s appeal against a high court order earlier this year, which had quashed and set aside reservations for the civic elections that were notified by the government. Sawant told the House that the reservations were done on the basis of the 2011 Census and denied claims of political interference. Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai retorted by saying that the CM was aware of everything – including political intervention – in the reservations, to which Sawant vehemently objected. “Had the government vested in the SEC powers of reservation and delimitation it would have not faced ignominy when its plea was thrown out by the court, and reservations had to be redone as per the Constitutional mandate,” Kamat said. The government was compelled to appoint an independent person as state election commissioner. Law secretary Chokha Ram Garg, who held the post as an additional charge, had to quit following the apex court rap, and retired IAS officer W V Raman Murthy was subsequently appointed SEC. Kamat said the House has to be told how much the government spent to defend its plea in the apex court. “You made it a prestige issue and went to the SC and hired top lawyers although the matter wasn’t big,” he said, adding that the whole exercise of approaching the Supreme Court was an exercise in futility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-amend-law-to-give-more-powers-to-poll-panel-cm/articleshow/84875359.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Porn racket: Model, shoot assistant held in Kolkata||KOLKATA: A model-cum-actor in adult web-series and short videos featured across multiple platforms was arrested, along with a 39-year-old shooting coordinator, for allegedly forcing aspiring models into pornography either by threatening them or making false promises of a “break” in the booming web series industry. Nandita Dutta (30), better known by her screen persona “Nancy Bhabhi” in some semi-porn contents, and Mainak Ghosh (39) were picked up from their homes in Dum Dum and Naktala respectively. They were arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by two young models with New Town police on July 26, where the complainant had alleged that she was forced to participate in a nude video at a Ballygunge studio and her friend was made to shoot in an adult video at a New Town hotel by the same group. The arrest comes after Bidhannagar police recently busted a porn racket in New Town and Salt Lake and arrested a photographer and a make-up artist in a separate but similar complaint last week. Cops said the groups lure women from lower middle class families striving for work with quick money or by threat of dire consequences and providing fake promises for a break. Friends on social media with some of city’s top photographers and models, Dutta and Ghosh were charged under IPC sections 354B (assaults or uses criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing or compelling her to be naked), 354C (voyeurism), 500 (defamation), 509 (molestation), 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave), 417 (cheating) and 469 (forgery). They were produced before a Barasat court and were sent to police custody for a week. “We will grill them for their other accomplices and also to know about places where they organised the shoots. We will also question them to know where they used to sell videos and if they were part of a larger racket,” said a senior officer of the Bidhannagar Commissionerate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/porn-racket-model-shoot-assistant-held/articleshow/84872908.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Speaking on the motion, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal heaped praises upon him for protecting the environment at an age when no one seemed to care about it. Kejriwal recently wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi seeking the highest civilian honour for the environmentalist.“He started working to protect the environment when he was just 13. At an age where we were attending school and did not have worldly knowledge, he started social activism.

Now, he has been pleading the district administration to remove his name. Banaskantha has always been a fertile ground for the MGNREGA scam where large-scale irregularities were unearthed in August and September 2020 where dead persons, government employees, cops and even schoolchildren were named as MGNREGA labourers taking their wages. Shailesh Parmar, 30, has been working in a private bank for around two years. Sources in the district administration said that his mother Ramila Parmar had been registered as a MGNREGA labourer in 2006, after which she had worked for the developmental works in her village named Kaleda. In the first week of July, Shailesh came to know that not only his mother’s name but also his name was there as MGNREGA labourer even though he had never worked under the job guarantee scheme. He had on July 16 made an application to the director of district village development agency requesting removal of his name from the MGNREGA list. In the same application to the agency director, he wrote that Rs 1,903 has been mistakenly deposited in his bank account, which is unfair. Sources in the district administration said that Parmar had also talked with a Gram Sewak (GRS) pleading him to remove his name as someone else’ money was being deposited in his bank. The district administration has begun an inquiry, but no one’s involvement has been discovered yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remove-my-name-from-list-bank-employee/articleshow/84872909.cms||---
---||Delhi||Can’t have witch-hunt for procuring oxygen for patients after govts failed: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: We will not allow you to indulge in a “witch-hunt” , the Delhi high court told the city’s drug controller on Thursday as it rapped the department for prosecuting political leaders who procured oxygen for needy patients during the devastating second wave of Covid -19 in the capital. “If this is the way you proceed, then half of Delhi can be booked, then please proceed against all the gurudwaras, temples, churches that arranged oxygen for patients when both the Centre and Delhi government failed to provide sufficient medical oxygen to the people. Why pick only one person? There were so many good Samaritans who helped with oxygen, go book them,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh remarked. The high court’s strong comments at the Delhi Drug Controller came after it informed the bench it has launched prosecution against AAP MLAs, Imran Hussain and Praveen Kumar before a court for allegedly illegally stocking and distributing Covid-19 drugs during the infection’s deadly second wave. The high court bench pointed out it had already drawn a distinction in its June 3 order between hoarding of key drugs such as FabiFlu and supply of oxygen cylinders. “You’re very consciously targeting leaders of a particular political party. We will not permit this. It’s unfortunate that this human tragedy has been used for political capital,” an irked bench told DDC’s counsel Nandita Rao. It further pointed out that the “idea is not to go against the person who is helping people without damaging anyone” The bench said the reason it picked up Gautam Gambhir’s case “is that he irresponsibly hoarded huge quantities of the tablets and was distributing them in his constituency only. He may have had the best intentions, he spent money from his own pocket, but there were spare tablets left while patients were not able to get it elsewhere.” It noted that the “oxygen issue” was first flagged with respect to Imran Hussain where the court wanted to know if he was sourcing it from refillers in Delhi or outside. “He was helping the community and not taking from Delhi oxygen supply” the court recalled. “How can you take such a hyper-technical view?,” the bench wondered, granting time to the drug controller to clear its stand on withdrawing prosecution against all such persons who had procured or distributed medical oxygen for free to the needy Covid-19 patients. It listed the matter for further hearing on August 5. During the hearing, the drug controller informed the court that prosecution has been launched against Gautam Gambhir Foundation, and AAP MLA’s Hussain and Kumar for alleged violations under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and a trial court had on July 28 taken cognisance of the issue and issued summons to them for August 26. Meanwhile, senior advocate Kailash Vasudev, representing Gambhir, urged the high court to clarify that adverse observations made against him won’t be used against him before the trial court. The high court made it clear that the observations made by it earlier in these hearings shall not come in the way of proceedings in the trial court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cant-have-witch-hunt-for-procuring-o2-for-patients-after-govts-failed-hc/articleshow/84872876.cms||Abhinav Garg

Expressing his anguish over how comunidade lands were being destroyed by the “same syndicate” of land scamsters with the law enforcing authorities unable to take action against the culprits, Khaunte pointed out that 18 cases of land scams in South Goa and 12-13 cases in Mapusa have recently come to light. “How did this happen and who are involved in all this? No action seems to be happening. By now you should have set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and gone into the depth of these things and booked the culprits. These ancestral properties which belong to people who have grown old and whose children are abroad, now lie in the possession of someone else,” Khaunte said, while speaking on the discussion on demands.

Justice V M Pancholi was not inclined to extend protection against the arrest by CBI as apprehended by the former top cop, who was involved in ISRO espionage case as a member of the Intelligence Bureau in 1990s. The CBI has filed an FIR against 18 officials, including Sreekumar, in New Delhi for framing and torturing the scientist. After granting protection for eight days and seeking reply from the CBI, Justice Pancholi questioned Sreekumar’s advocate about the delay in moving the Kerala HC. He questioned the relevance of transit bail particularly when the courts are functioning through virtual mode due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The CBI earlier probed the espionage case and gave a clean chit to Nambi Narayanan and others. The scientist moved the Supreme Court against his framing in the case. The apex court ordered compensation for him and set up an inquiry committee into the episode. In May, the CBI filed an FIR against officials involved in the investigation against the scientists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ex-dgp-withdraws-plea-from-guj-hc/articleshow/84872945.cms||---

Within the Covid-19 pandemic, Maharashtra was hit by a mucormycosis epidemic that has claimed 1,175 lives till now and affected nearly 10,000. The medical education department has studied 242 mucormycosis deaths among patients who were treated in the 18 government-run medical colleges since April. They found that 79% of those who succumbed had diabetes, 75% were treated with steroids, 81% were on oxygen support and only 39% were on ventilators. The mean duration between their diagnosis of Covid-19 and onset of mucormycosis symptoms was eight days. “It is without doubt that these three factors became a lethal combination for those patients,” said one of the experts, who was a part of the analysis. The medical colleges have detected 2,666 cases of mucormycosis out of 16,096 people screenedthere. Worryingly, a total of 418 patients died while undergoing treatment, lending the fungal infection a significantly high mortality rate of 19%. Of the 2,666 patients, as many as 1,852 (69%) required surgical intervention. Almost 64% of the deceased were above 50 years. The treatment course of 242 patients of the 418 deceased were studied. The infection had affected the sinuses in 98% of the deceased while eyes were involved in 65%. In 32% cases, the oral cavity was affected. In 11% of cases, the infection had spread to the lungs. The patients had spent an average of eight days for mucormycosis treatment before succumbing. While 94% of those who succumbed to mucormycosis had a history of Covid-19, the rest hadn’t suffered from Covid-19 in the recent past. “The findings are an attempt to understand what can be done to prevent those risk-factors from either arising or coming together in the future. Mucormycosis not just has a high fatality rate, it can also leave people with disability,” said Dr Rakesh Waghmare of the medical education department. During its peak, hospitals have carried out an average of 8-10 mucormycosis surgeries every day, some very debilitating where people have lost palate, eyes and the jawbone. As part of preparations to tackle the third wave, the state has emphasised the need to prevent mucormycosis by early detection, curtailing the use of unnecessary steroids and maintaining an extra vigil of those with uncontrolled blood sugar levels. The state Covid-19 taskforce has emphasised on early detection and screening of high-risk patients such as those above 50 years or people with diabetes. Since mucormycosis has also been found in those with no history of steroid use, known to cause immune suppression, doctors have said that the role of Covid itself in weakening the immunity must be studied. The state’s public health department data shows that Maharashtra has seen a total of 9,569 mucormycosis patients, of whom 2,513 are under treatment, 5,704 have recovered and 1,175 have died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-mix-of-diabetes-steroids-and-o2-support-found-in-mucor-deaths/articleshow/84879011.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||Attitude of police callous, says Delhi court after IO fails to turn up for hearing||NEW DELHI: After the investigating officer did not turn up for a virtual hearing a day after an accused was arrested, a court had called it the “callous attitude” of police and their “scant regard” for the court. Additional sessions judge Ashutosh Kumar said on Tuesday that the presence of the investigating officer (IO) was needed as it wanted to ascertain from him the present status of the investigation, the material collected against the accused so far and whether his custodial interrogation was required by police. It further noted that the IO’s presence was needed for deciding the bail application moved by the accused since the case was at the initial stage of investigation with respect to the accused, who was arrested on July 26. He was arrested for allegedly causing grave injuries to a man. “The matter requires the indulgence of the joint commissioner of police concerned. Hence an e-copy of this order be sent to the joint commissioner of police concerned,” the judge said. Kumar also directed the joint commissioner “to ensure that all IOs join hearing through videoconference timely and that precious time of the court is not wasted”. The accused got bail on Thursday after as per the court order, a report was filed detailing the status of the investigation, including the admissible material collected against him and whether his custodial interrogation was required. The IO submitted that the investigation with respect to the accused, who was not involved in any other criminal case, was complete. Other two accused in the case were already out on bail, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/attitude-of-police-callous-says-court-after-io-fails-to-turn-up-for-hearing/articleshow/84873010.cms||Usha Das

---||Kolkata||Engineers inspect Sealdah station ahead of 1st test run||Kolkata: Metro Railway on Thursday inspected the under-construction Sealdah station of East-West Metro. The inspection by the electrical department engineers was necessary for the final decision to run the debut test train till Sealdah on Saturday. Earlier this week, Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation, implementing agency of the 16km East-West corridor, wrote to Metro Railway, so the first train can chug into Sealdah Metro station on Saturday. Currently, a 7km truncated Sector V-Phoolbagan section is operational. The Metro will eventually link Howrah Maidan with Sector V. The third rail will be charged on Friday so that the first test train can pull into the Metro station coming up 17m below Sealdah railway station. Ahead of the milestone, TOI took a look at the 10,000sqm interiors, to find that a part of the premises is propelled towards completion, with platform screen doors fitted on either side of the eastward tunnel. The station is in this unique situation because of the tunnelling fiasco on August 31, 2019. Chundi, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) digging the west-bound tunnel had hit an aquifer and buildings collapsed due to large-scale subsidence. Sibling TBM Urvi, which built the east-bound tunnel till Sealdah station, took a U-turn and complete the rest 800m of the west-bound tunnel till Durga Pithuri Lane. Sealdah is probably the only Metro station in the world where train trials will be conducted in one tunnel while the other will simultaneously function as a shaft for winding up activity of TBM Urvi. Even as east-bound tunnel was over in October 2020, and the shaft of this tunnel has been covered, digging of the west-bound tunnel was only completed on May 15, this year. In fact, when extension is commissioned , trains will only run along east-bound tunnel beyond crossover till Sealdah Metro station. Trains will ply only along this tunnel since westbound tunnel is being used as a shaft for winding up activities of TBM Urvi which finished work on May 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/engineers-inspect-sealdah-station-ahead-of-1st-test-run/articleshow/84872963.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Aam Admi Party MLAs blamed the three municipal corporations for the city streets flooding following heavy rain. Public Works Department minister Satyender Jain also refuted BJP allegations that the drains under Delhi government were not being cleaned.The capital has 30,000-km of roads and Delhi government manages only 1,259km of it that have drains on both sides, Jain told the assembly, adding that the rest of it comes under municipal corporations and other central agencies.The minister also alleged corruption in the civic bodies, claiming that their desilting work was only on paper and that there is a nexus of junior engineers and contractors.Other AAP MLAs also blamed the corporations for the waterlogging and demanded an audit of the desilting work by an assembly committee.On the other hand, BJP MLA from Lakshmi Nagar Abhay Verma and Yamuna Nagar MLA Ajay Mahawar claimed that Delhi government was responsible for the waterlogging. “Choked PWD drains cause flooding all over the city but Delhi government is deflecting the blame,” Mahawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-spar-over-issue-of-waterlogging/articleshow/84872968.cms||---
---||Delhi||BJP MLA marshalled out of assembly, another suspended||New Delhi: The monsoon session of Delhi assembly started on a stormy note on Thursday with speaker Ram Niwas Goel suspending BJP MLA OP Sharma for a day and ordering marshals to remove legislator Anil Bajpai.The Bharatiya Janata Party MLAs were protesting against the business advisory committee not meeting before the assembly session, among other issues. The speaker retorted that it was the BJP-led central government that was carrying out “murder of the Constitution”.Goel said it was painful for him to note that during his tenure, the “rights of the House were being snatched away” and its committees were being disempowered. “Such an act of disempowerment of committees has no precedent in independent India. I want to seek answers from the central government. It’s a day of shame for me. It is painful that this occurred during my tenure and I want to say that opposition members of Delhi assembly were also involved in this,” he added.Amid the ruckus in the assembly, the speaker also ruled that from now onwards, opposition members would get 20 minutes of speaking time based on their numbers, the precedent that was also being followed in Lok Sabha.“I’m dividing the time of the House in the ratio of the number of members. The assembly is in session between 11am and 5pm out of which two hours are reserved for matters like starred questions and one hour for lunch. Out of the remaining 180 minutes, the opposition members will get 20 minutes, while the treasury will get 160 minutes,” Goel added.While BJP members alleged that this was against democratic norms, the speaker said that he was following the rule prevalent in Lok Sabha. “If Lok Sabha keeps on snatching our rights, should we not do anything? We will do exactly the same thing being followed in Lok Sabha,” he added, arguing that the decision was taken because of repeated disruptions by the opposition at the time when the MLAs raise questions about their constituencies.Former Delhi BJP president and Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta said that the five MLAs were marshalled out because the AAP government didn’t want to face the people’s ire. “It’s an emergency-like situation in the assembly. When OP Sharma objected to the government setting the House agenda without holding a meeting of the business advisory committee, he was suspended,” he added.“Also, why was the matter pertaining to the failure of the Delhi government in opening new schools or colleges in the city and shortage of teachers withdrawn from the revised list?” asked Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-mla-marshalled-out-of-assembly-another-suspended/articleshow/84872938.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP plans to bring spotlight back on rural bodies polls||Lucknow: Buoyed by a stellar show in the recently concluded rural local bodies polls, the state BJP plans to felicitate victorious party-backed candidates during the scheduled visit of BJP national president JP Nadda to Lucknow in the first week of August. The move is seen as a fresh attempt by the saffron party to drum up its rural presence after it bagged 66 of 75 zila panchayat chairman seats. A senior UP BJP leader said, the programme is being planned to showcase the party’s strength in the rural heartland, which is key to the electoral fortunes of any political party. Experts interpret it as BJP’s overt attempt to bring the political spotlight back on rural polls, which was touted as a semi-final to the assembly elections due next year. Sources said, the BJP brass is in no mood to let the victory tide wane and take the wind out of Opposition’s aggressive positioning. Significantly, while ZP elections are not conducted on party symbols, BJP went all out in giving its affiliation to contesting candidates by announcing their names from its official platform. Even as BJP registered a landslide victory, the Opposition upped the ante, accusing the ruling party of resorting to foul play. In fact, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav went on to call BJP’s win “mockery of free and fair elections” and a “disgraceful face of power.” This was squarely countered by BJP ranks with CM Yogi Adityanath terming the rural polls results a reflection of people’s confidence on the state’s good governance under leadership of PM Narendra Modi. Even as the Opposition firmed up its stance, BJP looked for every possible opportunity to bring newly elected rural local bodies chiefs closer to the ruling dispensation to establish smoother coordination for carrying out developmental work, besides lending traction to employment generation at the grassroots. Two days ago, the state government announced it will procure material worth Rs 1000 crore at the local level through 58,189 gram panchayats. The state government, in fact, approved a budget of Rs 1.75 lakh for equipping and furnishing village secretariats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-plans-to-bring-spotlight-back-on-rural-bodies-polls/articleshow/84875446.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||BJP alleges ‘scam in every sector’, its workers protest outside House||NEW DELHI: BJP workers protested against the Aam Aadmi Party government outside the legislative assembly, whose monsoon session started on Thursday. State BJP president Adesh Gupta and leader of the opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri led the demonstrations. Police had to use water cannons to stop the protestors when they tried to breach the barricades and enter the assembly premises. Addressing the demonstrators, Gupta alleged that Delhi had suffered much because of “inefficiency and scams” in the past seven years. He claimed there had been fraud in almost every sector, including in Delhi Jal Board projects, the new excise policy, purchase of Delhi Transport Corporation buses and in ration distribution. “Delhi government, which talks of providing world-class education, hasn’t even constructed a new school building in its seven years in power,” he said. “People here are yearning for clean and pure drinking water,” continued Gupta. “During the Covid pandemic too, Delhiites were dying in large numbers, but the CM was busy with self-publicity. What could be more shameful than the fact that even the free ration given by the central government for the poor was allowed to rot in the storehouses instead of being distributed?” Gupta maintained that during the pandemic, more than 300 government employees and health workers had died in the line of duty and despite the bereaved families of the corona warriors being promised Rs 1 crore each, very few had actually received the pay-out so far. He added that the CM had promised piped water to every household, something he has fulfilled except that the people were getting drain water in the taps. Bidhuri claimed there was neither clean drinking water nor buses for easy commuting in Delhi. “The healthcare system is no better and people have to search high and low for a hospital bed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-alleges-scam-in-every-sector-its-workers-protest-outside-house/articleshow/84873004.cms||---

As a result, we have requested the government to allow primary education to continue in morning hours,” said a member of the State Primary Teachers’ Association. The association has recently written to the Director of Primary Education in this regard. The government had recently allowed opening schools for on-campus studies for Class 9 to Class 12 students.

In the first week of July, the total number of active cases was around 2,300, which has now shot up to over 5400, although 70-80% of the cases are asymptomatic. The daily positive,cases hover around 900-1,000. The weekly Covid positivity rate in Ahmednagar is 4.9. Nashik divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game has raised the red flag over the constant surge of Covid cases in the district. “The constant surge in Covid cases in Ahmednagar district is extremely concerning. I had a virtual meeting with the district authorities on Wednesday stressing the need to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus,” he told TOI. Currently, Ahmednagar’s active cases are about five times more than the cumulative active cases of other four districts of the region (Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar). “Ahmednagar is currently witnessing a trend similar to Amravati district had witnessed when the second wave of the pandemic unfolded in the state. The Ahmednagar administration must not allow things to go out of hand on the Covid front. I have directed the police to crack the whip on those violating the Covid rules,” he said. Amravati district was the first in the state to witness a surge in Covid-19 cases in the second wave. Official sources attributed the rapid spike in cases due to overcrowding at many marriages at different talukas in the district in violation of the government rule of presence of only 50 guests. Moreover, some commercial establishments remain open beyond the time limit set by the administration. District collector Rajendra Bhosale warned that marriage halls, hotels etc will be sealed for a long time if there is overcrowding and violation of timings of operations. One such mangal karalaya was sealed on Thursday at Shevgaon taluka. Bhosale and the Ahmednagar CEO, Rajendra Kshirsagar, together visited the two hotspot talukas,--Parner and Sangamner. “There is a cluster of 20 villages in these two talukas that are registering 30-35 daily Covid cases. The local elected representatives of these villages have decided to voluntarily have a lockdown for 10-day from July 31 to reduce the infection,” Bhosale added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-case-count-in-ahmednagar-crosses-5400-mark-first-time-since-june-2nd-week/articleshow/84868129.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha pointed out how several areas of her constituency suffered power outages for nearly a week after the recent cyclone despite relentless efforts by the personnel of the electricity department to restore power supply. She said that as several areas of her constituency had dense tree cover, snapping of overhead power lines owing to tree branches falling on them, leads to frequent power outages. She urged the government to accept her proposal for underground power cabling in her constituency. Ponda MLA Ravi Naik, while supporting Saldanha’s views, expressed his displeasure over successive power ministers undertaking power cabling in their respective home constituencies while ignoring taking up the project in other constituencies. He demanded that underground power cabling be taken up in his constituency on priority. Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai said that with large number of vacancies at a higher level and several officers holding additional charges, the electricity department was heading to an “administrative collapse.” He said that with no training for electricity personnel often leads to deaths and accidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/several-legislators-throw-light-on-power-outages-demand-underground-cabling/articleshow/84875430.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Happily ever after marrying rapist? Not quite||NEW DELHI: “We told her not to go, but she accompanied him to Uttarakhand. She is dead now and he should be hanged,” said the brother of the 29-year-old woman who is believed to have been pushed to her death down a cliff by her husband in Nainital in June. Police recovered her body only a month and a half later. She had been raped by the man, but had later married him when he offered to do so while in jail. TOI spoke to experts to understand if resolving rape cases through marriage was justified. According to police, Uttarakhand native Rajesh Roy was jailed in July last year after raping the woman in Delhi's Dabri area. However, in October, he was released on conditional bail when the victim agreed to marry him. Roy’s family is in a daze. “If he has done it, he should be punished for it. We thought if the two married, the honour of both the families would be safeguarded,” said Roy’s brother. Supreme Court senior advocate Sidharth Luthra told TOI that bail is a possibility in such cases. “Rape cases fall in two categories. One is when the allegation of rape is based on obtaining the victim’s consent on promise of marriage. Rape without consent falls is the other category. While grant of bail on the grounds of the victim and accused agreeing to marry may be possible in the first category, there is no legal justification for bail in the second category.” Ranjana Kumari, director, Centre for Social Research, felt conditional bail given on marriage grounds should have certain provisions. “Specifically in this case, the woman and the man agreed to marriage, but the accused should have been told to regularly report to police or the court could have objected to the matrimony because he was a rape accused,” Kumari said. The woman’s brother recalled that the family was against her marrying the accused, but she believed Roy genuinely wanted to be with her. On June 11, when the accused asked her to accompany him to Uttarakhand, the family was apprehensive of sending her and even approached the police station to ask the investigating officer in the rape case if the two should be allowed to go together. Then, when the family couldn’t reach her on her phone even after four days, they went to the cops. Police later informed the woman’s family of what had happened. “Her body was recovered in a highly decomposed state but we recognised her clothes and jewellery,” said the brother. A team led by inspector Surinder Sandhu, SHO of Dabri police station, and SI Narender had combed 150 hilly areas before locating the body on Monday. Roy told his interrogators that he called her to an isolated location, strangled her and threw the body down the cliff before going home near Rudrapur and telling his brother that he had wanted to bring his wife with him but her family hadn’t allowed her to go.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/happily-ever-after-marrying-rapist-not-quite/articleshow/84873027.cms||---

It was hearing a plea by two minor siblings whose father was infected with Covid-19 and was admitted to Jaipur Golden Hospital on April 18 and was put on oxygen support. He died on April 24 as he was allegedly provided very minimal oxygen support due to the shortage, the plea claimed. Justice Rekha Palli granted three weeks’ time to the authorities to file their counter affidavits after noting that the same was yet to be filed. Advocate Anuj Aggarwal, appearing for Delhi government, informed that there was a policy in existence for families who have lost their breadearners to Covid-19 and he would want to place it on record. Advocate Bharat Malhotra, for the siblings, said that the petitioners want to ensure that those who lost their parents in the pandemic get timely compensation. In June, a vacation bench of HC had issued notices to the Centre, Delhi government, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, NCPCR and the LG on the plea which cited a statement by the hospital’s medical director that as many as 20 patients died and more than 200 lives were at stake due to lack of oxygen at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-govts-reply-on-relief-for-covid-hit-families/articleshow/84873057.cms||---

They argued that terrorism is dealt by a central law like Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the state government cannot enact a law when the field is already occupied.

Kotta Telangana Charitra history group convener Sriramoju Haragopal said: “Menhir means a large upright standing stone in French. Most menhirs belong to the Atone Age or Megalithic Age, and they were built on graves of ancestors of prehistoric man. These stones are part of the culture of ancient people.” One of the pillars found at Venkatapuram is intact. The stone is 4.5 feet wide and 15 feet high. “The second menhir was partially broken and fell to the ground. Megalithic burials stones were removed by farmers while cultivating land. In fact, Venkatapuram is known as Elugupalli Venkatapuram. This site has archaeological importance. Most of the significant archaeological structures were demolished for housing, farms or real estate ventures,” he added. The Telangana heritage department has not yet identified the menhirs of the area. “No excavations were carried out. We have asked the heritage department to preserve the menhirs and also carry out more exploration and excavation,” Ahobilam Karunakar, another member of the group, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-menhirs-found-at-fields-in-yadadri-district/articleshow/84875516.cms||---

While one of the women bought expensive gifts including Rs 92,000 mobile phone for her lover, the other gave some of the ornaments to her beau who had sustained loss in his business. The Vavta police arrested the complainant’s wife and relative for the theft. Inspector H V Sisara said that Vatva resident Manan Patel had filed a complaint on July 22 that some unidentified person had entered the house from the back door between 3pm and 7pm on July 22. He told police that the burglar made away with gold jewellery worth Rs 8.25 lakh. This included mangalsutra, necklaces, and bangles among others. The police began investigating the case. They called the forensic science laboratory officials who swept the place. However, they found only one fingerprint from the crime scene. On examination, it was revealed that the fingerprint belonged to none other than Manan Patel’s wife Riddhi. Police interrogated Riddhi and found out that he was in love with an unmarried youth. “In order to impress the man, she carried out the theft in her house and used it to gift an expensive cellphone to him,” said police. They added, “During investigation, it was revealed she had kept the stolen gold ornaments with Rohini, who is Manan’s relative. We recovered some ornaments from Riddhi” When she informed that the other ornaments were with Rohini, cops searched her house. “During interrogation, Rohini told us that she too was in love with a youth and had give all the ornaments to her lover as he had incurred huge losses in the business,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/love-ke-liye-women-steal-from-their-house/articleshow/84873064.cms||---
---||Delhi||R-Day violence: Protection from arrest to Lakha Sidhana||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday granted protection from arrest to gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana in a case related to the violence on Republic Day during farmers’ rally, saying prima facie no case was made out against him. Additional sessions judge Dr Kamini Lau said the IO had submitted that there was no direct evidence to confirm Sidhana’s presence inside Red Fort and the call detail records available on record showed his presence outside its periphery. “I have asked the investigating officer if the presence of the accused outside Red Fort was a very grave offence and non-bailable. The investigating agency is not sure of the same... There is no prima facie material to show that the applicant/accused was present inside Red Fort and if that be so, even no prima facie case is made out against him,” the judge said in the order. Additional public prosecutor Rajat Kalra had opposed the anticipatory bail plea claiming Sidhana had a long criminal history and was involved in several cases. Police had further alleged that he was one of the key conspirators of the violence and a prominent leader at the Singhu border during the farmers’ protests. Sidhana’s lawyers, Jaspreet Rai and Jasdeep Dhillon, told the court that there was no evidence to show that he indulged in any violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/r-day-violence-protection-from-arrest-to-sidhana/articleshow/84873050.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Peerless Hospital trains transgenders on basic life support||KOLKATA: Peerless Hospital, which runs an exclusive clinic for trans people, on Thursday conducted a workshop to train members of the third gender community in basic life support (BLS). Twenty transpersons attended the workshop and received BSL certificates at the end of it. “Basic life support generally refers to the type of care that first-responders, healthcare providers and public safety professionals provide to people so that they can revive anyone who is experiencing cardiac arrest, respiratory distress or an obstructed airway. Before the pandemic, Peerless Hospital has imparted this training to Kolkata Police, Navy personnel and teachers of various schools,” said Subrojyoti Bhowmick, clinical director, who is in charge of Antar, the state’s first health clinic exclusively for the transgender community, housed at Peerless Hospital. Bhowmick added, “Since I visit Garima Griha to support the transpersons in distress, I realized this sort of formal training is all the more necessary for them.” Garima Griha is the city’s first safe home for transgenders. The Union ministry of social justice and empowerment has tied up with Gokhale Road Bandhan, a city-based support group for transgender people, to set up the safe home for abandoned transgender people. Ranjita Sinha, secretary of Gokhale Road Bandhan and Association of Transgender/Hijra in Bengal (ATHB), said, “This is the first time a training as important as this has been given to transpersons, who are often victims of transphobia that deprives them of immediate medical attention.” “The training becomes more relevant in times of pandemic when doctors are avoiding home visits and physical contact with patients,” Bhowmick said, adding the Garima Griha inmates received hands-on orientation on BSL with the help of mannequins. Led by Indranil Dasgupta, head of the department of emergency medicine, an American Heart Association-recognized training centre for BLS and advanced cardiac life support, the transpersons were shown how a person with cardiac arrest could be helped, using automated external defibrillators and relieving airway obstructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosp-trains-transgenders-on-basic-life-support/articleshow/84873053.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

According to the data provided by Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), 30 of the 150 patients required hospitalisation but none of them required oxygen support during their stay at the hospital. The vaccination drive has speeded up in the city during the last two months and around 48% of the total vaccination took place in two months since June 1. The city reported a total of 3,293 Covid cases in June, while it reported 1,611 cases in July so far. “Of the 150 patients who tested positive in the city, 110 had got the first shot and the remaining 40 had got the second shot. Only 20% of them required hospitalization, but they were not in serious condition,” said Jitendra Dhaneshwar, medical officer and in charge of the Bytco hospital. He said none of the 150 patients had succumbed to the infection. NMC’s Covid officer Avesh Palod said even though some people are getting infected even after taking a vaccine, there are no chances of being in serious condition and patients get cured early. “The government has projected Covid third wave in the coming few months. Hence, increasing vaccination and maintaining Covid appropriate behaviour are the only measures to prevent Covid,” said Palod. “We have already started preparations to increase the number of beds considering the third wave, but the requirement for the number of beds will be reduced if we could vaccinate maximum number of beneficiaries in the city,” he said. So far, 5.60 lakh doses of vaccines have been administered in Nashik city. Of which, the first shot has been given to 4.12 lakh beneficiaries, while the second shot has been given to the 1.48 lakh beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/150-of-4904-who-received-jabs-got-covid-in-nashik-city/articleshow/84868162.cms||Tushar Pawar

It has become a white elephant. The toilets aren’t working and the lifts are non-functional. The complex which should have been a landmark is going to be modern ruins,” he said. Revenue minister Jennifer Monseratte interjected at this moment to inform him that the repair work of the toilets and lifts was going on. Sardesai also slammed the government for its failure on the IT front. He said that the government has failed to bring in investments in the IT sector because of failure to provide proper infrastructure and opportunities that could attract IT industries to the state. Speaking on demands on education, Sardesai underscored the need for effecting a change in the academic school curriculum. He stated that the school students suffer from “psychological trauma” for having to consistently watch the mobile phone screens for their online classes. “Infrastructure for school education has gone for a toss. Classrooms need to be modernised and labs upgraded,” he said. Pointing out to teachers’ protests and issues concerning their unpaid salaries and regularisation, Sardesai demanded to know why teachers weren’t a priority for the government. He also expressed his displeasure over inadequate compensation paid to land losers of Mopa airport. Pointing out that hardly any Goans were employed at the Dabolim airport, Sardesai demanded that Goans be made “employable” so as to recruit them at the Mopa airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goa-admin-complex-needs-maintenance-vijai/articleshow/84875460.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Shut since November 2018, Malancha up for sale; Tolly-Garia stretch now without a hall||KOLKATA: Malancha, the prominent south Kolkata theatre, is now up for sale. The seats and the projector have already been sold. The owners are now in talks with buyers who are either realtors or associated with retail chains to sell off the theatre along with the adjoining four-storey building. Records state that Malancha had opened its doors on October 26, 1979, with a Bengali mythological movie. Old-timers remember the screening of Amitabh Bachchan’s ‘Sharaabi’ and ‘Akhree Rasta’ at the theatre. Uttam Kumar’s ‘Ogo Bodhu Sundari’ too had done well there. Subsequently, other Hindi films including ‘Mohabbatein’ and ‘Kal Ho Naa Ho’ drew a good crowd. It was among the four single screens, including Mahua, Bunty and Madhuban, that drew a lot of viewers in the stretch between Garia and Tollygunge. All of them shut down some years back. The first to close was Bunty. Madhudan and Mahua followed. In early 2000, Malancha was shut for a year due to renovation work. After running Kamal Haasan’s ‘Vishwaroopam 2’, it closed down on August 15, 2018, only to reopen on August 31. The cinema shut down for good in November that year. Survival of single screens has been a big challenge for Tollywood. There were some 18 single screens in Kolkata that had kept their doors open before the government stalled exhibition this year due to the pandemic. According to Mausumi Guha Roy, who is a co-owner of the cinema, “My father, Subodh Roy Chowdhury, was the founder of the cinema. He died in 2010. My mother passed away three months later. My sister and I had wanted to keep the cinema running. We tried a lot to do so but were forced to close it in 2018 since we didn’t get the necessary cooperation. Since the cinema has been shut for long, both my sister and I have agreed with our uncle to sell it off.” Her uncle, Amar Roy Chowdhury, who is another co-owner, attributed the low footfall as one of the prime reasons for shutting down the theatre. “With limited visitors, running the theatre was not commercially viable. We will not give it out on lease but sell it outright. Negotiations are on with buyers,” Roy Chowdhury said. Apart from the cinema hall, the premises also has a four storey-building adjacent to it. “The total area measures 18 cottahs and 10 chattaks. The building adjacent to the cinema houses two banks and another office. There are a few shops too. The entire property will be sold off,” he added. On being asked if there is a chance of a new buyer reopening it as a cinema hall, he said, “The structure remains. But the seats, speakers and the projector have already been sold off. The buyer will take a call on what to do with the property,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shut-since-nov-2018-malancha-up-for-sale-tolly-garia-stretch-now-without-a-hall/articleshow/84873102.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

If things go as planned, your councillor will be able to grant you funds and share the burden of expenses needed for these works. The AMC standing committee has passed a resolution, asking government to allow councillors to allocate their funds to develop private societies. If this is approved, societies will have to bear only 10% of the expenses. Till now, residents used to shell out 20% of the cost. So far, councillors grants were not included in the Swarnim Jayanti Chief Minister Shaheri Vikas Yojna for infrastructure development works. Standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot said, “This yojna enabled societies to get cemented roads, drainage or stormwater lines, paver blocks and other infrastructure. Till now, government bore 70% of the project cost while societies bore 20% and MLAs bore 10%.” He added, “As per the new proposal, the government will continue to bear 70% expenses. However, societies will have to fork over only 10% as 10% of the funds will come from the AMC budget and the remaining 10% will be paid from the MLA or councillor’s grant. This way, we will be able to cover more societies.” So far, over 900 societies have benefited from the scheme and over 200-odd societies are waiting for approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/want-roads-lights-societies-to-bear-only-10-of-project-cost/articleshow/84873104.cms||---
---||Delhi||ED gets seven-day custody of Ambience Group promoter||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court remanded Raj Singh Gehlot, promoter of the Ambience Group, in Enforcement Directorate custody till August 5 in a case related to a bank loan fraud of Rs 800 crore. The court said there was material on record to suggest that funds fraudulently obtained in connivance with bank officials were siphoned off by Gehlot. Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana said that ED’s case for Gehlot’s custodial interrogation was valid and the allegations were serious in nature. The court noted that against Ambience’s outstanding liability of Rs 289.3 crore, bank officials had attempted to settle the account with the accused for a paltry sum of Rs128.9 crore, which spoke volumes about malafide intent. “The material available on record suggests that the accused entered into a criminal conspiracy with other accused persons to fraudulently siphon off the loan amount by diverting the funds for the purposes other than for what they were released,” the court said. The judge said, “In my considered opinion, a sustained custodial interrogation of the accused is desirable owing to the very intricate nature of the offence of money laundering ... I do not find any merit in the contention that the arrest of the accused was unwarranted in the instant case.” Exactly a year ago, ED had carried out searches on seven premises of the Ambience group and of the promoters and directors of Aman Hospitality Pvt Ltd (AHPL). The company had received Rs 800 crore as loans from a consortium of banks which it was alleged to have laundered through related companies. The directors of Ambience group have also been implicated of laundering through the construction and development of Leela Ambience, a five-star hotel in Delhi. APHL is alleged to have transferred a substantial part of the loan funds to several companies and individuals as payment for running bills and advance payments for supply of material or work executed. Some employees of Ambience Group and the associates of Raj Singh Gehlot were made the directors of such companies, with Gehlot remaining the ‘authorised signatory’.

The state education department has revisited the July 31 deadline and extended it to August 31, said sources in the department. To meet the huge rush in schools for Class 9 to Class 12 admissions due to mass promotion, the state government has invited applications from schools that want to increase the class strength. The government’s decision for mass promotion for Class 10 students, the results of which were declared recently, has led to a big rush in schools. As a result, the state education department has decided to increase the classroom capacity from 60 to 75 students per class. The Gujarat board has made some changes in the classroom strength for this year and the next. “For Class 9 and Class 11, we will allow 75 students to be admitted per class.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujaratis liquidated 22 metric tonne of gold since pandemic||AHMEDABAD: To meet cash requirements amid the economic uncertainty triggered by the pandemic, 20% of India’s scrap gold sales took place from Gujarat, suggest estimates by India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). According to the latest gold demand trend (GDT) report by World Gold Council (WGC) launched on Thursday, 111.5MT scrap gold sale in exchange of cash was reported from April 2020 to June 2021. Of this, IBJA experts estimate that 22MT gold – both bullion and jewellery – was sold off by people. “People lost their jobs or their sources of income dried up due to the economic turmoil caused after the lockdown. To cushion personal finance needs, many sold off their gold and gold jewellery since the pandemic. At least 20% of scrap gold sale in the country came from Gujarat,” said Haresh Acharya, director, IBJA. The scrap gold sale is over and above an estimated 120 MT gold traded in exchange of gold, according to WGC experts. “Gold recycling has surged 15% in India due to the pandemic as people needed money to sustain their expenditures for personal as well as medical requirements. With surge in yellow metal price, many also sold off gold for profit-booking as well,” said Somasundaram PR, managing director, India, WGC. “The ferocity and spread of the second wave of Covid-19 throughout rural India impacted income levels. Many rural consumers turned to gold to meet medical expenses during the pandemic, forcing distress selling of gold,” states the latest GDT report. Interestingly, gold recycling saw a significant 33% rise in the first quarter of 2021-22 i.e. April to June this year when the second wave of Covid-19 struck, according to the report. Besides encashing gold, a significant increase was seen in uptakes for gold loans as well, said Somasundaram. “People here have a sentimental value attached to gold and therefore, they don’t want to part with gold. Thus, gold loans too witnessed phenomenal uptakes. Returns were better as price of gold was high and as the RBI increased the loan to value ratio to 90%, people could get loans by mortgaging gold, rather than selling it off,” he said. Bullion traders here said that the majority of people who sold off gold or sought gold loans were from rural India, and did so especially during the second wave of the pandemic to cater to medical expenditures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujaratis-liquidated-22mt-of-gold/articleshow/84873130.cms||Niyati Parikh

In her complaint, Mahima Pahwa of Mahanagar said several years ago her father and uncle had rented out 14 shops in Kasturi Bhawan Pratap Market to Sardar Surinder Singh. “There are three shops on the ground floor, four on the first floor and seven on the second floor of the building.

The complainant said Singh called her uncle on July 23 and said that he had transferred the possession of the shop to Chopra. “I was crestfallen at the disclosure.

The exercise will begin from Brahmagiri, the place of origin of Godavari river in Trimbakeshwar taluka of Nashik district. Stating that Godavari was not limited to Nashik, the eco-sensitivity of the region should be mapped, maintained and nurtured for which the eco-sensitive zones will be mapped by the villages themselves. “Brahmagiri houses religious and cultural heritage. Recently, there have been some incidents that have not gone well with its eco-sensitivity. We have therefore decided to carry out the survey by village-level committees that will decide the eco-sensitivity and propose the kind of activities be allowed there,” collector Mandhare said. The government in 2014 had announced the committees that will decide about the eco-sensitivity in the villages and they are being mobilized now. The gramsevak is the member secretary of the village level committees and thus they will conduct public hearing in their respective villages about the flora fauna of the village, consider the natural biodiversity, forest areas, lakes and water bodies, nullahs and grazing areas for the cattle. The village-level bodies will identify and conduct physical survey and inspection of the sensitive areas and map them. The forest department, revenue department and agriculture department have also been asked to ensure the committee is on its mark. The collector further pointed out all the information received will be compiled to demaracate eco-sensitive areas across the district following which these random development and other similar activities in such areas would not be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/demarcate-eco-sensitive-zones-collector-to-village-committees/articleshow/84868282.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Industries will now trade smoke emitting from their chimneys||AHMEDABAD: After the launch of the world’s first Emission Trading System for particulate matter PM10 in Surat in September 2019, the concept has received takers among Ahmedabad industrial clusters too. Of the 230 factory units that were approached, 143 units have agreed to buy the Continuous Emission Monitoring System to be installed at their facilities. Under emissions trading systems, it pays for companies to install pollution-reducing technology. Surat's pilot scheme enabled participating industrial units to reduce particulate emissions by 24%. How does the ETS work? Here the Gujarat Pollution Control Board sets a limit or cap on quantum of emissions per month (ranges between 200 to 276 tonnes per month) that industries may emit. The cap is based on the assessment of emissions data from the government's CEMS. “Participating industries can comply either by installing technology that cuts pollution, or purchase 'emission permits' to emit more than their limit for a specific pollutant,” says a senior GPCB official. Right now the base rate is Rs 5 per kg of PM 10 emitted. “Owing to Covid and a slowdown in industrial activity during Covid year the rates had dropped to rock bottom, but now its slowly picking up. During its peak, ETS base rate was Rs 15 per kg of PM10 emitted,” added the GPCB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/industries-will-now-trade-smoke-emitting-from-their-chimneys/articleshow/84873163.cms||---

The court, which passed the order on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Ukkrapandiyan, vice-president of the Madurai Bench Lawyers’ Society for Unity, observed that it is an ill-advised and meaningless petition by an uninformed advocate against public interest. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice S Ananthi observed, “There is no conclusive scientific opinion as to when a third or subsequent surge may arise and the number of positive cases have been going up in neighbouring state at an alarming level over the past few days.” “As it is, there is an experience of the havoc that was wreaked by the second surge of the pandemic, since the country was caught unaware. Experts advised that the only protection for vaccination to be completed so that even if the virus attacks an individual, the chance of fatality would stand reduced,” the judges observed and added that this court has continuously warned that in such a situation, one must err on the side of caution, in public interest and to safeguard the health of all concerned. “ As far as virtual hearing is concerned, the performance at Madurai appears to be much better than at the principal seat at Chennai,” observed the judges. The judges observed that while it is appreciated that not all people, particularly, parties intending to appear in person, may have access to smartphones or laptops or other gadgets to participate in virtual hearing, matters are being taken up and disposed of on regular basis without dismissals for default or ex-parte orders being made. The judges observed that in the light of the above, uninformed petitions of present kind are evidently avoidable, if only to allow the court to concentrate on matters that require its attention and not waste time on the frivolous and fanciful. Dismissing the petition, the judges said that the petitioner should exercise extreme restraint before invoking this extraordinary jurisdiction in public interest in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-physical-hearing/articleshow/84873135.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Madurai||Illegal buildings should be razed in public view: Madras high court||MADURAI: Observing that far too often the high and mighty in real estate flouted laws with political benevolence and incompetent court largesse to get away with almost murder, Madras high court on Thursday observed that no leniency can be shown towards such illegal constructions. Only if a few such buildings are razed in public view that other plotters of similar authorised constructions would know what lies in store for them in future. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by S T Karunanithi who sought a direction to take action against a multi-storey commercial building put up by a person called S Thanaraj (sixth respondent) in Tuticorin corporation limits. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice S Ananthi observed that an affidavit filed by the town and country planning authorities reveals largescale deviation in the building such as completely unauthorised floors and the extent of deviation in certain areas is 100%. The judges observed that while urban areas in the country are quickly being transformed into concrete jungles, the rule of the jungle also appears to have taken over. It is probably this which prompted Thanaraj to suggest there are minor variations from approved plans. Thanaraj also complains of personal vendetta of petitioner and that the complaint is being masterminded in political interest. “Whatever may be the case and even if extraterrestrials impelled the complaint being made in courts, once it is evident that there is unauthorised construction, the law must take over,” observed the judges. They observed that the law must prevail and its enforcement should be strict. It is for the enforcement agency that should act in accordance with the letter and spirit of law as encouraged by the present order. Hence the judges directed the Tuticorin corporation commissioner to take immediate aggressive steps to remove the unauthorised construction and deal with the same in accordance with law. The judges also said that Thanaraj should be heard and reasonable opportunity given to him before the demolition work is commenced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/illegal-buildings-should-be-razed-in-public-view-hc/articleshow/84873156.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Goa||Goa: Govt promoting new industry of crime, says opposition||PORVORIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant’s attempt to blame the parents of the rape survivors in the recent case at Benaulim beach for letting the minors stay out late, drew flak from all quarters on Thursday, with many demanding that he should step down. Despite the widespread criticism, the chief minister doubled down and said parents should take some responsibility for the gangrape, which took place during the early hours of Sunday. AICC national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala slammed Sawant for shifting the blame onto the survivors and their parents. “The chief minister should quit and go home for such preposterous pearls of wisdom,” he said. A day earlier, Sawant, who also holds the home portfolio, had said, “When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police.” “The government servant who is involved in the rape case has already been suspended. All the four were quickly arrested. It is the responsibility of the parents also when they send their minor children out,” said the chief minister on Thursday as he stuck to his guns. Sawant’s comments in the state legislative assembly have drawn condemnation from all quarters, including from other MLAs. Former IT minister Rohan Khaunte said the state government is promoting a “new industry” of crime in Goa. “Yesterday (July 28), the chief minister is on record saying that parents should not let their children out. Instead of creating security for Goans, he is trying to justify why things are going wrong,” the Porvorim MLA said. A day earlier, Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai had said that a “highly influential person” had called the police to save the accused persons in the Benaulim rape case. One of the accused is a driver at the agriculture department. “Our daughters should be free to go wherever they want at whatever time they want. Not only have you admitted that your BJP government is incapable of keeping them safe, you are emboldening the rapists who are happy to see the home minister himself blame the victims,” said AAP spokesperson Valmiki Naik. While state Congress president Girish Chodankar demanded an apology from Sawant and BJP, state convener for AAP Rahul Mhambre, said Sawant appears to be unfit for office. “It’s with utter disgust that I hold my head in shame as we have a chief minister in our Goa who, instead of charging and bringing to law the accused culprits, blames the victims. I strongly condemn the statement made by the Goa CM who holds the home portfolio. If he is helpless, he is unfit for the office,” said Mhambre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-promoting-new-industry-of-crime-oppn/articleshow/84875561.cms||Newton Sequeira

In a separate incident, three men were killed on Tuesday night after a speeding Cluster Scheme bus rammed into their car while taking a turn. Police said they received a call about an accident at Samaspur road at 10.25pm and rushed a team to the spot. The bike and the bus were in a damaged condition. The injured had been taken to a nearby hospital and was declared dead on arrival. Initially, the deceased could not be identified, but his family was traced through the motorcycle’s registration number. He was identified as Rahul. The body was handed over to the family on Thursday after an autopsy. Initial inquiry shows that the bus was in its lane when it hit the bike. Further probe is being conducted to ascertain the sequence of events. An FIR under Section 304A (causing death due to negligence) and 279 IPC (rash driving) has been registered and cops are looking for the absconding bus driver. This is the second accident involving a Cluster Scheme bus in two days. On Tuesday, three men were killed while another was critically injured after their car rammed a Cluster bus late on Tuesday night in Dwarka. Police suspected that the bus was being driven on the wrong carriageway. The driver of the bus, who absconded after the accident, was later arrested by the police. Prima facie, it appeared that the Cluster Scheme bus was taking a turn and entered the carriageway from where the car was coming, leading to a head-on collision. The impact of the collision was such that the front portion of the Swift was completely damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teen-dies-after-crashing-his-bike-into-cluster-bus/articleshow/84873160.cms||---

Several have taken to the social media site seeking to hold him accountable for his statements. TOI had reported on Thursday that following the gangrape of minor girls at Benaulim beach during the early hours of Sunday, Sawant had said, “When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police.” He had also said that teens, particularly minors, should not be “spending the nights on beaches”. A tweetstorm was started from 6pm on Thursday, wherein Twitter users across the platform were urged to demand an apology from the chief minister. “In view of the statements made by the head of our state, it’s extremely unfortunate that we are having a tweetstorm such as this one. But it’s important for that person who was made to feel guilty for no fault of theirs and who was wronged by society,” Twitter user Gautami R, posted. Another user, Nerissa, pointed out the irony in the CM’s statements amid the ongoing assembly session. “The assembly session (on July 28) went on till midnight and MLAs and staff will have reached home in the early ‘dangerous’ morning hours. Does that mean that women should not have taken up jobs at the assembly? Or is the CM/House irresponsible for running the session so late?” she posted. Student activist Mithila Prabhudesai posted a series of tweets detailing her experience of being molested and victim-blamed as a child. Finnish national Sanna Cutter, who has been fighting for justice for her nephew’s alleged murder in Goa, also took to Twitter to share her thoughts. “Instead of holding the perpetrators accountable and taking measures to improve safety of women in the state, the chief minister of BJP-ruled Goa, Pramod Sawant, decided to indulge in victim-shaming,” she wrote. Independent cartoonist Angela Ferrao scribbled a caricature of Sawant making the comments and uploaded it to the social networking site. “Mr Pramod Sawant who neglected to do his job when the second wave hit Goa, is giving lectures on duty,” she captioned her post. The chief minister’s statements triggered an outcry after he blamed the survivors and their parents for the incident. “Mr CM, do you give up protecting your citizens late at night? What kind of an argument is this?” tweeted Sudhir Dash. “Criminals have the right to roam around freely but young girls and women should stay at home? This is exactly the pro-rapists mindset that needs to change,” Mohammad Rehan posted. Tweets with ‘Dr Sawant we demand an apology’ were circulating on social media till late evening on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/criminals-have-right-to-roam-freely-but-girls-dont/articleshow/84875615.cms||Nida Sayed

All five of them are from Madhya Pradesh and had gone to visit Vaishno Devi shrine with a pit stop in Delhi. Since their train was in the wee hours, they decided to go clubbing and harassed the women . The incident took place on the intervening night of July 18-19 in south Delhi's Safdarjung Enclave. The victims had gone to a restaurant in the evening and were waiting outside for a cab when the accused allegedly made lewd comments at them. The police have filed the FIR under Section 509 of the IPC, which deals with outraging a woman's modesty. “An investigation was taken up and a video recording of the incident from the mobile phone of the complainant was scanned and the accused were later traced,” said Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police, (southwest). The accused men have been identified as Dinesh Ram (34), Ashish Shivhare (39), Vikas Shivhare (38), Naveen Shivhare (41) and Ankit Shivhare (29). “Their numbers were obtained and they were called to Delhi, following which they were arrested.

The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by S Gandhirajan, a resident of Virudhunagar district. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice S Ananthi observed that the petitioner is perfectly justified in pursuing the cause, but he appears to have knocked the wrong doors. Whether prohibition should be enforced in the state or not, is a matter of policy and it has to be brought about by legislation. Hence, the judges observed that the relief sought for by the petitioner could not be granted and disposed of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-close-liquor-shops-in-state-disposed-of/articleshow/84873223.cms||---
---||Madurai||State must look into citizens’ grievances: Madras high court||MADURAI: The state must look into the needs of its citizens, particularly when the grievance is of not receiving water to irrigate fields for the better part of the year, the Madras high court has observed and directed the authorities to take a decision expeditiously with regard to the implementation of proposed project of laying pipelines from Kullappagoundanpatti stream to Ethakoil tank situated in Andipatti taluk in Theni district. The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by T Rathinavel from Andipatti, secretary of the Tamilaga Malar Farmers Association who sought for a direction to the government to grant administrative sanction for this proposed project. He stated that the project of laying water pipelines for 62km from Kullappagoundanpatti stream to Ethakoil tank which would bring surplus water to 21 PWD tanks and nearly 300 ooranis benefits nearly 150 villages which come under 30 village panchayats in Andipatti union. A division bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice S Ananthi observed that according to the petitioner the people remain without any supply of water for agricultural activities for most part of the year. When an earlier litigation was filed before this court, the authorities were directed to consider the plight of the farmers in and around Andipatti and to devise a scheme to reach water to them. Pursuant to the earlier order, a project report has been prepared for the proposed project. The judges observed that in a matter of present kind, despite the petitioner’s assertion that the proposal submitted is awaiting administrative sanction, several aspects such as viability of the project, cost, availability of resources, has to be looked into by the higher authorities in the executive when a project report is submitted. At the same time, the state must also look into the needs of its citizens. Hence, the judges directed the authorities to take a decision for allocation of funds to implement this project or formulate any other suitable project that would reach water to the farmers around Andipatti to alleviate their problems of lack of water for irrigation. The judges also directed the authorities to undertake a site visit and interact with the farmers to expeditiously take a decision that may be for the greater good.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/state-must-look-into-citizens-grievances/articleshow/84873174.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Stop illegal extraction of groundwater: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday directed the state government to frame appropriate guidelines and regulation, and implementation by local authorities to regulate groundwater extraction and supply of drinking water. The court held access to clean water is fundamental right and authorities are dutybound for equitable supply of water. Acting on a PIL complaining about indiscriminate groundwater extraction in Surat’s industrial areas of Udhana-Pandesara for commercial purposes by supplying water to industries in tankers, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati ordered the government to frame regulations on basis of directions given by the Centre in its notification of September 24, 2020. If this is done, the court said that it would be “a stepping stone to control the illegal and indiscriminate groundwater extraction and supply of drinking water and resultantly the exploitation of groundwater resources would be curbed to large extent”. The court said that the issue is not restricted to Surat industrial estate, but it is a common concern throughout the state of Gujarat. It said that the issue is of primary importance and some guidelines are required to be issued in absence of any legal framework to regulate the activity. It observed, “There being no direct mechanism available to control the groundwater extraction, the exploitation of resources remains uncontrolled.” The court was against extraction of groundwater, which is the State’s property, for the purpose of commercial exploitation. Asserting that clean water is every citizen’s fundamental right and state authorities are under constitutional obligation to maintain natural resources, the court said that the task is how water is to be made available to one and all. For this, the question is how to curb the exploitation of such natural resources and to ensure effective mechanism for equal and just distribution of such resources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stop-illegal-extraction-of-groundwater-hc/articleshow/84873230.cms||---

Panel will probe||NOIDA: With several parts of the city getting waterlogged, the district environment committee (DEC) has initiated an enquiry and sought a report on the status of rainwater harvesting systems in residential societies and commercial complexes. All such constructions under Noida and Greater Noida authorities are supposed to have rainwater harvesting systems, according to building bylaws. Several public parks also have them installed. But the officials said that there has been no assessment on how many such plants are operational across the district. “Rainwater harvesting systems are essential for recharging the groundwater. Noida’s groundwater level is already low and it is depleting every year. Hence, it is important to maintain the rainwater harvesting systems,” said Vikrant Tongad, an environmental activist and member of the DEC. Officials said all local authorities would be asked to report on the status of rainwater harvesting systems. “The authorities will give us an update on the systems and how these can help recharge groundwater. The report will be discussed in the committee’s meeting next month,” said Suhas LY, the district magistrate and chairperson of the committee. The committee will also prepare a report on the illegal RO water plants across the district. Earlier, the administration had received complaints regarding two such plants last month that were shut down.  “There are hundreds of small and big RO plants in the district and they are using up the groundwater. Most of them may not be needed if the local authority’s water supply system becomes regular. We will help the administration to locate such plants,” Tongad said. The DEC has also sought a list of waterbodies, wetlands and solid waste management plants in the district and residents’ complaints regarding waste management system. Officials said an environment plan has been prepared for next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/do-city-bldgs-have-rainwater-harvesting-panel-will-probe/articleshow/84876952.cms||Snehil Sinha

The terror module was busted by the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of UP Police with the arrest of two alleged operatives, Minaz and Masiruddin from Lucknow on July 11 and their three associates, Mustaquim, Moid and Shakeel on July 14. All five were nabbed from different places in Lucknow.

Sources in the ATS said, NIA sleuths had questioned Minaz and Masiruddin and also sought all evidence and documents pertaining to the case. After a preliminary inquiry, a fresh FIR will be lodged by NIA. During raids followed by arrests of the terror suspects, UP ATS had seized an improvised explosive device (IED) in the form of a pressure cooker bomb from the Lucknow residence of an accused.

---||Noida||To check annual flooding, GNIDA to redesign Surajpur roads, drains||Greater Noida: The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has decided to redesign roads and drainage networks around Surajpur collectorate that gets flooded almost every year. The work will start after this monsoon, officials said. The development authority has been facing a lot of criticism for not being able to prevent flooding in the area and other busy parts of the city. Although GNIDA had claimed it had taken preventive measures this time as well, steady rains that lasted for about 20 minutes resulted in waterlogging in many locations. Currently, eight pumps are being operated to drain out water. “Surajpur collectorate building is at a lower level compared to the road adjacent to it. Also, the drains near the building do not discharge water properly as they remain choked with silt and garbage. It is extremely difficult to get inside the building when it rains,” said Ramesh Gautam, a resident of Mamura who visited the collectorate on Wednesday to apply for a welfare scheme.On Wednesday, GNIDA blacklisted a company and imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on a contractor for not being able to avoid waterlogging in Kulesara area. For the past couple of days, traffic movement has been disrupted on the Dadri-Surarjpur-Chhalera route because of flooding.“On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, our officials surveyed all places that reported waterlogging. Some contractors have been identified and action will be taken against them,” said the additional chief executive officer of GNIDA, Deep Chandra. In Noida, the area near Mahamaya flyover is prone to waterlogging. Officials said Noida Authority had spent Rs 74 lakh to avoid such problems on the stretch between Mahamaya flyover and DND flyway loop near Dalit Prerna Sthal.“But the efforts have not yielded desired results. The area near Mahamaya flyover gets flooded almost every year and water stays on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway days after it stops raining,” said Sachin Rawat, a resident of Jaypee Aman in Sector 151. The stretch on Master Plan Road 1 that extends from DND flyway to Sector 16 underpass also gets flooded when it rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/to-check-annual-flooding-gnida-to-redesign-surajpur-roads-drains/articleshow/84876941.cms||Shalabh

Labourers were seen cleaning trawlers, loading nets, and some even offering special prayers ahead of the new fishing season. However, 60% of the migrant labourer workforce is yet to return from their home towns. Cutbona Boat Owners’ Development Society president Savio D’Silva said around 40% of the work force has returned and the remaining are expected soon. Other than the weather, trawler owners have to also deal with sandbars that form at the mouth of the river where it meets the sea making it difficult to manoeuvre the vessel. During the past few days traditional fishermen along Salcete and Mormugao have netted sizeable quantities of solar shrimps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cutbona-jetty-readies-for-new-fishing-season/articleshow/84875648.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Bank clerk calls boss ‘hoodlum’, loses job||AHMEDABAD: Abusing your boss could cost you your job. A bank clerk lost his job for calling his branch manager a hoodlum and the labour court as well as the Gujarat high court have upheld his termination, by holding that the punishment is commensurate to the charge. The case involved Harshad Dave, who was appointed as leave reserve cashier in the Bank of India’s Sardhar branch in 1973. Later, he was confirmed as staff clerk-cashier and posted at the Kasturbadham branch in Rajkot. He did not seem to get along well with the branch manager and on February 21, 2002, Dave addressed his manger as ‘hoodlum’. The branch manager complained about this misconduct to his superior. The manager also complained about Dave’s alleged irregularities and carelessness. The management held an inquiry against Dave for calling his boss a hoodlum, making reduced payments to customers but the amounts concerned were just between Rs 10 and Rs 50, and the third charge was that he was careless and irresponsible in his behaviour and his day-to-day duty. He was accused of writing sums in various languages - Hindi, Gujarati and English. The inquiry proved all the charges and the disciplinary authority ordered that Dave’s services be terminated in July 2003. Dave rushed to the concerned labour court, claiming that the charges levelled were frivolous and that he had a stainless service record. The inquiry and termination order were mala fide, he claimed. However, his case was dismissed by the labour court in 2011. Dave moved the HC in 2012, questioning the inquiry and its outcome as well as the proportion of punishment. A single-judge bench rejected his petition in 2012. Dave challenged this order before a division bench, before which advocate Nisarg Desai submitted that the inquiry proved all three charges and the earlier orders upholding Dave’s removal from service were justified. After hearing the case, the bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice B N Karia upheld the termination and said, “The punishment ordered by the disciplinary authority is commensurate to the charges levelled against the original petitioner and the contention of the appellant does not hold good in view of the charges proved otherwise..”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bank-clerk-calls-boss-hoodlum-loses-job/articleshow/84873237.cms||---

The mother tigress has also been sighted.Even as Tadoba officers were lucky to trace the Katezari tiger family, the three 22-month-old cubs of Maya (T12) continue to go missing for the last three months. While one male cub is still sighted with the mother and is dependent, why the other three don’t need her support is surprising.Ramgaonkar said, “In Tadoba, several male tigers have been frequenting T12 territory. The tigress was also seen mating with other males. With a high density of tigers in Tadoba, cubs disperse at an early age. We still believe the cubs must be there in the non-tourism zone.” Officials were a harried lot after a 22-month-old sub-adult male tiger T31-C2 was found dead under mysterious circumstances on July 19, in Tamsi beat near Ghosri in Tadoba range. The sub-adult was one of the three siblings of T31.“Though it was not a poaching case as all the body parts of the tiger were intact, we were puzzled as the post-mortem report was inconclusive. Though forensic test reports are awaited, it is quite possible the death may be due to snakebite as Russel’s viper was found creeping near the spot where the tiger was found dead,” said Tadoba officials.The Katezari tigress had three cubs - two male and a female. As all the three siblings must be moving together, officials were worried about the presence of other two.According to TOI sources, the male cub T31-C1 was recorded on camera on July 25 and July 26, while female T31-C3 was also recorded twice on camera traps once on July 19, the day of the incident, and also on July 25. The tigress T31 was also recorded on July 25 along with an adult male T168 was in the same area.Talking to TOI, TATR conservator of forest (CF) & field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar confirmed the presence of the entire family. “Though we are monitoring the tigers, we feel relieved with the presence of the cubs, who were keeping distance with the mother and perhaps maybe at a dispersal stage.”A section of wildlife veterinarians said, “Even if the tiger had died of snakebite, it would be difficult to detect as the carcass was 4-5 days old. Poisoning can also be ruled out as no animal kill was found nearby. In June 2020, two sub-adult cubs were found dead in the Mohurli buffer. It turned out to be a poisoning case as langurs were also found dead nearby,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-officials-heave-a-sigh-of-relief-as-2-katezari-cubs-traced/articleshow/84870948.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Madurai||Madurai: Patrol cops to get body-worn cameras||MADURAI: The Madurai city police will soon issue body worn cameras to armed police teams involved in two-wheeler patrolling so that incidents they come across can be recorded, which can be examined later by higher officials, if required. City police personnel were using such cameras since 2019. City police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha told TOI that 30 cameras from the existing 90 will be diverted to the armed police patrol introduced by him last year to curb rivalry murders among rowdies and to bring down incidents threatening the safety of the people and their properties. Sinha said that the city police has 30 armed patrol teams, each consisting two members. One person would ride the two-wheeler, while the other with a firearm rides pillion. They work on two shifts with 15 teams involved in each shift. “The bike rider will wear the body camera. Cameras which are not being used by the law and order teams would be diverted to armed patrol teams. They will start wearing the camera in a few days from now. They can switch on the camera and record with a touch of the button, whenever they require,” Sinha said. State director general of police (DGP) C Sylendra Babu who had visited Madurai recently, had learnt about the activities of the armed patrol teams and appreciated their efforts. The best performing men were chosen for rewards, Sinha said. At present, city police unit has 90 body worn cameras.

While on one hand the government officials are busy in Gunotsav evaluating the learning outcomes of schools, on the other, the education department is cancelling exams due to shortage of textbooks, said sources close to the development. The department is yet to announce the new date for the examination, as there seems to be lack of clarity on when the textbooks will be made available to students. Unit tests in government-run schools are underway and the shortage of textbooks for social studies subject has put things in disarray, he added. The Gujarat Council of Education Research and Training (GCERT) has recently written a letter to the district education officers about cancellation of exams due to textbook shortage, sources further said. “The education department has claimed that textbooks will be delivered to students at their doorsteps. But the situation is such that they are unable to deliver it even at the school level,” an education expert said. Schools have re-opened for the new academic year for about two months now and the shortage of textbooks is a matter of serious concern as there is no clarity on when these students will get them, he added. This year, new textbooks for social science subject has been introduced for Classes 6-8. “Many schools in the state did not receive textbooks for their students, as a result of which they made representation to the education department. The department had no choice but to cancel the exams,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/textbook-shortage-exams-cancelled/articleshow/84873329.cms||---

On pleas from students, the Overseas Friends of India Canada (OFIC), a trade and culture body in Canada, on Wednesday wrote to PM Justin Trudeau to lift the India travel ban and start direct flights to ease the woes of thousands of students. The letter, signed by Hemant Shah, director of Canada India Trade and Marketing, and Shiv Bhasker, president of OFIC, said India placed third in terms of international students in 2019.  ‘India alone contributes 34.5% of Canada’s total foreign students... We write on behalf of Indian students who look to the Canadian government to undo its unjust decision of not allowing them to pursue their studies,’ read the letter. Shah, who has been on various international trade bodies of Canada and India, said they came across several instances where students had to hop across borders and pay exorbitant sums to reach Canadian shores. “We wanted to put forth the struggles of students and their families who have incurred financial burdens for a better future. Those with valid documents and visas with Covid compliance must be allowed to come to the country,” he said. ‘We urge you on behalf of the Indian diaspora and international students to end this discrimination and uphold what Canada is most known for: Equality for All,’ the letter says. The letter added that the US is allowing students without much trouble. The appeal resonated with many parents in the city who are struggling to send their children to Canada. “The trouble is that the Covaxin vaccine, which was administered to the majority of students during a special drive, is not acceptable in Canada and several other countries. Airfare is another issue we have taken up. Compared to normal airfare, carriers are charging more than double. Adding the cost of quarantine, it runs into more than 20% of the course fees we have paid,” said a city-based parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lift-india-travel-ban-resume-direct-flights-says-letter-to-trudeau/articleshow/84873347.cms||Parth Shastri

According to figures sourced from the health department, the number of women for every 1,000 men in the district was 961 in 2020, but has reduced to 915 this year.The district’s sex ratio was a cause for concern 10 years ago. In 2011, Ghaziabad’s sex ratio was 870, which was lower than the state’s figure of 912. The next year, it reduced further to 818. However, the gap between the number of men and women gradually increased over the years. From 928 in 2018, it increased to 961 in 2020. However, it came down again to 915 this year.Officials said some of the main reasons for the poor sex ratio cited in government reports were the preference for a son, female infanticide, and higher maternal mortality, among others. Continuous efforts, they said, were being made to improve the sex ratio and make people aware.However, despite a complete ban on pre-natal sex determination tests in the district, more than 30 FIRs have been registered for violations in the past three years. As many as 12 cases were lodged since January this year and the maximum number was reported from the Loni area. There are 324 registered ultrasound centres in Ghaziabad.The additional chief medical officer, Dr Sunil Tyagi, the nodal officer for the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994, said that raids were being conducted to find out if ultrasound centres were conducting sex determination tests.Apart from the raids, pregnant women and families are also being counselled by Asha workers.

We have to be alert against such designs,” Akhilesh said addressing party workers at SP headquarters in Lucknow.

SP has lodged an FIR with Lucknow police in connection with the fake account. “It is not only about maligning the image of political adversaries. With the assembly elections fast approaching, BJP is also planning to influence the objectivity and fairness of the electoral process.

She said the men stopped their bike and asked them as to which village they belonged to. As soon as the couple revealed that they were residents of Ilaikadividuthi, the attackers confirmed that they belonged to scheduled caste.

A proposal has been sent to the commissioner of municipal administration’s (CMA) office for clearance. The equipment would be purchased at around Rs 8 crore with one year maintenance. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan told TOI that the civic body had proposed purchasing of an amphibian vehicle to clear the storm water drains. But since most of the drains in the city are narrower, it was decided to purchase the robotic excavator. “It is smaller in size and more suited to deal with the narrow storm water stretches,” he said. The excavator can perform the task of both an excavator and the dredger and is controlled by one person. Since the machine takes care of all functions, it eliminates the need to bring heavy cranes for lifting out silt and dumping it aside. “It can be used to lift heavy things, excavate roads and even cut trees. It is so swift that no arrangements are required before operating it,” a corporation official said. The machine moves on wheels, making it easier to bring it at narrow work sites. The excavator, which is shaped like an octopus, can adjust its legs to position itself in tricky spots. It will be purchased by utilizing the fund under the Swachh Bharat Mission scheme. The CMA office will forward the proposal to the Swachh Bharat Mission to get it cleared, officials said. With the Supreme Court ruling that humans should not be employed for desilting and cleaning toxic drains the machines will be pressed into operation soon, corporation is also planning to purchase jet rodding machines to deal with manhole clogs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corporation-to-procure-robotic-excavator-to-desilt-drains/articleshow/84873308.cms||V Devanathan

Around 5.30am, some people returning from a mosque after prayers heard the cry of a baby from near a garbage dump. They saw the newborn in the garbage. They rushed the baby to a nearby primary health centre (PHC) where the umbilical cord was removed after which the infant was referred to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). The baby, weighing 1.3kg, was admitted to neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU) in the hospital for observation. Sevai ChildLine project coordinator M Ashraf Ali said that since the baby was underweight, the doctors advised medical care. “It is a premature baby. It requires medical attention,” said Ashraf. The Fort police inquired with the local people to trace the parents of the baby. But they had no clue about it. Police were checking footages from CCTV cameras in the area to trace the person(s) who abandoned the baby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/newborn-rescued-from-pile-of-garbage/articleshow/84875713.cms||---

Rajkot will get Rs 1 crore for promoting infrastructure and projects that encourage cycling in the city. Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has decided to use the fund to further promote cycling in the city. India Cycle 4 Change Challenge is an initiative of the union ministry of housing and urban affairs under the Smart Cities Mission. The aim is to inspire urban local bodies to implement cycling friendly initiatives in response to Covid-19. The local bodies participating in this challenge had to implement schemes to promote cycling among citizens and create infrastructure for cyclists on the roads. Rajkot mayor Pradeep Dav said, “We are happy that our efforts have been recognized at the national level. We will use this fund to promoting cycling in the city.” The RMC had conducted a survey of potential cycling routes and facilities needed for cyclists before participating in the challenge. Based on the output, a pilot project was started on the BRTS route where a dedicated lane for cyclists was created. RMC also promoted Cycle2Work on social media. Under this programme, senior RMC officials and employees started coming to the office on a cycle every Friday. The civic body also started a cycle sharing project at the Racecourse under a public-private partnership model besides providing subsidies to cycle buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-awarded-for-promoting-cycling-in-city/articleshow/84871033.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Judge run over by auto in Jharkhand, HC says ‘attack on judiciary’||A Jharkhand additonal district judge, who had been hearing some “sensitive cases”, was killed in an apparent road accident during his morning walk in Dhanbad on Wednesday. The Jharkhand high court on Thursday pulled up the state government over “delay” in filing of the FIR and said this incident and another — the alleged murder of an advocate in the Tamar area of Ranchi recently — were a direct attack on the “justice dispensation system.” ADJ Uttam AnandBar associations of the Supreme Court, the HC and Dhanbad courts demanded a CBI probe into the case. A CCTV footage of Wednesday’s incident shows Uttam Anand had come out of his Judges’ Colony home for a walk at 5am. Minutes later, an auto-rickshaw sped up from behind and ran over him a few metres away from Randhir Verma Square, an upmarket locality in Dhanbad. A passer-by took the injured judge to hospital, where he was declared “brought dead.” Times ViewThe video strongly suggests that the ‘accident’ was no accident. That the act was carried out in daylight underlines the brazenness of those behind it. The police should not only investigate the man behind the wheel, but also find those behind the 'killing', in what seems to be acold, calculated act.Police lodged a case of murder on a written complaint by Kriti Sinha, wife of the deceased judge, and arrested two persons, SSP Dhanbad Sanjiv Kumar said. Following orders of the Jharkhand high court, police formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the incident. The SIT will be headed by ADGP Sanjay Latekar. “We have seized the autorickshaw that hit the judge from behind while he was jogging by the roadside on Wednesday morning. The auto rickshaw was traced to Giridih district and two persons, including the driver Lakhan Verma and his accomplice Rahul Verma, who is said to be sitting on the middle seat of the auto, have been arrested. They are both residents of Dhanbad,” said Kumar. The SSP, however, refused to divulge details of the autopsy report and findings of the investigation so far, saying that scientific investigation of the case by a forensic team was on. When asked whether it was a case of accident or murder, the SSP said they were investigating different angles of the case. “There is an old case of mobile theft against Lakhan Verma and the police are looking for any criminal antecedents of Rahul,” he added. Four days earlier, the judge had reportedly rejected the bail petition of Ravi Thakur, lodged in Dhanbad jail on charges of demanding extortion money and hurling a bomb at the house of one Rajesh Gupta, a close associate of Baghmara MLA Dhullu Mahto. Ravi Thakur is said to be a protégé of UP gangster Aman Singh, who is currently lodged in Hotwar jail Ranchi. Aman is the prime accused in Dhanbad deputy mayor Neeraj Singh murder case. Aman has also been named in more than a dozen cases for trying to extort money from persons trading in coal and land in Dhanbad and threatening them with dire consequences. Besides, Anand was also handling the murder case of one Ranjay Singh, the trial of which was likely to start soon. Ranjay Singh was a close associate of Sanjeev Singh, former Jharia MLA and son of former Dhanbad strongman Suryadeo Singh. Sanjeev is also languishing in jail since 2017 in the murder of Neeraj Singh, who was his cousin. Neeraj Singh’s wife Purnima Singh contested from the Jharia assembly seat on a Congress ticket and defeated Ragini Singh, wife of Sanjeev Singh.

The 7.62 X 39mm portable weapon launched on the carbine platform was entirely manufactured at the ordnance factory here. TriCa weighs 3.17kg (including the magazine) and is lighter compared to the assault rifles. It is a compact automatic weapon designed for the crews of infantry combat vehicles, helicopters, paratroopers, state police force and special operation forces. OFT sources said that TriCa is equipped with a special muzzle booster to hide the flash and mitigate the sound during the firing. The weapon has an effective range of 150 to 175m. TriCa can use ammunition and magazines, as well as the interchangeable parts of general assault rifles (TAR and AK-47). The carbine can be hidden in the jackets of security personnel and even concealed under their clothes, an official said. The weapon was displayed during the defence exhibition held at Bengaluru a few months back. A source in the OFT said that several defence organisations and paramilitary units have expressed interest in the weapon. “Trichy Carbine best suits the CISF, state special police forces and NSG commandos. It will be easy to carry,” the source said. The field trials conducted yielded positive results. The weapon was launched by Sanjay Dwivedi, IOFS, general manager, OFT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ordnance-factory-launches-new-weapon-trichy-carbine/articleshow/84875754.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Patrolling could have averted bus accident||LUCKNOW: An initial probe into the Barabanki accident that snuffed out 18 lives early Wednesday revealed the tragedy could have been averted had the highway patrol detected the snag-ridden bus, which was stranded on the roadside for four hours, before the head-on collision with a speeding truck. Had a highway patrol made arrangements to tow away the bus after it broke down, lives would have been saved, said police. An employee of Ahmedpur toll plaza, 10km off the tragedy spot, has been booked for failing to conduct routine highway patrolling, said superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad. Also, drivers and owners of the ill-fated bus and truck have been named in the FIR for causing death by negligence, negligent driving, causing grievous hurt and under Sections of Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act. Prasad said, assistant regional transport officer, Barabanki, Rahul Srivastava, is the complainant in the case and a joint probe will be launched by police and road transport department. “The Bihar-bound double-decker bus did not have a night reflector on its rear to alert incoming vehicles in the dark. Also, NHAI guidelines on effecting a route diversion immediately after an accident was flouted,” said SP Barabanki. A technical evaluation, including fitness of the bus and the truck will be done by the RTO department, he said. Speed-limit violations by the trucker, overloading of the double-decker bus, laxity of toll plaza staff will be probed threadbare. Police also said the truck owner, Adil Khilji, has been traced to Nagaland and the bus owner, Rajesh, has been tracked down in Siwan. Both drivers, however, are still on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/patrolling-could-have-averted-bus-accident/articleshow/84875760.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||439 pregnant women in city get vaccinated||Ahmedabad: The civic body administered Covid vaccines to 439 pregnant women in the city on Thursday. Following the April-May Covid surge, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had opened a dedicated vaccination centre for pregnant women in each of the seven municipal zones of the city. “During Covid infection, pregnant women are at a higher risk of going into pre-term labour. There have been instances of sepsis affecting the foetus,” said a senior AMC official. Another major reason for the special vaccination centres was the feedback that they had received from pregnant women that they have to stand in long queues Nearly 50% of the people of Gujarat eligible for vaccination against coronavirus have been protected with a first dose of the vaccine as part of the intensive statewide drive till July 29, 2021. In absolute terms, against 4,93,20,903 people older than 18 who are eligible for vaccination, 2,48,56,842 people have been given the first dose. These include 19,66,506 healthcare workers and frontline workers, 1,20,71,902 in the above-45 age group and 1,08,18,434 the 18-44 age group. Another 77,57,619 people have been given the second dose. In terms of people vaccinated per million population, Gujarat tops the list in the country, a government statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/439-pregnant-women-in-city-get-vaccinated/articleshow/84873373.cms||---
---||Trichy||Trichy sees low turnout for vaccine camps; vials are now returned||TRICHY: The patronage for vaccination against Covid-19 in Trichy city is declining and the vaccination centres are making desperate attempts to utilise the doses allotted. Once, the medical staff had to issue tokens for those waiting in queue after the vials were completely exhausted, but now the staff at the vaccination camps are returning around 200 vials of Covishield every day. Tthe declining number of cases and deaths for the past few weeks has resulted in a low turnout for vaccination, health authorities said. After July 24, several unused vials were returned from the vaccination drives organised at 8 to12 locations. At the vaccination camps organised in Trichy city on three different days in the week, at least 500 out of the total 1,500 vials were returned to the civic body. Until the first week of July, the camps were utilising almost all the vials. “People were worried over the surging cases and rushed for vaccination till a month ago. After the relaxations, when the number of cases declined, people started postponing their plan to take the vaccine,” a medical officer with Trichy Corporation said. Until July 28, Trichy district has vaccinated only 7.9 lakh people of the eligible population which comes around 22lakh. While there was a perception that a majority of the people have already taken at least one dose, authorities disapprove of the theory. The desperation of health officers to prevent the wastage of vials was such that frantic calls were made to attract people through influencers and social media pages to utilise the opened vials. The public opined that poor selection of venues for vaccination was also a reason for the low turnout. For instance, the Thennur Corporation School near the TNEB office was among the camps that returned most vials back to the nodal centre. “We are roping in associations to target sector-wise population such as hairdressers and autorickshaw drivers. Locations of the camps will be streamlined and awareness is continuing,” the official said. The civic body also said that a section of the population is waiting for Covaxin as there was a public perception it has minimal side-effects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-sees-low-turnout-for-vax-camps-vials-are-now-returned/articleshow/84875726.cms||Deepak Karthik

The civic body said that they had to skip the milling process in certain pockets as the existing roads were already deteriorated. The corporation, in the past few days, completed road relaying and patchworks in Palakkarai under Ariyamangalam zone covering wards 23, 24 and 26 under the special road project scheme. Eda street, Kajapettai road, Anna statue and Kallukara street were laid with new bituminous layer, increasing the height of the roads by a few centimetres. As the height of roads has been increasing in the last few years, residents expressed fear over the possibilities of rainwater inundating households that are below the road level. “There is no way that the civic body had milled the existing road before laying the new one. The construction work was completed on a very short notice, the orders of chief secretary to mill the old roads were disobeyed,” I Augustine, a resident of Annai Nagar said. Residents said that many of them were not even aware of the road laying work while it was progressing. “Few stretches were completely worn out, we were unable to mill such parts. Out of the 800m newly laid, 50% of the length was milled,” a senior corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/roads-in-palakkarai-not-milled-before-relaying/articleshow/84875753.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: DMK wrests panchayat from AIADMK||MADURAI: The DMK has taken control of Sivaganga panchayat union after chairperson Manjula Balachander of AIADMK and three other councillors switched loyalties to the party. This has taken the strength of DMK from eight to 12 in the 18-member union council while the AIADMK-led front’s tally has gone down from 10 to six now. The AIADMK which had eight councillors on its own had bagged the union with the help of a BJP and a DMDK councillor, adding up to 10. Manjula Balachander was elected chairperson and Kesavan, also of AIADMK, the vice-chairman of the panchayat union. On the other hand, DMK had seven councillors, including one member from the Congress. A few days ago, it got a shot in the arm when AMMK councillor Padmavathy extended support to it and joined the party, taking its strength to eight. Sources said Manjula met minister for rural development and panchayat unions K R Periyakaruppanm along with AIADMK councillors Velmurugan and Lakshmi Saravanan and DMDK’s Ramesh on Tuesday and and joined the DMK. There has been speculation that some AIADMK councillors were in parleys with DMK leaders. This is said to be the reason behind Manjula Balachander deciding to switch her loyalty so as to protect her position as chairperson of the panchayat union. Meanwhile, the development has disappointed some DMK councillors who had planned to lure some AIADMK councillors to their side and bag the chairman and vice-chairman posts. By acting fast, Manjula has secured her position for now. Sources said that talks were now on for someone from DMK to get the vice-chairman post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dmk-wrests-panchayat-from-aiadmk/articleshow/84873354.cms||---

The statistics issued by the district health authorities indicate that the number of active cases in Nashik Rural has reduced from 710 on July 22 to 419 on Wednesday, registering a drop of over 40%. Similarly, the active cases in Nashik city have reduced from 651 to 593 during the same period registering a drop of 9% The number of active cases in the district has reduced from 1,361 to 1,012 (26%). The health officials from Nashik Zilla Parishad attributed the drop in the cases to increasing surveillance among the people and carrying out RT-PCR tests of people with Covid symptoms, high and low-risk contacts of patients. “We are testing more than 5,000 samples per day. The rigorous testing carried out by the health authorities during the past one month has resulted in the rise in the cases first and now the decline by a huge number,” said Dr Kailas Bhoye, the taluka health officer of Nashik. “We were certain that once the hidden and asymptomatic cases among the high-risk category were detected and treated, the number would fall.” Boye said. He, however, said that this would not mean that Covid infection is going to go away soon. “The rise in the infection has nothing to do with the hospitals, but with the people who strictly abide by the Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. “Whenever restrictions were imposed the cases have dropped and then surged again during the relaxation. The cycle needs to change,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-rural-reports-greater-drop-in-active-cases-than-city/articleshow/84868541.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||Wait not over for these 65k kids from 1,060 new schools||New Delhi: A little more than 65,000 students of 1,060 CBSE schools didn’t get their Class XII results on Friday. For these 65,184 students, it’s “results later”, possibly by August 5, stated Central Board of Secondary Education. The new assessment policy, decided after the final examinations were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, has a component called “reference year”, which was meant for avoiding inflation of marks by considering previous results of an institute. These schools, newly set up, don’t have a “reference year”. Under the new assessment policy, the historical performance of the schools was considered. Out of their last three years’ performance, the schools had to select the best one as the reference year and use subject-wise averages of the year for moderating classes XI and XII marks. The subject-wise marks this year had to be within the range of +/-5 in the reference year, while the overall marks could not exceed more than two of the reference year. These 1,060 schools will be given the option of choosing from their category — Kendriya Vidyalayas, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, or government/private schools — district, state or national averages of the last three years as their reference point. The CBSE controller of examination, Sanyam Bhardwaj, said, “The results of about 1,060 new schools are still under process as there was no reference year. Hence, looking into the interest of candidates, their results will be declared within a week. Accordingly, these results and that of a few other schools show as ‘results later’.” Bhardwaj has asked these schools to inform the students that the results will be declared soon as they are “addressing the interest of students”. The board has also notified that if any student has a problem over the computation of marks, it will set up a committee to investigate it. The detailed guidelines on the application process will be released soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wait-not-over-for-these-65k-kids-from-1060-new-schools/articleshow/84909080.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

No one was injured, as the crane collapsed on to the railway tracks. While there were reports of workers being injured, the authorities denied it. On Thursday afternoon, the crane was lifting the bars and taking on to the elevated corridor. Due to the rain making the ground soft, the crane collapsed. A passerby said had the crane collapsed on the road passing near by the railway track, many people would have been injured or killed. A resident of an apartment building nearby, who asked not to be named, said that this was not the first such incident in the area. A concrete slab used for the elevated corridor had fallen earlier. Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation officials said the incident was caused by the rain and no damage to the metro pillars railway tracks was reported. Officials said that within 10 minutes, the work had resumed. Officials said construction of the metro station on the Vasna to Motera North-South corridor was going on when the incident took place. In 2018, a Hydra crane fell over while lifting a 2.5-tonne slab for the north-south corridor on the same stretch where the incident took place on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/crane-engaged-in-metro-work-collapses/articleshow/84873468.cms||---

The chamber stated that it has been a long-pending demand for a regional bench in Chennai as there are only 34 judges in the apex court for India that has a population of 133 crore. Chamber president N Jegatheesan said that since the Supreme Court is located only in Delhi, plaintiffs unsatisfied with judgements rendered by the high courts are finding it difficult to travel all the way to the capital for an appeal. “People naturally have the impression that only the well-to-do can sue in the Supreme Court and get relief,” he said.  “About 69,212 cases are pending in the SC and only about 400 to 600 cases a month seem to be heard for disposal. Based on this figure, it may take at least another 10 years to hear the pending cases in the SC,” Jegatheesan said. This calls for the need for regional benches to be established in Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata and decentralization of power. He pointed out that the Parliamentary standing committee and the law committee have already recommended for setting up SC regional benches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mps-urged-to-demand-sc-bench-in-chennai/articleshow/84873384.cms||---

He said the virus remained active in some states of the country and governments there have implemented restrictive measures to prevent spread of the infection. “In such a situation, the state must follow constant precautions and ensure complete compliance of Covid protocol. Only then will we be able to be safe from the wrath of the third wave,” he added. Gehlot was addressing a review meeting on the status of state Covid infection and vaccination through a video conference from the chief minister's residence. He said the officers of the medical and health department should also ensure that while administering the second dose of Covid vaccine, the same vaccine is given to the beneficiaries. He said the department should issue instructions in this regard and ensure its implementation at all the levels.The chief minister said after the second wave, few children who were infected without showing symptoms (asymptomatic), have gone through post-Covid symptoms. In such cases, there is a need to be more vigilant, he added.Health secretary Siddharth Mahajan said there were only 268 active cases in the state against 3.97 lakh active cases across the country. He said in the last two weeks, the number of deaths due to corona in the state had also declined. He said around 14 per cent of the beneficiaries have received both doses. “A total of 3.13 crore doses have been administered so far, out of which 2.43 crore have been administered as first dose and 69.54 lakh as second dose,” he added. Dr Rajababu Panwar, Dr Sudhir Bhandari, Dr Virendra Singh, Dr ML Gupta and other medical experts said before opening educational institutions, guidelines of the central government, availability of vaccines for children and all preventive measures should be taken in to account.

As NEET 2021 is scheduled on September 12, efforts are being made to help get students enrolled in the free coaching programme. “This number is much higher compared to last year and with the implementation of the 7.5% quota for government school students, we are expecting more number of students to perform well and get seats. We are hence now trying to provide as much motivation as possible for students,” said S Vennila Devi, district co-ordinator for government NEET coaching. The NEET coaching this year was conducted by way of the e-box application and students had access to video lessons and practice tests they could take up online. More than 1,000 students from classes XI and XII had enrolled in the programme. As online course through e-box has ended, to help students prepare better, government school teachers and NEET co-ordinators have been giving daily practice tests to students by sharing question papers to answer through Google forms. Around 50 teachers have been involved in the preparation of study materials, question papers and organizing sessions. “It is also important to continuously encourage students and hence we have been holding motivational sessions online as well. We are getting NEET co-ordinators and experts from other districts as well to give sessions,” said Devi. At the same time, with only online learning being done, students and teachers are hoping for at least a few weeks of regular classes with physical interaction to be allowed before the NEET 2021. Students had also been distracted and anxious about the cancellation of Class XII board exams and announcement of results. “Though we are more used to it by now and is nothing new, online learning still has limitations. It would be nice if we can have sessions in school as well. This time, there will be tough competition as everyone knows about the implementation of 7.5% quota even before the exam,” said SK Guru, a NEET aspirant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/more-neet-applicants-from-govt-schools-this-year-thanks-to-7-5-quota/articleshow/84873405.cms||---

The king was none other than one of the most celebrated characters in Bengali history — Wajid Ali Shah, the Nawab who made biryani affordable by making potato mandatory after a chef's experiment proved a hit. “People often find Shah’s name synonymous with Kolkata biryani for his patronage of adding potato to the savoured dish that till then comprised just rice, meat and spices. But his contribution spanned across a range of subjects, including music, art, culture, leisure and fashion,” said Shahanshah Mirza, the great great grandson of Shah, who is celebrating Shah’s 199th birth anniversary on July 30. According to the family, when Shah landed ashore on May 13, 1856 – shortly after the annexation of Awadh, Metiabruzwas a flat barren land. Shah loved the place by the river that reminded him of river Gomti and the city as a whole as he peopled the area with his followers, family members and loyalists. He built 18 palaces and a zoo and converted it into a mini Lucknow. “Shah was in Kolkata to meet the British Governor General to plead that he was annexed on a false charge of maladministration and that Awadh should be returned to him. Lord Canning welcomed him at Fort William with a 21-gun salute but didn’t respond to his pleas. He had then sent his mother, brother and son to England to place the case before Queen Victoria but amidst the negotiations, the 1857 uprising began and the discussions fell flat. The English fearing the rebels could rally around Shah and start a mutiny in Kolkata, deposed him under nazarbandh (house arrest) inside Fort William where he spent 26 months,” said Mirza, a senior GST official. Upon release, he had started staying at a bunglow belonging to Maharaja of Burdwan at Metiabruz on high rent before he started building own homes. He was entitled to a 12 lakhs yearly pension by the British administration. “Shah promoted Urdu in Kolkata with thousands of citizens of Awadh flocking to Metiabruz. He also patronised writers and poets and events like mushairas (poetic symposiums), ghazals and qawalis and classical dance forms like Kathak and Thumri,” said Mirza. In a short time, Metiabruz had morphed into a shahi mohalla replete with the trappings of royalty and pastimes like flying kites and kabutarbaazi. But the one thing people remember Shah the most for is the delectable cuisine of biryani. “Shah had given full freedom to his chefs for experimentation. During one such experiment, a chef added potato to biryani and the nawab loved it so much that the tuber became a mandatory addition and thus the Kolkata biryani was born,” Mirza quipped. He felt adding egg is an insult to biryani. Shah died on 1887 at the age of 65 and even as multiple families of descendants across the world celebrate the 199th anniversary of the last Nawab of Awadh on Friday, the city that was his last home celebrates the Nawab nearly every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-to-fete-last-nawab-of-awadh-who-built-18-palaces-a-zoo-on-his-199th-birth-anniv/articleshow/84871056.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

After a brief gap of vaccine shortage, private hospitals have received fresh stock but the demand has reportedly been decreasing slowly. Prior to March 1, all private CVCs got free vaccine for inoculating healthcare and frontline workers. But once the drive was opened to the community, they had started purchasing the doses. Since then, all private CVCs together have got a total 28,39,001 doses. “We have already administered 1,11,590 doses till July 28. Of these, 58,189 have been given at our own vaccination centres, rest were given at 100-plus on-site workplace CVCs,” said Woodlands Hospital MD Rupali Basu. The three units of AMRI Hospitals have offered around 1.8 lakh jabs since March 1, of which almost 60% were administered to those above 45. Of the total doses dispensed, more than 90% has been in Kolkata. “But we are seeing a drop in demand from June by about 50%. We have vaccine stock, manpower and infrastructure but the dipping demand is a concern,” said AMRI Hospitals group CEO Rupak Barua. Fortis Hospital, which had to stop the drive for more than a week as the hospital ran out of stock, has administered close to 77,000 doses. “Most of the vaccination has been done in Kolkata. We have received both Covaxin and Covishield recently and have resumed our drive,” said Richa Singh Debgupta, chief of strategy and operations at Fortis Healthcare. RN Tagore Hospital has administered 1,12,458 doses so far. But all hospitals said that there is a massive drop in demand. “The rush is now missing in private CVCs. This could be because most people who can afford to buy the vaccine have got inoculated either with both the doses or at least one,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. As on Wednesday, all private CVCs had a combined of stock of 6,93,315 doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-demand-drops-at-private-jab-centres/articleshow/84871060.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

They held the ministers responsible for the poor perception of the government.Bairwa, MLA from Niwai said, “Those who are non-performers be removed and new people should be given a chance.”They also demanded proper representation to the SC/ST and OBC in the government. They objected to Maken meeting Independent MLAs. Instead they demanded that Maken meet the defeated Congress candidates in these constituencies in the assembly elections. Ved Prakash Solanki, another MLA from the Pilot camp also raised the same demand the other day.Parbatsar MLA Ram Niwas Gawariya said those who shed blood and sweat to form the government were not get participation in power the deadlock will increase in the coming days.Throughout the day, Maken had one to one discussion with 52 MLAs of 20 districts followed by a Congress legislature party meeting at the chief ministers residence and dinner. "Maken interacted with 66 MLAs Wednesday and will hold meeting with 52 MLAs today," said Congress deputy chief whip Mahendra Choudhary to the reporters outside the Rajasthan Assembly.Meanwhile, health minister Ragu Sharma against whom some MLAs complained said “some people had launched a propaganda against him which will not succeed.” He denied any substance in the allegations against the ministers. “What is seen is not there and what is there is not seen,” the minister said while rejecting the reports.“It was printed that complaints were made against Shanti Dhariwal, Govind Singh Dotasra and Raghu Sharma. There is no substance in these things. Congratulations to those who want to be happy after seeing the headlines of newspapers,” Sharma told reporters. Water supply minister B D Kalla, who came under the target of MLAs, said to media that “I do not want to give any answer to the charges. Ask the MLAs who have complained. No one in my family has any contract. Everybody knows what I do, what I don't.”Party chief whip Mahesh Joshi said the brain storming with MLAs should not be linked to cabinet reshuffle but a natural process in the Congress party. Joshi, said, "It is a tradition to take feedback from party leaders and MLAs. Sometimes it is held formally and sometimes informally. Whatever someone has in his mind, he has right to put his thoughts before party high command.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mlas-seek-sacking-of-non-performing-ministers/articleshow/84873406.cms||---

Thirty-two-year-old Islamuddin Sheikh had applied for bail in the sessions court stating that he hasn’t committed any offence and the marriage was done as the man and woman were in a relationship. The 25-year-old complainant had filed an FIR at Gotri police station last month accusing her husband of duping her into the marriage and then forcing her to convert. “The complainant was converted and then the marriage was solemnized against her will by Sheikh who is a maulvi. I argued in the court that under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, anyone wanting to convert his or her religion has to take permission from the district collector,” said advocate Anil Desai, public prosecutor appearing for the complainant. “The maulvi hadn’t taken any such permission to convert the complainant. The court took note of the seriousness of the offence and rejected Sheikh’s bail,” Desai said. On July 5, the court had rejected the bail application of the complainant’s 21-year-old husband who is the prime accused in the case. The woman had on June 17 filed a complaint at Gotri police station against her husband, who called himself Sam Martin, on social media. It was the first FIR in the state under the new ‘love jihad’ law. She had alleged in the complaint that he befriended her in February 2019 and then expressed his wish to marry her. The complainant also alleged that he forced himself on her and later they got married in February this year. The lady accused her husband of converting her forcefully and not allowing her to practice her religion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cleric-named-in-new-love-jihad-law-denied-bail/articleshow/84870573.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi University scholar finds Old Stone Age imprints in Aravali hills||NEW DELHI: New evidence of a settlement dated to the Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age has been discovered in the Aravali hills by a doctoral scholar from Delhi University. Shalaish Baisla has found stone tools such as blades and petroglyphs and stone carvings ranging from the lower to the upper Paleolithic Age. Baisla, when pursuing his degree in archaeology from Delhi Institute of Heritage Research and Management, conducted an ethno-archaeological study on the Gurjar tribe of Delhi and chanced upon the villages of Kot and Mangar in Faridabad, close to the Delhi border, where he made some interesting discoveries. “I found the first stone hand-ax there and while I was aware of Paleolithic sites nearby, I hadn’t known of Kot village as being one. The stone tools we found are in comparatively corroded condition because of continuous erosion by the seasonal river water,” the PhD scholar said. In Mangar village, Baisla’s investigations unearthed, for the first time, rock shelters from the Middle Paleolithic period, or 3,00,00-5,00,00 years ago, the dating based on tools found there. Baisla said, “We found many petroglyphs in Kot village consisting of cupules, graffiti marks and uncommon hand and footprints of humans, animals, bird and fish engraved into horizontal quartzite slabs.” He said similar prehistoric art existed at Bhimbetka and Dharaki-Chattan in Madhya Pradesh. The tools discovered include hand axes, pebble tools, borers, blades and other implements. “There has to be more research in this area soon and the location needs to be protected too,” said the resident of Kotla Mubarakpur. According to Professor Manoj Kumar Singh of DU’s anthropology department, “Baisla’s discoveries are remarkable examples of Indian prehistory.” He explained that when the human species left Africa during the Pleistocene epoch, one group migrated to the east via Iran and entered India from the north-western area of the subcontinent. “They must have landed in the Aravali region and cultural evidence now suggests they stayed there for a long time before migrating to the southern peninsula.” The professor also claimed that the findings of flakes and core tools were proof being made available for the first time of “Mode I industry”, or the earliest stone implements made by the genus Homo. “We need more extensive exploration and excavation throughout the Aravali hills,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-scholar-finds-old-stone-age-imprints-in-aravali-hills/articleshow/84873504.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

In a written reply to detective department, the manufacturer of Covishield stated that none of the specimens sent to them by police (those seized from Deb’s Kasba office) matched their own batch numbers. The manufacturer has also stated that none of the seized vials were manufactured in their units. “They have confirmed that the vials are fake. We had written to them about the content inside them. This will bolster the cases against Deb,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The cops though said that this was not enough to ascertain the “actual” medicine contained in the vial, which is widely believed to be Amikacin. “We have sent samples to the drug control office for chemical examination.

Alerted by locals, cops and fire officials swung into action with no clear information on number people stuck in the car. It took 8 hours of rescue operation to finally bring out the submerged car with only the former SI’s body trapped inside. District police said that the car driven by ex-SI Pappaiah Naik was speeding on the stretch between Kothapalli and Husnabad when it veered off the road and fell into the huge open well. A video captured by locals showed the car slowly sinking. By the time police reached the spot and some locals jumped into the water, the car was invisible.  Later, officials of fire and revenue department came in and a crane was also brought to the spot. By then a huge crowd had gathered around the well. Swimmers finally found the car but by then officials feared people inside would have long been dead. Rescuers tied the car with a rope and pulled it out with great difficulty after more than 8 hours with the lone body inside. Till the car was brought out no one knew exactly how many were stuck in it. A few passersby had earlier claimed to cops that there were three people in the car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ex-si-dies-as-car-falls-into-well/articleshow/84875838.cms||---
---||Lucknow||As polls near, opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh clamour for share in Hindutva pie||Case 1: BSP national general secretary SC Mishra offers prayers at makeshift Ram Temple in Ayodhya and other temples of prominence before addressing a Prabudh Varg Goshthi which culminates with the chants of Jai Shri Ram. Case 2: Five Brahmin leaders of the SP meet party chief Akhilesh Yadav to offer him a statue of Lord Parashuram and promise to install his 108-feet statue. Akhilesh has already promised to construct a grand Lord Vishnu temple once his party comes to power. LUCKNOW: While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continues to follow its Hindutva agenda with party workers being asked to seek blessings from seers on Guru Purnima, the Opposition – primarily the SP and the BSP –has also started treading on the path of ‘soft Hindutva’ in the name of Brahmin outreach. With UP Vidhan Sabha elections hardly eight months away, the Opposition seems to have made a major shift in its approach to counter BJP’s Hindutva agenda, which, according to political experts, has helped the BJP bring together upper caste, non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits to a great extent. Read AlsoBJP's discreet silence on Mayawati's Brahmin outreach a ploy to dent SP?Experts point out how top saffron ranks distanced themselves from unleashing political barbs at the BSP whose possible resurrection could thwart Samajwadi Party's attempts to position itself as the principle opponent of the BJP and firm up a bi-polar electoral contest in the run up to the high stakeWhat has come as a surprise is the paradigm shift in the approach of parties like the Bahujan Samaj Party. In 2007, when the BJP's fortune was on decline in UP, BSP went for social engineering to win over the upper caste to tackle the SP’s winning run. It succeeded by winning a majority with Brahmins shifting towards it. However, with BJP in power both at the Centre and in UP, the BSP now has made a shift in its approach by making efforts to woo not only Brahmins but other Hindus by invoking Lord Ram in the first phase of Prabudh Varg Goshthi, Lord Krishna in Phase II and Lord Vishwanath in the phase III of the meet. What has also come as a surprise is the fact that BSP’s general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, while invoking Lord Ram, has even promised to ensure speedy completion of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Replying to a question on the shift in the party’s approach, Mishra said: “Being a Brahmin, I have been offering prayers in temples since childhood. There has never been any restriction on religious belief in the party either.” Asked if it was BSP’s strategy to counter BJP’s Hindutva plank, Mishra replied in the negative but said the move certainly aimed at exposing BJP’s false agenda. “They don’t have any Hindutva agenda. They whip up sentiments only during elections just to divert people’s attention from problems being faced by farmers, labourers, women and common man,” Mishra said. Mishra’s statements as well as the tour programme hint at BSP’s shift towards ‘soft Hindutva’. After the completion of Phase I of Prabudh Varg Goshthi in Sultanpur on Thursday, Mishra would begin the second leg of the meetings from Mathura-Vrindavan, the abode of Lord Krishna. During his speech in Ayodhya, Mishra had announced that the third phase of Prabudh Varg Goshthi would begin from Varanasi, the abode of Lord Vishwanath, and the fourth phase would take off from Chitrakoot Dham. Interestingly, former minister and senior Samajwadi Party leader Rajendra Chaudhary said Hindutva had been on SP’s agenda for a long time.  “It is not that we are treading on this path to counter BJP,” he said, adding that Brahmin outreach and installation of the idol of Lord Parashuram was being done by the members of specific communities and they had complete support of the party. Decoding the shift in Opposition parties, political expert Badri Narayan said: “Mass politics is not possible today in UP or at the national level without joining the Hindutva discourse. Hindutva is the mainstream for political mobilisation right now. Anyone who jumps into the political arena would have to address Hindutva agenda.” “It is becoming a necessity for parties to remain in the Hindutva discourse to make a space for themselves. Be it Dalits or Brahmins, every community is getting influenced by the symbols of Hindutva,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/as-polls-near-oppn-parties-in-up-clamour-for-share-in-hindutva-pie/articleshow/84875832.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Coimbatore||AIADMK MLAs reprimand Coimbatore collector for not rising from chair to receive petition||COIMBATORE: AIADMK MLAs from Coimbatore created a stir at the collectorate on Thursday evening as they demanded the district collector to rise from his chair to receive the petition they submitted. They reprimanded collector G S Sameeran when he sought to receive the petition from former minister S P Velumani while remaining seated on the chair in his chamber. The collector then rose from his seat and received the petition, but the incident has caused consternation in bureaucratic circles as AIADMK MLAs spoke to the collector in a ‘disrespectful and intimidatory tone’ in the video. The MLAs led by Velumani and former deputy speaker of Tamil Nadu assembly Pollachi V Jayaraman had visited the collectorate to submit the petition seeking more Covid vaccines for Coimbatore. They also demanded the AIADMK MLAs be invited to all government functions, dropping the move to scrap some of the projects brought by AIADMK and give due importance to Coimbatore. When Sameeran sat on his chair and received the petition from S P Velumani, the MLAs started admonishing him. “This is very bad,’’ Pollachi V Jayaraman told the collector. “Is this the way you will receive the petition?’’ one of the members of the delegation was heard saying. Mettupalayam MLA A K Selvaraj adopted a harsher tone. “What kind of a practice is this?’’ he asked even as Velumani rose his hands to silence the MLAs. Sameeran got and up received the petition after which the MLAs left. Later when reporters asked Velumani about the harsh tone in which MLAs spoke to the collector, he refused to answer. Collector Sameeran too declined to comment. A senior bureaucrat said that there was no need for the collector to stand up and receive the petition. “For courtesy sake, he can raise up and receive the petition. But it is the collector’s discretion,’’ he said.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/aiadmk-mlas-reprimand-collector-for-not-rising-from-chair-to-receive-petition/articleshow/84873499.cms||---

She has been behind bars since then and has not come out on temporary bail or furlough for a single day.Miyana’s continuous incarceration was a cause of concern for the HC, which is hearing her appeal against conviction and her plea for bail. The court was informed that she was once ordered to be released for 90 days but she could not go out because nobody took interest in providing surety for her. The court asked the jail authority and concerned police authority to inquired with her family members whether anybody would come forward for her release and stand as surety. The court also said that it would explore other possibility for her release, if none is ready. During a hearing on Wednesday, the court opined that Miyana may be released on self-bond. But the jail authority informed the court that the psychologist has said that her mental health is not proper. The court was informed that once the woman’s relatives visited her, but since her children are not in favour of maintaining relations with her, the relatives also backed out. Her children have not yet been able to accept the situation.The bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice R M Sareen said that noticing the convict’s mental condition, it would not be safe for the court to release her on self-bond. “The cooperation of the family of the applicant would be necessary. Let this be attempted,” the judges said and posted further hearing on August 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-seeks-familys-aid-to-release-mentally-ill-woman/articleshow/84873505.cms||---

While many have not been able to take even their first dose, the worry is also for those who will soon be eligible for their second dose. Times ViewMany households have taken upon themselves the responsibility of getting their support staff jabbed with the vaccine. But the dilemma of choosing between doing without support staff and accepting the higher risk of infection from unvaccinated persons is one problem that many of us have faced. It is imperative for the supply of vaccines to improve to a consistent level so that jab centres can plan a few days ahead and citizens know what to expect.New Town Forum and News, an umbrella body of residents’ association in New Town, has drawn up a list of people need to be vaccinated and has submitted it to the New Town Kolkata Development Authority, the agency responsible for the civic upkeep of the township. Several families have also instructed their domestic helps to try and get vaccinated in their neighbourhoods if possible because of the crisis in the township. Many families that have elderly people or those with co-morbidities are even sending their helps and drivers on leave till they can arrange for their vaccination. “Our help at home is yet to get even his first dose of vaccination. During the vaccination camps in the township, he was at his native place in the district. Now the camps are not happening and we are not getting slots in any of the private hospitals that have long waiting lists. My in-laws are old and ailing and I am worried for them,” said Ruchi Saraf, a homemaker in Action Area 1 of New Town. At the peak of the second wave, many residents welfare associations had barred house helps, drivers, gardeners and other support staff from entering the gated communities for the fear of spreading the virus. “The maid at my house has not received her first dose of vaccine because no camp has been organised in her village in Bantala. I have two kids and I am worried about them as health workers have been saying that the third wave might impact the children badly. We are trying to get her vaccinated but if it doesn’t happen in a few days, I might send her on leave till I can arrange for her vaccination,” said a businessman in New Town who did not wish to be named. New Town Forum and News has drawn up a list of at least 6,000 who need their first dose, including helps and other support staff. “This will take care of the first dose but we will also have to start preparing for those who will be eligible for their second dose. We will need a higher number of vaccines for that,” said Samaresh Das of the forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-homes-fret-over-jab-for-support-staff/articleshow/84871130.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid numbers on a roller-coaster ride. Be on your guard, say experts||KOLKATA: Fresh Covid cases in Kolkata have been on a roller-coaster ride this week. While it saw a sharp jump to 81 from 54 between Tuesday and Wednesday, triggering fears of a surge following a period of restricted transmission since late-June during which positivity rate had dropped to just 1% in the state, on Thursday, it slid to 64. While Kolkata had no Covid death on Tuesday and Wednesday, three casualties were recorded on Thursday. In Bengal, the number of daily new cases has been climbing up and down since the beginning of July. It had climbed up to 899 on July 17 but dropped to 801 a day later. On July 24, it had plunged to 730 and further to 657 on July 26. On Wednesday, fresh cases in the state surged to 815 with 14 deaths. New cases slid to 766 on Thursday. Some private hospitals said they had seen more Covid patients trickling in this week than the previous three-four weeks. “Number of new admissions had slid to zero in mid-July but ever since, we have had 1-2 patients seeking admission every day. Now, we have 17 patients, including 10 in critical care,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. AMRI Hospitals have 22 patients admitted in its three units. Experts, however, were not yet alarmed by the occasional rise in Covid numbers in Kolkata but warned that ignoring Covid norms could turn this into a trend and usher in a third wave. “We are yet to see a consistent and a very sharp rise in numbers. There could be occasional spurts but they will slide down. We have seen zero death since Tuesday which is an indication that the vaccine has worked. It is more significant than an occasional rise in fresh cases,” said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research professor Diptendra Sarkar. Most labs across the city running RT-PCR tests have seen a slight rise in positivity rate. According to private labs, the positivity rate, which was hovering around the 2% mark even 10 days ago, is now swinging between 4% and 6%. The positivity rate in Bengal stood at 0.1% on Thursday. “We are seeing a gradual rise in the positivity rate, which is about 5% in our lab. This, however, has not led to an increase in hospital admission yet. But if this rate goes up further there could be more hospital admissions,” said Narayana Health regional director (East) R Venkatesh. “Reasons could be the lax attitude and opening up of more travel avenues. While the rise in the positivity rate is not that alarming yet, we are finding the viral load very high in some patients, which is a matter of concern. People should resort to all Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. At Peerless, though, there hasn’t been a significant change in positivity rate. In May, it had shot up to more than 40% but has now dropped to 3%-4%. “Number of tests, too, has dropped from 300 a day during the second wave peak to 150 now,” said Chaudhuri. He added that most of those who tested positive in recent weeks have had a travel history. “Mostly, those travelling through the Gulf to Kolkata have been testing positive. We have sent the samples for further scrutiny,” said Chaudhuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-numbers-on-a-roller-coaster-ride-be-on-your-guard-experts/articleshow/84871102.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

This is the highest number of fresh cases recorded in a day after July 20, when the district recorded 204 cases. While brushing off the possibility of it being the beginning of a third wave, health department officials admitted that there is a sudden increase in cases. They are coming up with a plan to bring the situation under control. The 188 fresh cases recorded is a 14% spike compared to the 164 cases recorded the previous day. July 27 was the first time the district recorded an increase in cases compared to the previous day, after a span of more than 50 days. But the increase was at a negligible five. However, on Thursday, it was a conspicuous increase. “There is definitely an increase in cases,” said deputy director of public health Dr Senthil Kumar. “As a first step to identify the reasons behind the spike, we have identified two to three areas that are seeing a spike and are contributing to the increase in cases. They are mainly fringe areas like Sulur and Karamadai, which have a lot of industries and people movement,” he said. Officials admit that the brief spikes could be a natural progression two weeks after a major portion of the lockdown was lifted. “Since it has been around two weeks since industries opened to full strength, we think the spike could be the normal progress two weeks after increase in people movement,” said the official. The health department has scheduled a meeting with the collector on Friday to submit a report on the increase in cases and discuss methods being implemented to control the spike. “It is not a third wave, but we are not ignoring it. It is just a temporary spike and we have already dispersed staff to the places and are coming up with strategies to control it,” said another official. The day saw 198 people getting discharged, leaving active cases at 1,905. The day also saw three deaths due to the virus, taking the toll to 2,172. The total number of people discharged went up to 2,24,797. With the total number of cases increasing to 2,28,874, the recovery rate stood at 98.2%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/spike-in-fresh-cases-worries-health-officials/articleshow/84873507.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Commuters complain of bumpy rides on roads leading to ‘beautified’ water bodies in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: The Coimbatore Corporation has been focusing on beautifying many tanks and lakes in the city but the roads that lead to these water bodies have been ignored by the state highways department. Sundapalayam Road, which is the access road to Kumaraswamy, Selvampathy and Krishnampathi “beautified” tanks, has become bumpier for the past three months. Commuters say it is not the only main road that is in bad shape — Race Course and Kavundampalayam-Edayarpalayam roads are even worse. Under the Smart City project, the Coimbatore Corporation constructed small parks, walkways and jogging tracks around the three above-mentioned tanks. However, commuters who now cycle or drive over to the tanks to enjoy a pleasant walk or ride, find themselves complaining about the road. “The road was in a good shape two years ago. Now, it has a plethora of potholes. When we cycle, it often becomes too bumpy forcing us to slow down or focus on avoiding them,” C Ganesh, a resident of the road, said. “The corporation or highways department could have re-laid the road in May during the complete lockdown.” “The drive gets jumpy and we even start hearing noises even when we drive at a normal speed of 40 kmph on the road. It is impossible to even raise the speed on the road,” a daily commuter, V Venkatesh, said. Race Course Road, which also saw “rejuvenation” of its walking track, parks and facilities, is in a worse state, residents say. “While they are working on rebuilding the walking and jogging tracks, the road has become worse. One of our main requests was to first remove all old layers of the road and relay it properly,” Anshul V, a resident of the area, said. The 3km-long Kavundampalayam-Edayarpalayam Road, which is now being used by thousands of commuters as a diversion due to the Mettupalayam Road being blocked, is also filled with potholes and badly laid speed breakers, say residents. “The district administration and corporation should have re-laid or at least done a patchwork on the roads marked for diversion,” a resident said. The Coimbatore Corporation says plans are on to relay a 3-km stretch of the circle with bitumen. They say the water supply and UGD works are over, but gas pipeline work is still on. “We will coordinate with gas pipeline and complete the work within three months,” corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/commuters-complain-of-bumpy-rides-on-roads-leading-to-beautified-water-bodies/articleshow/84873534.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Police reshuffle in Coimbatore raises eyebrows||COIMBATORE: The en masse transfer of police personnel in the district after DMK came to power has raised eyebrows. More than 80% of police officers, including 30 of the 40 inspectors, eight assistant commissioners of police (ACPs), six deputy superintendent of police (DSPs), deputy commissioners and even the city police commissioner were shunted out after the new government was formed. The wind of change had started blowing through the district during the election season. Former Coimbatore collector K Rajamani and city police commissioner Sumit Sharan were transferred after DMK leaders petitioned the Election Commission of India (ECI). S Nagarajan and Davidson Devasirvatham replaced them respectively. Later, superintendent of police Ara Arularasu and additional superintendent of police G S Anitha were transferred. S Selvanagarathinam was appointed superintendent of police. Inspector general of police (west zone) K Periaiah was transferred and Dhinakaran was posted west zone IG. Dhinakaran was later replaced by Amalraj. After DMK came to power, Nagarajan and Davidson Devasirvatham were transferred and posted in Chennai. G S Sameeran was appointed Coimbatore collector and Deepak M Damor was appointed city police commissioner. R Sudhakar was appointed west zone IG. “Eight assistant commissioners of the city police, who were working during the AIADMK regime were transferred. Most of them were posted in the south zone. As many as 13 law & order police inspectors were shunted out from the city. But the DMK government left women police inspectors alone. Two inspectors of police in the intelligence section were also transferred to the south zone,” an assistant commissioner said. “Most of them had no affiliation to any political party. They fell victims to the DMK-AIADMK rivalry.” Most of the six DSPs transferred from Coimbatore were posted in the south and central zones. “Twenty-five inspectors of the rural police were replaced by inspectors from other districts. As many as 40 sub-inspectors and 20 special sub-inspectors were transferred within the district,” said the officer. “Some police personnel in Perur sub-division used to pass information to AIADMK leaders. Whenever senior officers tried to shunt them out, AIADMK leaders intervened and took action against the officers. Now, the DMK government has prepared a list of personnel for transfer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/police-reshuffle-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/84873538.cms||A Subburaj

In an affidavit filed in the high court, health secretary Amit Negi said that the state would need 600 paediatric beds, with 240 of them in the ICU and 360 beds in the ward. The number in the affidavit has been arrived at using guidelines of the Central government. According to the guidelines, an upper limit of 10,000 patients was taken (this was the number of cases in Uttarakhand at the peak of the second wave) and it is expected that around 12% of total cases will be children (below the age of 20 years). According to the calculation, 5% of the affected children may need hospitalisation daily. When the average hospitalisation days are factored in, the affidavit said, the government would need 600 paediatric beds when infections peak. The government has said that it has enough infrastructure to deal with these cases. It added that it has one of the highest number of ambulances per capita in the country. The affidavit has said that the government is scaling health infrastructure and building capacity to deal with the third wave and these preparations will be finished by August 15. “The government has to prepare for the worst. In the first wave, we had reached the peak at 1,800 cases per day, it crossed 10,000 in the second wave which was a five-fold increase in cases. Therefore, we don’t know what the third wave would mean. We don’t know the variants which would emerge or their transmissibility,” said professor Hem Chandra Pandey, vice-chancellor of HNB Uttarakhand Medical Education University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/60-kids-would-need-hospitalisation-daily-when-third-wave-peaks-state-tells-hc/articleshow/84868749.cms||Prashant Jha

Police sources said the windows of the car which was used to commit the crime are tinted. This has raised suspicions that the accused may have committed similar offences earlier as well. Police are now investigating the antecedents of the accused. Ponda police had arrested the accused and seized the car used in the crime, on Wednesday. The accused, Usman Adam Sayed, 26, a truck driver and a native of Kerala, called the 19-year-old girl from North Goa to Usgao and raped her along with his colleague Saiju Joy Varghese, 28, also a native of Kerala, in a car. Both the accused were staying at Postwada, Honda in Sattari. Police said the incident occurred in the first week of June, but the survivor could not disclose the crime as the accused had warned her of dire consequences if she revealed the incident. However, the crime came to light after the girl was taken to a medical practitioner for a check-up by her parents. They found that she was pregnant. The survivor, working in a Tiswadi hospital, met Sayed on a social media platform. An offence has been registered at Ponda police station against both the accused under Sections 376 and 506(II) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/usgao-rape-case-accused-in-7-day-police-custody/articleshow/84875944.cms||---

But, it appears that while she sought permission under the pretext of sedition and national interest, in fact she tapped the calls of political opponents,” he said. Through her counsel, Shukla had brought it to the notice of the high court that she was given permission for tapping phones from July 17 to 20, 2020, by Sitaram Kunte, who was the additional chief secretary (home) at the time, in connection with an alleged conspiracy of plum police postings for money. Information was received by the DGP’s office saying some persons were allegedly facilitating transfers of senior police officers using political connections. Shukla has filed a writ petition before the high court challenging the FIR lodged by cybercrime branch in the illegal phone tapping and leaking of sensitive documents. Ever since the MVA government took over in November 2019, Malik has on several occasions taken up the issue of illegal phone tapping during the tenure of Devendra Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-claims-shukla-misled-officials-for-nod-to-spy-on-calls/articleshow/84875948.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Forest-electricity department joust pushes tribals into darkness||HYDERABAD: Tribals of at least three villages in the Nallamala forest in the state are literally groping in the dark due to erratic power supply since the onset of monsoon this year. The villagers claim that even a single spell of rain is turning out to be a nightmare for the tribals living in Vatavarlapally, Sarlapally and Kudichintalapalli villages as the power disruption not only makes it difficult for them to stay safe in the forest and carry out their day-to-day activities but also takes a toll on the functioning of drinking water schemes in some areas. “The villages that we live in are located deep inside the forest and it becomes very difficult for us to move about in the forest in case of emergencies after sunset. This is a very serious problem because in monsoon, there is always an increase in snake bite cases in the forest areas,” Nimmala Surayya, a resident of Kudichintalapalli, said. “Lack of three-phase power supply has also become a stumbling block in the operation of the drinking water borewells in several tribal habitations, provided by the Integrated Tribal Development Agency. These drinking water bores are the only source of clean drinking water for us apart from the natural water source, which is about 7-8 kilometres far,” he said. The situation is despite these three villages were identified under the Giri Vikasam scheme, which envisages three-phase electricity in land belonging to small and marginal tribal populations, last year. “An open electricity line has been sanctioned for the three villages, which means that the officials can now provide three-phase power supply to the beneficiaries and take measures to reduce the number of power cuts in the region,” said Chatru Naik, sarpanch of Vatavarlapalli village. “However, this is being delayed because the forest department is yet to give permission for the power supply line to the villages,” he said. However, when contacted, Nagarkurnool district forest officer G Kista Goud said, “Since the electricity department is the user agency here, they should apply for a permission for this three-phase line. Only then, we can check the environmental impact and see if the permissions can be given.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forest-electricity-dept-joust-pushes-tribals-into-darkness/articleshow/84875909.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Lucknow||Power tariff unchanged for third consecutive year in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: In a big relief to the people of Uttar Pradesh, the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) on Thursday announced keeping the power tariff unchanged for the 2021-22 fiscal. The announcement has come just months ahead of the UP assembly elections and with it, the power tariff has remained unchanged for the third consecutive year. Yogi Adityanath government has increased power tariff just once in the past four years — in 2018-19. The decision was taken by the electricity panel headed by Chairman RP Singh, who along with members K Sharma and VK Srivastava, rejected the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) proposal to increase the regulatory surcharge by 12%. The corporation had pleaded to raise a surcharge of around Rs 50,000 crore which eventually was to be passed on to the electricity consumers. But after the UPERC decision, the tariff remains unchanged for urban domestic, commercial and rural consumers. Urban domestic consumers will continue to pay at the rate of Rs 5.50/unit for the first 150 units, Rs 6/unit for next 151-300 units, Rs 6.50/unit for 301-500 units and Rs 7/unit beyond 500 units. The fixed charge, too, has been kept unchanged at Rs 110/Kw/month. A senior UPERC official termed the order as significant given the rise in the prices of coal, oil and other logistics, including salary bills of the employees. The commission maintained that the maximum demand during the month recorded by the meter will have to be indicated in the monthly bill if the meter reading is done by the licensee (Distribution Company). This will not be the case if the bill is generated on the basis of reading submitted by the consumer. For rural consumers, the UPPCL will levy a charge of Rs 500/Kw in case of unmetered consumers. Metered consumers will be required to pay at the rate of Rs 3,35 to RS 6 per unit for various slabs, besides a fixed charge of Rs 90/Kw/month. This, too, has been kept unchanged, much to the benefit of the rural consumers. In case of life line metered consumers having the electricity load up to 1 Kw, an energy charge of Rs 3 per unit will be levied. This will be apart from the 50/Kw/month of fixed charge. For unmetered and non-lifeline consumers a fixed charge of Rs 500/Kw/month will be levied. The UPERC officials said that the UPPCL sought inclusion of 16.64% of distribution losses but the commission approved only 11.08%. The commission also ordered that the expenditure on smart meters should not be passed on to the consumers. President of UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhogta Parishad, Avdhesh Verma said that the parishad had been fighting a long legal battle to ensure that the corporation did not increase the power tariff. He said that the parishad will file a review petition with the commission seeking reduction in the electricity rates for giving relief to the consumers during this period itself. In May, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had ruled out the possibility of the hike in power tariff. Yogi had maintained that the tariff should remain unchanged as the state’s economy got adversely affected by the devastating second wave of pandemic and subsequent restrictions. Hours after the UPERC announced keeping the power tariff unchanged, the ruling BJP said that it provided 54% more electricity to the villages since the government formation in 2017. A state government spokesperson said that 24-hour uninterrupted supply is being provided to all district headquarters, 20 hours to tehsil and 18 hours to villages. He said that till 2016, a peak demand of 15,000 MW was met. This has now been increased to over 25,000 MW. The demand has also increased substantially with the addition of 1.40 crore new consumers. The spokesperson said that the state government also abolished the regulatory surcharge which has been going on for 20 years. Even after this, the government did not increase the electricity rates for three years. The government is committed to affordable and uninterrupted electricity, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/power-tariff-unchanged-for-third-consecutive-year-in-up/articleshow/84875913.cms||Pankaj Shah

Apart from renovating existing facilities, the district administration is planning to add many new green attractions to the sprawling 77-acre park located on the Rajkot-Jamnagar highway. The forest department and rural development agency have also joined hands for the redevelopment of the park which will have many amenities like entertainment zone, water sports, kid’s zone, golf course and other activities. The planning is being done with an eye on maintaining the biodiversity of the area by planting indigenous trees and native shrubs and flowers. Also, an artificial pond will be developed in which boating and other water sports activities are planned. According to the officials, the plan also includes creation of a dense forest wherein people can enjoy nature trails. Rajkot district collector Arun Mahesh Babu said that project cost is estimated at Rs 6 crore. “We are creating this biological park on a public-private-partnership model in collaboration with the forest department and other agencies. Many activities and attraction points are planned for the visitors. Also, there will be a place where artists can showcase their work,” Babu said. The renovated Ishwariya Park will also ease the burden on the racecourse, currently a favourite hangout for citizens that becomes overcrowded on Sundays and public holidays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/haven-for-winged-visitors-to-be-developed-as-rajkots-lungs/articleshow/84871173.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Vasantha said he had submitted a complaint with the signatures of his family members to the tahsildar alleging six acres of agricultural land has been encroached by land grabbers in the village. “We visited the revenue officials concerned to cancel their (land grabbers) passbook and update our name in the land record of Dharani portal. Our family has been farming on the land for many years,” he said. Speaking to reporters, Vasantha Rao said that because of financial problems, the entire family migrated to Adilabad district and was working as daily wagers. “Due to Covid-19, we returned to our village and were shocked to see that our six acres of land has been encroached upon. The revenue authorities did not respond to our pleas and threw our complaints in the dust bin despite us providing evidence.” When contacted, N Naga Bhavani, Bayyaram tahsildar said revenue official checked the records and verified the facts from the villagers. “We got to know that 40-years ago, Vasantha Rao’s father had sold that land and migrated to Adilabad district. Rao’s father died a few years ago and now he and his family members are appealing to allocate the land to them.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Private hospitals gave only 3.5 lakh vaccine in three months||JAIPUR: Poor Covid vaccination by private hospitals has badly affected the inoculation drive in the state. Centre’s guidelines allows private hospitals a quota of 25% of the vaccines supplied to the state, but they have managed to vaccinate just 2% of the beneficiaries from May 1 to July 29 while 98% has been done by the state government. While the government’s vaccination centres are witnessing long queues of beneficiaries, private hospitals doses have few takers. While the state’s vaccination centres are providing free doses, private hospitals have to buy the vaccines and after giving a paid jab to a beneficiary, the profit margin is not much. For July, the Centre had allocated a quota of around 65 lakh doses for Rajasthan and out of those, the state government was allocated 48,90,170 doses while the rest 16.3 lakh doses were for private hospitals. But the private institutes managed to give around 2.2 lakh doses in July. Till June 30, private hospitals had inoculated 1.3 lakh people, but in July, the total vaccinated doses rose to 3.5 lakh (from May 1 to July 29). Viewing the marginal contribution of private hospitals, the health department is encouraging them to scale up the drive. “Meetings with the private hospital representatives were held, collectors also held meetings asking them to scale up the drive,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). Besides, the Centre increased the quota of vaccine doses for the state government for July after it asked the Centre to provide more doses and several letters were written by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, health minister Raghu Sharma and also by senior government officials. Though the allocation of doses by the Centre for the state government for July was 48,90,170 doses, it received 65,13,830 doses. Officials said that since the quota for private hospitals was not exhausted, it was diverted to other states where vaccination in private hospitals is quite encouraging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-hosps-gave-only-3-5l-vax-in-3-months/articleshow/84873461.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad to sport 150 million square feet office space by 2025?||HYDERABAD: The city’s office space supply could well cross the 150 million square feet (sft)-mark by 2025. At least so it seems from industry reports, which indicate that Hyderabad, already sitting pretty on a supply of 70 million sft, is likely to add another 80-odd million sft to its kitty over the next four to five years. And almost all this stock is planned along the Hi-Tec City-Madhapur-Financial District-Kokapet belt, which defines Hyderabad western corridor. Incidentally, over past 12 months, the city’s vacancy rates more than doubled — jumping from 4 million sft in 2020 (Q2) to 10 million sft in 2021 (Q2). Realty consultants fear such huge supplies in the offing can lead to a demand-supply mismatch — and even impact rentals — if not rolled out mindfully. “On a cautious note, developers need to be wary of down cycles and control the developments judiciously to balance the demand-supply dynamics,” said Veera Babu, managing director, Cushman & Wakefield (Hyderabad), while adding that this robust outlook is rooted in Hyderabad’s ‘stellar performance over the last few years’. The city that had hit 10 million sft in office leasing by 2019 — falling only behind Bengaluru — was expected to have grown to 15 million sft by now, had Covid-19 not thrown it off the tracks. While admitting to a chance of Hyderabad consistently reporting a 15% to 20% vacancy rate, major developers say there is enough activity happening in the city for the office supply to be absorbed. “Also, this supply will come up in a staggered manner. Even if developers have 10 to 15 million sft in the pipeline, they will build only small bits — say 2 to 3 million sft — depending on the demand,” said an official of a major realty firm. Seconding it, Mahesh Khaitan, director of Salarpuria Sattva Group, pointed out how Hyderabad’s demand — backed by proactive government policies — is also expected to see a 5% to 10% year-on-year growth. “Maybe the ride will be rough till Q2 of 2022, but after that, we are certain to see this rise,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-to-sport-150-m-sft-office-space-by-2025/articleshow/84873687.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Patna||More action in illegal sand mining case soon: Minister||PATNA: A day after the suspension of two IPS officers and 15 other officers, mines and geology department minister Janak Ram on Wednesday hinted at another round of crackdown on government officials for their alleged involvement in illegal sand mining, storage and transportation in the state. Aurangabad SP Sudheer Kumar Porika and Bhojpur SP Rakesh Kumar Dubey were removed from their posts on July 14 and suspended on Tuesday for their alleged acts of omission and commission in illegal sand mining and transportation in their respective areas then. The Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police, in an internal inquiry, found their role in illegal sand mining and transportation in Patna, Bhojpur, Saran, Aurangabad, Rohtas and Kaimur districts. When asked, the minister told TOI over phone that more action would be taken soon. “It would be on various levels. District magistrates have been written on various issues, including crackdown on illegal sand mining,” he said. The minister said altogether 46 government officials have been suspended in the case till now. “The EOU report was against 42 officers, but later four mining inspectors were also suspended. All the 46 have been found involved in the illegal sand mining,” he said. Ram said the EOU is carrying out its preliminary inquiry against all these officers to know if they have amassed disproportionate assets or have taken illegal gratification from sand mafias to allow them sand mining illegally. “It will be decided only after the completion of inquiry if there is any material to register an FIR against them or not. Home department would take decision on it,” he said. The minister said that huge quantity of illegally mined sand from Sone river had been seized. When asked, he said the licence of any company found involved in illegal mining has not been suspended or cancelled till now. The minister could not reply immediately how much illegally mined sand has been seized during action of the state government against illegal sand mining. “I will gather the details,” he added. A retired IPS officer, preferring anonymity, said the suspension of so many government officers has been the biggest administrative crackdown on corruption in the state. “However, it’s a vicious circle. This nexus is deep and strong. Contractors, politicians and others in power corridor are involved in illegal mining activities as it generates huge financial profits. Those suspended were mere pawns. This nexus is virtually impossible to break in the existing political system,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/more-action-in-illegal-sand-mining-case-soon-minister/articleshow/84835918.cms||Debashish Karmakar

They said that they will continue to seek alms or funds through various modes until they collect Rs 60 lakh so that the same can be given to the Exhibition Society, which runs KNPW. “For Rs 60 lakh, the society is shutting down the college which has over 60 years of history. To stop this, we see no other option except to beg,” said K Swathi Maniputri, alumni, KNPW, who took part in the protest. She said that at least by seeing girls on the street begging for their college they hoped the government would react and address the issue. They said that the Exhibition Society should continue offering all aided courses at least this academic year so that students will have time to fight and get special aid for the college from the government before the start of the next academic year. The Exhibition Society has already applied for closure of five aided courses — garment technology, hotel management & catering technology, pharmacy, commercial and computer practice, and architectural assistantship. The remaining four courses will be offered in self-financed mode. Alumni and students said they have met various ministers, technical education department commissioner Navin Mittal and other officials, urging them to save KNPW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/knpw-students-beg-to-save-college/articleshow/84873707.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Jinnaram murder: Couple admit role in robbing 3 more women||Hyderabad: A couple, arrested by Dundigal police in the alleged rape and murder case of a 35-year-old labourer, reportedly confessed that they have committed three other robberies, targeting women labourers, on the outskirts of the city. The accused —K Swamy, 30, and his wife Narsamma, 30 — are natives of Peddemul in Vikarabad district. While staying in IDA Bollarum, they used to work as labourers. However, as the income was not sufficient to lead a comfortable life, the duo hatched a plan to rob woman workers, police said. On Sunday, they took the 35-year-old woman worker from Mallampet labour adda to a hillock in Jinnaram on a two-wheeler on the pretext of providing her work. After reaching the hillock, Swamy raped the woman, while Narsamma held her. After the sexual assault, the couple killed the woman by throttling her and also by inserting a stick in her private parts, police added. After the murder, they stole her gold and silver ornaments and fled from the scene. By analysing CCTV footage, the couple was arrested and the body was located, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Balanagar, PV Padmaja said. On interrogation, the couple admitted to have committed three robberies in Jinnaram, Ameenpur and Shankarpally during the past few months targeting women labourers. “Swamy raped women in all the incidents and robbed their valuables. In the Jinnaram incident, the accused tried to kill the victim, but luckily she survived,” ACP, Pet Basheerabad, VVS Ramalinga Raju said. Police recovered stolen jewellery, cash and cell phones from the possession of the accused. Cops would seek custody of the accused to get more details about the crimes they had committed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jinnaram-murder-couple-admit-role-in-robbing-3-more-women/articleshow/84873716.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: 33-year-old loses little finger in accident, doctors re-implant it after 4-hour surgery||NEW DELHI: Doctors at a private hospital in Delhi recently re-implanted the little finger of a 33-year-old man. Ajay Kumar (name changed) was climbing down the stairs at his home when his little finger got entangled in the iron support railing of the staircase and got amputated. Kumar went into shock but regained his courage and called for help. His family rushed him to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital’s (SGRH) emergency. They brought the amputated finger in an ice filled plastic bag within two hours, the doctors said. “The patient was immediately shifted to the operation theatre (OT) for emergency re-implantation surgery. One team took the amputated finger to the OT and identified all important structures i.e. bone, tendon, artery, vein, and nerve. Meanwhile, the patient was investigated and then taken to OT by another team. The finger was successfully re-implanted after a four-hour surgery,” Dr Mahesh Mangal, chairperson of the department of plastic and cosmetic surgery said. He added that the patient remained in hospital for five days post-surgery and then he was discharged in a stable condition. In the last couple of years there has been a spurt of ‘household’ hand injuries, Dr Mangal said. “Before Covid, we used to get about 25 cases in a year. In the last one year, we have attended and treated more than 50 cases of ‘household’ hand injuries. Of these 50 odd patients, 18 were children,” the SGRH doctor added. He said that the majority of children — 85% — came with door trap injury, wherein fingers got caught between the door edges and cupboard drawers, resulting in partial or total amputation of finger tips. In adults, more than 65% were due to injury with mixer juicer, blender, washing machine or bike chain, Dr Mangal said. One can avoid these injuries by taking proper precautions. In case of children, having effective door stoppers, better lock mechanism for doors and drawers are advisable. While adults can avoid these injuries by operating mixer juicer, washing machine, etc. carefully — closing the lid properly and opening it only when the machine stops completely, doctors said. “These “household” hand injuries are so common. If one gets injured, the important thing is to stop the bleeding first by putting pressure on it by a clean cloth and raising the hand above heart level,” Dr Mangal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/33-yr-old-loses-little-finger-in-accident-docs-re-implant-it-after-4-hour-surgery/articleshow/84873715.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

These works of art include 13 objects connected to art dealer Subhash Kapoor through his ‘Art of the Past’ gallery and one, a bronze (child-saint Sambandar) from a Tamil Nadu temple, acquired from art dealer William Wolff, said an official release. The works include six bronze or stone sculptures, a brass processional standard, a painted scroll and six photographs. Tamil Nadu would get back two 12th century Chola-era bronzes – the child-saint Sambandar, stolen from the Sayavaram temple in Sirkali in Tamil Nadu, and the dancing child-saint Sambandar. The other works of art belong to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and UP. The National Gallery has introduced a new provenance assessment framework that considers available evidence about both the legal and ethical aspects of a work of art’s history. If, on the balance of probability, it is considered likely that an item was stolen, illegally excavated, exported in contravention of the law of a foreign country, or unethically acquired, the National Gallery will take steps to repatriate, the Gallery release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/australia-to-return-14-stolen-illegally-exported-works-of-art-to-india/articleshow/84877798.cms||---

---||Delhi||Post-Covid hair loss is temporary, doctors say as complaints pour in||New Delhi: City hospitals are reporting a sharp rise in complaints of hairfall among Covid-recovered patients. Normally, a spokesperson at Delhi’s Apollo hospital said, they would record four to five complaints of hair loss a week. However, hair loss cases “started increasing from mid-May and a consolidated report says we have been seeing double the number of cases since then,” he added. Usually, Covid-19 patients experience hair loss a month after recovering from the disease. In some cases, hair loss is observed during the infection period, too, doctors said. Deficiencies due to change in dietary habits, fever during the infection, stress, anxiety, sudden hormonal changes and persistent post-Covid inflammatory reactions are some of the reasons for the temporary hair loss, they said. Dr Shahin Nooreyezdan, senior consultant, cosmetic and plastic surgery, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, said, “We have seen a two-fold rise in the number of patients complaining of problems related to hair loss. Post-Covid inflammation has been a major contributor. Deficiencies due to a compromised nutritional intake, sudden changes in weight, hormonal disturbances and reduced vitamin D and B12 levels are some of the major reasons for the loss of large volumes of hair loss post-infection.” Dr Kuldeep Singh, senior consultant, cosmetology and plastic surgery, said, “Post-Covid hair loss is temporary in nature and is due to a condition called telogen effluvium. It is a result of the shock the body sustains after suffering from fever and other symptoms during Covid-19.” Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine at Max Saket said Covid-19 associated hair loss typically starts after recovery, usually six-eight weeks after the person tests positive. “While many people think of this as hair loss, it’s actually hair shedding, which is temporary. There’s no evidence yet that the novel coronavirus itself directly causes hair loss. Instead, physical and emotional stress, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal changes and persistent inflammatory state that accompanies a case of Covid-19 can lead to a reversible hair loss condition called telogen effluvium,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/post-covid-hair-loss-is-temporary-doctors-say-as-complaints-pour-in/articleshow/84873746.cms||---

Police preliminary probe pointed to a property dispute being the reason behind the murder. The accused, who left the house after the murder, later surrendered before the police. According to cops, Rayees Fathima (41), who was the widow of Syed Mustafa from Zubeida Manzil in Adam Colony of Tolichowki, was murdered by her brother Arif Ali as he was furious after receiving a legal notice over a property dispute. “Arif, a painter, has four brothers and five sisters. Except Arif, all other siblings along with their family members stay together at Zubeida Manzil in Adam Colony,” Golconda SI Raju said. On Thursday afternoon when he went to his house in Nadeem Colony he was told about the legal notice. “Arif realised that the notice was sent by Fathima over a property dispute. Similar notices were received by other siblings too, but Arif became furious and went straight to Zubeida Manzil,” the SI said. Fathima was alone in the kitchen when Arif reached their home. “The accused pushed Fathima to the floor and slit her throat. Upon hearing her screams, other family members rushed there and tried to stop Arif. He threatened to kill them and left,” Golconda inspector K Chandrasekhar Reddy said. A case was registered against him under IPC Section 302 (murder).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lawyer-killed-by-kin-over-property-row/articleshow/84873728.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Restaurants may stay open till 8pm, but no a/c in large halls||Mumbai: Health minister Rajesh Tope said shop timings will be extended from 4pm to 8pm and dining-in at bars and restaurants allowed for longer hours at 50% capacity. Non-essential shops as well as restaurants may be allowed to stay open till 4pm on Saturday. Sunday restrictions will continue. The guest limit for social and cultural events will also be increased. “It has also been agreed to allow malls, theatres to open at 50% capacity. The state will also be insisting that shop owners ensure their staffers are fully vaccinated. The government will also discourage the use of AC (air-conditioning) where large groups of people have been allowed like wedding halls. It is better for establishments to open their windows and allow for better circulation,” said Tope. However, there is no consensus within government on allowing the general public to use local trains. A decision is likely after a meeting with railway officials. “Checking of passengers will require huge manpower. Concerns were also raised regarding the rise in cases in Kerala and so it was decided to push train travel back for some more weeks,” said Tope. “Several discussions were held before finalising restrictions. We are closely monitoring any surge related to a third wave and preparing for it but economic relief had to be extended to the business community,” said Tope. As per the Covid update, the weekly positivity of the state was 3.8% and weekly growth rate as on June 27 was 0.11%. However, some districts like Satara are at 8% weekly positivity and a growth rate of 0.44%, the highest in the state. “Some of the districts where relaxations will not be given are still a cause of concern for us. If required, restrictions may be further tightened in those districts,” said Tope. Officials quoted Thackeray as saying authorities should ensure that guidelines to be followed by establishments are complied with strictly so that relaxations do not lead to a surge in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-restaurants-may-stay-open-till-8pm-but-no-a/c-in-large-halls/articleshow/84873821.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Third heavy rainfall day, result as expected||NEW DELHI: While the skies were clear during the day, the situation in the capital changed quickly by the afternoon on Thursday. A three-hour spell between 2:30 pm and 5:30 pm brought 72mm of rainfall at Safdarjung, making it the third ‘heavy’ rainfall day of the season. Lodhi Road received 73.4mm of rainfall during the same period as intense showers lashed Delhi, catching commuters off-guard and causing waterlogging in a matter of minutes at several locations. Various arterial roads in the city faced waterlogging and witnessed traffic disruptions. Waterlogging was observed in places like Khyber Pass, Dilli Gate, Ring Road, Yamuna Bazar, between Signature Bridge and Yamuna Vihar, and ITO. Near AIIMS flyover, traffic snarls were observed due to very heavy waterlogging and even ambulances could be seen stuck in the traffic tangle. Several roads in Civil Lines, Hauz Khas, Moti Bagh and Jor Bagh areas were inundated. Evening showers also led to water getting accumulated on roads inside the Delhi assembly complex. In east Delhi, waterlogging complaints were received from New Govindpura, Gandhi Park and Krishna Nagar. Delhi Traffic Police issued an alert late evening regarding obstruction in traffic in the carriageway from Signature Bridge towards Yamuna Vihar due to waterlogging. The public works department has asked Delhiites to report waterlogging cases on its helpline numbers — 011-23490323 and 1800-11-0093. With Thursday’s rain spell, Safdarjung, the base station for Delhi, has now received 463.5mm of rainfall – more than double for what is normal for the month (210.6mm). India Meteorological Department had on Wednesday issued an ‘orange’ alert, forecasting moderate rainfall across the city. While the alert was downgraded in the morning to the ‘yellow’ category, IMD by the afternoon once again issued an orange alert, forecasting ‘heavy rainfall’ in places of Delhi. IMD classifies rainfall as ‘heavy’ if it is above 64.5mm in a 24-hour duration. On Tuesday morning, Safdarjung had recorded 100mm of rainfall, while the first ‘heavy rainfall’ spell of the season for Delhi was on July 19, when Safdarjung received 69.6mm of rainfall. IMD data showed till 8:30 am on Thursday, light to moderate rainfall had been recorded in the last 24 hours across Delhi’s weather stations, including 27mm at Palam, 6mm at Lodhi Road, 32.9mm at Ridge, 5.2mm at Safdarjung and 22.8 at Ayanagar. However, Jafarpur in southwest Delhi had received 133mm of rainfall, which falls in the ‘very heavy rainfall’ category and is the highest rainfall recorded at a station this monsoon season. Thursday’s spell, meanwhile, began after 2:30 pm. Both Safdarjung and Lodhi Road received ‘heavy rainfall’ till 5:30 pm, while moderate rainfall of 49.8 and 34.8mm was captured in the three-hour spell at Ridge and Ayanagar stations, respectively. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said heavy localised activity was observed over Safdarjung and Lodhi Road with rainfall even giving a skip at some locations. “We saw light rainfall, moderate rainfall and no rainfall too,” said Srivastava, adding that “the monsoon trough will be near Delhi for the next few days and more rainfall is expected.” IMD has forecast ‘moderate’ rainfall for the next four days, stating some parts may record heavy rainfall during this spell, while other locations may record drizzle activity. “The spread over Delhi can sometimes be uneven, like on Thursday. While some stations may receive heavy rainfall again, it is safe to say large parts of Delhi are expected to see moderate rainfall activity in the coming days,” said Srivastava. Thursday’s rain spell kept Delhi’s air quality in the lower half of the ‘satisfactory’ category with an overall Air Quality Index of 63.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/third-heavy-rainfall-day-result-as-expected/articleshow/84873845.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

After suspension of Somya Gurjar, Dhabai became the officiating mayor on June 7 and her term will expire on August 6. With the order of LSG, the term is now been extended for another 60 days. As per rules, the term can be extended for the third time for another 60 days in case the board is not able to re-elect the mayor. After this government has to organize elections in which city councilors will elect a new mayor amongst through voting. State government is trying to avoid that election because Dhabai despite being a BJP councilor is working on the orders of Congress government. It has to be seen, whether the state government will call elections after this term ends or extend it further. JMC-Greater mayor Sheel Dhabai has apologised to the Bar association of Jaipur for saying that lawyers would take away all the money from the family of the boy who was electrocuted if they register a case against the corporation. An audio had gone viral on social media on Tuesday in which she was heard making the statement.Dhabai issued a statement saying, “I want to convey that I have nothing, but respect for lawyers. I had no intention to disrespect the profession of lawyers and still if anyone was offended with the statement, I regret it.”The matter came to light when a family member called up the mayor after she gave them Rs 2 lakh cheque for compensation and said that this is not the right way to help them and they will also file an FIR against the corporation officials for neglect.Over this the mayor allegedly said, “I just wanted to help you and have no intention to offend your feelings. There is no point in registering a case. Lawyers will take away your money which is difficult for you to arrange.”This statement didn’t go well with the Bar Council of Rajasthan. The Bar Council demanded an unconditional apology from Dhabai in writing to the entire legal fraternity and also immediate recalling of the statement made about advocates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dhabai-expresses-regret-over-remark-on-lawyers/articleshow/84873803.cms||---

Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol has objected to decision. Mohol, a BJP leader, has demanded that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) should be allowed to draft the development plan for the 23 merged villages, as the PMC is the local planning authority for these areas after the merger. “The best liveable city should be developed as per the development plan of the PMRDA. While doing so, the authorities should give attention and make sure that no illegal constructions take place in this area,” said chief minister Uddav Thackeray at the meeting held in Mumbai. The PMRDA’s development plan has two ring roads, high speed railway and crescent railway, 10 Metro routes, 13 multi-modal hub, four regional centres, 15 citizen centres, 12 logistic centres, five tourism centres, five education centres, two medical research centres and seven accident treatment centres. The DP has also focused on environmental projects, including 8 bio-diversity parks, five regional gardens and 16 public gardens. The plan aims at promoting public housing and planned development by building 59 public housing projects and 26 town planning schemes. The draft has proposed two industrial research and training centres. The total areas under the PMRDA is 6914.26sqkm. It is the largest in Maharashtra and the third largest in the country. The proposed plan is for 1638.21sqkm. The state government has given final stamp for adding 23 villages in the PMC limits. After that the PMRDA was appointed the “special planning authority.” “The PMC has to provide all the facilities in the 23 merged villages. So, instead of setting up two planning authorities, the PMC should get the rights of the DP as per the law,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol. Mohol said that the PMC is firm on its views about drafting the DP. The planning authority looking after the PMRDA’s DP has around 14,000 sqkm areas under its jurisdiction. So, the PMC should be allowed to plan the development of around 185 sqkm in the 23 merged villages, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjp-objects-to-mva-govts-nod-to-pmrdas-draft-dp/articleshow/84873982.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana intelligence chief T Prabhakar Rao embroiled in slugfest ahead of bypoll||HYDERABAD: After attacking chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and IT minister KT Rama Rao, a few important leaders from the opposition parties have now dragged state intelligence chief T Prabhakar Rao into the political slugfest amid the upcoming Huzurabad elections. References to Prabhakar Rao in the political statements from opposition leaders have intensified of late. The newly-appointed Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief, A Revanth Reddy, who previously used to restrict himself to accusing Prabhakar Rao of undue surveillance on opposition leaders, recently upped the ante by warning Prabhakar Rao of consequences if the Congress comes to power. Similarly, senior BJP leaders, including Etela Rajender, who is expected to be the BJP candidate for the upcoming Huzurabad poll, have also been quite vocal against Prabhakar Rao. Reacting to these political attacks, a senior state IPS officer told TOI, “Since the main opposition leaders are unable to take on KCR, they are targeting officials. No sensible leader with experience in running a party or government will resort to giving such statements. Have the Congress or BJP done anything better to the present government, when they were in power in any state? Anyways, the government system will take care of everybody.” In December 2019, when former TPCC chief Uttam Kumar Reddy made allegations against Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar, the Telangana IPS Officers Association immediately issued a statement condemning it but surprisingly, there is no voluntary statement from the association yet.“Making wide allegations against IPS officers is not good for the morale of the force. Any police officer will do his duty within the parameters of law. I request political leaders to desist from making personal comments. On the question of electronic interception, no illegal thing was ever done in the state and there is a well-laid procedure of vetting done at different stages supervised by home secretary and chief secretary before anything is done,” Anjani Kumar, secretary, Telangana IPS Officers Association, told TOI. Prabhakar Rao, generally considered to be soft-spoken, was appointed to look after the work of IGP (Intelligence) in October 2020 when he was on extension as Chief of Operations (Special Intelligence Bureau) after attaining superannuation. Prabhakar Rao, during his service as IPS officer, has cracked several sensational terror and communal cases when he was posted in Nalgonda district. He has also carried out several anti-naxal operations. Even when Prabhakar Rao’s predecessor Naveen Chand was the intelligence chief, it was Prabhakar Rao and a few others including Hyderabad task force deputy commissioner of police Radha Kishan Rao who were openly targeted by Congress leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/intel-chief-embroiled-in-slugfest-ahead-of-bypoll/articleshow/84873759.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Jaipur||JMC plans to rename UD tax as property tax||Jaipur: JMC-Greater is planning to rename ‘urban development tax’ as ‘property tax’. It will soon send a request to the state government for approval. According JMC-Greater officials, urban development (UD) tax has the word ‘development’, which often confuses people. Several PILs have been been filed in Rajasthan high court over the years stating that since the word ‘development’ is used to raise money, the corporations should carry out projects to improve civic amenities within its jurisdiction. Officials, however, claim that the money paid by citizens under UD tax is for owning a property in an urban or corporation area.JMC-Greater deputy commissioner Naveen Bhardhwaj said, “Development tax is collected by the JDA when a plot of land is transferred to residents. The money is used for creating better infrastructure in the area. UD tax is for owning a property or several properties in urban areas. To remove this confusion, we are preparing to send a proposal to change the name to property tax.”Before 2007, UD tax was called house tax. Residents and market associations of the city have often objected to this definition of the corporation. Traders claim that when they pay taxes to the corporation, there’s an expectation of some development projects.Jaipur Vyapaar Mahasangh president Subhash Goyal said, “If we are supposed to pay taxes for having a property in the corporation area, we expect civic amenities to improve in our area. We have the right to ask the corporation where our taxes are being utilised. The name of the tax doesn’t matter.”What’s urban development taxUD tax is paid once a yearBefore 2007, it was called house taxJMC-Greater and JMC-Heritage are already behind their annual target of collecting UD taxCommercial properties up to 100sqm are excludedResidential properties up to 300sqm are excluded||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-plans-to-rename-ud-tax-as-property-tax/articleshow/84873829.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: All-India med seats quota upsets open category students||Mumbai: The Centre’s announcement to set aside OBC and EWS quota in the all-India medical seats has upset open category students in Maharashtra, who termed the decision as “politically fuelled”. Several students asked how the quota at the post-graduate level would be “legal” as all MBBS graduates would go on to earn a monthly stipend of Rs 60,000-75,000. Parents and activists said the government ought to think of alternatives, such as free-ships or scholarships. “Students from the general merit across India will suffer and those from the reserved category will benefit because of this decision,” said former head of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research Dr Praveen Shingare. “In case of students from Maharashtra, they will suffer largely at the post-graduate level where many from the state take the post-graduate exam for admissions to colleges across India. The state ranks third or fourth in cornering the maximum all-India quota seats,” he said. Sudha Shenoy, a representative of medical aspirants’ parents, said, “Reservation has to come with a timeline. Once a student has an MBBS tag attached, she or he does not need multiple levels of reservation.” Shenoy said if seats are added to implement an additional EWS quota, there may be a repeat of the past where seats in non-clinical category may be increased to show a compensatory increase in seats, but the quota would be implemented across the board for all subjects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-india-med-seats-quota-upsets-open-category-students/articleshow/84869138.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Dudhwa becomes UP’s first tiger reserve to get CA|TS tag||Bareilly: Dudhwa became the first tiger reserve in UP to get Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CA|TS) accreditation on Global Tiger Day. The ministry of climate, forests and climate change on Thursday announced that Dudhwa is among the 14 tiger reserves of the country to have received this prestigious global recognition. CA|TS has been agreed upon as an accreditation tool by the global coalition of Tiger Range Countries (TRCs) and has been developed by tiger and protected area experts. Officially launched in 2013, it sets minimum standards for effective management of target species and encourages assessment of these standards in relevant conservation areas. CA|TS is a set of criteria which allows tiger sites to check if their management will lead to successful tiger conservation. Sanjay Pathak, field director, Dudhwa, told TOI, “It is a result of years of hard work of all the staff of the reserve. We stood first for forest patrolling in the country since the lockdown was enforced in 2020. All the international standards of forest conservation along with effective management of species were met. This recognition will help us in carrying forward the hard work in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dudhwa-becomes-ups-first-tiger-reserve-to-get-cats-tag/articleshow/84869085.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Jaipur||Jaipur fort becomes a flashpoint between Hindu outfits & tribal Meena community||JAIPUR: A historical fort in Jaipur has been embroiled in a row after members of a tribal community claimed that RSS-backed Hindu groups were trying to appropriate the tribal culture. The first signs of trouble began when a few idols on the fort were allegedly vandalised and an FIR was filed on June 4. The Transport Nagar police station subsequently detained four minors and arrested one person from a different religious community for the act. A chargesheet in the case has already been submitted, said ACP (Adarsh Nagar) Neel Kamal. A controversy erupted when a huge saffron flag was suddenly hoisted at a temple on the hill fort, days after the alleged vandalisation. The flag was later removed in the presence of Ramkesh Meena, an independent MLA and president of Adivasi Meena Sewa Sangh, on July 21. A video went viral on social media, invoking sharp reactions from several right-wing groups. The two groups later lodged cross FIRs against each other at the Transport Nagar police station, albeit, against unnamed persons. A social media slugfest soon followed with some people clamouring for arrests for those who installed the flag, while others calling for the arrests of those who removed it. The controversy snowballed when a TV news anchor allegedly made derogatory remarks against the Meena community. In a precautionary step, Jaipur police cordoned off the fort area and said the property belonged to the forest department. Amid the ongoing controversy, a city-based advocate Kedar Nath Sharma held a press meet here on Thursday claiming that his ancestors have been taking care of the temple on the fort as priests for the past several generations. “The historical Ambika Bhawani temple is visited by devotees of all sects and communities. There has never been a controversy of such kind before, I appeal both parties to amicably resolve the issue with mutual understanding,” Sharma said, adding that he requested the district administration to allow ‘darshans’ for devotees in the ongoing holy month of Shravan. City police, however, continued to bar entry at the fort and deployed reserve police companies at multiple locations. Police commissioner Anand Shrivastava said that the land belongs to the forest department and entry has currently been restricted. Sources in Jaipur police claimed that entry to the area was prohibited after some people and organisations called on people to congregate on August 1. The Meena community sees the latest controversy as an RSS ‘project’ to appropriate all tribal cultures and weave them into a larger Hindu identity. “The Amagarh fort is a historical heritage of our community. Besides Amba devi, there are other Meena deities like Shiv Parivar and Bhairu ji, all these lok devtas (folk deities) have been revered by us for past several generations,” said MLA Meena. He denied any role in removing the flag from the fort. “When I was informed about a flag hoisted atop the hill. I went there and enquired the forest guards about the incident. Soon, people who had installed the flag arrived, they admitted their mistake and agreed to take it down,” he said, adding that no disrespect was shown to the flag. “Some right-wing groups tried to turn it into a Hindu-Muslim row, which was completely false. Some RSS-backed groups have been trying to meddle with tribal culture, and their places of historical significance,” he said, adding that no one can be allowed to interfere with the community’s “virasat” (heritage). Earlier in the day, BJP MP from Rajya Sabha, Dr Kirori Lal Meena handed over a memorandum to the chief secretary and raised the issue of idols being allegedly desecrated on June 4. The BJP MP demanded that rest of the accused be arrested and police reopen the temple gates so that Meena community priest can continue worshipping there. “Meena community has been a part of the Hindu community and will remain so,” the BJP MP said in a statement. Bharat Sharma, one of the complainants who filed the case against the flag’s removal, claimed that Ramkesh Meena and his supporters tried to sow hatred in the Meena community. “The flag was hoisted by some local youths on the fort on a different location away from the Amba Mata temple. But still, the flag was removed and torn apart. I want to ask where Ramkesh Meena and his supporters were when some youths of a religious community vandalized the idols there,” he said, adding that no one has ever disputed that the fort belongs, and will always belong to the Meena community. Narendra Purohit, national secretary of Vishva Hindu Mahasangh, said, “Anti-social people are unsuccessfully trying to divide the Hindu community by vandalising idols at the fort temple. MLA Meena was misled and he wrongly removed the saffron flag even though Meena community is undivided part of the Hindus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-fort-becomes-a-flashpoint-betweenhindu-outfits-tribal-meena-community/articleshow/84873865.cms||---
