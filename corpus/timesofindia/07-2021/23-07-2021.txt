Chief minister BS Yediuyrappa will visit the shopping hub and other roads on Friday. The Rs 5.4-crore work on the 458m-long road was taken up in December last year by Bengaluru Smart City Limited, but the pandemic and lockdown disrupted the schedule. An official from Bengaluru Smart City Limited said the new design has been executed using cobblestones with radiant colours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/commercial-st-gets-a-new-look/articleshow/84657445.cms||---

Debt-ridden Vodafone Idea (Vi) has sought government approval to raise Rs 15,000 crore to fund its operations in the country. "There is no issue in Vodafone Idea raising Rs 15,000 crore but they need to provide investors' details for the processing of the application. The final approval has to be given by the Cabinet," an official source told PTI. The board of Vi in September 2020 had approved raising up to Rs 25,000 crore but the company could not go ahead with its fund-raising plans. The board approval also included issuance of "unsecured and / or secured, non-convertible debentures" up to an aggregate amount of Rs 15,000 crore, by way of public offering or private placement basis or otherwise, in one or more tranches. The fund-raising will throw a lifeline to cash-strapped VIL, which has suffered massive losses, as it has been losing subscribers and average revenue per user (ARPU), and faces outstanding AGR dues of RS 50,399.63 crore as per government data. Vi managing director and CEO Ravinder Takkar in a statement on June 30 had said, "We are in active discussion with potential investors for fund raising, to achieve our strategic intent." The company in the last quarter of 2020-21 had reported narrowing of its consolidated loss to Rs 7,022.8 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. Total income of Vodafone Idea Vi declined by about 19 per cent to Rs 9,647.8 crore from Rs 11,920.4 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2019-20. The gross debt (excluding lease liabilities) as of March 31, 2021 stood at Rs 1,80,310 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dot-awaiting-investors-detail-from-voda-idea-for-rs-15000-crore-fdi-application/articleshow/84657530.cms||---

The amended pension rules, notified by the personnel ministry in May this year, make it mandatory for retired government servants who have worked in select intelligence or security-related organisations to take prior clearance from the head of the organisation if they wish to make any publication. "Prior to amendment, it was up to the official concerned to decide whether the published material falls in the prescribed prohibited categories or not ,‚Äù minister of state for personnel Jitendra Singh said in a written reply. In case, the official feels that the material he is going to publish does not fall in the prohibited category then he could publish the material without any prior approval of the government, he said. "Later on, in case government comes to a conclusion that the published material comes/falls under the category of prohibited material, a loss to the country would have already happened. To prevent such situations, the current amendment has been made," the minister said. The government was asked to give detailed rationale behind taking such decision (bringing in changes in the pension rules). Singh said the stakeholders were consulted while amending Rule 8 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Amendment Rules, 2021. "The condition of good conduct already exists in the CCS (Pension) Rules," he said, in response to the question "whether the ministry has consulted different stakeholders while bringing in the Central Civil Services (Pension) Amendment Rules, 2020 through which a condition of 'good conduct' has been added in Rule 8 prohibiting the retired officers from writing about their department?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-defends-changes-in-pension-rules-says-it-is-done-to-prevent-loss-to-country/articleshow/84657594.cms||---
---||Business||India's inflation situation 'very alarming'; needs better curation of policy between RBI, finance ministry: Kaushik Basu||NEW DELHI: India's wholesale price-based inflation is at a 30-year high, leading to a "very alarming" situation for the country, former World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu said on Thursday. He, however, doesn't see any risk of hyperinflation, but cautioned that if retail inflation follows wholesale prices, it might lead to "inflationary crisis". Participating in a virtual event organised by the Asia Society, India, Basu said the inflationary situation in India is at a "very risky bend". "There is a big risk of inflation and actually one particular kind of inflation. If you look at wholesale price inflation in India. Right now it is at a 30-year high," he said. Basu added that "generally wholesale price inflation seeps into retail price inflation, so that this is a very alarming situation for India because prices are rising quite rapidly". Basu, who served as a chief economic advisor to the government of India during 2009 to 2012, has written a new book titled 'Policymaker's Journal: From New Delhi to Washington DC'. The eminent economist said the "inflationary situation is at a very risky bend...where you need intertwining of monetary policy and fiscal policy". Stating that India needs a much better curation of policy once again between the Reserve Bank of India and the finance ministry, Basu said, "I feel not enough is happening once again between the Treasury, the finance ministry and the central bank for the inflation." He cautioned that there is a big risk of inflation going to be higher, though not huge. "I don't think there's any risk of hyperinflation or anything like that in India," he opined. "But it can go higher and if the retail prices begin to follow the wholesale prices, it is a major inflationary crisis, already, because the poor people have been hit so badly by the crisis," he observed. The wholesale price-based inflation eased marginally to 12.07 per cent in June as crude oil and food items witnessed some softening in prices, while retail inflation slipped a tad to 6.26 per cent in June although it remained above the comfort level of the Reserve Bank for the second consecutive month in a row. Agreeing with Basu, former chief economic adviser to the government of India Arvind Subramanian, who was also participating in the event, said that he is actually a little bit more worried about inflation than he used to be. "I'm very worried about inflation. First of course, you know, it's possible that we don't know but the global situation itself could turn a little bit more inflationary in the next one or two years," Subramanian said. He further said "the pie (resources) is shrinking in India and conflicts over the pie are rising very sharply". "You see that in agriculture, you see that in the individual state saying no employment for people outside. All these are signs, both that the pie is shrinking," Subramanian noted. According to him, if this pie doesn't grow very rapidly, then these conflicts will exacerbate and one of the key manifestations will be higher inflation. On Goods and Services Tax (GST), Subramanian said that there is a need for simplification of GST rates. "Some of the GST rates have to be increased... GST design has to be countercyclical compensation," he opined. Subramanian also said GST requires lots of cooperation between the Centre and the states. Subramanian, who was appointed CEA on October 16, 2014 for a period of three year and was given an extension in 2017, pointed out that India's economic growth in the last 30 years was driven by exports. "There is no economic model in the world where a country can grow 8-10 per cent without high export," he said adding that in the last few years, "poverty has started rising again". On the issue of globalisation, Basu said it is "going to come back with a vengeance, and the world will see new winners and losers..." "I think globalisation is hitting roadblocks and it will continue to stumble for a couple of years, but I have no doubt in my mind that it is going to come back and come back actually with a vengeance. So countries which make the mistake of nationalism and hyper nationalism and closing down will be the losers in the new world, that is going to come out," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-inflation-situation-very-alarming-needs-better-curation-of-policy-between-rbi-finance-ministry-kaushik-basu/articleshow/84657768.cms||---
---||Business||From coal to cars, Chinese floods tangle supply chains||BEIJING: The floods drenching central China and submerging swathes of a major economic and transport hub are threatening supply chains for goods ranging from cars and electronics to pigs, peanuts and coal. Power had been partly restored and some trains and flights were running on Thursday but analysts said disruption could last for several days, pushing up prices and slowing business across densely populated Henan and neighbouring provinces. Zhengzhou, Henan's capital of 12 million people, 650 km (400 miles) southwest of Beijing, is the junction for the major north-south and east-west high-speed rail lines, with connections to most major Chinese cities from one of Asia's largest stations. Transport of coal, which generates most of China's power, from top mining regions like Inner Mongolia and Shanxi via Zhengzhou to central and eastern China was "severely impacted", the state planner said on Wednesday, just as power plants scramble for fuel to meet peak summer demand. "As Zhengzhou is a top national transportation hub and Henan province is a major producer of grains, raw materials and some manufactured products like iPhones, we believe the rainfall and flooding will have a material impact on business activity and inflation in the short term," Nomura analysts wrote. Foxconn, which makes iPhones for Apple at a plant in Zhengzhou, said there has been no direct impact on its main facility. "We are closely monitoring the situation and will provide any updates as appropriate," it said. However, a person familiar with the matter said production at a small Foxconn facility that mainly makes desktop connectors in the Zhongmu section of Zhengzhou was affected after some equipment was damaged in the flooding. The floods poured into subway lines and washed away thousands of cars, killing at least 33 people, cutting road links and knocking out power and cellphone service to many parts of the region. IDLED plants, impromptu breakfasts On one highway jammed with stranded trucks, residents handed out fried dough sticks to drivers, social media footage showed. "We've all been stuck here all day and night," said one driver, tucking into breakfast. China's largest automaker, SAIC Motor, warned of short-term impact on logistics at its Zhengzhou plant, while Japan's Nissan said production at its factory had been suspended. The rain snarled transport of pigs to slaughterhouses in one of the country's top pork-producing regions, said a hog trader, and Nomura said food prices in Henan, home to almost 100 million people, and neighbouring provinces could edge up in coming weeks. The floods could also have a longer-term impact on farm output as rainwater can spread disease on farms. Heavy rain in the south last year was blamed for a resurgence of African swine fever, which is deadly to hogs. With more than 200,000 hectares of Henan farmland hit by flooding, SDIC Essence Futures analysts warned of the impact to the maturing peanut crop. Henan produces about a quarter of China's peanuts, a major source of cooking oil. But the flooding should also trigger the release of pent-up demand for consumption and investment, said the Nomura analysts, especially for cars and infrastructure. Data from 11 insurers including Ping An Insurance Group showed they had received claims for almost 32,000 damaged cars in Henan by Thursday. China Development Bank said on Wednesday it would issue 1.86 billion yuan in emergency loans to the Zhengzhou Metro Group and other local government companies to reinforce drainage and rebuild foundations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/from-coal-to-cars-chinese-floods-tangle-supply-chains/articleshow/84657892.cms||---

---||World||US senators aim to stop vaccine misinformation by going after tech's legal immunity||WASHINGTON: Two Democratic US senators on Thursday will add to the stack of bills going after Section 230 - a law that protects tech companies from being sued over content posted by users - making such platforms responsible for health-related misinformation. The legislation introduced by Amy Klobuchar and Ben Ray Lujan requires internet platforms such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google to take down health and vaccine-related misinformation during public health emergencies or be held liable for that failure. It also directs the Department of Health & Human Services to issue guidelines on what constitutes health misinformation. "These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation," Klobuchar said. The bill quotes a study from the Center for Countering Digital Hate that found social media platforms failed to act on 95 percent of coronavirus-related disinformation reported to them. The Health Misinformation Act is not the first bill targeting tech's liability shield from Senator Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate antitrust subcommittee. Earlier this year, she co-sponsored another bill called the Safe Tech Act with two fellow Democrats. It aims to make social media companies more accountable for enabling cyber-stalking, targeted harassment and discrimination on their platforms. The chief executives of Google, Twitter and Facebook have said Section 230 is crucial to free expression on the internet. They said it gives them the tools to strike a balance between preserving free speech and moderating content, even as they appeared open to suggestions that law needs moderate changes. Several Republican lawmakers have separately pushed to scrap the law entirely over decisions by tech platforms to moderate content critical of former President Donald Trump and his supporters. There are several other pieces of legislation aimed at changing the law that have been making the rounds for over a year, including a bipartisan bill from Democrat Brian Schatz and Republican John Thune. Trump repeatedly pushed for the legal protection to be stripped away over what he alleged was censorship against conservatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-senators-aim-to-stop-vaccine-misinformation-by-going-after-techs-legal-immunity/articleshow/84656772.cms||---
---||World||US churches reckon with traumatic legacy of Native schools||The discoveries of hundreds of unmarked graves at former residential schools for Indigenous children in Canada have prompted renewed calls for a reckoning over the traumatic legacy of similar schools in the United States - and in particular by the churches that operated many of them.  US Catholic and Protestant denominations operated more than 150 boarding schools between the 19th and 20th centuries. Native American and Alaskan Native children were regularly severed from their tribal families, customs, language, and religion and brought to the schools in a push to assimilate and Christianize them.  Some US churches have been reckoning with this activity for years through ceremonies, apologies, and archival investigations, while others are just getting started. Some advocates say churches have more work to do in opening their archives, educating the public about what was done in the name of their faith, and helping former students and their relatives tell their stories of family trauma.  "We all need to work together on this," said the Rev. Bradley Hauff, a Minnesota-based Episcopal priest, and missioner for Indigenous Ministries with the Episcopal Church.  "What's happening in Canada, that's a wakeup call to us," said Hauff, who is enrolled with the Oglala Sioux Tribe.  This painful history has drawn relatively little attention in the United States compared with Canada, where the recent discoveries of graves underscored what a 2015 government commission called a "cultural genocide."  That's beginning to change.  This month top officials with the US Episcopal Church acknowledged the denomination's own need to reckon with its involvement with such boarding schools.  "We have heard with sorrow stories of how this history has harmed the families of many Indigenous Episcopalians," read a July 12 statement from Presiding Bishop Michael Curry and the Rev. Gay Clark Jennings, president of the denomination's House of Deputies.  "We must come to a full understanding of the legacies of these schools," they added, calling for the denomination's next legislative session in 2022 to earmark funds for independent research into church archives and to educate church members.  Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a US Cabinet secretary, announced last month that her department would investigate "the loss of human life and the lasting consequences of residential Indian boarding schools." That would include seeking to identify the schools and their burial sites.  Soon afterward, she spoke at a long-planned ceremony at the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, where the remains of nine children who died at the school more than a century earlier were returned to Rosebud Sioux tribal representatives for reburial in South Dakota.  US religious groups were affiliated with at least 156 such schools, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, formed in 2012 to raise awareness and address the traumas of the institutions. That's more than 40% of the 367 schools documented so far by the coalition.  Eighty-four were affiliated with the Catholic Church or its religious orders, such as the Jesuits. The other 72 were affiliated with various Protestant groups, including Presbyterians (21), Quakers (15), and Methodists (12). Most have been closed for decades.  Samuel Torres, director of research and programs for the coalition, said church apologies can be a good start but "there is a lot more to be done" on engaging Indigenous community members and educating the public.  Such information is crucial given how little most Americans know about the schools, both in their impact on Indigenous communities and their role "as an armament toward the acquisition of Native lands," he said.  "Without that truth, then there's really very limited possibilities of healing," Torres said.  Hauff noted that the experiences of former students, such as his own parents, ranged widely. Some said that even amid austerity, loneliness and family separation, they received a good education, made friends, learned skills, and freely spoke tribal languages with peers. But others talked of "unspeakable, cruel abuse," including physical and sexual assault, malnourishment, and being punished for speaking Native languages.  "Even if some of the children did say they had a positive experience, it did come at a price," Hauff said. "Our church worked hand in hand with the government to assimilate these children. ... We need to acknowledge it happened."  In Canada, where more than 150,000 Indigenous children attended residential schools over more than a century, a National Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified 3,201 deaths amid poor conditions.  The United Church of Canada, which operated 15 such schools, has apologized for its role, opened its archives, and helped identify burial sites.  The Rev. Richard Bott, the moderator of the United Church, lamented that "we were perpetrators in this" and that the church "put the national goal of assimilation ahead of our responsibility as Christians."  The Catholic Church's response in Canada remains controversial. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in June that he was "deeply disappointed" the Vatican has not offered a formal apology. Pope Francis expressed "sorrow" following the discovery of the graves and has agreed to meet at the Vatican in December with school survivors and other Indigenous leaders.  Canada's Catholic bishops said in a joint statement this month that they are "saddened by the Residential Schools legacy." In Saskatchewan, bishops have launched a fundraising campaign to benefit survivors and other reconciliation efforts.  The US Conference of Catholic Bishops, meanwhile, said it would "look for ways to be of assistance" in the Interior Department's inquiry.  "We cannot even begin to imagine the deep sorrow these discoveries are causing in Native communities across North America," spokeswoman Chieko Noguchi said.  Influential voices such as the Jesuit-affiliated America Magazine are urging US Catholic bishops not to repeat their mishandling of cases of child sex abuse by priests and other religious leaders.  "For decades the people of God were anguished by the obfuscation on the part of those church leaders who allowed only a trickle of incomplete document releases from diocesan and provincial archives while investigators struggled to get to the truth," the magazine said in an editorial. "The church in the United States must demonstrate that it has learned from ... such failures."  Individual efforts are underway, however, such as at the Red Cloud Indian School in South Dakota, which has formed a Truth and Healing Advisory Committee to reckon with the years it was managed by Catholic orders.  Other churches have addressed their legacy to varying degrees.  Early in 2017, leaders of the Presbyterian Church (USA) traveled to Utqiagvik, on Alaska's North Slope, to deliver a sweeping apology before a packed school auditorium for the treatment of Indigenous persons in general, and specifically for how it operated the boarding schools.  The Rev. Gradye Parsons, the former stated clerk for the denomination, told the gathering that the church had been "in contempt of its own proclaimed faith" in suppressing Native spiritual traditions amid its zeal to spread Christianity, and "the church judged when it should have listened."  "It has taken us too long to get to this apology," Parsons said. "Many of your people who deserved the apology the most are gone."  The United Methodist Church held a ceremony of repentance in 2012 for historic injustices against Native peoples, and in 2016 it acknowledged its role in the boarding schools in tandem with a government effort to "intentionally" destroy traditional cultures and belief systems.  Still, the Native American International Caucus of the United Methodist Church recently urged the church to do more "to uncover the truth about our denomination's role and responsibility in this reprehensible history."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-churches-reckon-with-traumatic-legacy-of-native-schools/articleshow/84658948.cms||---
---||World||House votes to evacuate more Afghan allies as US war ends||The House voted overwhelmingly Thursday to allow in thousands more of the Afghans who worked alongside Americans in the Afghanistan war, citing the urgency of protecting those on-the-ground allies from Taliban retaliation as the US military withdrawal enters its final weeks.  Florida Republican and Vietnam war veteran Rep. Neal Dunn evoked the scenes of the US military withdrawal from Vietnam, which left many Vietnamese who'd worked with American forces fearing - and sometimes meeting - death and detention.  "We cannot do this again. We must not do this again. We must bring back ... all the people who were so important to us in combat," Neal said, urging fellow lawmakers to vote for the bill. "Please do not abandon friends of America again."  The bill, by Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat and former Army Ranger who fought in Afghanistan, allows 8,000 more visas for translators and others who worked with US government troops and civilians in Afghanistan. It also eases some requirements for the visas.  Currently, 26,500 of the special Afghan visas are allocated.  The House passed the new measure 407-16, sending it to the Senate. All of the no votes were from Republicans.  President Joe Biden decreed an end to the US military role in Afghanistan by Sept. 11. That will close a U.S. military effort that early on succeeded in its main goal of crushing the Afghanistan-based al-Qaida plotters of the 2001 attacks on the United States, but struggled to quell Afghanistan's former Taliban rulers and stabilize a Kabul-based elected government.  The Pentagon says the U.S. withdrawal is 95% finished and will be completed by Aug. 31.  The last weeks of withdrawal leave the Taliban apparently holding "strategic momentum" in the fight for control of Afghanistan as they claim more rural territory and put increasing pressure on key cities, Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday.  The Biden administration says there are 20,000 applicants so far, half of whom have not completed initial stages of review for the visas. The United States is also allowing former Afghan employees to bring in close family members.  Rep. Tom McClintock, a California Republican, said the bill would add to what he said would be too-hasty screening and processing as the United States rushes to get the Afghans out. He pointed to security risks for the United States.  "We will not be adequately vetting arrivals under this program," McClintock said.  Other lawmakers called it essential to future US military endeavors to prove that Americans would stand by local battleground allies. Some urged the US government to open the door wider still to the Afghans who worked with Americans.  "Don't stop here. Let's keep going," said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat. "These are our friends."  About 70,000 Afghans have settled in the United States on the special visas since 2008, Tracey Jacobson, the director of the administration's Afghanistan task force, told reporters on Wednesday.  Currently, the Biden administration plans to start flying 750 of the Afghans furthest along in the visa processing from Kabul to the United States next week, along with their immediate families, Jacobson said.  Those new arrivals will head to Fort Lee, Virginia, for an expected seven to 10 days to complete their processing, authorities said.  The administration hopes to process 4,000 former employees and their immediate families - people much further behind in the process - at US bases in some other country before bringing them to the United States.  Qatar and Kuwait are among the latest countries being mentioned as possible hosts, but US officials said this week they had no agreements to announce yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/house-votes-to-evacuate-more-afghan-allies-as-us-war-ends/articleshow/84659239.cms||---

The "superbug" outbreaks were reported in a Washington, DC, nursing home and at two Dallas-area hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. A handful of the patients had invasive fungal infections that were impervious to all three major classes of medications.  "This is really the first time we've started seeing clustering of resistance" in which patients seemed to be getting the infections from each other, said the CDC's Dr. Meghan Lyman.  The fungus, Candida auris, is a harmful form of yeast that is considered dangerous to hospital and nursing home patients with serious medical problems. It is most deadly when it enters the bloodstream, heart or brain. Outbreaks in health care facilities have been spurred when the fungus spread through patient contact or on contaminated surfaces.  Health officials have sounded alarms for years about the superbug after seeing infections in which commonly used drugs had little effect. In 2019, doctors diagnosed three cases in New York that were also resistant to a class of drugs, called echinocandins, that were considered a last line of defense.  In those cases, there was no evidence the infections had spread from patient to patient - scientists concluded the resistance to the drugs formed during treatment.  The new cases did spread, the CDC concluded.  In Washington, DC, a cluster of 101 C. auris cases at a nursing home dedicated to very sick patients included three that were resistant to all three kinds of antifungal medications. A cluster of 22 in two Dallas-area hospitals included two with that level of resistance. The facilities weren't identified.  Those cases were seen from January to April. Of the five people who were fully resistant to treatment, three died - both Texas patients and one in Washington.  Lyman said both are ongoing outbreaks and that additional infections have been identified since April. But those added numbers were not reported.  Investigators reviewed medical records and found no evidence of previous antifungal use among the patients in those clusters. Health officials say that means they spread from person to person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/superbug-fungus-spread-in-two-cities-health-officials-say/articleshow/84659417.cms||---

"He's got several phone numbers. This does not mean he has been spied on. It's just additional security," the official told Reuters. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said the president's security protocols were being adapted in light of the incident. A global outcry was triggered when several international media organizations reported that the Pegasus spyware was used in hacking smartphones belonging to journalists, human rights activists and government officials in several countries. In Israel, home of Pegasus developer NSO Group, a senior lawmaker said a parliamentary panel may look into spyware export restrictions. NSO says its software is used to fight crime and terrorism and has denied any wrongdoing. "Obviously we're taking (this) very seriously," Attal told reporters hours after an emergency cabinet meeting focused on the Pegasus allegations. Le Monde newspaper and Radio France broadcaster reported on Tuesday that Macron's phone was on a list of potential targets for surveillance by Morocco. The two media said that they did not have access to Macron's phone and could not verify if his phone had indeed been spied on. Morocco has rejected these allegations. A French lawyer for Morocco, Olivier Baratelli, said the government planned to lodge defamation lawsuits in Paris against nongovernmental organizations Amnesty International and Forbidden Stories, according to French news outlet franceinfo on Thursday. The two groups participated in the Pegasus probe and alleged Morocco had targeted French officials for surveillance with the spyware. Amid mounting EU concern, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin that spyware should be denied to countries where there is no judicial oversight. Hungarian prosecutors on Thursday launched an investigation into multiple complaints received in the wake of the reports. Israel has appointed an inter-ministerial team to assess reports based on an investigation by 17 media organizations that said Pegasus had been used in attempted or successful hacks of smartphones using malware that enables the extraction of messages, records calls and secretly activates microphones. NSO has rejected the reporting by the media partners as "full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories." Reuters has not independently verified the reporting. "We certainly have to look anew at this whole subject of licenses granted by DECA," Ram Ben-Barak, head of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, told Israel's Army Radio, referring to the government-run Defence Export Controls Agency. The Israeli government team "will conduct its checks, and we will be sure to look into the findings and see if we need to fix things here", said Ben-Barak. A former deputy chief of Mossad, he said proper use of Pegasus had "helped a great many people". DECA is within Israel's Defence Ministry and oversees NSO exports. Both the ministry and the firm have said that Pegasus is meant to be used to track only terrorists or criminals, and that all foreign clients are vetted governments. NSO says it does not know the specific identities of people against whom clients use Pegasus. If it receives a complaint of Pegasus having been misused by a client, NSO can retroactively acquire the target lists and, should the complaint prove true, unilaterally shut down that client's software, the company says. Other world leaders among those whose phone numbers the news organizations said were on a list of possible targets include Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Morocco's King Mohammed VI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/frances-macron-changes-phone-in-light-of-pegasus-case/articleshow/84659219.cms||---

Premier Mario Draghi's government approved a decree Thursday ordering the use of the so-called "green" passes starting on August 6. To be eligible for a pass, individuals must prove they have received at least one vaccine dose in the last nine months, recovered from Covid-19 in the last six months, or tested negative in the previous 48 hours.  The passes will be needed to dine at tables inside restaurants or cafes, to attend sports events, town fairs, and conferences, and to enter casinos, bingo parlors, and pools, among other activities. according to officials.  The certification is needed "to keep economic activity open‚Ä≥ and will allow people to enjoy entertainment "with the assurance they won't be next to contagious people," Draghi said.  "The Italian economy is going well. It's reviving, and Italy is growing at a rhythm superior to that of other EU nations,'' the premier told reporters.  Some 40 million people in Italy have already downloaded a "green pass," Health Minister Roberto Speranza said. He noted that the certification is already required to attend wedding receptions and to visit residents of care homes.  More than half of people in Italy older than 12 and thus eligible for Covid-19 vaccines have received two doses, and several million more have received the first dose.  But fueled in part by huge street celebrations after Italy's wins in the recent European soccer championships this month, new daily cases have climbed again. Health experts say the delta variant of the coronavirus is rapidly gaining traction in much of Italy, facilitating transmission.  Still, thanks to vaccination, "pressure on hospitals is strongly diminished,'' Draghi said. While Italy was reporting nearly 400 virus-related deaths a day four months ago, the number has been far lower lately, with fewer than a dozen deaths recorded on some recent days.  "The vaccine campaign permitted the economy to revive,‚Ä≥ Draghi said. "The first thing I have to say is to invite all Italians to get vaccinated and to do it right away."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/italy-to-require-covid-19-pass-for-many-activities/articleshow/84660343.cms||---
---||World||Vaccinations rise in some states with soaring infections||Vaccinations are beginning to rise in some states where Covid-19 cases are soaring, White House officials said Thursday, and hospitals are running out of space because of the delta variant, which is "spreading with incredible efficiency."  Coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters that several states with the highest proportions of new infections have seen residents get vaccinated at higher rates than the nation as a whole. Officials cited Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, and Nevada as examples.  "The fourth surge is real, and the numbers are quite frightening at the moment," Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said on a New Orleans radio show. Edwards, a Democrat, added: "There's no doubt that we are going in the wrong direction, and we're going there in a hurry."  Louisiana reported 2,843 new Covid-19 cases Thursday, a day after reporting 5,388 - the third-highest level since the pandemic began. Hospitalizations are up steeply in the last month, from 242 on June 19 to 913 in the latest report. Fifteen new deaths were reported Thursday.  Just 36% of Louisiana's population is fully vaccinated, state health department data shows. Nationally, 56.3% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Aly Neel, a spokesperson for Louisiana's health department, said the state has seen "a little bump" in vaccinations recently, adding that details would be available Friday. Warner Thomas, president and CEO of Ochsner Health, said the system had seen a 10% to 15% increase in people seeking vaccination over the past week or two.  In Missouri, which is second only to Arkansas and Louisiana in the number of new cases per capita over the past 14 days, officials have rolled out a vaccine incentive program that includes $10,000 prizes for 900 lottery winners. The state lags about 10 percentage points behind the national average for people who have received at least one shot.  Hospitals in the Springfield area are under strain, reaching pandemic high and near pandemic high numbers of patients.  "Younger, relatively healthy and unvaccinated. If this describes you, please consider vaccination," tweeted Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer of Mercy Hospital Springfield, noting that half of the COVID-19 patients are ages 21 to 59 and just 2% of that group is vaccinated.  The surge that began in the southwest part of the state, where some counties have vaccination rates in the teens, has started to spread to the Kansas City area, including at Research Medical Center.  "I don't want to keep putting my life on the line just because people don't want to get vaccinated or listen to what health care professionals are recommending," lamented Pascaline Muhindura, a registered nurse who has worked on the hospital's Covid-19 unit for more than a year.  "A lot of them don't even believe in Covid-19, to begin with. It is incredibly frustrating. You are helping someone that doesn't even believe that the illness that they have is real," Muhindura said.  Dr Jason Wilson, an emergency physician with Tampa General Hospital, also has watched the rise in cases with frustration. Unlike earlier in the pandemic, when many patients were in their 70s, he has seen the median patient age fall to the mid-40s.  "I spent a lot of time this fall and last summer saying, 'We've got to do these things, these social mitigation strategies until we get that vaccine. Just hang in there," Wilson said.  Hospitals initially were hopeful as cases declined. But then, he said, "Things just fell flat."  In conservative Utah, hospitals also are filling up again as the virus surges among the unvaccinated. On Wednesday, the state recorded its highest number of people hospitalized due to Covid-19 in five months.  State health officials renewed their pleas for residents to get vaccinated as Utah intensive care units reached 81.5% capacity. There are 295 people who are hospitalized due to the virus in the state, the highest since February.  "This delta at the moment it is honing in on largely unvaccinated persons," said Dr William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases in the health policy department at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.  The variant, which originated in India, now accounts for an estimated 83% of coronavirus samples genetically identified in the US It is the predominant strain in every region of the country and continues "spreading with incredible efficiency," the director of the CDC, Dr Rochelle Walensky, told reporters at the White House.  She said the mutation is more aggressive and much more transmissible, calling it "one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of."  "We are yet at another pivotal moment in this pandemic," she warned. "We need to come together as one nation."  The CDC has not changed its guidance that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks. But in Georgia, Atlanta Public Schools announced Thursday that it will implement a "universal mask-wearing" policy in all of the system's school buildings when fall classes begin.  Just 18% of eligible students in the Atlanta school system are fully vaccinated and 58% of its employees have said they are either fully vaccinated or plan to be, officials said.  "Given our low vaccination rates and increasing community spread, the CDC acknowledges that universal masking would be appropriate," the school system said in the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/vaccinations-rise-in-some-states-with-soaring-infections/articleshow/84661360.cms||---
---||World||Brother of Miami condo victim heartbroken but not hopeless||FORT LAUDERDALE: He has given his DNA, talks frequently with the medical examiner and search team, and even reluctantly visited the site of the collapsed Surfside condo, to see for himself what is being done to find his big sister. But there is still no closure for Ikey Hedaya. Almost a month after the 12-story building disintegrated into a smoking pile of debris, where the lucky few escaped through a choking dust cloud, and at least 97 perished, 54-year-old Estelle Hedaya appeared to be the only missing victim still not identified by Thursday. Her best friend in the building, lawyer and fellow New Yorker Linda March, was finally identified Wednesday night even though her body was found more than two weeks ago. But Hedaya's big sister, the life of the party and a travel lover who'd just bought a red Lexus to celebrate weight loss and career success, remains unaccounted for. "Hard to believe,'' he said. '"My sister is the last one,'' At first, he was hesitant to visit the site's twisted steel and concrete chunks, wondering about his sister's final moments. Her balcony and living room were still eerily intact. It was too much, and the 47-year-old real estate tax accountant from Brooklyn quickly turned around. "I can't believe Estelle is in there somewhere, and I didn't want to think about it,'' he said. But at the urging of a childhood best friend, now a rabbi, they returned to the site once more to pray in recent days. This time, the rubble was largely gone and the collapse site mostly swept flat. That's the image he'll hold onto. It is a lot to contemplate for this deeply religious man, firmly rooted in his Jewish faith. The waiting is torture, and although he is heartbroken, he is not hopeless. "I know God took care of her,'' he told The Associated Press in a series of interviews on Wednesday and Thursday. The brother said he is drawing his strength from God, just as he'd seen his sister do in troubling times. He also believes God chose her and that "it was her time.'' He'd sensed a shift in Estelle in the six to eight months before the collapse and had just seen her in May. "She always mentioned God anytime she was struggling with anything,'' he said. "She had reached a different level spiritually, which allowed her to excel in all other areas.'' Even her boss and friends agreed, Estelle had a knack for taking life's difficulties and squeezing out something positive. Beauty from ashes. That's what her brother believes will happen now after this tragedy where hundreds of relatives, friends and co-workers are grieving and pondering so many questions. Why them? Why this building? It is only natural to grieve, mourn and cry, he said. "Let it all out, don't fight it. But then pray for the strength to start moving forward,'' he said. Even if it's baby steps, he encouraged others grieving families to "shift to the positive'' in their own times as a way to "open yourself up to receive blessings'' "In times like these we have the power to unlock all kinds of things that are not available in normal times," he said. He said this late Wednesday after a day of frustration, another day with no word on his sister, another lengthy talk with the medical examiner, a conversation that includes painful reminders of final moments. He must also remain strong as he updates his elderly parents. Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Wednesday night that the search after the June 24 collapse had been impeded by fire, water and other obstacles and further identification of victims was relying heavily on the "technical, scientific process" of pathologists. "The enormous pressure of the weight of the collapse and the passage of time also make it more challenging,'' she said in a statement. Meanwhile, Estelle Hedaya's friends gather frequently to tell stories of their dear friend. Leah Sutton said Estelle and Linda March celebrated most holidays and birthdays with her family. "It is the finality of never laughing with them again that is so heartbreaking,'' said Sutton, who has known Estelle since birth and was her Miami mama. "Truly, amazing fearless girl. She could go travelling on vacation all by herself and make all new friends," she said. Since Ikey Hedaya came to Florida, several of Estelle's friends tracked him down, eager to tell him how his sister impacted their lives. "Good things will come out in her honor. She will be responsible for all kinds of blessings and happiness," he said of his sister, who had a blog "Follow The Toes'' documenting her travels, fitness tips and favorite spas. "When you think of all the people around the world who are going to look at themselves and improve in one way or another as a result of this, that's all on Estelle,'' he said. "That's immensely powerful.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/brother-of-miami-condo-victim-heartbroken-but-not-hopeless/articleshow/84660686.cms||---

Sen tore the papers and flung them at deputy chairman Harivansh. Vaishnaw could not complete his statement and the House had to be adjourned for the day. Immediately after, there was an animated exchange between Union minister Hardeep Puri and the TMC MP and marshals had to intervene to bring the situation under control. Just before this high drama, as soon as Vaishnaw rose to speak on the issue of the alleged phone tapping, opposition MPs rushed to the well of the House and raised ‚Äújasoosi band karo (stop spying)‚Äù slogans against the government. The minister rubbished the charges and reports, saying, ‚ÄúWhen we look at this issue through the prism of logic, it clearly emerges that there is no substance behind this sensationalism.‚Äù Harivansh urged protesting MPs to desist from unparliamentary behaviour and return to their respective seats and let the minister complete his statement. W e should not follow this unparliamentary behaviour. The report has been laid which you all wanted and which was an important issue for you all. You are getting an opportunity to ask your questions and get the answers. But you do not want a discussion on an issue. How is this democratic process?" Harivansh asked. Earlier in the day, the House was adjourned twice after opposition MPs raised the Pegasus issue and I-T searches on offices of Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar. Targeting TMC, Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the incident was ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù. ‚ÄúWanton hooliganism of @AITCofficial that has claimed 100s of lives in West Bengal now displayed in Parliament against a gentleman minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. Disgraceful,‚Äù he tweeted. ‚ÄúShameless behaviour encouraged by Mamata Banerjee who believes laws of the land don‚Äôt apply to her or her party,‚Äù Chandrasekhar added. BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi said the TMC and Congress were saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôll do things to damage the country's reputation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pegasus-row-mp-snatches-tears-it-mins-papers-in-parliament/articleshow/84661338.cms||---
---||World||Philadelphia officials 'strongly' recommend wearing masks in indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status||NEW DELHI: Philadelphia health officials on Thursday strongly recommended everyone to wear masks in indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status. "It's time for all of us to do what we need to do to protect our city's kids. That means getting fully vaccinated if you haven't yet, and it means all of us going back to wearing masks in public," said acting health commissioner Cheryl Bettigole in a statement. "Kids under 12 cannot yet be vaccinated. They need you to step up." Bettigole added that the city is witnessing "a small but disturbing increase in hospitalizations due to Covid-19 among children." Health officials asked the public to avoid crowded indoor spaces, and choose outdoor spaces over indoor ones. They further recommended "wearing a mask while indoors around people whom you don't know are vaccinated, and for unvaccinated people, consider double masking while in indoor public spaces." At present, 60.8 per cent of adults in Philadelphia are fully vaccinated, and 73.9 per cent have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to officials. "As of this week, over one million people have been vaccinated in Philadelphia," said mayor Jim Kenney. "The numbers make it clear: vaccinations are the best way to combat Covid-19 by protecting ourselves and the people around us."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/philadelphia-officials-strongly-recommend-wearing-masks-in-indoor-spaces-regardless-of-vaccination-status/articleshow/84661535.cms||---
---||World||Officials in Michigan county used virus money for bonuses||CORUNNA: Elected officials in a Michigan county gave themselves $65,000 in bonuses with federal relief money related to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The money, described as "hazard pay," included $25,000 for Jeremy Root, chairman of the Shiawassee County Board of Commissioners.  The mostly rural county, between Lansing and Flint, has a population of 68,000.  Commissioners - all Republicans - last week voted to award more than $500,000 to dozens of county employees. It ranged from $25,000 for administrators to $2,000 for cleaning staff. All recipients got at least $1,000.  Besides Root, commissioners John Plowman and Brandon Marks each received $10,000, and the other four commissioners got $5,000 each.  Most commissioners are paid $10,000 a year for their part-time job, plus a stipend for meetings.  "I think that I earned it," Commissioner Cindy Garber said of the bonus. "I work really hard at this job. I was here in person all through this crazy year."  Commissioner Marlene Webster said she was "mortified" when money appeared in her bank account and didn't know she had voted to reward herself.  "I'm giving the money back," Webster told WILX-TV. "I think one commissioner is giving it to a nonprofit so those actions indicate that we truly did not know this money was coming to us."  A message seeking comment from Root wasn't immediately returned Thursday.  Meanwhile, Nichole Ruggiero of Owosso filed a lawsuit to try to rescind some bonuses, claiming commissioners violated Michigan's open meetings law when they went into closed session to discuss the money, The Argus-Press reported.  "The arrogance of this board is outlandish," Ruggiero said.  The hazard pay was extended to other elected county officials, including Sheriff Brian BeGole, who got $25,000, and prosecutor Scott Koerner, who received $12,500.  The county administrator, Brian Boggs, who received $25,000, said the focus on commissioners was overshadowing an effort to assist county workers.  "It was to the benefit of the employees," he said of the bonuses, "and perhaps we should not pursue other ideas like this to get them additional funding if this is how it's going to be received."  Garber said the large payment for Root was justified because he "bears the burden of all emergency orders."  Stephan Currie, executive director of the Michigan Association of Counties, or MAC, said the group works closely with counties about how to spend federal virus-related cash.  "We are not aware of any other counties considering payments to elected officials, and MAC has not provided any guidance or advice to do so. ... Decisions, however, ultimately rest with the county's board of commissioners in each county," Currie told MLive.com.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/officials-in-michigan-county-used-virus-money-for-bonuses/articleshow/84661935.cms||---

The action sparked protests from the opposition and media bodies, which called it an attack on press freedom. The Bhaskar Group dubbed the action as a retaliation against its aggressive coverage of the pandemic. Government sources, however, refuted the charge, and said the searches were part of a probe into the alleged round-tripping by the Bhaskar Group, which has interests in other sectors, besides media. I-T officials also conducted searches on a UP-based media group, Bharat Samachar, and its promoters in a different tax evasion case. Read AlsoAgencies are doing their job, there‚Äôs no interference: GovtNEW DELHI: Information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur said on Thursday that investigation agencies are ‚Äúdoing their work‚Äù and that there is ‚Äúno (government) interference in it‚Äù with reference to the income tax action against the Dainik Bhaskar group and Bharat Samachar. Speaking on theThe three Agarwal brothers ‚Äî Sudhir, Pawan and Girish ‚Äî are promoters of the Bhaskar Group and control media conglomerate DB Corp Ltd, which has diverse investments in power, textile and real estate with a turnover of around Rs 6,000 crore. The flagship DB Corp controls at least 100 companies where the I-T department has alleged large-scale tax evasion and round-tripping of investments through the Mauritius route. Read Also‚ÄòI-T action on Bhaskar comes after allegations of tax evasion'NEW DELHI: The searches by the income tax departmemt on Dainik Bhaskar group follow allegations of siphoning of funds by the group which has interests in media, power, textiles and real estate apart from the names of some members related to promoters cropping up in the Panama Papers, governmentSeveral shell companies controlled by the group allegedly have employees of the company as shareholders and directors. Government sources claimed that the DB Group has figured in the 2016 Panama paper disclosure case, which is being probed by a multi-agency group (MAG) consisting of the I-T department, Enforcement Directorate, Financial Intelligence Unit and the RBI. Astatement released by the Bhaskar Group said I-T raids were conducted on its premises in MP, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra for its aggressive journalism. Laptops and mobile phones of its editorial and digital staff were seized despite these persons having nothing to do with financial transactions of the company, and they were detained illegally. News updates suffered for several hours, it said. The opposition also linked the I-T action to the media group‚Äôs reporting on alleged under-counting of Covid deaths and the matter was raised on Thursday in the Rajya Sabha by former MP CM Digvijaya Singh. Thereafter, several opposition politicians and parties condemned the action against Dainik Bhaskar. Answering a question as to whether the IT action was an attack on journalism, information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur said the agencies were working without any interference of the government and added it would be a folly to reach conclusions on the basis of incomplete information. The Panama paper leaks had mention of over 400 Indian entities but the multi-agency inquiries later found only 146 cases were ‚Äúactionable‚Äù in which the government has so far unearthed undisclosed income of more than Rs 20,000 crore. While no official statements have been made by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the apex cadre controlling I-T authority, on the searches on the two groups, government sources alleged that people from the Bhaskar Group were involved in alleged round-tripping of investments. Round-tripping is a concept generally used in money laundering contexts where fictitious or shell companies registered in tax havens receive deposits of undisclosed income and route them back to the beneficiary in the host country as legitimate foreign direct investments. Sources said that the Bhaskar Group has been on the radar of the tax authorities since 2016 and is being investigated along with other entities under the Black Money Act. ‚ÄúMany had their accounts in Singapore while their entities were registered in the British Virgin Island,‚Äù according to the I-T department. The department has already filed several chargesheets in courts and served notices to many under the Black Money Act. Residences of Dainik Bhaskar promoters and the bungalow of its chief finance officer were among those searched, said sources. Members of the editorial team on the night shift at the Bhopal HQ office ‚Äî which moves out by 6am ‚Äî were asked to remain inside till 1pm, said sources. It was the same in other editorial offices as well. The searches lasted well into the evening, and could stretch into the night. There were 20-25 officials in the DB office in the Press Complex in Bhopal around 7.30pm. In Jaipur, I-T teams arrived at the daily‚Äôs JLN Marg office. CM Ashok Gehlot decried the I-T action against the newspaper and called it an attempt to muzzle the press. He tweeted that the government‚Äôs inability to tolerate any criticism indicates BJP‚Äôs ‚Äúfascist mentality."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/it-searches-dainik-bhaskar-opposition-calls-it-attack-on-press-freedom/articleshow/84661894.cms||---

An apartment complex ‚Äî DLF Westend Heights Apartment located at Akshay Nagar in Begur ‚Äî has flipped this picture: Their OWC is not just swanky (with a magnet curtain and effective exhaust) and stink and fly-free, it is also efficient and is helping the community with compost. Residents have stopped paying for waste disposal by managing it within their gates. Apart from using in-house compost, they‚Äôre earning Rs 40,000 per month by selling dry waste. The complex, with 1,830 flats of which 1,500 are occupied by 5,000 residents, generates 15 tonnes of dry waste and 30 tonnes of wet waste every month. Till 2019, a contractor would take away solid waste, but his cost kept increasing. Residents also had no clarity on how their waste was being disposed of. But things changed when they realised that financial and environmental costs of their waste had to be cut. Kartikeya Khanna, secretary of the executive committee of the apartment‚Äôs RWA, said that‚Äôs when they decided to start segregation and manage waste inside their complex. Dr Rashmi Vasanth, member of the RWA‚Äôs executive committee, led the volunteers for educating the waste segregation team, and distributed two dustbins and one bag to each household. Mohi Shaik, a sub-committee member of the RWA, said their next step was to increase the OWC capacity provided by the builder by 500kg a day and make sure it was done in a hygienic manner. Using the OWC meant inviting flies, odour and leachate, as well as annoying residents. Khanna said they were able to have a clean and efficient OWC by ensuring there was no stagnant water. Wet waste was covered with dry waste to avoid flies, empty crates were cleaned with jet sprays to remove remaining waste and installing electric flycatchers. ‚ÄúToday, the OWC processes 10 tonnes of wet waste per month. It has a vibrating sieve, 20 crate trolleys and air-handling unit. The compost is sold to residents and external buyers,‚Äù said Khanna. The society has committed one tonne of its compost at no cost to any public-plantation project. ‚ÄúThe interested can write to compost.whcaowa@gmail.com,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/apartment-makes-cash-out-of-dry-trash/articleshow/84662064.cms||Farheen Hussain

The youth, who reportedly pleaded with the cops not to coerce him to consume drugs, tried to end his life later but survived. The suspended officers are inspector S Parvathamma, sub-inspector Anjinappa H M and constable Umesh. Preliminary probe revealed the cops tried to frame the youth to show they have been cracking down against drug peddlers. The suspension orders were issued following a report from deputy commissioner of police (north) Dharmender Kumar Meena to police commissioner Kamal Pant on Tuesday. According to the report, Parvathamma detained two youths near Goraguntepalya on the night of July 14 while on patrol duty. ‚ÄúOne of them was smoking a cigarette and threw it away on seeing the police vehicle. The cops assumed he was consuming drugs and disposed them of on seeing them. He was taken to RMC Yard police station. There, the four cops gave him a cigarette filled with ganja and told him to smoke it,‚Äù the gist of the report read. The youth, who ran a roadside eatery, reportedly refused, but he was told they would set him free if he smoked. After the youth obliged, two constables took him to a hospital and subjected him to a test. The medical report confirmed the consumption of ganja. Subsequently, he was booked and later released on bail. Upset by the incident, the youth attempted to end his life by consuming poison on July 17. ‚ÄúFortunately, he recovered swiftly. The news reached us and we held a departmental inquiry,‚Äù Meena‚Äôs report said. SI Anjinappa recorded talk with DCP:On Tuesday, DCP Meena questioned sub-inspector Anjinappa for over 25 minutes inside his chamber. Meena grew suspicious when he saw Anjinappa repeatedly touching the right pocket of his trousers and directed his staff to frisk the SI. They found Anjinappa was recording his conversation with the senior officer by switching on the recorder of his mobile phone; 14 minutes of the talk had been recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-cops-suspended-for-forcing-youth-to-smoke-ganja/articleshow/84662068.cms||---

According to a report dated June 7, 2021 submitted by the society‚Äôs administrator to the high court and accessed by TOI, the bank siphoned off Rs 284 crore from the society‚Äôs investments and accounts with it and adjusted the same towards its bad loans. The bank and society were both founded by the same set of people and also the same individuals were office-bearers in both institutions, making it easy for the alleged irregularities to be perpetrated. The society maintained its accounts and fixed deposits in the bank. The society‚Äôs two-pronged strategy of brandishing the caste card and a high 12.5% interest rate without TDS had lured about 3,500 people to deposit Rs 284 crore, which it then deposited with the bank in various instruments. The unauthorised debits from the society‚Äôs two current accounts maintained with the bank were being done since 2015-16, the report pointed out. The report provided details of how a sum of Rs 180 crore was illegally withdrawn ‚Äî without authorised signatures or cheques ‚Äîfrom the society‚Äôs current accounts to bail out the bank. It was also found that some of the society‚Äôs FDs, totalling over Rs 104 crore, were prematurely closed and were adjusted towards loan accounts of the bank in November 2019. The interest earned on the FDs too was not credited into the society‚Äôs accounts. The society‚Äôs money was used to close loan defaulters‚Äô account of the bank, only to mislead people about the bank‚Äôs financial health, society depositors TOI spoke with said. Citing an illustration, the report disclosed that Prof G Krishnan, a former director of the bank, connived with its officials and sold his agricultural land in Tamil Nadu to the society. While records in the sub-registrar‚Äôs office showed the land was sold for Rs 70.7 lakh, a sum of Rs 17.7 crore was transferred from the society‚Äôs account to Krishnan‚Äôs. The society has now requested the court that permission be granted to sell the land, which is of no use to it. The revenue department attached the land in November 2020. KS Shyam Prasad, administrator of the society, declined to comment, saying the documents are with the high court and other authorities concerned. Director convinced me: DepositorGopinath, 70, a retired engineer and resident of Katriguppe, said one of the society‚Äôs directors convinced him to deposit money. ‚ÄúI deposited (FD) Rs 8 lakh in June 2019, but now my money is stuck. All other depositors, most of whom are senior citizens dependent on interest money for day-to-day necessities, are in distress,‚Äù he claimed. Krishna Kumar, 38, an auditor and resident of Chamarajpet, had deposited Rs 23 lakh with the society in 2017 after he was lured by one of the bank‚Äôs board members. ‚ÄúWhile the high interest was what drew me, I also trusted my community people,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bank-adjusted-societys-284cr-towards-bad-loans-says-report/articleshow/84662074.cms||Kiran Parashar

A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka set a six-month deadline for establishing the required number of shelters elsewhere in the state. The government statement indicated at least 166 night shelters are required to be set up in cities/towns having more than 1 lakh population and only 46 are functioning as against the approved strength of 54. In addition, in BBMP areas, as against the requirement of 84 night shelters, only 10 are functioning and in other cities like Mysuru and Hubballi-Dharwad, as opposed to the need of nine night shelters, only two and one exist, respectively. The bench also directed district legal services authorities to make a surprise visit to existing night shelters to verify the conditions and facilities provided and submit reports. The court is hearing a PIL filed by People‚Äôs Union of Civil Liberties challenging the constitutional validity of certain provisions of Karnataka Prohibition of Beggary Act, 1975 as well as the Prohibition of Beggary Rules, 1975, saying they seek to criminalise begging. The petitioner has sought for directions for conducting an audit regarding the expenditure of beggary cess collected and also implementation of operational guidelines for urban homeless shelters issued on May 29, 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/set-up-42-night-shelters-in-three-months-hc-tells-govt/articleshow/84662076.cms||---

With few US restrictions on what companies can do with the vast amount of data they collect from web page visits, apps and location tracking built into phones, there's not much to stop similar spying on politicians, celebrities and just about anyone that's a target of another person's curiosity - or malice.  Citing allegations of "possible improper behavior," the US Conference of Catholic Bishops on Tuesday announced the resignation of its top administrative official, Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill, ahead of a report by the Catholic news outlet The Pillar that probed his private romantic life.  The Pillar said it obtained "commercially available" location data from a vendor it didn't name that it "correlated" to Burrill's phone to determine that he had visited gay bars and private residences while using Grindr, a dating app popular with gay people.  "Cases like this are only going to multiply," said Alvaro Bedoya, director of the Center for Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School.  Privacy activists have long agitated for laws that would prevent such abuses, although in the US they only exist in a few states, and then in varying forms. Bedoya said the firing of Burrill should drive home the danger of this situation, and should finally spur Congress and the Federal Trade Commission to act.  Privacy concerns are often construed in abstract terms, he said, "when it's really, 'Can you explore your sexuality without your employer firing you? Can you live in peace after an abusive relationship without fear?'" Many abuse victims take great care to ensure that their abuser can't find them again.  As a congressional staffer in 2012, Bedoya worked on legislation that would have banned apps that let abusers secretly track their victims' locations through smartphone data. But it was never passed.  "No one can claim this is a surprise," Bedoya said. "No one can claim that they weren't warned."  Privacy advocates have been warning for years that location and personal data collected by advertisers and amassed and sold by brokers can be used to identify individuals, isn't secured as well as it should be and is not regulated by laws that require the clear consent of the person being tracked. Both legal and technical protections are necessary so that smartphone users can push back, they say.  The Pillar alleged "serial sexual misconduct" by Burrill - homosexual activity is considered sinful under Catholic doctrine, and priests are expected to remain celibate. The online publication's website describes it as focused on investigative journalism that "can help the Church to better serve its sacred mission, the salvation of souls."  Its editors didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday about how they obtained the data. The report said only that the data came from one of the data brokers that aggregate and sell app signal data, and that the publication also contracted an independent data consulting firm to authenticate it.  US Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said the incident confirms yet again the dishonesty of an industry that falsely claims to safeguard the privacy of phone users.  "Experts have warned for years that data collected by advertising companies from Americans' phones could be used to track them and reveal the most personal details of their lives. Unfortunately, they were right," he said in a statement. "Data brokers and advertising companies have lied to the public, assuring them that the information they collected was anonymous. As this awful episode demonstrates, those claims were bogus -- individuals can be tracked and identified."  Wyden and other lawmakers asked the FTC last year to investigate the industry. It needs "to step up and protect Americans from these outrageous privacy violations, and Congress needs to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation," he added.  Norway's data privacy watchdog concluded earlier this year that Grindr shared personal user data with a number of third parties without legal basis and said it would impose a fine of $11.7 million (100 million Norwegian krone), equal to 10% of the California company's global revenue.  The data leaked to advertising technology companies for targeted ads included GPS location, user profile information as well as the simple fact that particular individuals were using Grindr, which could indicate their sexual orientation.  Sharing such information could put someone at risk of being targeted, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority said. It argued that the way Grindr asked users for permission to use their information violated European Union requirements for "valid consent." Users weren't given the chance to opt out of sharing data with third parties and were forced to accept Grindr's privacy policy in its entirety, it said, adding that users weren't properly informed about the data sharing.  The advertising partners that Grindr shared data with included Twitter, AT&T's Xandr service, and other ad-tech companies OpenX, AdColony and Smaato, the Norwegian watchdog said. Its investigation followed a complaint by a Norwegian consumer group that found similar data leakage problems at other popular dating apps such as OkCupid and Tinder.  In a statement, Grindr called The Pillar's report an "unethical, homophobic witch hunt" and said it does "not believe" it was the source of the data used. The company said it has policies and systems in place to protect personal data, although it didn't say when those were implemented. The Pillar said the app data it obtained about Burrill covered parts of 2018, 2019 and 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/priest-outed-via-grindr-app-highlights-rampant-data-tracking/articleshow/84662400.cms||---

---||World||Mississippi asks US Supreme Court to overturn abortion rights landmark||WASHINGTON: The state of Mississippi on Thursday urged the US Supreme Court in a major case set to be argued in its next term to overturn the landmark 1973 ruling that recognized that women have a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican, said in papers to be filed with the court that the Roe v Wade ruling and a subsequent 1992 decision that affirmed it were both "egregiously wrong" and that state legislatures should have more leeway to restrict abortion. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. The filing marked the first time Mississippi made overturning Roe v Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide and ended an era in which some states had banned the procedure, a central part of its argument. "It is time for the court to set this right and return this political debate to the political branches of government," Fitch added in a statement. Mississippi is one of numerous Republican-governed states in recent years to have passed ever-more-restrictive abortion laws. The court in May agreed to take up the Mississippi case and will hear it in its term that begins in October. The justices are likely to hear oral arguments in November, with a ruling due by the end of June 2022. Mississippi is seeking to revive its Republican-backed law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Lower courts ruled against the 2018 law, which legislators enacted with full knowledge that it was a direct challenge to Roe v Wade. It has been a longstanding aim of religious conservatives to overturn Roe v Wade, which recognized that a constitutional right to personal privacy protects a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. The court in its 1992 decision, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, reaffirmed the ruling and prohibited laws that place an "undue burden" on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. Roe v Wade said that states could not ban abortion before the viability of the fetus outside the womb, which is generally viewed by doctors as between 24 and 28 weeks. The Mississippi law would ban abortion much earlier than that. Other states have backed laws that would ban the procedure even earlier. Abortion opponents are hopeful the Supreme Court will narrow or overturn Roe v Wade. The court's conservative majority includes the addition last year of Republican former President Donald Trump's third appointee, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She replaced liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an abortion rights champion who died in September. If the justices do consider overturning their abortion precedents, they would have to wrestle with various factors, including that women for almost 50 years have known they have the legal right to obtain an abortion. Abortion remains a divisive issue in the United States, as in many countries. Christian conservatives are among those most opposed to it. US abortion rates have steadily declined since the early 1980s, reaching the lowest levels on record in recent years, according to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute. After the only abortion clinic in Mississippi, Jackson Women's Health Organization, sued to block the 15-week ban, a federal judge in 2018 ruled against the state. The New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2019 reached the same conclusion. The Supreme Court in a 5-4 June 2020 ruling struck down a Louisiana law that imposed restrictions on doctors who perform abortions. Ginsburg was still on the court at the time and conservative Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the court's liberal wing in the ruling. Roberts, however, made it clear that he voted that way because he felt bound by the court's 2016 ruling striking down a similar Texas law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/mississippi-asks-us-supreme-court-to-overturn-abortion-rights-landmark/articleshow/84662535.cms||---
---||World||Confederate bust to be removed from Tennessee Capitol||NASHVILLE: A decades long effort to remove a bust of a Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader from the Tennessee Capitol cleared its final hurdle Thursday, with state leaders approving the final vote needed to allow the statue to be relocated to a museum.  The seven-member State Building Commission voted 5-2 to remove the Nathan Bedford Forrest bust as well as the busts of two other Tennessee military leaders.  The Forrest bust was first installed at the Capitol in 1978 and has sparked protests and demonstrations ever since. Some have called for adding more historical context to the bust, but others, including Gov. Bill Lee recently, fought to have it moved to the state's history museum.  Tennessee's Black legislative caucus has been particularly vocal about how painful it has been to walk by the bust, displayed prominently between the House and Senate chamber, as they carry out their work each day.  "Much like this bust symbolizes the pain and suffering of slavery and terror, removing the likeness of Nathan Bedford Forrest from a place of honor in Tennessee's Capitol is a symbol for much needed reconciliation," said Sen. Raumesh Akbari, a Black lawmaker from Memphis and the Senate's Democratic caucus chairwoman.  "No doubt we have work to do to achieve equality and justice for all people, but today's vote shows that progress is possible," she said.  Forrest was a Confederate cavalry general who amassed a fortune before the Civil War as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis. After the war, he was a leader of the Klan, which terrorized Black people as it sought to reverse Reconstruction efforts and restore white supremacy.  Earlier this year, Tennessee's Historical Commission voted 25-1 to move the three busts just north of the Capitol building to the state's museum, noting it was better equipped to furnish the appropriate historical context.  However, the Statehouse's top Republican leaders argued that the bust could not be removed without approval from the State Building Commission. House Speaker Cameron Sexton and Senate Speaker Randy McNally both expressed disappointment with Thursday's outcome.  "No one is arguing that Forrest is not a problematic figure. He is. But there is more to his story. His life eventually followed a redemptive arc which I hope is outlined in great detail in our state museum," McNally said in a statement, adding that the vote signaled that some advocates will likely find another monument to "demand that we again kneel at the altar of political correctness."  The GOP-controlled General Assembly has refused for years to advance legislation calling for the bust's removal.  However, momentum shifted when Lee changed positions and called for moving the bust out of the Capitol in 2020 amid national outcry over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minnesota. Floyd's death sparked a new push to remove Confederate symbols, including the Forrest bust.  Lee's position was markedly different than when he first came into elected office in 2018, arguing that "the Ku Klux Klan is a part of our history that we're not proud of in Tennessee, and we need to be reminded of that and make certain that we don't forget it. So I wouldn't advocate to remove" the bust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/confederate-bust-to-be-removed-from-tennessee-capitol/articleshow/84662822.cms||---

Shiradi Ghat was closed for traffic on Thursday; NHAI officials refused to specify when repairs could be completed. Dams in Cauvery basin continue to receive good inflow of water and the Bhadra is flowing above the danger mark at several places in Chikkamagaluru district. Hebbale bridge has been submerged, cutting off the road network between Kalasa and Horanadu. The road link between Balehonnur and Kalasa has also been cut off. The accident was reported in the early hours of Thursday as the car crashed into a tree at Halenahalli on the outskirts of Chikkamagaluru city. Two leaders of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha ‚Äî Ramaswamy, 70, from Ramanagara district and Ramanna, 55, from Belur in Hassan ‚Äî were killed while the driver, Manjunath from Belur, is in hospital, police said. Chikkamagaluru police said the three were heading home after attending a farmers‚Äô memorial at Navalagund in Dharwad on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe accident occurred due to low visibility after rain early morning,‚Äù Chikkamagaluru SP Hakay Akshay Machhindra said. In Hassan, the district administration moved in swiftly to ban traffic on Shiradi Ghat as the highway caved in near Donigal in Sakleshpur taluk, stalling the flow of vehicles between Bengaluru and Mangaluru. They have been rerouted towards Charmadi Ghat via Belur and Mudigere. A minor landslide was reported at the same spot where four-lane construction related work was taken up last year. Locals said the road began to develop cracks as heavy rain started at 4.30pm on Wednesday. NHAI has begun restoration work but it is not clear when traffic can resume. Water levels up in dams:In districts along Cauvery basin, heavy rain continued to push up water levels in major dams. KRS dam near Mysuru crossed the 102ft mark and has an inflow of 15,000 cusecs of water. Inflow into Kabini dam in Mysuru picked up after a week, with the reservoir getting close to 10,000 cusecs. Dam authorities are maintaining water level at 2,280ft, against the maximum of 2,284ft, factoring the fluctuation in inflow. Inflow into Harangi dam in Kodagu district has also increased. Authorities are releasing 10,378 cusecs of water into the dam, which has led to flooding at Kudige, where the river joins the Cauvery. During the last 24 hours, the average rainfall in the district is 74.5 mm, with Somwarpet taluk receiving the highest rainfall at 89.5 mm, followed by 77.5 mm in Madikeri taluk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/2-ryot-leaders-killed-in-crash-nh-cave-in-due-to-heavy-rain/articleshow/84662845.cms||---

It also resolved to form a committee to study the pandemic-hit sector‚Äôs demand to reduce the guidance value of properties. ‚ÄúWe will take the final call based on the committee‚Äôs report,‚Äù said law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai. The decision on stamp duty is expected to help increase property registrations and lift the sentiment in the affordable housing segment across the state. In May 2020, the government had slashed stamp duty on homes priced between Rs 21 lakh and Rs 35 lakh by the same rate. In the 2020-21 budget, units costing up to Rs 20 lakh saw a decrease. The initial plan was to lower charges for only properties priced up to Rs 20 lakh, but the government realised the incentive would not spur demand in urban centres like Bengaluru, where such lowcost units are difficult to find. It finally decided to expand the purview of the cut to the Rs 35-lakh price range and now to Rs 45 lakh. Though pleased with the government‚Äôs decision, real estate developers believe it may not have a significant impact on demand. According to Suresh Hari, the chairman of CREDAI‚Äôs Bengaluru chapter, affordable housing accounts for about 20 per cent of real estate development in the state. ‚ÄúWhile we welcome the move to cut stamp duty, which will help lower middle-class and first-time homebuyers, the market requires a flat cut across all segments,‚Äù he said. Hari added that after the second wave of Covid-19, the real estate market was finding it challenging to pick up the pace, while would-be buyers were still concerned about how the pandemic would affect their financial status. Amid chatter that chief minister BS Yediyurappa, 78, may make way for a younger leader, the cabinet has cleared another major proposal. The plan will involve the construction of 5 lakh houses ‚Äî 4 lakh in rural Karnataka and 1 lakh in urban locations ‚Äî under various housing department schemes. Bommai said that the project would be completed in the next two years and was estimated to cost Rs 8,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/stamp-duty-cut-for-flats-up-to-45-lakh/articleshow/84662849.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Classes on campus: Higher grades could return first, says Karnataka education minister S Suresh Kumar||BENGALURU: The government plans to reopen Classes 9 to II PU first and the expert committee looking into the matter will submit its report next week, said primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar on Thursday. He briefed the media after the SSLC exams were completed. However, the expert committee on school reopening may suggest that pre-primary and primary grades may resume first. The expert committee was formed after another committee headed by Dr Devi Shetty submitted its report on preparing for the third wave. That suggested that the school reopening decision should be decentralised. However, many committee members feel that all schools should reopen. If schools cannot reopen at once because of crowding, grades 1 to 5 should start first. The committee is likely to suggest they reopen on August 2. Members said the latest ICMR and Lancet studies, apart from international experience, show that children are quite safe. Schools said they‚Äôre worried as these children have lost out the most because of the lockdown. Schools should be allowed to decide on the modalities of reopening ‚Äî shift system with some classes in the morning and other grades in the afternoon; alternate days or even full school reopening if the number of students is low. The committee is expected to emphasise that teachers should not be forced to complete the syllabus, but the department should acknowledge learning gaps created over the past 18 months. For this, there should be active learning from August 2021 to May 2023, with three-hour classes for six days a week. A minimum of 300 actual teaching and learning days out of 500 days should be held to achieve core learning outcomes of the lost curriculum and the new 2022-2023 curriculum. A profile of the learning ability of each student should be generated. The committee also feels that midday meals should be restarted at the earliest. However, some members suggested that if transmission of virus is a concern, dry food like chikki, banana and biscuit should be provided over and above dry rations. Teachers and parents should be vaccinated to create a bubble. All standard operating procedures and hygiene facilities should be in place and heads of the school and SDMC should ensure compliance. Beyond SSLC exam:There are 12 lakh PU seats in the state and the government will ensure that no student who passes Class 10 will face a problem in admission, Kumar said. As all Class 10 students will be promoted, the number of students joining PU courses will be much more than earlier. ‚ÄúDistrict officials are compiling statistics on demand and supply. In case any college wants to increase its quantum of seats, the request will be considered,‚Äù he said. The two-day SSLC exam concluded on Thursday. Around 99.6% students appeared for the language papers. Last year, the attendance was 98.4%. While 67 Covid-positive students wrote the exam in Covid Care Centres, 152 students with symptoms took the exam in isolation rooms in schools and 706 students from other states crossed the border for the test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/experts-panel-govt-differ-on-schools/articleshow/84662850.cms||---

These are also among the top states, along with Maharashtra, witnessing a rise in active cases. While 47 districts have above 10% positivity, in 55 it is ranging between 5-10%, official data from July 14-20 shows. While Jaisalmer in Rajasthan has the highest positivity rate at over 41%, other districts in the state like Sawai Madhopur, Baran, Jhalawar, Tonk and Rajsamand also have significantly high positivity. In Kerala, nine districts including Mallapuram, Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Palakkad and Thrissur have high positivity rate. In Sikkim‚Äôs South District and Kohima‚Äôs Nagaland too, the rate is above 30%. The Centre has advised these states and districts to focus on aggressive testing and containment measures. While scaling up RAT testing, all states have also been asked to steadily enhance RT-PCR testing, which is the gold standard of Covid diagnosis.

The health ministers of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh claimed their states were never asked to submit the relevant data and hence did not report the number of Covid deaths medically attributed to oxygen shortage. Both questioned the basis of the Centre‚Äôs statement in Parliament when the relevant data wasn‚Äôt collected from the states. Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma said majority of the deaths during the second wave in the state were due to oxygen shortage. The Centre, in a written statement on Tuesday, had informed the Rajya Sabha that states did not specifically report deaths due to oxygen shortage. In a series of tweets on Thursday, Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo pointed out that the ‚Äúnumber of deaths in a day, deaths with comorbidity, deaths without comorbidity and type of comorbidity‚Äù were the only categories in which data was sought. Singh Deo alleged that the Centre deliberately misled Parliament without checking with the states. ‚ÄúWhen GOI says ‚Äòno one died due to lack of oxygen during the second wave,‚Äô they are probably referring to Chhattisgarh ‚Äî a state with surplus oxygen,‚Äù added Singh Deo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-never-sought-oxygen-death-data-rajasthan-chhattisgarh/articleshow/84662920.cms||---

Press secretary Jen Psaki insisted Thursday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and not the White House, makes the decisions about public health. Psaki says any change in the guidance would come from CDC. The current guidance is that fully vaccinated individuals do not need to wear face masks while those who are unvaccinated should continue to wear them. White House and public health officials have been discussing whether to update the mask guidance because of the surge in Covid-19 infections blamed on the highly contagious Delta variant. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a briefing Thursday that while her agency is always reviewing the data, the recommendations haven't changed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/white-house-says-no-change-to-mask-mandate/articleshow/84662928.cms||---

Siddiqui was the Chief Photographer for Reuters in India. He was killed during the ongoing violence in Kandahar's Spin Boldak district. "This afternoon, HE President Ashraf Ghani called Professor Siddiqui, father of Reuters journalist late Danish Siddiqui, and conveyed his condolences over the death of his son to his family, friends and colleagues. The President termed his death as a great loss for the journalism fraternity," said Aziz Amin, Special Secretary to President Ghani. Last week, Ghani had expressed grief over the death of Danish Siddiqui, who was killed while covering the Taliban atrocities in the war-torn country. "I am deeply saddened with the shocking reports that Reuters Photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering the Taliban atrocities in Kandahar," he had said. "While I extend my heartfelt condolences to Sediqqui's family and also to our media family, I reiterate my government's unwavering commitment to freedom of speech and protection of free media and journalists," Ghani had added. India had raised the killing of the journalist at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla last week at New York had said, "We condemn the killing of Indian Photo Journalist Danish Siddiqui while he was on a reporting assignment in Kandahar in Afghanistan yesterday. I extend our sincerest condolences to his bereaved family."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghan-president-calls-danish-siddiquis-father-to-extend-condolences/articleshow/84662996.cms||---

The 78-year-old Lingayat strongman added that he offered to resign two months ago to make way for others and asserted he would not name a successor even if asked to do so. Breaking his silence for the first time amid a heightened buzz that he would resign on July 26, Yediyurappa said he was awaiting instructions from the high command on Sunday. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt got any message (regarding continuation as CM). It‚Äôs my duty to abide by what they (high command) say. I‚Äôll continue as CM as long as they want. Whether in power or not, I‚Äôll continue to tour the state and strengthen the party,‚Äù he said. He said he would continue working as usual. On Friday, he is to inspect developmental works in Bengaluru. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my duty till the end, let‚Äôs see what happens," he said. He also heaped praise on the party brass. ‚ÄúPM Modi, Amit Shah and JP Nadda have special love and faith in me. In our party, those over 75 years are not given any post. However, appreciating my work, they gave me an opportunity to serve as CM,‚Äù he said. The change in tone from ‚Äúnobody has asked me to resign and I will continue as CM‚Äù to ‚ÄúI will abide by high command‚Äôs decision‚Äù is being seen here as an indication that his exit is imminent. Asked whether a fellow Lingayat should succeed him, he said, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt put any such pressure. Who should be made (the next CM) is left to the central leadership.‚Äù In New Delhi, BJP national general secretary in charge of Karnataka, Arun Singh, who had said last month that Yediyurappa would continue in office for a full term, ducked a question on leadership change. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll discuss it some other time over a cup of tea,‚Äù he told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ready-to-go-will-await-partys-instructions-on-sunday-yediyurappa/articleshow/84663042.cms||---

The CM will also host party MLAs and MPs over tea before Sidhu assumes charge. Amarinder had earlier put a precondition that Sidhu should publicly apologise for his ‚Äòderogatory‚Äô tweets before he agrees to meet Sidhu. Sources said that intervention in both camps by AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and party incharge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat led to truce. However, party insiders feel that despite his climbdown, it would be premature to assume a thaw in Amarinder‚Äôs strained relations with Sidhu. On Thursday, two of the four PCC working presidents, Kuljit Singh Nagra and Sangat Singh Gilzian, reached the CM‚Äôs Siswan farmhouse and handed over two invitation letters ‚Äì one signed by 57-odd MLAs and another personal invitation from Sidhu to Amarinder. Sidhu wrote to the CM that he had ‚Äúno personal agenda‚Äù and as the ‚Äúeldest of Punjab Congress family‚Äù, the CM should come and bless the new PPCC team. ‚ÄúMy resolve and commitment on Punjab‚Äôs issues and fulfilling high command‚Äôs pro-people 18-point agenda for the welfare of every Punjabi is well known to you and all,‚Äù he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/captain-amarinder-to-attend-navjot-singh-sidhus-installation-ceremony/articleshow/84663132.cms||---

A bench of Justices U U Lalit, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat said the rights of such purchasers are the same as that of original allottees. ‚ÄúIt cannot be said that a subsequent purchaser who steps into the shoes of an original allottee of a housing project in which the builder has not honoured its commitment to deliver the flat within a stipulated time, cannot expect any ‚Äî even reasonable time ‚Äî for the performance of the builder‚Äôs obligation. Such a conclusion would be arbitrary, given that there may be a large number ‚Äî possibly thousands ‚Äî of flat buyers waiting for their promised flats or residences; they surely would be entitled to all reliefs under the Consumer Protection Act,‚Äù the court said. The court ruled against a plea by the real estate company Laureate Builwell Pvt Ltd, which took the ground that the paid amount cannot be refunded as the purchaser is not the original allottee and he/she purchased the flat knowing that the project was getting delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/second-hand-flat-buyers-have-same-rights-as-original-allottees-rules-sc/articleshow/84663162.cms||---

Senior counsel CV Nagesh made this submission in response to a query posed by Karnataka HC‚Äôs Justice G Narendar, who commenced dictation of the judgment on Maheshwari‚Äôs petition seeking quashing of a notice issued to him by the UP police over alleged circulation of a controversial video. When the judge wanted to know whether Twitter Inc can be referred to as the parent company, Nagesh replied that Twitter India is an independent entity and at best can be called an affiliate company. He added that Twitter Inc doesn‚Äôt have a single share in Twitter India and that he would place this fact through a memo on Friday. The court was told that Twitter International Company, headquartered in Ireland, has 9,999 shares, while Twitter Netherlands has one share. However, Twitter Inc runs the platform. However, the judge pointed out there is nothing called affiliate company in company law and, at best, they are called sister companies or associated companies. Amid these deliberations, P Prasanna Kumar, special public prosecutor for the UP police, said that in the event of Twitter India claiming to be an independent entity, it would have to be ready to face the consequences. He claimed that in proceedings before the central government, colleagues of the petitioner have represented on behalf of Twitter Inc as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/twitter-inc-doesnt-have-single-share-in-twitter-india-md/articleshow/84663174.cms||---

The probe by the tax department has focused on allegations of tax evasion by the group by allegedly claiming bogus expenses and purchases using shell entities. Sources accused the group of having floated ‚Äúpaper companies‚Äù for the purpose, with employees as shareholders and directors of entities. The money allegedly siphoned off is routed back into various personal and business investments, in the form of share premium and foreign investments through Mauritius-based entities. The searches triggered a massive controversy, with the issue taking a political colour and the government coming under attack from the opposition for ‚Äúthrottling‚Äù the media. The sources said the operation on 32 premises, comprising residential and business premises, followed an analysis of the tax department‚Äôs database, banking and other inquiries. Asked about Congress‚Äô allegation on the searches being politically motivated in response to Dainik Bhaskar‚Äôs reportage on alleged under-reporting of Covid deaths, information and broadcasting minister Anurag Singh Thakur said: ‚ÄúAgencies are doing their own work and there is no interference in them.‚Äù The searches, which began around 5.30am and went on till evening, were conducted at premises spread over Mumbai, Delhi, Bhopal, Indore, Jaipur, Korba, Noida and Ahmedabad. While the group, which has an annual turnover of over Rs 6,000 crore, has over 100 companies across its businesses, the tax department did not disclose if the focus was on certain specific businesses. DB Corp Ltd, which publishes Dainik Bhaskar, is the flagship company. The coal-based power generation business is carried in the name of DB Power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/i-t-action-on-bhaskar-comes-after-allegations-of-tax-evasion/articleshow/84663218.cms||---

Pakistan interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had earlier said Indian agencies were responsible for her abduction. Reacting to the claim, India described the abduction as shocking. ‚ÄúThis involves two other countries. and usually we wouldn‚Äôt comment. However, since the interior minister of Pakistan has dragged India into it, I would like to say that even by their standards, Pakistan‚Äôs denial of the victim‚Äôs account is stooping to a new low,‚Äù MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.

---||India||Govt seeks to tweak law on states‚Äô OBC lists||NEW DELHI: The Centre has moved a proposal to amend the 102nd constitutional amendment Act to overturn the May 5 Supreme Court judgment and restore the rights of states to identify the OBCs for the ‚Äústate list‚Äù of castes eligible for Mandal reservations in education and employment under state governments. Well placed sources said the social justice ministry has moved the Cabinet note. The swift move implies that the bill can be brought in the ongoing monsoon session itself. If so, it could be part of a strategy to break the blockade of Parliament proceedings by the opposition over the Pegasus snooping scandal. Given the sensitivity of the issue and the rights of states involved, neither Congress nor regional parties can afford to block the bill. It may thus restore normalcy in the Parliament. However, the larger political aim of the Centre is to assure OBCs that their rights, as under state lists, were not being undermined. The move comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi placed emphasis on the OBC representation in the recent Cabinet reshuffle along with women, SCs and STs. It is learnt that the proposal has suggested specific changes to be made to the Act to clarify that state lists and central list of OBCs are separate and under the jurisdiction of respective governments ‚Äî as had been the case before the SC judgment. The apex court also rejected a government appeal against the order earlier in July. While upholding the said Act (102nd) in the Maratha reservation case, the SC held that its provisions implied that OBCs for states and Central lists both were to be identified by the President (Centre) on the recommendations of the national commission for backward classes. The order triggered an uproar from regional parties and OBC advocacy groups as state lists have been the mandate of states since the Mandal quotas were instituted. There Is a fear that since the NCBC is a central body packed with political appointees, The ruling party at the Centre may identify the backward castes both for central and state lists. Sources said the said amendment proposed will also clarify the SC ruling on ‚Äúsingle list‚Äú ‚Äì mentioned by three of the judges and which has been interpreted as Ordering that both the central and state lists be merged to form a single consolidated list. It is also seen as a problematic issue which needs to be reversed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-seeks-to-tweak-law-on-states-obc-lists/articleshow/84663263.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Ahmadzai will reach India on July 27. The reference to the SPA is significant against the backdrop of speculation that Afghanistan may ask for military assistance from India. The agreement says: ‚ÄúIndia agrees to assist in the training, equipping and capacity building programmes for Afghan National Security Forces.‚Äù In other words, India would, if asked, continue ‚Äî or even enhance ‚Äî the military support it has provided to Afghanistan. Thus far, India has given four Mi-35 attack helicopters to Afghanistan; four MI-35s repaired and refurbished by Belarus, and three Cheetah helicopters. At this point, when the future course of the battle between the ANDSF and Taliban will depend on who provides superior airpower, Afghanistan is looking for all the help it can get. India‚Äôs ability to help in ramping up Afghan air capacity is limited. ‚ÄúShould we not get to a stage in the peace process with the Taliban, then maybe a time (will come) where we would be seeking India‚Äôs military assistance,‚Äù Farid Mamundzay, Afghanistan‚Äôs ambassador to India, recently told NDTV.

---||Business||‚ÄòReforms galore since ‚Äô91, but execution weak‚Äô||Bimal Jalan, a former Reserve Bank of India governor and ex-finance secretary, has been a key player in reforms unveiled over the years. A veteran policymaker, Jalan says in an interview with TOI that India has introduced enough reforms, and now the focus should be on implementation on the ground. Excerpts: What is your assessment of the economic reforms undertaken 30 years ago? They have worked out very well. There were several steps to make the economy more open and that helped. There is no doubt the 1991 liberalisation was extremely positive. The 1990 crisis with India‚Äôs balance of payments made it absolutely necessary to liberalise. Otherwise, it was the old mindset, everything was controlled. What do you think worked in getting politicians and policymakers to arrive at a consensus? Before 1991, the total foreign exchange reserves were very small. To increase the reserves, India arranged a loan from the IMF. After that, the economy started functioning. After 1991, India started a huge liberalisation and it worked out. It had the complete support of politicians. Then PM Narasimha Rao, and later Atal Bihari Vajpayee, completely reformed the economy. Was there any opposition to the reforms at the time? The opposition to these reforms must have been from the corporate sector. There was a limited number of corporates who could not withstand competition. When there is competition, there is always that problem. In the 1970s and 1980s, the system was of Licence Permit Raj, and competition was highly limited. How do you see the next 30 years of reforms, given that Covid has hurt growth? There have been a lot of reforms now. There is no doubt about it. The only question is implementation. There are many things that we announce, but the implementation is very weak. About 80% of government expenditure is on the administrative setup. We have so many ministries and all of them would have a large staff who have to be paid their salaries. So, the amount of money that you can invest to help below-poverty line people would be much less. This is simply because the number of ministries have increased, the amount of administrative staff has also increased. So, expenditure reforms should be the focus? Yes, it should be the focus, and how it is actually done when the fiscal deficit is high. In terms of expenditure, India has to spend money but the fiscal deficit should not be very high. If it is high, there is inflation. When inflation is high, the RBI has to take measures to reduce money supply. There is an argument that we should let go of this fear of fiscal deficit and spend to get out of the slowdown... There can‚Äôt be two views on this. What is the impact of the fiscal deficit? Fiscal deficit is the demand side, and when rupees are spent, the demand for products increases and prices rise. We have to make sure that the fiscal deficit is not beyond what we can manage. India‚Äôs debt-to-GDP ratio is already high. Now, suppose it exceeds, what does it mean? It means that we have to finance debt much more than what can be done in terms of investments. Do you think the constituency for reforms has expanded over the years, given the benefits we have seen? There is no doubt about that. Now, there is a large premium also. Governments should make policies, but the execution should be left to private and public sectors. There is also a lot of discussion about the public sector, and the government has brought about certain reforms, for example, through disinvestment. The privatisation of the public sector is also a very good move. The policy framework is extremely positive, and the only question is the administrative part of it. Apart from expenditure reforms, what are the others that are crucial for the years ahead? What is important is what is actually happening on the ground. In terms of policy reforms, we‚Äôve done enough. The Prime Minister and finance minister have announced important policies, however, implementation has to be better.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/reforms-galore-since-91-but-execution-weak/articleshow/84662885.cms||Surojit Gupta

Brands were better placed in the quarter in terms of supply chain when compared to the first wave, and online channels contributed to the growth in the period, analysts said. Tech research firm Canalys pegged the fall in shipments during the quarter ended June at 13% sequentially to 32.4 million units adding that year-on-year it was up 87%. Brands that succeeded in the online space were able to carry the most momentum, Canalys noted. Xiaomi emerged as the market leader in the quarter, followed by Samsung in second place and Vivo coming in third, as per Canalys. ‚ÄúFor smartphone vendors, this [second wave] was a wake-up call, and shows the importance of bolstering both online and offline presences equally,‚Äù Canalys analyst Sanyam Chaurasia, said. Signs of recovery emerged by the end of the quarter as consumer confidence was boosted by vaccination programs, he added.International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates that the second quarter is likely to see a drop of 10-13% compared to Jan-March that registered 38 million in shipments. ‚ÄúYear-on-year basis, the quarter is expected to see over 80% growth, and online channel is expected to be major growth driver as it continues to entice cautious consumers with better offers, availability, financing, and trade-in programs,‚Äù Upasana Joshi, associate research manager, IDC India, said.Tarun Pathak, research director, Counterpoint Research, said that though the sector has been resilient to Covid, there is added pressure of component shortage globally and India is not immune to that. ‚ÄúThe contribution of online sales is likely to cross 50% in April-June up from 42% in Jan-March, and 5G is estimated to contribute 15% of the shipments up from 7%,‚Äù he said. Market tracker CyberMedia Research (CMR) estimates a 15-18% dip in shipments on a QoQ basis and a 69% growth year-on-year. ‚ÄúWe see potential for the market to be back on track in the second half of 2021 driven by strong retail push by smartphone brands and earlier-than-usual festive sales. However, the consumer demand may not be at the same levels like the year before,‚Äù Shipra Sinha, analyst at CMR, said. Canalys‚Äô Chaurasia said that going forward, the component shortage brings the risk of ‚Äúregional de-prioritization,‚Äù as brands look to allocate their limited supplies of devices to more lucrative markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/smartphone-shipments-in-apr-june-dip-on-qoq-basis/articleshow/84659240.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Besides, investments worth Rs 914 crore have been grounded with direct employment of 2,325 workers during this period. Deliberations in this regard were held at the second meeting of Bihar Investment Promotion Committee (BIPC) in Mumbai on Thursday. The meeting was chaired by state investment commissioner R S Srivastav. At the onset, Kavita Kumari, under-secretary (industries) and member secretary of BIPC, welcomed all members to the meeting and thanked them for their continued support towards driving investment and industrialisation in the state. Apart from enumerating aforementioned investment details, Kavita said, ‚ÄúThe state has performed exceedingly well in the Investment Promotion Agencies (IPA) rankings released in December, 2020, scoring 91% and 86% in investment strategy and investment targeting categories, respectively. The overall score of the state was 74% and it was declared a ‚Äòpromising developer‚Äô.‚Äù The members congratulated the investment commissioner on consistently attracting new investments even during the Covid-induced lockdowns and for good overall performance of the state in investment promotion activities. Mayur Bansal, member, BIPC, recommended further awareness about the stable political and labour scenario in the state among large investors, especially in south India. Nimesh Kampani, special adviser and chairman of JM Financial Ltd, suggested targeting of select large investors across key sectors. The investment commissioner agreed to the points and said his office would act promptly. P K Agrawal, chairman of Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries, suggested that validity period of industrial and trade licences be increased to 10 years, the credit-deposit ratio of banks in Bihar be increased and guidelines for opening of current accounts, overdrafts, credit cards and term loans be made MSME-friendly. A sub-committee was formed under the leadership of Agrawal to take up the matter further with banks and RBI.

At the same time, the candidates will not be allowed to use flags of any political party during campaigning. The guidelines issued by the SEC for the upcoming election to three-tier panchayati raj institutions said such practices would be construed as violation of the model code of conduct and invite suitable action. The panchayat polls in the state are not contested on the party lines. The SEC has also asked the contestants to duly inform the authorities concerned about street plays performed by artists in favour of candidates. ‚ÄúStaging dharna or shouting slogans in front of the houses of candidates following statements against their opponents in the fray will also come under purview of violation of model code of conduct,‚Äù a senior SEC officer said. Meanwhile, the SEC has asked all the DMs to complete the first-level checking of EVMs by August 20 and rectify the technical snag, if any. Over 1.20 lakh EVMs will be required for the election likely to be held in 10 phases. In each phase, polling will be held at 15,000 polling booths under two blocks in each district. A senior SEC officer said a proposal would be sent to the panchayati raj department to announce the poll schedule. The department will announce the same after getting state cabinet‚Äôs nod. The schedule for the election to elect over 2.59 lakh representatives is likely to be announced by August-end. The election on the two posts of gram kuchhary ‚Äì panch and sarpanch ‚Äì will be conducted through ballot papers. EVMs will be used to elect representatives on the four posts of mukhiya, ward member, panchayat samiti member and the district board member. The EVMs are being used for panchayat election for the first time in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/panchayat-polls-dms-asked-to-check-evms-by-august-20/articleshow/84656472.cms||Ramashankar

The move could pave the way for a merger of the bank with its parent. Shares of IDFC were up 12% at Rs 59 in the stock exchange while IDFC First Bank also rose nearly 2%. While granting the erstwhile infrastructure financier a bank licence in 2014, the RBI had required businesses that were not compatible with the banking licence to be housed under a holding company that will also own the bank. ‚ÄúWe would like to inform you that the RBI has vide its letter dated July 20, 2021, clarified that after the expiry of a lock-in period of 5 years, IDFC can exit as promoter of IDFC First Bank,‚Äù the company said in a notice to the exchange. Last month the RBI allowed small finance banks to merge with their promoter entities on completing five years of operations. This resulted in Equitas holding and Ujjivan Financial to announce that they would initiate process for amalgamation process with their promoter entities. According to an analyst the requirement of a holding company seems to be there only as long as there is an identifiable promoter and once the bank turns into a professionally managed entity the requirement will be eased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idfc-first-bank-may-merge-with-its-parent-firm/articleshow/84662789.cms||‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º ‡§®‡•á‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï

The residents of the village were at their wit‚Äôs end when Shivni Yadav (90) breathed his last late Tuesday night. The next morning, the family members started searching dry land in nearby villages on country boats to cremate the body, but in vain. The spot used as ‚Äòshamshan ghat‚Äô was under waist to neck-deep water. Somebody suggested the family to throw the body into the floodwaters, which was opposed by the latter. Finally, they devised a novel way to perform the last rites as per Hindu rituals. The villagers erected a ‚Äòmachan‚Äô with the help of bamboo sticks, placed the body in a ‚Äòkothi‚Äô made of mud, used dry timber and lit the pyre. Ram Pratap Yadav (36), son of the dead man, said he made three rounds of the pyre on a country boat amid chanting of mantras by a local priest. People on six country boats attended the funeral procession and a separate boat carried the body. ‚ÄúDeath during the monsoon months at the village means torture to the bodies,‚Äù said Dilip Yadav, a local. Shivakant Thakur, a local priest, said burning the bodies is the best form of their disposal as per Hindu belief. A former mukhiya, Pramod Chaudhary, said villages under Kusheshwarsthan block remain inundated with floodwaters for nearly six months a year. Famous for its Shiva temple, Kusheshwarsthan is nearly 60km from the district headquarters. Former circle officer of Kusheshwarsthan block, Triveni Prasad, said he was not aware of the cremation, but admitted that people face difficulties in disposing of the bodies when floodwaters inundate the villages. Darbhanga DM Thiyagrajan SM could be contacted despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-dry-land-to-cremate-bodies-at-this-flooded-darbhanga-village/articleshow/84656831.cms||Ramashankar

People used to say that their patients may not survive if oxygen is not made available in half an hour or so. We all saw that situation. But if the Parliament is being told that no death occurred due to lack of oxygen, it is shocking. It must be troubling for the people who lost their relatives. There may be some technical glitches, but I am hopeful that if a reply is submitted in the Parliament, it is done after thorough scrutiny and with utmost seriousness,‚Äù Chirag told reporters at Patna airport. Chirag also took a dig at CM Nitish Kumar, saying, ‚ÄúThe CM goes on aerial surveys on helicopters whenever there is flood in Bihar. He does it every year. I don‚Äôt remember the last time he went by road to take stock of the situation. If he goes even once by road, he will know the actual situation in flood-affected areas.

The two constables had allegedly beaten up the MLAs. IG of central range, Patna, issued the suspension order on Thursday. Sinha said the additional chief secretary of the state home department and DGP were asked on March 23 to probe the rude and rough behaviour of the constables and also take necessary action against them. On March 23, the state assembly had witnessed an unprecedented incident when the police used force on opposition MLAs who were protesting against the passage of the Bihar Armed Police Bill, 2021. The MLAs had also gheraoed the Speaker in his official chamber. The Speaker, while talking to media persons on Thursday a couple of days before the start of the five-day monsoon session of the state legislature from July 26, said the Aachaar Samiti of the assembly was also asked to look into the undignified behaviour on the part of the MLAs against the Speaker during the passage of the Bill. ‚ÄúThe report of the Aachaar Samiti and its recommendations are awaited. Once it is submitted, the next step will be taken with regard to the erring MLAs,‚Äù the Speaker said. ‚ÄúThe rude and undignified behaviour of policemen with the elected representatives will not be tolerated,‚Äù Sinha said, adding such a behaviour tarnishes the image of both the executive and the legislature. On March 23, a constable was seen beating an MLA outside his chamber. Another MLA was beaten outside the portico of the assembly building. The Speaker said police personnel at every level should refrain from indulging in rude and undignified behaviour with the MLAs, since they are elected representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-constables-suspended-for-march-23-assault-on-bihar-legislators/articleshow/84657726.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: First vaccine dose should be given priority, says Dr Subhash Salunkhe||AURANGABAD: State advisor on Covid-19 Dr Subhash Salunkhe on Thursday said the current vaccination policy that is giving priority to second dose needs to be reviewed with focus on covering the working population and younger age groups who are still awaiting for the first dose. Stating that he is of the view that the first dose should also get prioritized by keeping aside some percentage of vaccines, Salunkhe told ToI necessary feedback would be communicated to the state government. ‚ÄúWe cannot afford any health risk to the working population as it could have a cascading impact on the economy and overall growth. On the other hand, the younger population, if it gets infected, can act as a carrier of the virus,‚Äù he said, adding the state was well short of vaccination supply. Amid acute vaccine shortage and also difference of opinion over the time interval between two doses of Covishield, different health experts have demanded that those still awaiting the first dose of the vaccine shoudl be immunized on priority. Citing the possibility of the third wave of the pandemic, Dr Santosh Ranjalkar, president of Aurangabad chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said the first dose can give at least some sort of protection to vulnerable groups. ‚ÄúIt is scientifically proven that even the first dose of vaccine can develop sufficient number of antibodies. It will be best in the interest of the society if we focus on the first dose without limiting the vaccination to the second dose during the current shortage of doses,‚Äù he said. Health experts have also projected the example of Telangana, which has increased the time interval between two doses of Covishield to 14-16 weeks from the recommended 12-16 weeks, to vaccinate a maximum number of people with the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/first-vaccine-dose-should-be-given-priority-salunkhe/articleshow/84654851.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Ahmedabad||13 out of every 1,000 Gujarat Covid patients had mucormycosis||AHMEDABAD: The mucormycosis outbreak during the second wave still gives nightmares to many. Data tabled in Rajya Sabha on July 20 revealed that India recorded 45,374 cases of Covid-19-mucormycosis infection, of which 35% were recorded from Maharashtra (9,348) and Gujarat (6,731) alone. Gujarat had the second highest mortality at 656 patients after Maharashtra (1,129), accounting for 15% of India‚Äôs total deaths. Analysis of the Covid-19 cases vis-√†-vis MM cases, however, revealed Gujarat recorded higher prevalence of ‚Äòblack fungus.‚Äô According to state government figures, Gujarat recorded 5.15 lakh Covid-19 cases between April 1 and June 30 ‚Äì meaning 13 out of every 1,000 Covid-19 patients got the infection (1.3% of Covid patients got MM). The number is much higher compared to Maharashtra which had a prevalence of 0.3% (3 in 1,000 cases), and national average of 0.2% (2 in 1,000 cases). Dr Rajesh Vishwakarma, a senior city-based ENT surgeon, said multiple factors were responsible. ‚ÄúGujarat is long considered the diabetes capital of India, and it was found to be a major comorbidity among Covid-19 patients. The low immunity of the Covid-recovered patients gave way for proliferation of the fungus. Further study of MM patients from Gujarat may give some insight into why it was reported more from two neighbouring states,‚Äù he said. Dr Atul Patel, infectious diseases specialist and member of Gujarat Covid-19 task force, said ongoing study of MM in Covid-19 patients points out that environmental factors could have played a larger-than-acknowledged role. There is a distinct possibility that environmental factors like high presence of fungal spores in Gujarat and Maharashtra during that time led to greater manifestation. In fact, a recent Canadian study on swine flu-aspergillus fungus connection demonstrated how incidence of fungal infection in lungs was higher during certain years than the rest and pointed at at environmental factors,‚Äù said Dr Atul Patel, infectious diseases specialist and member of Gujarat Covid-19 task force. State-based doctors also said that Gujarat reported higher numbers compared to other states where several patients did not go to a formal hospital setting for the infection. ‚ÄúAbout 99.9% of the MM cases had a history of Covid-19. The general profile of patients was that they were middle-aged and had one or more comorbidities,‚Äù said Dr Devang Gupta, an ENT surgeon with Civil Hospital. ‚ÄúSeverity of Covid-19 had no correlation with the MM cases ‚Äì in some cases, we even saw MM infection a couple of months after mild Covid.‚Äù The RS data shows that Gujarat had a 9.7% mortality rate in MM, compared to the national average of 9.5%, whereas the recovery rate for the state was 68%. While the data did not mention a time range, it showed 800 active cases, which is lower than 100 as on Thursday morning, said state health department officials. Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, has the highest number of MM cases in Gujarat, with 20 active patients. ‚ÄúWe are however getting at least one case every day, primarily for re-surgery from Gujarat, Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra,‚Äù said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/13-out-of-every-1k-covid-patients-in-guj-got-black-fungus-infection/articleshow/84659619.cms||Parth Shastri

As per the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), which is appointed as the general consultant of Patna metro project, the L&T has emerged as the lowest bidder in the financial bid for Corridor II, which is 14.5km-long from Patna Junction to new ISBT. Four companies had participated in the financial bid. The 7.9km-long underground stretch will have stations at Rajendra Nagar, Moin-Ul-Haq Stadium, Patna University, PMCH, Gandhi Maidan and Akashvani with entry/exits and connecting subway, including architectural finishing, water supply, sanitary installation and drainage works. The firm will design and construct twin tunnel, underground ramp and stations by utilising Rs 1,958 crore in 42 months. A state urban development and housing department official said the underground ramp (ascending ramp) will create a link between Rajendra Nagar and Malahi Pakri stations. ‚ÄúThe ramp will take metro from underground section of Corridor II to elevated stretch. As per the DPR, the elevated stretch is around 6.6km from Malahi Pakri to Patliputra bus terminal or ISBT.‚Äù The Corridor II underground twin tunnel network includes two metro rail tunnels‚Äô lines ‚Äì one north-bound and one south-bound. It will be constructed through tunnel boring machine and tunnel by cut and cover technology. The DMRC is yet to share the details of the bidding with the officials of Patna Metro Rail Corporation.

---||Business||It‚Äôs time for digital currency to counter crypto, says RBI||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that it is working towards a phased implementation strategy for its digital currency and examining use cases where it can be deployed with little disruption. Making a strong argument in favour of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for India, the RBI has said that it would reduce currency costs for the government and would help offset the threat of virtual currencies. ‚ÄúDeveloping our own CBDC could provide the public with uses that any private virtual currency can provide and to that extent might retain the public preference for the rupee. It could also protect the public from the abnormal level of volatility some of these virtual currencies experience,‚Äù RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar said on Thursday at a webinar organised by the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy. Sankar added that conducting pilots on CBDC in wholesale and retail segments may be a possibility in the near future. ‚ÄúAs is said, every idea will have to wait for its time. Perhaps the time for CBDCs is nigh,‚Äù he said. On the consequences of digital currencies on banks, Sankar said that while it could reduce the need for maintaining deposits, the impact would be limited as they cannot pay interest. ‚ÄúThus, potential costs of disintermediation mean it is important to design and implement CBDC in a way that makes the demand for CBDC, vis-a-vis bank deposits, manageable,‚Äù said Sankar. The key issues examined by the RBI include whether these should be used in retail payments or also in wholesale payments, whether it should be a distributed ledger or a centralised ledger, whether it should be token-based or account-based, whether it should be directly issuance by the RBI or through banks and the degree of anonymity. In a strong attack against virtual currencies (cryptocurrencies), Sankar said, ‚ÄúPrivate virtual currencies sit at substantial odds to the historical concept of money. They are not commodities or claims on commodities as they have no intrinsic value, some claims that they are akin to gold clearly seem opportunistic. For the most popular ones now, they do not represent any person‚Äôs debt or liabilities. There is no issuer. They are not money.‚Äù The deputy governor said 86% of central banks were actively researching the potential for virtual currencies and 60% were already experimenting with the technology, and 14% are deploying pilot projects. He said that interest had spiked to replace paper and avoid the more damaging consequences of private currencies. The deputy governor‚Äôs statement comes at a time when the RBI has been forced by a Supreme Court order to withdraw a ban on bank services to cryptocurrencies. Although the RBI has earlier spoken about plans to launch a digital currency, this is the first time that the central bank has gone into so much detail. Central banks across the world have drawn up plans to launch their digital currency to battle cryptocurrencies. China has said that its e-CNY has been tested in 70 million transactions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/its-time-for-digital-currency-to-counter-crypto-says-rbi/articleshow/84662839.cms||---

An MoU has been signed between the department of tourism and the French Consulate in Kolkata with an objective to revive colonial heritage tourism in Chandernagore. A former French court house, the Registry Building is one of the 99 heritage structures in Chandernagore which represent a unique blend of Indo-French architectural patterns. However, it is now in ruins. The Bengal government, in consultation with the French government, has decided to put it to adaptive reuse. According to the proposed plan, the hotel will include a French library, a cultural centre and a heritage trail through the Ganges. The state has aimed at completing the restoration within 18 months and at an estimated cost of Rs 3 crore. While the implementation of the project will be carried out by the Chandernagore Municipal Corporation, it will involve active participation of local residents. ‚ÄúThe common people of the area will play a very important role in implementing the plan,‚Äù said Virginie Corteval, Consulate General of France in Kolkata. With an objective of treasuring the colonial legacy, the state is keen on extending the restoration project to other heritage buildings in Bengal. ‚ÄúOur primary objective is to treasure Bengal‚Äôs rich colonial history through restoration of existing colonial architectures,‚Äù said Nandini Chakravorty, principal secretary, department of tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restoration-to-breathe-life-into-french-legacy/articleshow/84657378.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar govt launches e-portal for convenience of private schools||PATNA: State education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Thursday launched e-Sambandhan, a web portal to provide no-objection certificate (NOC) to private elementary schools (classes I to VIII) as well as secondary schools which want to get affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) or Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE). Addressing the media persons, the minister said the online facility has been developed with an aim to provide hassle-free solution to the private schools in Bihar. ‚ÄúIt will simplify the process and bring transparency. Private schools, even from far-flung areas, will no longer have to run from pillar to post to get NOC certificate and affiliation. The step will also ease the process of getting grants and aides under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act 2009,‚Äù Choudhary said. He added getting NOC was a time-consuming procedure earlier and school officials had to run from one office to another for it. Explaining the procedure, Choudhary said the schools have to apply online on edu-online.bihar.gov.in for the certificate, following which they will be inspected on various parameters, including affiliation by-laws of CBSE and ICSE, such as student- teacher ratio, number of classrooms, and other infrastructural amenities. ‚ÄúBased on the inspection, the certificate will be issued by the department. It is advisable for the schools to check the criteria and bylaws before filling the form,‚Äù he said. Choudhary said the department will also expedite the scrutiny of applications and required documents for NOC in minimum possible time. ‚ÄúIn this way, the state government will be able to keep a track on private schools, number of kids studying in these schools and kids getting benefit under the RTE Act,‚Äù he said. The minister said under Section 18 of the RTE Act 2019 and Rule 11 of the Bihar State Free and Compulsory Education of Children Rules, 2011, all private elementary schools in the state have to admit 25% kids from weaker section. The approval of elementary schools will be given according to the criteria set by the three-member committee constituted at the district levels. Additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar, director of primary education Ranjit Kumar Singh and other officials were also present at the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-launches-e-portal-for-convenience-of-private-schools/articleshow/84654499.cms||Faryal Rumi

The single bench had originally been hearing the case which was later transferred to a division bench. The lawyers had urged the Calcutta HC Bar Association for a meeting on this on Thursday, but the Bar refused. The issue related to a recent HC single-bench order on disruptions of internet services which was affecting virtual hearings.

He not only posted eight pornographic images and a message in the same group but also created another WhatsApp group of teachers and students and uploaded objectionable content on it. In the message, he targeted Abhinav Kumar Srivastava, a BA (Semester 6) student who had earlier reported the matter to LU authorities on Twitter and had requested the authorities to take action against the culprit. He also mentioned the names of a few girls and a faculty member in the message. After the first incident, students had left the group to register their protest against delay in action by LU authorities and lodged a complaint on Twitter tagging university officials and UP police. Head of the department, Prof Piyush Bhargava, lodged a complaint with the proctor‚Äôs office after which a case was registered. ‚ÄúThe culprit targeted me as I had lodged a complaint with the authorities. It‚Äôs shocking that he has so much of audacity to repeat the crime even when an FIR has already been lodged against him,‚Äù Abhinav said. ‚ÄúI had left the group on the day of the incident. At least 70 students are still in the group. Some of my friends alerted me about the incident and shared the screenshot. The obscene content was uploaded at 1.13am,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúFiling an FIR is not enough. The proctor‚Äôs office is neither investigating the matter nor recording the statements of students or teachers. After the incident, no safety guidelines for the use of online platform for teaching were released by the authorities,‚Äù said Shivangi Singh, a student of BA. Another student, Ayush, said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any student body to listen to our complaints. LU‚Äôs meritorious council made for the purpose is defunct and teachers and authorities are not taking the matter seriously. If this continues, we will be forced to stage a protest on the campus.‚Äù SHO, Hasanganj, Yashkant Singh said the cyber cell was tracking the number. ‚ÄúIf LU files a complaint about the second incident, one more FIR will be lodged on the same matter,‚Äù he added. Chief proctor Dinesh Kumar said, ‚ÄúThe proctor‚Äôs office tried to trace the number. We have scanned all examination forms and admission forms but the number being used in the crime is nowhere in our records.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have personally talked to a dozen students who are active in the group to get a lead. The department‚Äôs head, Piyush Bhargava, has also been asked to share every minute detail and data about students,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSince this is the second such incident, we have informed the investigating police officer and have sent a written complaint to him. The biggest challenge we are facing is to track the number as we don‚Äôt have the required software and cyber experts,‚Äù Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/criminal-strikes-again-as-lu-police-grope-for-clues/articleshow/84662090.cms||---

The decision was taken after a major row erupted when it came to light that the plots were being used for purposes other than plantations.The plots were awarded by the civic body to various organizations including those led by politicians. It transpired that at most of these plots there was no afforestation in true sense. A few saplings were planted while the remaining portion of the plots was being put to some other use.A series of controversies erupted as it came to light that politicians, including those in top positions, were linked to some organizations that had secured the plots but hardly took a step towards adding to the city‚Äôs greenery. When the ruling BJP found its members being targeted, it started looking into the affairs of plots allocated to Congress members.However, Mayor Keyur Rokadia, on Thursday morning, announced that the VMC was taking back all the 46 plots that were allotted for afforestation. ‚ÄúA resolution was passed in 1991 to give plots under this arrangement. But in the wake of the controversy, we have decided to take back all the plots,‚Äù said Rokadia.Rokadia said that the plots were allotted to different organizations only till 2019. ‚ÄúSome of these plots were also given to senior citizens and women organizations that did goo work. We thanked them for their contribution, but expressed our inability to continue with the arrangement,‚Äù he said.Leader of the Congress party in VMC Ami Ravat said that the party had been demanding action on the issue. ‚ÄúMere notices were issued and no action was taken. We demand that instead of merely taking away plots, action should be taken against those who violated conditions and all the structures developed on these plots should be razed,‚Äù she said.Ravat added that the VMC should consider alternative arrangements for organizations that added to the city‚Äôs green cover by undertaking plantations at the plots. ‚ÄúThese plots are meant for afforestation and should be put to no other use. Other spaces should be allocated to organizations doing good work,‚Äù she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmc-takes-back-46-plots-it-had-given-for-afforestation/articleshow/84654926.cms||---

Over 700 had to be evacuated in the Konkan belt as incessant rains since Wednesday led to rivers breaching the danger mark. Multi-agency rescue operations are underway in districts like Raigad, Ratnagiri, Palghar, Thane in the Konkan and in Satara, Sangli Kolhapur in western Maharashtra. CM Uddhav Thackeray chaired an emergency meeting to review the flood situation in the Konkan districts and directed the administration to be on alert and evacuate people staying near rivers where the water levels are rising. PM Narendra Modi spoke to Thackeray on the phone in the evening and assured assistance with rescue. So far, NDRF, SDRF, local agencies, navy, coast guard and the air force have been pressed into rescue. As many as 17 teams of NDRF are active, but the state has sought another 5-6 teams. In the last seven days, around 40 people have died and 15 were injured in rain-related incidents in Konkan. Rainfall rising into triple digits lashed at least 59 locations in Maharashtra till Thursday morning and showers continuedamid reports of landslides, localised flooding and widespread damage to crops. For instance, Nashik district got 935.1mm rainfall, with the three talukas of Igatpuri, Peth and Trimbakeshwar accounting for over 700mm. Several low-lying areas in Nashik city were inundated. In Palghar, four people died on Thursday. In the first case, Darshana Dhutkar, 50, was wading home in Manor at around 1.30am with her son when she lost balance and was swept away. In Dhumalpada village of Vikramgad, Rama Thakre, 52, was also swept away. In Maswan, Gautam Dhanwa, 18, was electrocuted while walking home and Abhijit Tamore, 21, died during crab fishing with others when their boat capsized in the creek at Dandi in Tarapur. In adjoining Raigad district, a 50-year-old man fell from the roof of a building in Mahad and died, while a father-daughter duo from Karjat is missing after being swept away by Ulhas waters. Over 400 people were evacuated as water entered houses in Mahad, Khalapur and Karjat. A landslide was reported at Talai village of Mahad taluka late on Thursday, raising fears of casualties. Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhary said a rescue team had not been able to reach till the time of going to press. Besides Raigad, Ratnagiri was the worst affected. Three persons died in a landslide and over 250 were evacuated after the Vashishti river swelled. The district got 200mm rain in the last 24 hours. The worst-hit were Chiplun and Khed towns, with near 5-6 feet water in parts of Chiplun affecting about 5,000 people, said Ratnagiri collector Dr B N Patil. Traffic on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway was hit due to flooding in Manor. Landslides blocked traffic between Nashik and Mokhada. Parts of the Mumbai-Goa highway were shut as water was flowing over it. The Panchaganga river in Kolhapur crossed the warning level of 39feet on Thursday. An alert has been sounded in villages along the banks of the Krishna in Satara and Sangli districts as discharge from the upstream Koyna dam may be increased from Friday.

---||Patna||BJP asks its Bihar MPs to promote central schemes||PATNA: The BJP has decided to rope in its Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs from Bihar to counter the opposition attacks in the state and also launch a publicity binge in favour of the central government, besides seeking their active support to the party‚Äôs national programmes. While this is being done as part of the BJP‚Äôs pan-India exercise, the Bihar Lok Sabha MPs and Rajya Sabha members got together on Thursday in New Delhi for an address by the party‚Äôs national general secretary (organisation) B L Santosh. State BJP president and West Champaran MP Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, state general secretary (organisation) Nagendra and other functionaries also participated in the meeting. The BJP has 17 Lok Sabha MPs in Bihar and also five Rajya Sabha members ‚Äì Gopal Narain singh, Satish Chandra Dubey, Vivek Thakur, Rakesh Sinha and Sushil Kumar Modi. ‚ÄúThe meeting of the MPs from Bihar was held on the sidelines of the monsoon session of the Parliament. This is a normal exercise. The aim is to have better coordination among the organization, government and elected public representatives,‚Äù state BJP spokesman Prem Ranjan Patel said. ‚ÄúThe MPs have to lend their support to the party‚Äôs national programmes and highlight the pro-poor and other policies of the central government. They also have to reach out to people to inform them about such policies, besides helping in monitoring of the central schemes and projects to the benefit of people,‚Äù Patel added. Among the party‚Äôs national programmes are training of the office-bearers and others at the national, state and district levels, as well as strengthening of the organization wherever it is weak. While Patel reiterated that the decision to rope in the MPs is normal exercise, it has gained added significance in view of the fact that the opposition parties have got activated on various issues. To add to that, in Bihar, policy differences have surfaced between the BJP and JD(U) within the state NDA on certain issues, like the need for population control law and caste-based Census. While the BJP has pitched for population control by force of law, the JD(U) has been insisting on mass education of women for reducing the fertility rate for more effective population control. Further, the BJP has favoured caste census of only the scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) groups, but the JD(U) has come on the same page with the opposition parties like the RJD in demanding the general caste-based census. However, what concerns the national BJP most is that the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre has been facing a storm of criticism and protests from the opposition parties on various counts on a host of issues, including the ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù of Pegasus spyware, price rise and the demands of agitating farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-asks-its-bihar-mps-to-promote-central-schemes/articleshow/84656561.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh cabinet approves 58,000 jobs in gram panchayats||LUCKNOW: A strong push on public welfare ahead of the upcoming assembly elections was evident in the slew of proposals cleared by the UP Cabinet on Wednesday, from creating employment to extending reach of health insurance benefits, employment for differently abled and benefits to farmers. In a major decision which will see over 58,000 jobs being created, the cabinet gave nod to appointment of a panchayat assistant and accountant-cum-data entry operator and construction of a panchayat office or rural secretariat for each panchayat in the state. There are 58,189 gram panchayats in the state, many of which were without even basic office till now even though they are responsible for implementing some of the most important government schemes. The assistants and accountants will be paid a salary of Rs 6,000 per month. Currently, there are 16,000 sanctioned posts of gram panchayat officers and gram development officers against which only 10,000 are employed. Similarly, there are 33,577 gram panchayat bhawans on ground, while 24,617 are under-construction. These buildings will be repaired for which approximately Rs 1.75 lakh will be allocated. A jan seva centre will be set up in each panchayat office and separate space would be allocated for banking correspondent sakhi. In another important decision, the Cabinet approved the proposal to cancel a government order of 2011 for a 3% disability reservation in government departments and replaced it with a new order under which recruitment for disabled persons will be done directly by each department for group A, B, C and D services. The recruitment will be done as per a 2016 order in which the earlier seven categories of disability had been expanded to include 21 others and reservation was extended from 3% to 4%. Government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said chief minister Yogi Adityanath had constituted a committee in 2019 which asked all 68 departments to assess how many posts in each of the four categories should be reserved for persons with disabilities. ‚ÄúThe report has been submitted and it has been decided that direct recruitment will take place in each department for each of the four categories,‚Äù he said. The cabinet also approved a limit of Rs 800 crore as guarantee for loans provided to rural cooperative development banks by the National Bank for Rural Development between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022. The registrars of cooperative committees have been allowed to provide loans up to Rs 400 crore. The initiative is being seen as the government‚Äôs move for helping farmers financially in the run up to assembly elections. The Cabinet also approved the proposal to hire teachers on a temporary basis for non-government aided Sanskrit secondary schools and state Sanskrit colleges for the session of 2021-22 and 2022-23, or till the appointment of regular staff, whichever is earlier, to address the problem of teachers‚Äô shortage. A selection committee, headed by the principals of these schools and colleges, has been set up at the district level. These teachers will be paid Rs 12,000 per month. In another social welfare-oriented move, around 40 lakh Antyodaya card holders, who are not beneficiaries under either the PM or CM Jan Arogya Yojana, will now be included in the CM Jan Arogya Scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/welfare-push-cabinet-approves-58000-jobs-in-gram-panchayats/articleshow/84662123.cms||---

After eight months at three Delhi borders ‚Äî Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri ‚Äî they gathered near the Parliament, where the Monsoon session is on, demanding that the new farm laws be scrapped. One of those actively involved with the protests in Delhi is sugarcane farmer Vijender Singh (name changed on request), 75, from Kanchanpur. His house was among those raided. ‚ÄúThe government does not want farmers to raise their voices. This is an attempt to silence us. What happened today was targeted harassment,‚Äù he told TOI. The power corporation, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (PVVNL), denied any ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù behind the raids. PVVNL senior engineer (rural) AK Singh said, ‚ÄúIt was not planned. It was not a conspiracy. Such raids happen after our local intelligence units tip us off about power theft. In these villages, there are about 700 power connections. And 42 households were found using ‚Äòkatiya‚Äô.

---||Kolhapur||Mahavitaran told to restore power supply of gram panchayats||Kolhapur: The state electricity department has been asked to restore power supply of the gram panchayats after the connections were snapped due to non-payment of dues. Rural development minister Hasan Mushrif, in a statement issued on Thursday, said the gram panchayats can recover the power supply dues from the water and property taxes charged from the villagers. Due to snapping of the power supply, the water supply schemes and street lights have become non-functional. The snapping of power supply has also caused widespread anger among the villagers. To resolve the issue, Mushrif took up the matter with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who is also states finance minister. Later, Pawar convened a meeting on the issue with power supply minister Nitin Raut. Mushrif said, ‚ÄúThe deputy chief minister has asked Mahavitaran to restore the power supply connections of gram panchayats. There were issues regarding differences between gram panchayats and electricity department over the power tariff. The gram panchayats claimed they are being charged exorbitant rates and since they are non-profit oriented and a public service organisation they should be charged at lower rates. The deputy CM has appointed a panel to look into the issue.‚Äù Mushrif said the decision has been taken by his ministry that the power supply bills will be recovered through water supply tax charged to the villagers. ‚ÄúWe will ask the gram panchayats to install solar-based street lights. Also all the water lifting schemes will be powered by solar pumps. The expenditure incurred to set up and maintain the solar street lights and water lifting pumps have to be recovered through the property tax,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mahavitaran-told-to-restore-power-supply-of-gram-panchayats/articleshow/84654891.cms||---

His announcement came during a ceremony to hand over appointment letters to 130 newly inducted excise inspectors. While praising his government‚Äôs initiative in cleaning up the recruitment process and making it transparent, he cautioned the youth against being misled by the ‚Äòvasooli gang‚Äô, which he alleged was becoming active in the state. He added that the government had confiscated property worth over Rs 1,500 crore of such agents who were responsible for harassing job seeking youth in UP. ‚ÄúBefore 2017, jobs were given on the condition of family connections and caste. Meritorious youths had started leaving UP because there were no jobs. In the past four years, the appointment process has been streamlined and there is rule of law in the state now. This has upset certain people who were thriving as agents in the process. The government has put many in jail and confiscated their property,‚Äù the CM said, adding that positive thinking and hard work will help the youth to progress and the government will stand by them through this. The CM said that the excise department has been an important source of revenue generation for the state and the excise inspectors would help the department in controlling the sale and manufacture of illicit liquor and streamline the functioning of the department. Asking the new recruits to remember that the tax paying public is their boss because of whom their salaries are paid, the CM said that they would be expected to perform their duties with as much honesty with which their recruitment had taken place. ‚ÄúYou should not harass any innocent person during the course of your duties. It is our responsibility to work for the welfare of everyone,‚Äù he said. The CM highlighted employment generation under his government, saying that in the past more than four years, 4.25 lakh youth have been given government jobs. Investments made in the state over this period further generated jobs for 1.61 crore youth. An additional 60 lakh youth have been helped in becoming self-employed, he added. Excise minister Ram Naresh Agnihotri said that the excise department has contributed revenue of more than Rs 30,000 crore to the state in the past four years. He added that with help from the department, industrialists have contributed to setting up oxygen plants in various districts since the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-to-give-employment-to-50000-youths-in-up-cm/articleshow/84662148.cms||---

The state government appointed the 2015-batch IAS officer as the Jalgaon ZP CEO, replacing B N Patil, in the first week of July. Prior to this, Ashiya had served as the commissioner of Bhiwandi-Nizampura Municipal Corporation. Talking to TOI, Ashiya said the Covid situation in rural Jalgaon is fully under control. ‚ÄúDifferent agencies in Jalgaon, led by district collector Abhijit Raut, have tamed the virus successfully during the second wave. In most of the talukas, the daily positive cases are in single digits and on some days, some talukas report zero daily positive cases,‚Äù said the new Jalgaon CEO. According to him, the focus of the Jalgaon ZP, currently, on strengthening infrastructure at the 77 PHCs in rural areas so that in case of a third wave, these PHCs will be able to handle the patients who need hospitalisation. ‚ÄúWe are working out the modalities to have at least 10-15 medical oxygen beds in each of the PHCs. Patients who need oxygen support will then not have to travel to the taluka headquarters. In case there is a problem at any PHC, we shall make use of the community hall to treat patients,‚Äù said Ashiya. According to him, the other focus area is vaccination of eligible beneficiaries in rural Jalgaon. In April 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, the state government had deputed Ashiya at Malegaon when the textile town had emerged as the top Covid hotspot in the state and the local civic body had failed to bring the situation under control. At that time, Ashiya was the SDO of Kalwan in Nashik. Ashiya worked overtime to coordinate with various stakeholders in Malegaon to ramp up testing, following the lockdown rules, adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour etc. Within two months, the situation in Malegaon was brought under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pankaj-ashiya-is-new-ceo-of-jalgaon-zp/articleshow/84654921.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The return of heavy rainfall not only doused hopes of farmers who were waiting to salvage their paddy cultivation, but also kept fire department personnel on their toes. The incessant rainfall brought down a 25m long retaining wall at Khadpaband, Ponda. The residents of the housing complex had a narrow escape as nobody was injured in the collapse. In Sattari, authorities have issued a warning to the villages of Sonal, Savorde, Kudshe, Savorshe, Khotode and Ganje after the water level in the Mhadei river crossed the danger mark. The water levels in all the rivers in Bicholim taluka have also risen after Tillari dam authorities discharged water from the reservoir as a precautionary measure. The Tillari river water level rose to to 40.3m just 3m short of the danger level. The Chapora river is also in full spate, flooding the low-lying areas in Sal. The footbridge at Sal was also about to submerge under water creating panic among the villagers. The fire and emergency services department personnel said that they received over 20 calls from across the state, with most of the calls being about trees falling on roads and compound walls. Two trees fell on residential houses, one at Palolem and the other at Avali Cotigao, thus causing damage roughly of about Rs 35,000. According to station fire officer Ravindranath Pednekar, the first incident took place at Palolem, where a mango tree fell on the house of Shekhar Gaitonde, causing him a loss of Rs 10,000. In Mapusa, a tree collapsed on a compound wall of a house. A large portion of the Galgibaga beach in Canacona was eroded and more than 25 casuarina trees fell down due to the heavy rain and strong winds.

The first batch of 10 meritorious, but economically weak students tutored by an RSS-backed institution in Lucknow, is all set to face JEE and NEET for admissions to IITs and premier medical colleges. The institution ‚Äî Mahamana Shikshan Sansthan under Bhaurao Devras Seva Nyas of the Sangh ‚Äî was set up in Arjunganj, Lucknow, in 2019 and is being run by alumni from BHU and other top technical/medical colleges from across the country. RSS sources said, students are picked up from across the state after screening and physical verification of their economic status through house visits by a team. Plans are also afoot to induct meritorious children who got orphaned in the Corona pandemic. This comes close on heels of the Yogi Adityanath government‚Äôs move to provide financial aid of Rs 4000 to children, who lost both parents during the pandemic. The campus of the three-storied institute straddles an area of 34,000 sqft and has 20 rooms and a big hall on the ground floor. ‚ÄúStudents who scored at least 80% in class 10 are given admission. Though the concept has been initiated for students across India, we are focussing on UP‚Äôs socio-economically poor regions like Poorvanchal and Bundelkhand,‚Äù said secretary of the institution, Ranjeev Tewari, who did chemical engineering from IIT-BHU in 2004.

Not willing to take a chance, however, they alerted swimmers deputed along the riverfront. What the men brought ashore left everyone shocked: the doll turned out to be a welldressed newborn girl, fished out of her watery grave. The image was a study in contrast. The infant was attired in a summery white strappy dress with blue and pink flowers on it. However, the body had bloated after being in water for some time. Someone had adorned her forehead with a black tikka, in a futile attempt to ward off evil. Aghast at seeing the body, people dialled 100 and 108 but the baby was dead. This is probably the first time that the river has thrown up such a young victim. Sabarmati Riverfront (West) cops have begun an investigation into the case which they have currently registered as ‚Äòaccidental death‚Äô. Cops estimate the age of the child to be between zero and one month. They believe that she had been thrown into the river. Though the body was spotted on on Thursday afternoon, cops estimate the incident took place a day or two ago. They have started checking CCTV footage over the past 3-4 days to zero in on any suspect who may have dumped the child in the river. Police officials said that the baby was taken to Civil Hospital for post-mortem. Prima facie, no strangulation marks or injuries were found on the body. ‚ÄúWe are investigating the case and hope to track the culprits soon,‚Äù said cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/baby-girl-found-floating-in-watery-grave/articleshow/84657610.cms||---

Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that no such proposal has been forwarded yet to the Centre. Surendra Gajanan Samant, in his petition before the high court, challenged the state government‚Äôs intention to declare the wild boar as vermin. He stated that this will facilitate the hunting of wild animals. Samant alleged this will facilitate many politicians to kill these wild animals for meat trade with five-star hotels and illegal export to foreign countries. He alleged that politicians want to make money for the election. He suggested that the state adopt latest technology like ultra sound system or stringent smell to repel wild boar so that farms are protected. Advocate Anamika Gode, amicus curiae, in the matter submitted to the high court that there is no information whether any objective and independent study has been done by the government prior to taking this decision at a review meeting with forest department officials on July 5 this year. She sought that the government be directed to place on record whether any human wildlife conflict management plans as directed by the MoEF & CC have been prepared in Goa. She also said the government must place on record details of ground level assessment if any, and basis of the decision to declare wild boar as vermin under Section 62 - any study, consultation, expert opinion, surveys, etc. The government may be directed to place on record the specific areas where issues of human wildlife conflict relating to wild boar have been reported, and whether there is any assessment of the population of wild boar in the adjacent forests, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-proposal-sent-to-centre-on-wild-boar-as-vermin/articleshow/84660058.cms||‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º ‡§®‡•á‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï
---||Kochi||Kerala: Man commits suicide over notice from bank hit by fraud||THRISSUR: A former panchayat member and Congress activist has ended his life allegedly after receiving a property attachment notice from the Karuvannur Cooperative Service Bank, which is at the centre of a controversy over a loan fraud running to over Rs 100 crore. The registrar of cooperative societies has dissolved the bank‚Äôs director board controlled by CPM. T M MukudanThe deceased has been identified as T M Mukudan (63) of Thelappilly. His body was found hanging at his home on Thursday. Mukundan‚Äôs family alleged that he was served a notice asking him to pay about Rs 80 lakh he owed to the bank. ‚ÄúHe is known to have pledged his 16-cent property. How can a bank give Rs 80 lakh loan by accepting just 16 cents as collateral in such a remote area. A probe must be conducted to find out to which account the loan amount has been transferred,‚Äô‚Äô Rajeswari, Mukundan‚Äôs sister said. Denying the allegations, the secretary in charge of the bank, said in a statement that Mukundan had taken a loan of Rs 30 lakh by pledging his house and surrounding properties on March 3, 2018, and topped it up with another Rs 30 lakh loan on March 19, 2019. Both these loans were not repaid, and the bank had issued a notice directing him to remit the loan, in February this year, the secretary said. He claimed the bank has not issued any further notice, and no staff from the bank had gone to his house to initiate property attachment procedures. Congress said CPM leaders who are ruling the bank cannot wash their hands of Mukundan‚Äôs suicide. The party has called for a hartal in the area on Friday demanding action against the CPM leaders on the bank‚Äôs board. BJP district president K K Aneeshkumar demanded murder charges to be slapped on them, in the wake of Mukundan‚Äôs death. The registrar of cooperative societies P B Nooh said the bank‚Äôs director board was dissolved after it was found that the board members did not take measures at the right time to prevent the fraud. Nooh said the assets of those who had siphoned out the funds will be utilised for recouping the money lost to the fraud, apart from the properties pledged as collateral for the bad loans. ‚ÄúThe government will take all possible steps to ensure that the interests of the depositors are protected,‚Äô‚Äô the registrar said. The bank has been brought under the control of an administrator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/man-commits-suicide-over-notice-from-bank-hit-by-fraud/articleshow/84654970.cms||T Ramavarman

IMD officials said heavy rain activity is unlikely to subside before Saturday.Karjat recorded 322mm rain in a 24-hour span since Wednesday and Lonavala 313mm. ‚ÄúThe main reason for the flooding was heavy rain in the catchment areas of Karjat and Lonavala region from where the Ulhas river originates and passes through Badlapur, Ambernath and Kalyan,‚Äù Thane collector Rajendra Narvekar said. ‚ÄúThe rescue teams shifted around 5,000 people to safe places like schools, community halls and arranged food for them,‚Äù he added.Four rivers ‚Äî Ulhas, Waldhuni, Kalu and Bhatsa ‚Äî which come together near Kalyan inundated areas like Shahad and Yogi Dham. In Ulhasnagar, Shanti Nagar residents were badly affected due to the overflowing Waldhuni. In Bhiwandi, where 140.7mm of rain was recorded in the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Thursday, Kamvari river, which originates from Shahapur, also overflowed causing flooding.A high tide of 4.39m at 10.46am proved a major factor in the delay in subsiding of the flooding since most of the rivers drain into the Vasai-Kalyan creek.Several other areas on the MMR‚Äôs eastern fringes witnessed 100mm-plus rain between Wednesday and Thursday, fuelling the flooding. Mahabaleshwar, not far from the Ulhas catchment, received record July rain ‚Äî 480mm in 24 hours ‚Äî beating the 439.8mm recorded on July 7, 1977.The residents in Kalyan and Badlapur said the water level started rising around 4am on Thursday. There were rumours the gates of the Barvi dam have been opened, but civic officials dismissed them. At the Radisson Blu hotel abutting the Ulhas river in Karjat, the 100-odd guests began panicking as water began rising in the early hours of Thursday. By morning there was two-feet water in the reception area, leading some of them to dial the BMC disaster management control room. The SOS was forwarded to the NDRF, but when they reached after 11am, the water had receded. Still, all the residents were evacuated.In Kalyan and Badlapur, NDRF teams rescued seven villagers from Kamba and 15 people from the barrage area in Badlapur. The local fire team also rescued 78 people stuck in the water in different part of Badlapur.(With inputs from George Mendonca)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rivers-in-spate-bring-mmr-around-kalyan-to-its-knees/articleshow/84660099.cms||Pradeep Gupta

The party said that two weeks ago the Centre had said suburban railways may be opened for the general public with adequate precautions. ‚ÄúThe absence of a concrete alternative public transportation plan has put the common man to immense hardship to just reach his place of work, assuming he still has a job. In the face of adversities the monthly spend on office commute has shot up many times,‚Äù a BJP politician said. The BJP had earlier demanded the government pay a monthly allowance of Rs 5,000 per person if it does not wish to allow train travel. BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said the government must allow those who have taken both vaccine doses to continue normal activities with precautions.  MNS chief Raj Thackeray also wrote to CM Uddhav Thackeray demanding use of local train services for those who have taken both doses. The MNS chief said the restrictions were leading to overcrowding in buses. ‚ÄúWhat is the logic behind putting restrictions on local trains and running overcrowded buses?‚Äù he said.

Authorities of Pegasus PSC Coaching Centre were surprised to see the sudden spurt in downloads of their ‚ÄòPegasus Online‚Äô app over the last three days ever since the spyware controversy erupted. While the total downloads of the app stood at 1,000 last week, it doubled over the past three days to touch 2,110 on Thursday morning. ‚ÄúWe understood that the new-found interest in the app was fuelled by reports over Pegasus software after we started getting plenty of calls from people who downloaded it outside Kerala, even north Indian states. They had called us using the ‚ÄòCall your Institute Link‚Äô of the app after downloading it,‚Äù said P C Sanoop, owner of the coaching centre. Abin K T, a staff at the centre who attended the calls, said that many callers asked how they could manage phone calls using the software. ‚ÄúOnce the user downloads the app and logs in, there is a link by which users can contact the coaching centre. Now, most of the calls I‚Äôm getting are from outside Kerala. Though I know Hindi, I am unable to follow regional dialects used by callers from various places. I am busy telling them that the app is for Kerala PSC exam coaching only,‚Äù he said, adding that even their Facebook page has been flooded with requests over the past few days. The coaching centre that began in 2015 had launched the app last year following Covid lockdown to enable candidates to continue coaching. He said that the app had the mythological winged horse as its logo and media reports, which used the image of it in the coverage of spyware, would also have contributed to this mistaken identity. The app for students of the institute provides facilities to practice around one lakh PSC questions and has a database of question papers of previous exams with daily updates on current affairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/this-pegasus-is-all-about-coaching-not-snooping/articleshow/84655010.cms||---

The jawan got engaged to the city-based woman in February 2021. Since then, he and his family members have allegedly taken a gold ring worth nearly Rs 2 lakh as a token of dowry and another Rs 10 lakh under the pretext of getting the woman a permanent government job. However, not only have they failed to get the woman a permanent job, but have been escalating their demands ‚Äî including the demand for the rare reptile and the dog.

Police said the two families were introduced by a common contact, following which the wedding was fixed. Accordingly, engagement was solemnised, during which a gold ring was gifted to the jawan. ‚ÄúFollowing the engagement ceremony, would-be groom and his parents, citing auspiciousness, asked the bride‚Äôs family to get a 21-nailed tortoise, a black canine and traditional lamp as part of the dowry,‚Äù said Tare. The woman‚Äôs family started looking for the rare tortoise, but couldn‚Äôt find one. Wildlife activists maintain the prevailing superstition ‚Äî that owning a 21-nailed tortoise brings fortune and helps unearth hidden treasure ‚Äî has created a market for the rare reptile. The market value of such a tortoise is between Rs 5 and 10 lakh. After the woman‚Äôs father expressed his inability to get the tortoise, there was friction between the families. The groom‚Äôs family threatened to call off the wedding. Upset, the woman asked her parents not to comply with the ever-increasing dowry demand. After the wedding was called, the woman‚Äôs family asked the other party to return all the valuables.

Often being the first to reach the court ahead of advocate Prashant Bhushan‚Äôs clients in filing PILs in SC on important public controversies, including the coal scam and alleged irregularities in Rafale deal, Sharma requested the apex court to inquire why and under what procedure the Union government purchased the spyware for snooping purposes. He also demanded to know the expenses incurred for the purchase of the Israeli spyware, which is sold by its owner NSO only to governments. Making the PM a respondent by name along with all members of the Union council of ministers, Sharma requested the SC to constitute an SIT and monitor its investigations into ‚ÄúPegasus scandal and prosecute all accused persons/ ministers for buying of Pegasus and for snooping on citizens of India including judges, opposition leaders and political persons, activists, advocates and others for their vested political interest since 2017 till date‚Äù. Seeking a declaration that use of Pegasus by the government or any of its agencies was illegal, the petitioner said those responsible for the alleged purchase of the spyware without prior authorisation from Parliament must be asked to reimburse the treasury of an equal amount with interest. The petitioner said at a time when the government rides roughshod over opposition and refuses to answer anything relating to purchase and use of Pegasus, it is only the SC which could fix accountability by going to the root of the issue ‚Äî who entered into an agreement with Israeli NSO for purchase of the spyware. Sharma said the BJP government could not take shelter behind the run-of-the-mill excuse that snooping took place during the Congress-led UPA government on a much larger scale and must be made answerable to the breach of privacy, which a 9-judge bench of the SC has ruled to be part and parcel of the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pil-in-sc-seeks-sit-probe-into-snooping-through-pegasus/articleshow/84663301.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The arrested man, Vivek Mahadeo Yadav (38), represented BJP in the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB)‚Äôs elected body, dissolved over six months ago. Sub-inspector Prabhakar Kapure of the Kondhwa police on Thursday said, ‚ÄúYadav admitted to his involvement in the crime. He has seven cases registered against him.‚Äù A magistrate at the Pune Cantonment court on Thursday remanded him in police custody till July 26 after assistant public prosecutors Jyoti Waghmare and Santosh Patale argued that his custodial interrogation was essential to trace the source of firearms and identify the man he sent to deliver firearms to arrested criminals on records -- Rajan Rajmani (38) and Ibrahim alias Hussain Yakub Shaikh (27) -- to execute the plan to kill Vishnu Gawli alias Babliya. Gawli, a criminal on police records, is among the 12 people arrested and charged with attempt to kill Yadav in 2016. The public prosecutors submitted that the police had recovered Yadav‚Äôs cellphone, but he had concealed the SIM card and deleted the number of Gawli from the call details record. The defence lawyer opposed the prosecution‚Äôs plea, claiming that Yadav had no role in the crime. Yadav was on the run since the police arrested Rajmani and Shaikh (27) on July 14 and recovered three country-made pistols and as many magazines and bullets from them. ‚ÄúThe duo told the police that Yadav had given them Rs3 lakh for eliminating Gawli, accused of firing at Yadav from a country-made pistol during a Ganapati immersion procession near Qureshi Masjid in Camp in 2016. The bullet pierced through Yadav‚Äôs jaws and grazed the head of Sanjay Yadav, a passer-by,‚Äù said Kapure. Gawli was also an accused in the murder of Rajendra Maratkar, then vice-president of the Khadki Cantonment Board, the police said. Kapure said, ‚ÄúYadav was on the run after his name cropped up in the investigation related to Rajmani and Shaikh‚Äôs arrest. We conducted a technical (cellphone location) investigation and traced Yadav to Gujarat. He was in the process of crossing over to Rajasthan, but we tipped off the police there and got the border sealed. The police stopped Yadav‚Äôs car and intercepted him on Tuesday night.

---||Coimbatore||Doctors: Screen for RH incompatibility||Coimbatore: With 3-5% of pregnant women coming to city hospitals with Rh incompatibility, gynecologists are advocating the importance of screening. Rh factor (Rhesus factor) is a genetically inherited protein found on the surface of red blood cells. When Rh negative mother conceives an Rh positive child, the mother‚Äôs immune system mistakes Rh-positive fetal cells as foreign bodies and attacks them. It can lead to miscarriage, pre-term deliveries, hemolytic anemia or mental and cognitive disorders in babies. However, complications due to the incompatibility can be prevented by medical interventions during the pregnancy. The national estimate of Rh incompatible pregnancies is at 2-10%. Professor and chief of obstetrics and gynecology at PSG Institute of Medical Sciences Dr T V Chitra says around 3-5% of the pregnancies they see are Rh incompatible. ‚ÄúHowever, with timely screening for Rh blood typing and medical interventions, complications can be prevented.‚Äù Gyneacologists say that it is important to check Rh typing of every pregnant woman in the first visit. ‚ÄúNegative mothers need to have an indirect antiglobulin test. If antibodies are found, then levels need to be checked periodically and development of fetal anaemia must be monitored,‚Äù added Chitra. ‚ÄúAdministration of anti-D immunoglobulins can prevent incidence of such complications.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/doctors-screen-for-rh-incompatibility/articleshow/84660118.cms||‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º ‡§®‡•á‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï

---||Coimbatore||Trained, these girl students need help to make it big in kabaddi||COIMBATORE: Not many know that 23 girl students were getting intense training in kabaddi for the past eight months. The girls - three of them college students and the remaining corporation school students - now have an opportunity to make a name for themselves and the district proud. But they need some Good Samaritans to support them. Trained by coach Sathish Kumar, the girls are hoping to participate in a national sports championship in Jammu but can‚Äôt afford the participation fee of Rs 4,000 each. They have managed to get sponsorship for one-way train tickets so far. Kumar, who has worked as a kabaddi coach with private schools and colleges, has been training the girl students of corporation schools free of cost since 1989. ‚ÄúUnlike other sports, kabaddi requires no expensive equipment and is a good way to expend physical energy and focus. And I believed if the students trained by me could get into their school and district level teams, it would help them in college admissions and scholarships.‚Äù He trains the girls on an open ground near Nehru stadium‚Äôs basketball court. The girls, despite living as far as Thadagam, have been practicing for four and half hours a day for the national sports competition, which is organized by the Youth and Sports Development Association of India. ‚ÄúThey practice from 6.30am to 9am and again from 3pm to 5pm, and come to my house for lunch in between,‚Äù Kumar said. Radhika, a student of Bishop Appasamy College, says, ‚ÄúMy twin sister and I couldn‚Äôt attend online classes, because our parents, who are daily wage labourers, couldn‚Äôt pay our fees. Since our education is so uncertain, excelling in kabaddi is the only thing that will work for us now.‚Äù Kumar believes that the competition, which would be held from August 6 to 8, would help the girls see the heights they could reach, if they focus. Another participant, Priyadarshini, daughter of a goldsmith and Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board employee, says learning kabaddi had been a long dream, which she couldn‚Äôt afford earlier because of the financial situation at home. ‚ÄúIt was a gift when I heard of Sathish sir‚Äôs free coaching.‚Äù The girl, who is pursuing her BSc in physical education, wants to become a physical educator after her graduation. ‚ÄúAny victory or qualifications will give them a certificate, which may help them in school or college admissions too,‚Äù Kumar said. The group now needs to raise Rs 92,000 or Rs 4,000 per participant, as participation charges. ‚ÄúThis includes their accommodation, food, certificate, track suits and jerseys,‚Äù he said. For most girls, this is their first trip outside the state. A total of 16 teams are participating in the kabaddi competition. The meet would also feature competitions in silambam, karate and judo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/trained-these-girl-students-need-help-to-make-it-big-in-kabaddi/articleshow/84660145.cms||---

Rival political parties eyeing Brahmin votes are invoking the name of ‚ÄòLord Shree Parashuram‚Äô, a mythological figure considered to be a Brahmin icon. Now, a BJP MLA in Kanpur Dehat has donated land worth Rs 5 crores to build a temple of Lord Parashuram where a 20-ft-tall statue of the Lord will be established. Earlier, the Samajwadi Party (SP) had announced plans to install the tallest statue of Lord Parashuram, who is revered by many Hindus, particularly Brahmins, at Janeshwar Mishra Park in Lucknow. Now, a BJP MLA from Akbarpur-Rania assembly segment in Kanpur Dehat Pratibha Shukla has donated land worth Rs 5 crores to a trust to build a world class temple of ‚ÄòLord Shree Parashuram‚Äô in Kanpur Dehat district. A statement issued by the MLA‚Äôs personal secretary, Ramji Mishra on Wednesday said, ‚ÄúA 20-ft-tall statue of Lord Shree Parashuram will be installed in the temple premises.‚Äù She is the wife of former MP Anil Shukla Warsi. Warsi had represented the 14th Lok Sabha in 2007 after winning a bye-election from Billhaur constituency on a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket. Thereafter, he contested for 16th Lok Sabha election from Akbarpur constituency on BSP‚Äôs ticket in the 2014 general election but lost. In 2015, he resigned from the BSP and along with wife Pratibha Shukla, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Former MP Warisi said, ‚ÄúLand worth Rs 5 crores has been donated to Bhagwan Shree Parashuram Nyas in Khanchandrapur Khadanja in Rania. A world class grand temple of ‚ÄòLord Shree Parshuram‚Äô would be built here.‚Äù Pratibha Shukla, meanwhile, said, ‚ÄúBrahmins come from the enlightened class. Where everyone‚Äôs interests are protected, Brahmin goes there only.‚Äù On being asked about the temple of Lord Parashuram, she said, ‚ÄúMy husband (Anil Shukla Warsi), who is also the chairman of Parashuram Temple Trust, had resolved to build the temple in 2018 itself. Due to lack of cooperation from the people, the temple could not be built. Now, we are donating our land for the temple where a 20-ft statue of Lord Shree Parashuram will be established.‚Äù According to Rishabh, the chief trustee of Bhagwan Shree Parashuram Nyas, ‚Äòbhoomi pujan‚Äô for the construction of the temple will be done on July 26. ‚ÄúEleven acharyas will worship the land with ‚ÄòVeda‚Äô chanting. The rituals will start at around 11 am on July 26,‚Äù he added. The map and design for the construction of the temple has been prepared. Chief mahant of Gauraiyapur Ashram Desh Narain is likely to participate in the ‚Äòbhoomi-pujan‚Äô ceremony, said the chief trustee further. Lord Shree Parashuram is described in some versions of the Mahabharata as the angry Brahmin who with his axe, killed a huge number of Kshatriya warriors because they were abusing their power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/mla-donates-rs-5cr-land-for-lord-parashurams-temple/articleshow/84660472.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Sub-inspector Kiran Varal on Thursday said, ‚ÄúComplainant Bapu Abnave, a small- time businessman from Wadgaonsheri, and nine others had jointly entered into a registered agreement with the developer and the landowners after paying the market price of the land for construction of houses on the same, but the project did not commence till date.‚Äù Varal said, ‚ÄúThe buyers met the original landowners on numerous occasions and requested them to hand over possession of their plots for the purpose of fencing and barricading but they turned down their requests, claiming that the developer had not cleared their dues. After this, the buyers held a meeting with the developer and sought reasons for not clearing dues of the original landowners. The developer told them that he had cleared their dues, but they were not allowing him to commence construction work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAfter efforts to settle the dispute between landowners and the developer proved futile, the buyers filed a complaint application with the police in June. We conducted a preliminary inquiry and examined the documents and registered an FIR against the developer and others relating to cheating under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code after seeking legal opinion,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ahmednagar-developer-others-booked-on-charge-of-duping-10-people-of-rs1-60cr/articleshow/84657729.cms||---

The UT social welfare department, in association with the UT health department, will identify some locations in the city on the basis of the population of transgender people and accordingly hold special camps. There are around 1,500 transgender persons here eligible for Covid vaccination. Nitika Pawar, secretary, social welfare and women and child development, said, ‚ÄúWe, along with the UT health department, will cover transgender population. In some cases, they did not come forward for vaccination, therefore the department will reach out to them. In the coming days, special camps will be held for 1,500 of them.‚Äù ‚ÄúRecently, we had also held special camps for persons with disabilities, senior citizens and caregivers. In the past around 20 days, we have vaccinated over 6,200 people of these categories. The department will continue to hold these camps in the coming days as well,‚Äù she added.

---||Mumbai||Guillian-Barre Syndrome linked to Covid infection: Maharashtra study||MUMBAI: About 20% of the Covid-19 patients who developed a severe neurological disorder called Guillian-Barre Syndrome (GBS) died, but the remaining recovered quickly, according to a recent statewide study. ‚ÄúGuillian-Barre Syndrome has been shown to be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection,‚Äù said the study of 42 patients published in the Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology, a peer-reviewed journal brought out by the Indian Academy of Neurology. Details of Covid patients wi-th GBS from March to November 2020 were gathered from 16 hospitals in Maharashtra, though most were from Mumbai. The study found that three-fourth of the sufferers were men whose average age was 59. ‚ÄúAbout a third of these patients came to hospital with GBS and not Covid-19 symptoms. Of these, six were asymptomatic for Covid despite testing RT-PCR positive,‚Äù said the study‚Äôs lead author Dr Megha Dhamne from L H Hiranandani Hospital in Powai. GBS is a rare disease affecting 0.4 to 4.0 people per 1 lakh population per year. Patients usually develop GBS about six weeks after suffering from a viral infection. It is a debilitating condition though patients recover from it, but it takes months for them to be able to walk normally. Studies across the world have shown that 30% of Covid patients develop some neurological symptoms such as stroke, fatigue, Bell‚Äôs palsy and sensory problems (not able to smell). The study found two groups of patients ‚Äî the majority developed GBS after being discharged from hospital, while a few developed it alongside the main infection. ‚ÄúThe majority had a good outcome and were walking independently or with minimal support at discharge,‚Äô‚Äô said Dr Dhamne. While post-Covid GBS was easier to treat, the other group needed close monitoring. The standard treatment for GBS ‚Äî intravenous immunoglobulin ‚Äî helped most patients, but some needed Covid-associated medication, like remdesivir and tocilizumab. Neurologist Dr Sangeeta Ravat, who heads the department in BMC-run KEM Hospital in Parel and was not associated with the study, said GBS could be worrisome for Covid-19 patients. ‚ÄúCovid-19 affects the lungs and GBS affects muscles so much that many GBS patients need help (ventilators) to breathe,‚Äù said Dr Ravat, whose department has treated around half a dozen Covid-19 patients with GBS. Covid could hence adversely affect the outcome of GBS patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/guillian-barre-syndrome-linked-to-covid-infection-maharashtra-study/articleshow/84660207.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Tracks battered, 100+ trains hit, 12k travellers stranded||Mumbai: Thousands of passengers were stranded and railway assets worth several crores destroyed at over 21 points in the state, largely in the Konkan and along the Western Ghats, after extremely heavy rains led to water-logging, rock falls and washing out of tracks. The Bhor and Thul ghats on the Central Railway (CR) routes of Titwala-Igatpuri and Ambernath-Lonavala bore the brunt. Konkan Railway, too, was badly affected due to heavy flooding in Ratnagiri district. ‚ÄúThe intensity of rainfall from midnight can be gauged as Kasara received 136mm rainfall in just 4 hours and Karjat received 86.8mm between 1am and 2am,‚Äù said a CR official. Services of over a 100 long-distance trains were affected. In CR, around 34 trains were cancelled, 26 diverted and 42 short terminated. ‚ÄúWe ensured no trains are held up in between stations. All the scheduled trains were regulated at stations like Kasara, Igatpuri, Badlapur, Khadavali, etc,‚Äù said CR spokesperson Shivaji Sutar. Konkan Railways regulated 9 trains at various stations with nearly 6,000 passengers onboard. ‚ÄúTrain services are suspended temporarily between Chiplun and Kamathe stations on Konkan Railway after water level of Vashishiti river bridge in Ratnagiri region breached the danger level,‚Äù said a statement. Initially, curtailed suburban services started on the CSMT-Ambarnath/Titwala section as stations beyond were inundated. At 10.35am, CSMT-Badlapur services were restored, and extended till Karjat by 9.30pm. By 3pm, the Kalyan-Kasara section was made fit for traffic. Most of the disruptions at about 21 locations along CR routes were reported due to water-logging on tracks, washing out of embankments or tracks, boulders falling or landslides in ghats and rivers flowing over the danger level. Despite rain, CR deployed around 100 personnel, including senior officers, for repair and restoration, especially across Mumbai division. ‚ÄúTwo boulder special trains, 4 ballast rake, 2 poclains and 4 JCBs have been mobilised with labourers despite blockage of highways. More machines are being deployed at affected sites,‚Äù said Sutar. The MSRTC came to the rescue of those stranded. It operated 133 buses between Igatpuri and Kasara/Kalyan and ferried 5,800 passengers, said transport minister Anil Parab. On the Mumbai-Pune route, 65 special buses were operated from Pune to Mumbai and nine from Mumbai to Pune to ferry those stranded en route.

---||Lucknow||Political parties on mission to woo Brahmins before Uttar Pradesh polls||LUCKNOW: With national general secretary and the Brahmin face of the Bahujan Samaj Party, Satish Chandra Misra, heading the party‚Äôs show starting on Friday from Ayodhya, the BSP plans to win the caste group back as it claims to have done in 2007 assembly elections. However, Mishra opposes attempts to brand it as a ‚Äòcaste congregation‚Äô. Misra, who was recently appointed the national media coordinator of the BSP, told TOI on Thursday: ‚ÄúIt is not a caste sammelan but a goshthi of prabuddh varg (meeting of intellectuals)‚Äù. Whether or not BSP would go with slogans like ‚ÄúHaathi nahin Ganesh hai, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh hai‚Äù this time as it did before 2007 polls, but there is no denying the fact that it‚Äôs back to social engineering and Brahmins are on top of its priority list, apart from its core vote bank ‚Äî dalits. Brahmins constitute around 11% of UP‚Äôs voters. However, ever since the Yogi Adityanath government came to power, the Opposition and a section of BJP workers have been alleging Brahmins are being neglected. In a bid to quell this discontentment, the BJP has made every effort to keep Brahmins in good humour. The list of steps is long and the latest being elevation of Kheri MP Ajay Misra ‚ÄòTeni‚Äô as the minister of state in the Modi government. According to sources, as part of its Brahmin-outreach bid, the BJP may also give Jitin Prasada, who is also from the Teni‚Äôs region and had recently left Congress to join the BJP, a berth in the Yogi government when the next expansion takes place. While in Congress, Prasada in 2020 had floated a Brahmin Chetna Parishad to highlight the ‚Äòatrocities on Brahmins‚Äô. Political analysts say that the Bahujan Samaj Party‚Äôs performance after its social engineering experiment in 2007 UP elections is spurring the party to woo Brahmins once again before the 2022 assembly elections. The party has decided to hold meetings in almost every district of the state beginning July 23 from Ayodhya though it chooses not to call it a Brahmins‚Äô conference. Talking to TOI, Mishra confirmed that a detailed plan had been chalked out to hold such meets. To a question on why only Brahmins, Misra said during the meeting the party leaders would be talking about every other caste. However, he didn‚Äôt forget to add: ‚ÄúThe fact is that Brahmins have faced a lot of atrocities during the Yogi Government.‚Äù He said that a detailed plan to hold intellectual meets at other places have also been made. As of now, after Ayodhya, intellectual meetings would be held at Ambedkarnagar on July 25, Prayagraj on July 26, Kaushambi on July 27, Pratapgarh on July 28 and Sultanpur on July 29, Misra told TOI. Dates for such sammelans at other districts would be finalised later, Misra said, adding that such sammelans would be held across the state. In 2017, of the 312 seats that BJP won in a 403-member House, there were 58 Brahmins. Interestingly, in 2007 assembly elections, BSP fielded 86 Brahmins alone out of the 139 upper caste candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/political-parties-on-mission-to-woo-brahmins-before-polls/articleshow/84662287.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

We will extend the training programme to other blocks in the coming days.‚Äù Shukla, meanwhile, said that women would prepare designer rakhis of different sizes and shapes, and order for raw materials has already been placed. SHG women are showing keen interest in preparing rakhis as they find it an easy job which can increase their income.

The incident, which has sparked angry reactions from environmentalists and historians, has exposed poor vigil at the Mughal-era garden. Swapnil Joshi, convener of advocacy group Himayat Bagh Conservation Action Committee, said tree cutting and other ecological damages to the garden are failing to get official attention. ‚ÄúIf such official apathy continues, flora and fauna at Himayat Bagh as well as its historical significance would become extinct. There is a need for proper vigil to prevent damages to the garden,‚Äù he said. The committee, which is a group of nature experts and historians among others, has already conveyed its grave concern over rampant damage to Himayat Bagh. When contacted, Ashok Dhawan, vice-chancellor of Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University (VNMAU), said he was struggling to cope up with manpower issues. ‚ÄúI have asked local authorities to increase the vigil,‚Äù he said. Dhawan, however, also tried to downplay the incident of tree-cutting by saying that he had other important things to pay attention to. Meanwhile, the garden department of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) carried out a panchanama of the tree-cutting incident. Sachin Ujagare, an agricultural assistant with the AMC, said the civic administration would send a notice to VNMAU which is supposed to protect the trees at Himayat Bagh. ‚ÄúThe sandalwood tree was apparently cut on Wednesday night and thieves could have planned to take it away the next day,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sandalwood-tree-axed-at-himayat-bagh/articleshow/84655085.cms||---

Shahab Uddin, a tailor residing in Harwara area, said, ‚ÄúWe prepared all the special Eid delicacies and distributed the same amongst the poor families who live nearby.‚Äù Although a large number people did come out for shopping on a few days prior to Bakrid, but the roads were comparatively less crowded on the day of the festival. Only a limited number of people arrived in all major mosques of the city. By and large, people remained confined either to their homes or within their locality. Owing to some relaxations in restrictions, families visited each other, and quite a few people were also seen in local parks, malls and restaurants. ‚ÄúSome of the families did visit our restaurant. We had also made special preparations for the occasion,‚Äùsaid Raju Jaiswal, owner of a local restaurant in Civil Lines area. Several Hindu families also visited their Muslim friends and celebrated the festival together. ‚ÄúI never miss meeting my Muslim friends on Eid and Bakrid. Although, last year, the restrictions were stricter, the festival was celebrated more freely this year as the number of Covid cases has come down,‚Äù said Gopal Srivastava, an executive from the city. ‚ÄúThere was no visitor on Eid this year, but on Bakrid, some of my friends did come to my place, and we had fun. I am thankful to the Almighty for this, as I did not want to be all alone on the day of the festival like last time,‚Äù said Abbas Ali, a resident of Dariyabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bakrid-remains-low-key-affair-celebrations-confined-to-homes/articleshow/84660772.cms||---

Cyber-crime sleuths of city police asked Toty how he mastered the Indian greeting and the man named a hardened criminal Lalu Jalim alias Amit Rajput who, he claimed, taught him the finer nuances of Indian tradition behind bars. When the two hardened criminals met each other in the police lockup of city crime branch, gangster Jalim gave his African counterpart from Ivory Coast a few tips on Indian mannerisms. ‚ÄúHe is a quick learner and has been greeting every individual with folded hands since the morning. We were surprised when he credited Jalim for teaching this,‚Äù said an official in cyber-crime police station. But much to the cops‚Äô annoyance, the cyber criminal has, however, remained evasive about the exact details of the ‚Äòfake kidney racket‚Äô and is also misleading the cops. He is yet to name his associates who are involved in the racket, cops said. Toty disclosed that his father was a successful electrical contractor in Abidjan but his business suffered massive blow due to change in power in Ivory Coast. He came to study Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) in Bengaluru in 2007 and completed it in 2011. He returned home but after his father‚Äôs business started to go down, Toty returned to India. But his visa expired in 2015. However, Toty continued to stay here and did not even go in his father‚Äôs funeral in 2019. Using his knowledge of computers, Toty became part of the fraud rackets. Toty is an accused in a fraud of Rs 14.78 lakh with businessman Arbaz Rana, who wanted to sell his kidney to get his sister married off as he was reeling under financial crisis. Toty issued advertisements on his fake hospital websites for people interested in selling their kidneys for a handsome sum. He was arrested by cybercrime sleuths on July 17. He has been remanded to police custody for 14 days by a local court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/african-cyber-crook-stuns-cops-with-jai-mataji-greeting/articleshow/84657806.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

He added that people of Kaushambi were cheated for the past 70 years and no development work was taken up in the district by the previous governments. He claimed that the BJP would win over 300 seats in the 2022 assembly election in UP even if all the opposition parties come together. He also said that claims of former chief minister and Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav would fall flat. ‚ÄúAkhilesh Yadav had made big claims during 2014 parliamentary polls, 2017 state assembly polls and 2019 parliamentary polls but people of the state were well aware and proved them false,‚Äù he added. Maurya also claimed that BJP has been working on the formula of ‚Äòsabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas‚Äô. He said the opposition was attempting to deceive people on the issue of NRC, CAA and ‚Äòkisan andolan‚Äô. ‚ÄúBJP believes in the overall development of the people.

---||Coimbatore||Trained, these girl students need help to make it big in kabaddi||Coimbatore: Not many know that 23 girl students were getting intense training in kabaddi for the past eight months. The girls - three of them college students and the remaining corporation school students - now have an opportunity to make a name for themselves and the district proud. But they need some Good Samaritans to support them. Trained by coach Sathish Kumar, the girls are hoping to participate in a national sports championship in Jammu but can‚Äôt afford the participation fee of Rs 4,000 each. They have managed to get sponsorship for one-way train tickets so far. Kumar, who has worked as a kabaddi coach with private schools and colleges, has been training the girl students of corporation schools free of cost since 1989. ‚ÄúUnlike other sports, kabaddi requires no expensive equipment and is a good way to expend physical energy and focus. And I believed if the students trained by me could get into their school and district level teams, it would help them in college admissions and scholarships.‚Äù He trains the girls on an open ground near Nehru stadium‚Äôs basketball court. The girls, despite living as far as Thadagam, have been practicing for four and half hours a day for the national sports competition, which is organized by the Youth and Sports Development Association of India. ‚ÄúThey practice from 6.30am to 9am and again from 3pm to 5pm, and come to my house for lunch in between,‚Äù Kumar said. Radhika, a student of Bishop Appasamy College, says, ‚ÄúMy twin sister and I couldn‚Äôt attend online classes, because our parents, who are daily wage labourers, couldn‚Äôt pay our fees. Since our education is so uncertain, excelling in kabaddi is the only thing that will work for us now.‚Äù Kumar believes that the competition, which would be held from August 6 to 8, would help the girls see the heights they could reach, if they focus. Another participant, Priyadarshini, daughter of a goldsmith and Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board employee, says learning kabaddi had been a long dream, which she couldn‚Äôt afford earlier because of the financial situation at home. ‚ÄúIt was a gift when I heard of Sathish sir‚Äôs free coaching.‚Äù The girl, who is pursuing her BSc in physical education, wants to become a physical educator after her graduation. ‚ÄúAny victory or qualifications will give them a certificate, which may help them in school or college admissions too,‚Äù Kumar said. The group now needs to raise Rs 92,000 or Rs 4,000 per participant, as participation charges. ‚ÄúThis includes their accommodation, food, certificate, track suits and jerseys,‚Äù he said. For most girls, this is their first trip outside the state. A total of 16 teams are participating in the kabaddi competition. The meet would also feature competitions in silambam, karate and judo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/trained-these-girl-students-need-help-to-make-it-big-in-kabaddi/articleshow/84660154.cms||---

The river has been in spate following heavy rainfall in its catchment areas and the water level has now risen about 1ft above the bridge. For now, motorists as well as pedestrians could wade through the water on the bridge. But they fear that the water level may rise further in the coming days, leaving them unable to use the bridge. M Ammasaikutti, a farmer from Lingapuram, said, ‚ÄúWe want a quicker and permanent solution to the problem we are facing every monsoon. A new bridge has to be built.‚Äù While there was not much rain in Mettupalayam area, heavy showers in the catchments areas and in the Western Ghats for the past few days had increased the water flow in the river. The only proper way to reach other villages from Lingapuram across the 300-metre wide river is the bridge, which was built in 2004. The locality falls in the backwater area of Bhavanisagar dam and whenever there is a high water flow during monsoon, the bridge remains submerged. Villagers point out that the bridge had submerged in the very next year of its construction in 2005, forcing them to depend on alternative ways to reach the village. Whenever the bridge submerges, public would use coracle service to cross the river or take an alternative path through adjoining forests that is 10km long. For a long time, residents have been demanding the government to increase the height of the bridge. The district administration has assured that a new bridge would be constructed as soon as the state government gives a go ahead. State highways department officials too said they were ready to build a new bridge and had sought details from Sirumugai panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lingapuram-bridge-submerges-again/articleshow/84660169.cms||---

They claimed that ‚Äúthe Narendra Modi government, which is already suppressing the farmers with three new black farm laws, is now adding to that injury by introducing the Electricity Amendment Bill, 2021 that will eventually take away the rights of the state.‚Äù ‚ÄúFarmers, who are demanding the repeal of the three black farm laws, have been sitting on the Delhi borders for the last eight months irrespective of the weather conditions and hundreds of them have been martyred. But the Modi government has opted for an insensitive and shameless stance by not listening to the legitimate demands of the farmers,‚Äù said Mann. Speaking about the Electricity Amendment Bill, 2021, Mann stated that it was the same bill on which discussions had taken place during the 11 rounds of meetings between the farmers and BJP ministers Piyush Goyal and Narendra Singh Tomar. ‚ÄúDuring the meetings, the farmers were promised that this bill will not be introduced. However, later during the all-party meeting, I was told that the promise was made under the condition that if these talks with the farmers reach some positive conclusion, they would not introduce the electricity bill. However, because that dialogue never reached any conclusion, they are now introducing this bill,‚Äù Mann said during a press conference at the party office in Delhi. He claimed that under this bill, electricity will no longer be the right of the states. ‚ÄúThe central government is now snatching electricity rights from the states, like GST, agriculture, health, and education. With this bill, the electricity subsidy that the farmers were getting from the Punjab government will end,‚Äù said Mann, adding that the move will put more burden on them. ‚ÄúIt is under a well-thought-out conspiracy of the Modi government to make farming ultra-expensive, so that the farmers themselves surrender their lands to the capitalists,‚Äù Mann claimed. AAP functionaries said they would continue their protest against the anti-farmer laws at all platforms. They asked the central government to talk to the farmers who are now protesting at Jantar Mantar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-slams-centre-says-it-must-talk-with-farmers/articleshow/84657790.cms||---

The estimated cost of the project will be approximately Rs 155 crore and the civic body has given administrative and financial (A and F) approval for traffic improvement and beautification work at B2 bypass junction in the project works committee meeting (PWC). An official said, ‚ÄúAfter the feasibility report of this work was approved by the Urban Housing and Development (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal, the detailed project report was prepared and submitted. After few corrections and modifications, administrative and financial approval was provided.‚Äù The project was proposed at the place where B2 bypass junction intersects with Tonk Road, which is one of the critical locations that carry a high volume of traffic. The junction has four arms, which majorly connects Ajmer, Jagatpura, Kota and Jaipur. ‚ÄúIt is also one of the major intersections of Tonk Road connecting Durgapura to Sanganer and Pratap Nagar residential colonies to Sitapura Industrial area. Also, the connecting roads carry a major traffic solution due to presence of hotels, wedding areas, shopping malls, hospitals and airport terminal,‚Äù reads the feasibility report. The project also comprises construction of two 600-metre cloverleaf structures, which will facilitate movement of vehicles towards Jawahar Circle and Mansarovar from Tonk Road . ‚ÄúIt will also have pedestrian subway to provide easy and safe access for all the pedestrians,‚Äù added an official Apart from this, a 36-metre high monument will also be constructed under the project. Sources, however, said the project would clash with the construction of the proposed Jaipur Metro Phase-II (India Gate and Ambabari) on Tonk Road. ‚ÄúIt will not only ruin the skyline of the city, but also increase the cost of Metro project in future. For instance, at B2B a Metro station has also been proposed, where the JDA will develop an underpass and a cloverleaf. Once the signal-free project is constructed, the Metro station will be constructed at approximately at 35-feet in the middle of the city,‚Äù said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-gears-up-to-build-rs-155-crore-6-lane-underpass-at-b2-bypass/articleshow/84660248.cms||---

A bench of Justice MSK Jaiswal and member Meena Ramanathan pronounced these two orders after hearing the petitions filed by Nirbhaya Kumar Shah and Abhishek Kumar, who paid a portion of the total amount towards the promised flats at Aliens Space Station in Tellapur on the outskirts of Hyderabad. They were also aggrieved with their bankers which released a part of the loan without verifying if the flats were built or not. The flats were never constructed. The builder invoked force majeure clause and said they could not complete the work for reasons that were beyond their control. A ‚Äòforce majeure‚Äô clauseis a contract provision that relieves the parties from performing their contractual obligations when certain circumstances beyond their control arise, making performance inadvisable, commercially impracticable, illegal or impossible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/consumer-panel-refund-2-flat-buyers/articleshow/84662363.cms||---

The matter came to light when the complainant farmer Subhash Vishnu Rathod (39, a resident of Sai village) approached the branch manager of Union Bank of India in Kali (Daulat) village for a crop loan on July 19. The manager refused to sanction the loan as there was Rs1,17,000 debt against his name as a crop loan. Baffled as he had not applied for any such loan, Rathod tried to find out the reason and came to know that the crop loan was allegedly obtained from the Bank of Baroda in Kalgaon by an unknown person, with the help of bogus documents of the farmer‚Äôs land in Mahagaon. Rathod then contacted the Bank of Baroda branch manager and asked for details, including the name and photo of the person in whose account the sanctioned loan was credited. The manager refused to disclose the information. The farmer filed a complaint with the district collector through the Mahagaon tehsildar on Tuesday, and later filed an FIR against the branch manager at Digras police station on Thursday. Digras police have reportedly started an investigation which could lead them a racket wherein crop loans are procured through bogus documents across the district, which is notorious for farmers‚Äô suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/farmer-files-fir-against-bank-of-baroda-manager-for-fake-loan/articleshow/84655129.cms||---

It also noted that the videos and photographs submitted by police only showed his presence at the Red Fort. Additional sessions judge Dr Kamini Lau granted anticipatory bail to Jajbir Singh after the investigating officer failed to answer the court's query as to whether the presence of the accused at the Red Fort was a grave and non-bailable offence. ‚ÄúThe investigating officer submits that there is no material on record to show that the applicant/ accused was involved in any violence or attacking the police officials. I have also asked the investigating officer if the presence of the accused at the Red Fort was a very grave offence and non-bailable. The investigating agency is also not sure of the same‚Äù the judge said. Advocates Jaspreet Singh Rai and Jasdeep Singh Dhillon, appearing for Jajbir, had sought anticipatory bail on the ground that there was not an iota of evidence to show that he had indulged in violence or incited anyone to commit any violence.

The fixing of digital meters ‚Äúcannot be avoided not only by the taxi owners, but also by the government,‚Äù the division bench held. ‚ÄúNow that the government is implementing the law and our directions, the actions of the government cannot be thwarted based on such frivolous pleas,‚Äù the court stated. During the hearing, when the counsel for the petitioner told the court that the department hasn‚Äôt taken cognisance of the taxi association‚Äôs grievances raised, the bench asked, ‚ÄúAre you seriously suggesting that every taxi person‚Äôs individual grievances should be considered then only digital meters should be fitted?‚Äù The association‚Äôs counsel Nihal Kamat stated that it is not challenging the government‚Äôs orders and that it is ready to fit the meters, but only asked for extension of time to fit the meters and for proper guidelines to be framed by the government. The high court asked it to comply with the directions first. The petitioner stated that fitting the meters is not practical during the pandemic and that the tourism industry has collapsed and that ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù statements are being made by ministers that the meters would be provided free of cost, and that they wouldn‚Äôt have to pay. ‚ÄúYou cannot avoid it,‚Äù the bench told the petitioners. The court said Covid couldn‚Äôt be an excuse for not fitting the meters and said that Covid seems to be coming in the way when fixing digital meters, but not when doing business. The court said it will go against its own orders if it starts entertaining petitions like this and added that it has ‚Äúno intention‚Äù of doing so after it has been directing the government to comply with its orders. The petitioner said the association would comply if guidelines are framed, but the bench stated that ‚Äúthe law is very clear‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fixing-taxi-meters-cant-be-avoided-hc/articleshow/84660327.cms||---

The most common rumour doing rounds across different communities and regions is of vaccine leading to impotency. Then there are rumours about people getting seriously ill, suffering kidney failures, developing pain in legs and even dying after getting the vaccine.  Such has been the negative impact of the rumours that along with the government, various welfare organisations are running awareness campaigns even after six months of vaccine roll-out. Asad Kalyani, a Congress leader, is running awareness campaign for vaccination in Muslim community. ‚ÄúThe most common rumour is a person becoming impotent or falling sick after getting vaccinated. Majority of Muslims are yet to get vaccinated,‚Äù said Kalyani.  ‚ÄúFew of my patients ask me if the vaccine is safe and if it leads to impotency. People should not believe these rumours and they should take the jab,‚Äù said Mukul Choksi, a psychiatrist. With the majority of the tribal community yet to take a vaccine, activists working with this section are also worried. ‚ÄúHere too, the most common rumour is of vaccine leading to impotency. But our attempts are bearing fruit and gradually tribal community members are coming forward to get the jab.

However, compared to the eight-hour downpour experienced near coastal areas till 5.30pm on July 18 ‚Äì which is the wettest day of the season, so far ‚Äì the amount of rainfall experienced on Thursday was lesser. For instance, while the Panaji rain gauge station recorded 8cm of rainfall by 4pm on July 18, only 5cm was recorded in the same duration on Thursday.

While in UP, police have decided to book all those trying to take out the yatra, in Uttarakhand the Rapid Action Force (RAF) has been called to man the state's borders. UPs ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said, ‚ÄúThe kanwar yatra has been banned in its entirety. All kanwariyas will have to stay indoors." He added: "Those kanwariyas who try to cross into Uttarakhand will be booked under provisions of the Epidemic Act." While in Uttarakhand, senior police officials said that those trying to sneak into by force will face action. Uttarakhand police have also sought a few companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) for deployment at the inter-state border areas. The hill state‚Äôs DGP, Ashok Kumar, had earlier told TOI, ‚ÄúPolice are going to enforce the decision of the state government. We are going to take all necessary steps to stop kanwariyas from entering Uttarakhand." Senior police and administrative officials of the two states have held two rounds of discussions already. The first inter-state coordination meeting on the yatra was held on July 6 in Dehradun, followed by another meeting in Haridwar on July 20. Every year, during the month of ‚ÄòShrawan‚Äô in the Hindu calendar, around July-end, lakhs of people -- mostly youngsters-- from UP, Delhi, Himachal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana march to Haridwar to fetch water from the Ganga. They offer the holy water at Shiva temples back home. This year, Uttarakhand scrapped the yatra after facing flak for holding the Kumbh in Haridwar which saw an assembly of lakhs of pilgrims just before the onset of the second wave of the pandemic. The UP government had, meanwhile, decided to go ahead with the yatra but the Supreme Court took a tough stance on it and asked the administration to reconsider its move. The state government then told the apex court that it will not hold the yatra this year.

On a bicyle ride from his Dadar residence to Khopoli, he did not have any emergency identification on him and lay unattended during the crucial golden hour, said ‚Äòbicycle mayor‚Äô Firoza Suresh, who on Thursday announced the distribution of 10,000 emergency cyclist identification cards. TimesViewA cyclist injured in a mishap can get timely attention if he has an I-card with relevant details on him, but the government too needs to make cycling safe. It must create space for cyclists across the MMR. A dedicated strip on roads will ensure bicycles are not bullied by motored vehicles.Khale was taken to a Vashi hospital by a motorist and his friends, but did not survive. ‚ÄúIt was quite unfortunate that we lost him. We want to ensure that any cyclist who is a victim of mishap is not left unattended. We are, therefore, distributing IDs on a large scale so that it is affixed on every cycle. Citizens can check the ID and call up the emergency contact number for the cyclist or rush him or her to hospital and be informed of his allergies and blood group,‚Äù Suresh said. She said the I-cards are being given free and will also be distributed to dabbawalas. The identification cards may be prominently fixed on the bicycle and give details like name, emergency contact number, the cyclist‚Äôs address, his doctor‚Äôs details, any medication being taken or allergies, and his blood group. Suresh said that 2,000 cyclists had already received their identification card. ‚ÄúWe are building a database of all cyclists in Mumbai and will capture ward-wise cyclists with the help of our 24 bicycle councillors appointed recently. We will also pitch for neighbourhood pop-up bicycle lanes and also request the local civic authorities to redesign roads so that these are cycle-friendly,‚Äù she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-i-cards-with-med-emergency-details-for-cyclists/articleshow/84660482.cms||Somit Sen

---||Hyderabad||Telangana & Andhra Pradesh cops visited Israel, deny buying spyware||HYDERABAD: Amid the brouhaha over the Pegasus snooping controversy, it has emerged that Andhra Pradesh and Telangana cops were frequent visitors to Homeland Security expos in Israel scouting for sophisticated surveillance and arms equipment. AP and Telangana cops, however, denied having purchased Pegasus spyware and said their visit was only to know the advancements in anti-terror security areas. But currently, civil rights activist professor G Haragopal‚Äôs phone is under surveillance using the Pegasus spyware. A city-based lawyer‚Äôs WhatsApp was hacked using the spyware. A close perusal of GOs issued on foreign trips of officials revealed that between 2010 and 2018, IPS officials of anti-terror wing of Counter Intelligence and the anti-Maoist wing of Special Intelligence Branch attended the expos and demos in various companies. Most visits took place before 2014 when AP was united. After the bifurcation, it was Andhra cops who were actively engaged in Israel. It may be recalled the UAV and Aerostat purchase move by the police department prior to 2018 had landed then AP Intelligence chief AB Venkateswara Rao in a controversy. Professor Haragopal told TOI: ‚ÄúI was chairman of ‚Äòcommittee for defence and release of professor GN Saibaba‚Äô. He was our student and later, went to Delhi University. When he was jailed, the committee worked for better facilities for him in the jail as he was suffering from several ailments. We were also working on his bail. When the NIA came to me, I told them the same. I do not know why they chose to include me in Pegasus surveillance. The forensic analysis of my phone seems to be inconclusive.‚Äù Similarly, the first investigation report in November 2019 by Citizen Lab of the University of Toronto revealed that Hyderabad-based lawyer Balla Ravindranath‚Äôs WhatsApp was hacked using Pegasus spyware. Ravindranath told TOI, ‚ÄúI got information from both WhatsApp and as well as from Citizen Lab, Toronto. I have been arguing cases of activists branded as Maoists in the court. So, I was targeted.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúThough it looks like a surveillance from the Centre, both Telangana and AP governments should come clean on this.‚Äù Three IPS officials from AP had attended the IV international conference on homeland security. A GO was issued then. Its contents were: ‚ÄúMahesh Chandra Laddha, IG of police, intelligence, who is supervising functioning of the counter intelligence cell, ISI-sponsored cross-border terrorism and anti-Maoist activities, attended the conference and was asked to stay back in Israel after conclusion of the conference for three days for carrying out a certain official task.‚Äù N Sambasiva Rao, the then AP DGP, also visited Israel to participate in demonstration of Skystar 180 Aerostat system. In 2014, the then AP police chief, JV Ramudu, went to Israel to attend a homeland and defence security conference. In 2011, three IPS officers ‚Äî N Balasubrahmanyam, SV Rajasekhar Babu and PHD Ramakrishna ‚Äî visited Tel Aviv to attend a similar conference. The visits first started in 2010 when then additional DGP Kode Durga Prasad Rao visited Israel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ap-cops-visited-israel-deny-buying-spyware/articleshow/84660470.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Business||India tough place for business: US report||NEW DELHI: The US State department has said that India remains a challenging place to do business despite some of the reform measures, such as labour and farm laws, initiated by the government. ‚ÄúNew protectionist measures, including increased tariffs, procurement rules that limit competitive choices, sanitary and phytosanitary measures not based on science, and Indian-specific standards not aligned with international standards, effectively closed off producers from global supply chains and restricted the expansion in bilateral trade,‚Äù it said in the latest Investment Climate Statements. The stand is in line with the US government stance on multiple issues with the India too accusing Washington of maintaining several restrictions. Besides, Indian authorities have often argued that the policies do not violate India‚Äôs international commitments. While liberalising FDI has been a key theme of successive governments, the US complained of stakeholders being left out of the consultation process. It also pointed to FDI rules for aviation, where 100% overseas flows have been permitted, while the substantial ownership and effective control (SOEC) rules that mandate majority control by Indian nationals have not been clarified yet. Similarly, it was critical of ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù FDI policy for insurance sector due to the Indian management and control rider, although the ceiling was increased to 74% earlier this year. A major area of worry is the data localisation and storage requirements. It said RBI‚Äôs order on storing data on payment transactions within the country has led to significant compliance costs and increased risk of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, although American banks have managed to comply with the requirement. Similarly, it was critical of the Personal Data Protection Bill. ‚ÄúThe localisation of all ‚Äòsensitive personal data‚Äô being processed in India could directly impact IT exports. In the current draft, no clear criteria for the classification of ‚Äòcritical personal data‚Äô has been included,‚Äù it said. The other area of concern is the equalisation levy on tech companies, where the US had threatened retaliatory action. It also flagged the retrospective tax issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-tough-place-for-biz-us-report/articleshow/84663396.cms||---

Acting on specific information, Special Operations Team (SOT) sleuths of Bhongir and Malkajgiri Zones on Wednesday night nabbed M Raj Kumar of Bidar in Karnataka near Kothapet fruit market while transporting ganja from Gokavaram area of East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh to Karnataka. Raj Kumar‚Äôs associate and main accused, Ranga Lal, 25, of Bidar, is absconding. Police seized 320 kilos of ganja concealed in the pickup truck driven by Raj Kumar. On interrogation, Raj Kumar confessed that he had migrated from Bidar four years ago and started living at Ambedkar Nagar Colony in Saroornagar in Hyderabad . He had been driving a goods carrier vehicle to transport fruits from Kothapet fruit market to various places. Raj Kumar claimed he knew Ranga Lal, a ganja peddler, as they were from the same area in Bidar. On July 18, Raj Kumar received an order to transport pomegranate load from Kothapet fruit market to Rajahmundry and on July 19 he delivered the load. Before Raj left the city, Ranga Lal met him near Kothapet fruit market and asked him to bring a load of ganja from Gokavaram in East Godavari district during the return journey. After unloading the consignment of fruits in Rajahmundry, Raj met Ranga Lal at Gokavaram on July 20. They went to a nearby Agency area and loaded 152 packets of ganja in the goods carrier covering the contraband with empty trays. Once the ganja was loaded in the goods carrier, Lal left for Bidar in an RTC bus and instructed Raj to deliver the consignment to him in their hometown. The accused procured a kilo of ganja for Rs 6,000 and they were planning to sell it to clients in Bidar for over Rs 10,000 a kilo, SOT Inspector G Naveen said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inter-state-gang-peddling-ganja-busted-320kg-contraband-seized/articleshow/84660524.cms||---

Kumar Chaudhari from Bihar was nabbed by Mumbai cyber police late on Wednesday when he arrived at Borivli from his home town a year after he left the city. Chaudhari claimed he wanted to take revenge and wanted to earn money as he was jobless due to the pandemic. Chaudhari created eight fake accounts using the victim‚Äôs photo for sex chats and increase followers to earn money through his channel. A case was registered last July with Borivli police against an unknown person, said cyber police. ‚ÄúTechnical analysis and cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia helped track the main culprit. The accused has been handed over to Borivli police for a further probe. People should not share personal details on social media that will help others to take undue advantage,‚Äù said cyber DCP Rashmi Karandikar. The victim, a graduate working in Bollywood, learnt about the photos and videos when she got a message on social media from a person in July 2020, informing her that finally he located her. The victim was shocked. Chaudhari had left for Bihar when he failed to get a job after getting a degree in mass media (journalism). TOI learnt that the victim, annoyed with Borivli police for showing little interest for almost a year, contacted joint commissioner (crime branch) Milind Bharambe, who got the cyber team to handle the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-25-year-old-youth-held-for-uploading-morphed-videos/articleshow/84660541.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Pune||8 dead as triple-digit rain lashes 59 locations in Maharashtra||PUNE/MUMBAI: At least 59 places in Maharashtra received triple-digit rain till Thursday morning amid reports of landslides, localised flooding and widespread damage to crops. At least eight people were killed in rain-related incidents across the Konkan division as showers continued throughout the day. Rivers breached the danger mark and the high tide led to flood-like situations, with rescuers evacuating over 700 people. Ratnagiri and Raigad districts were the worst affected. Three people died in a landslide and a swollen Vashishti river forced the evacuation of over 250 residents in Ratnagiri, which received 200mm rainfall in 24 hours. The worst-hit areas in the district were Chiplun and Khed towns which went under nearly 5-6 feet of water, affecting 2,000-5,000 people, said Ratnagiri collector Dr B N Patil. The Ramkund area in Nashik was inundated on ThursdayFour deaths were reported in rain-related tragedies in Palghar district. While two people were swept away in separate incidents, one Abhijit Tamore (21) drowned when a small boat in which he and his two neighbours had set out in to fish for crabs capsized in the periphery of the creek at Dandi in Tarapur. The two neighbours swam to safety. In Maswan, Palghar, one Gautam Dhanwa (18) was electrocuted. Mahabaleshwar received 480mm rainfall in 24 hours till 8.30am on Thursday, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. This was the all-time high rainfall for July for the hill station. An IMD official said, ‚ÄúThursday‚Äôs rainfall (till 8.30am) was also the second highest (24 hour) downpour ever recorded for any month over Mahabaleshwar. The all-time high rainfall of 490.7mm was reported over Mahabaleshwar on August 11, 2008. The third highest 24-hour rainfall at the hill station was 439.8mm on July 7, 1977.‚Äù Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray chaired an emergency meeting to review the flood situation in Konkan and directed the administration to be on alert and evacuate people staying near the banks of the rivers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke to Thackeray over the phone in the evening and pledged assistance to the state in rescue operations. NDRF, SDRF, local agencies, Navy, Coast Guard and the Indian Air Force have been deployed for rescue operations. Disaster management authorities said several villages across the state received heavy cloudburst-like rain. A district official said water from the Indrayani river overflowed into Malavli, Karla and Boraj villages in Pune district. The Lonavla police rescued four senior citizens. Road and rail services in Pune, Lonavla, Mumbai and Nashik were affected and nearly 6,000 passengers were stranded as trains on the Konkan Railway route were suspended. A Central Water Commission (CWC) official told TOI that extremely heavy rainfall caused increased inflow in the west-flowing rivers in the coastal areas of Maharashtra. ‚ÄúMahabaleshwar is the source region for Krishna and Koyna as well as the west-flowing rivers. A close watch has to be maintained in all reservoirs of the Krishna and Bhima and their tributaries in Maharashtra. Sangli, Satara, Solapur, Kolhapur and Pune also need to be on alert,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúThe west-flowing rivers from Tapi to Tadri such as Ulhas (Thane district), Bhogeshwari, Savitri and Kal (Raigad) and Bav (Ratnagiri) were already in spate and are expected to rise further. Authorities need to be on alert in Palghar and Sindhudurg as well. Low-level bridges and railway tracks crossing these rivers could get submerged,‚Äù he added. Vikas Patil, director of agriculture (extension and training), agriculture commissionerate, Pune, told TOI that the crop situation in Maharashtra after the torrential rain was being assessed and the losses would be ascertained in a couple of days. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune, ruled out cloudburst in parts of Maharashtra where extremely heavy rain has occurred in the past two days. ‚ÄúWe had forecast extremely heavy rain in the ghats of Pune, Kolhapur and Satara and more than 200mm rainfall in some locations in a 24-hour period. But several locations recorded over 300mm rain in the state till Thursday morning. This was unusual. The ghats particularly recorded extremely heavy rain due to the current weather systems and the orography of such regions, as they are on the windward side of the Sahyadri range,‚Äù he said. The westerly winds on Thursday packed in speed, blowing at around 50 km/hour from the Arabian Sea over Konkan. ‚ÄúThese winds were saturated with moisture, while the offshore trough from south Gujarat to Karnataka aided in bringing very heavy spells. A low pressure system formed over the northwest Bay of Bengal on Thursday, which further helped strengthen the westerly winds. The Konkan-Goa region has already received surplus rain of 45% so far this season, with 2,032.7mm in its kitty as against the normal of 1,402.7mm. Madhya Maharashtra, whose normal rain up till now should be 315.3mm, has so far received 339.9mm, which is 8% more.‚Äù The IMD has forecast heavy to very heavy rains at places such as Palghar, Thane, Mumbai, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg as well as in isolated places in the ghats of Pune, Kolhapur and Satara on Friday.

He said all of them got 80 marks out of 100, though in the written examination they scored below 50%. Either there was some miracle or corruption. Those who scored less than 50% in the written examination and 80 marks in interview smacks of manipulation and only an inquiry could unearth the truth, he said. He said recently some employees, including a member of the commission were arrested by the ACB for demanding bribe for awarding higher marks in interview for RAS 2018.

Backward classes‚Äô welfare minister Kota Srinivas Poojary said the decision to implement 10% reservation for castes and communities not covered under the SC/ST or OBC categories was a reiteration of the Centre‚Äôs move. The Centre had defined, under its own calculations, the castes and communities which can be provided the reservation. Accordingly, the state government is also putting together a list of castes and communities that are not covered under any of the other quotas,‚Äù he said. The implementation of the 10% reservation in Karnataka had suffered a huge setback due to duplication of castes and communities which were covered in some quota or the other, while others were denied on the premise that they are ‚Äúunrecognised‚Äù under the larger caste bracket. ‚ÄúFor example, the Gaud Saraswat Brahmins (GSB) in the coastal parts had a huge problem securing reservation under the 10% quota due to lack of clarity on who needed to be included and who to be excluded,‚Äù said Poojary. CM Yediyurappa also approved a grant of Rs 3,000 per hectare for every farmer to invest in increasing organic carbon in the soil. The grant will be to a maximum of 2 hectare for every farmer. ‚ÄúSince scientists have been advising the government of the soil losing its organic carbon in Karnataka, we are ensuring that from sowing seeds to purchasing of organic manure and maintaining soil card, a sum of Rs 3,000 per farmer per hectare for a maximum of 2 hectares will be provided,‚Äù said Bommai. Bommai said the government has allocated Rs 75 crore for the purpose, for a period of 5 years, and Rs 10 crore is being released in this fiscal towards this effort. The Yediyurappa cabinet also approved the cashless health scheme of Karnataka Arogya sanjeevani scheme for state government employees and their family members. It will have a financial implication of Rs 250 crore per year, as per estimates. In other decisions, the cabinet approved schemes related to CM Yediyurappa‚Äôs home district of Shivamogga, which is being seen as a farewell gift for the district. These include the approval of 9.3 acres of land for a cow protection society, an AYUSH university and a cancer centre in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-cabinet-oks10-ews-quota-ingeneral-category/articleshow/84663455.cms||---

The three were booked for attempt to murder after they fired at and assaulted a 52-year-old resident of Amreli‚Äôs Maninagar earlier this month.‚ÄúWe have arrested all the three accused in this case and seized a pistol from their possession and a bullet used in the crime,‚Äù a police official said.After Bipin Jethwa, a tailor, lodged a complaint against Raghu Dhandhal, a driver with GSRTC, and two others ‚Äî Rajendra Gohel and Devang Bavaji ‚Äî the cops booked the three for attempted murder, criminal conspiracy and Arms Act for the crime on July 5.A day before, Jethwa along with his family was travelling in an Amreli-Somnath route GSRTC bus which was being driven by Dhandhal. Alarmed by the rash driving of Dhandhal, Jethwa asked him to drive safely which angered the driver who threatened to kill him.Next day, Dhandhal along with Gohel and Bavaji attacked Jethwa at his shop.

---||Mumbai||MVA heat on Devendra Fadnavis, 3 other Maharashtra BJP leaders||MUMBAI: Amid ongoing probes by central agencies against Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress leaders, the MVA government has cleared the decks for a probe into over 1,000 works commissioned under the Jalyukta Shivar water conservation programme during Devendra Fadnavis‚Äôs tenure as CM. Based on the report of a committee that inquired into wasteful spending, the state Anti-Corruption Bureau is likely to be tasked with scrutinising tenders and payments to contractors. While Fadnavis, leader of opposition in the assembly, has expressed willingness to face the probe, the state is also stepping up against 3 other BJP leaders: legislative council bigwig Pravin Darekar, for alleged irregularities in a cooperative bank that was headed by him; Girish Mahajan, who headed the water ministry in the BJP government, and former forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar for a Rs 430-crore tree plantation scheme. The action is seen in political quarters as a tit-for-tat, given the heat generated by the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI against members of the MVA regime. A senior NCP leader conceded that the state‚Äôs hand may have been forced by the political blowback against the MVA in recent months. Fadnavis has been at the receiving end for pouring funds into Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyan, following observations by the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG). But the panel headed by bureaucrat Bijay Kumar has armed the MVA regime with sufficient material to justify a criminal probe. Kumar has recommended an ACB inquiry into 1,173 projects and a departmental probe into 100 projects. Fadnavis has made light of the development, saying he himself as CM ordered an audit, which revealed problems in only 1% of the 6.31 lakh works taken up under the flagship programme intended to rejuvenate groundwater levels. ‚ÄúI am prepared for a probe by any agency,‚Äù he said. His party said Kumar, who conducted the probe, was secretary of the agriculture department from September 2016 to August 2018 when work was underway. Darekar is under the scanner for alleged irregularities in the Mumbai bank. The probe against the bank was closed, but demands from ruling party members prompted the government to order a fresh inquiry. It is alleged that during Darekar‚Äôs tenure, the bank suffered losses. The main charge against the board of directors was that it illegally sanctioned a loan of Rs 116 crore to 59 credit cooperative societies, which was never recovered. Darekar dubbed the charges baseless. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fact that the bank gave loans to cooperative credit societies, but most of them defaulted. I myself approached the crime branch and lodged a case. Following my complaint, several defaulters were arrested. The loan was not given to individuals, but to societies,‚Äù Darekar said. In Mahajan‚Äôs case, the issue is a criminal case of intimidation registered in Jalgaon against him and 30 others on January 21, 2021. The case pertained to the Maratha Vidyaprasarak Trust, which has its head office in Pune. ‚ÄúIt was a political conspiracy against me, I am not involved in the crime at all. An offence has been registered against me, along with my political colleagues, at the behest of local NCP leaders,‚Äù Mahajan said. The case has now been transferred to Pune. Then forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar is under the scanner for a Rs 450-crore tree plantation drive. The issue was raised by Congress state chief Nana Patole. A panel of legislators led by minister of state for forests Datta Bharne was set up to probe the distribution of 33 crore saplings. It was alleged that their survival rate was poor and the much publicized greening plan had failed to take off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mva-heat-on-fadnavis-3-other-state-bjp-leaders/articleshow/84662608.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

While in UP, police have decided to book all those trying to take out the yatra, in Uttarakhand the Rapid Action Force (RAF) has been called to man the state's borders. UPs ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said, ‚ÄúThe kanwar yatra has been banned in its entirety. All kanwariyas will have to stay indoors." He added: "Those kanwariyas who try to cross into Uttarakhand will be booked under provisions of the Epidemic Act." While in Uttarakhand, senior police officials said that those trying to sneak into by force will face action. Uttarakhand police have also sought a few companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) for deployment at the inter-state border areas. The hill state‚Äôs DGP, Ashok Kumar, had earlier told TOI, ‚ÄúPolice are going to enforce the decision of the state government. We are going to take all necessary steps to stop kanwariyas from entering Uttarakhand." Senior police and administrative officials of the two states have held two rounds of discussions already. The first inter-state coordination meeting on the yatra was held on July 6 in Dehradun, followed by another meeting in Haridwar on July 20. Every year, during the month of ‚ÄòShrawan‚Äô in the Hindu calendar, around July-end, lakhs of people -- mostly youngsters-- from UP, Delhi, Himachal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana march to Haridwar to fetch water from the Ganga. They offer the holy water at Shiva temples back home. This year, Uttarakhand scrapped the yatra after facing flak for holding the Kumbh in Haridwar which saw an assembly of lakhs of pilgrims just before the onset of the second wave of the pandemic. The UP government had, meanwhile, decided to go ahead with the yatra but the Supreme Court took a tough stance on it and asked the administration to reconsider its move. The state government then told the apex court that it will not hold the yatra this year. Bijnor superintendent of police (SP) Dharamveer Singh said, ‚ÄúWe have received a joint letter from Uttarakhand‚Äôs director general of police (DGP) and UP‚Äôs ADG (law and order). The higher authorities have asked to prohibit the entry of kanwariyas into Uttarakhand.‚Äù Bijnor borders Uttarakhand and most pilgrims cross the district to reach Haridwar. ‚ÄúWe are alerting village heads and sending out messages asking people to stay indoors,‚Äù the SP said. ‚ÄúPolice in all the districts from where the yatra passes have been put on alert.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ukhand-up-police-brass-move-in-tandem-to-ban-kanwar-yatra-in-entirety/articleshow/84653071.cms||Harveer Dabas

Yelia Sri Vishnumurthy Temple in Sarve village of Puttur taluk, about 65km from Mangaluru, is being renovated at a cost of Rs 1.2 crore. Contributions have come in the form of money and donations from many sections of society. For instance, Girish Gowda Kalenja, a farmer from Belthangady, recently donated 800 one-month-old saplings to the temple. The idea of cultivation took birth when Puttur MLA Sanjeeva Matandoor recently launched a campaign of growing paddy on fallow land in the taluk. This inspired the temple renovation committee led by Sorake Rajarao Mudambadithaya to take up cultivation on a half-acre land belonging to Venkappa Naik Yelia. This land was not being cultivated for nearly three decades. Since the Bramhakalashotava will be held from February 1 to 6 next year and mass feeding is being planned on the occasion, we decided to cultivate the land. When the idea of cultivating paddy was mooted, Abbas Majalugadde, his brother Majalugadde Abubacker Kooduraste and nephew Puttu Beary offered their three-acre land to the temple for this season. The yield from this land will be used during the temple festival,‚Äù Prasanna Rai S, treasurer, temple renovation committee, told TOI. Abbas said, ‚ÄúThis is all we could offer to the temple. We have been cultivating this land for many years, and this our service to the village.‚Äù Abbas guides locals in paddy cultivation by supervising workers in the field. Civil works on temple renovation began on November 11, 2019, and the temple has received Rs 50 lakh in contribution. Besides, 4,200 people have contributed through ‚ÄòShramadana‚Äô or voluntary work. Nearly 60 people are engaged in agriculture activity and transplantation has been completed. A 15-member team led by Shridhar Rao K, who heads managing committee of Shree Sadashiveshwara temple, Kalenja, participated in the cultivation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/muslim-family-loans-3-acre-land-to-temple/articleshow/84670766.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Recently, British oil firm Cairn Energy and Devas Multimedia sued Air India in order to recover arbitration awards they had won against the government. Devas petition filed in a New York court says AI is the ‚Äúalter ego of India‚Äù and ‚Äútherefore jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of India itself‚Äù. In a reply to a Parliamentary question on whether these suits could affect AI‚Äôs divestment, Union minister for state for aviationV K Singh, said on Thursday: ‚ÄúCairn Energy and Devas Multimedia have filed lawsuits in the US‚Ä¶ seeking declaratory and money judgment against AI as an alter ego of the Republic of India. There is no likely impact of the lawsuits on the ongoing divestment process of AI as AI is a separate corporate entity with its own management and board. The case is being defended by AI. The company has pointed lawyers to defend its interests.‚Äù Regarding AI divestment process, he said in a Lok Sabha reply on Thursday that ‚Äúmultiple expressions of interest (EoI) were received by transaction adviser (TA, for divesting 100% stake in AI).

These diseases include hypertension, digestive ailment, diabetes, respiratory diseases, heart conditions and kidney ailment. The report, based on the country‚Äôs largest primary healthcare survey covering 2,33,672 people and 673 public health offices across 21 states to analyse the rising cases of NCDs in India, observed that the burden of NCDs is growing at an alarming rate. Hypertension tops the list among all NCDs as far as Bengal is concerned with 5.13% prevalence rate against national average of 3.6%. The prevalence of digestive diseases in the state was 4.8% against the national average of 3.19% while for diabetes it was found to be 3.53% against the national average of 2.85%. ‚ÄúAmidst the pandemic, people suffering from uncontrolled diabetes and other comorbidities had poorer outcome when exposed to Covid. The pandemic is not just about viruses but also about reducing the number of vulnerable people with adequate medical care. In order to control such pandemic in the future, we need to address NCDs,‚Äù said Ambarish Mithal, chairman and head endocrinology and diabetes on Max Healthcare. ‚ÄúAll NCDs are preventable but in case of stroke, only about 10% people get the requisite treatment within the golden window period that is about four hours.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro resumption brings 200 autos back on streets||KOLKATA: Autos have started plying in nearly 200 routes with the resumption of Metro services after nearly two months. The auto services on these routes that provide commuters with a last mile connectivity completely depend on Metro services for passengers. The smile has returned to the faces of auto operators who were counting days in desperation for the resumption of Metro services. ‚ÄúWe were in a hand-to-mouth situation as the restrictions on Metro got longer than we expected,‚Äù said Arup Das, an auto operator of Kudghat-Karunamoyee route. Many commuters were left in the lurch when autos were not available. ‚ÄúI used to take an auto to reach my home from my office in just seven minutes. But the withdrawal of auto services caused a great inconvenience to me. I had to take a rickshaw by spending double the auto fare,‚Äù said Smritikana Ganguly, a commercial artist with an advertising agency at Tollygunge. She is a daily commuter of the Karunamoyee-Kudghat auto route. Since auto provides the biggest last mile connectivity to Metro commuters in Kolkata, there are around six to 12 auto routes from a single station to different directions. So for, 26 stations on the north-south Metro corridor, which runs from New Garia to Daskhineswar, have more than 200 auto routes. ‚ÄúSome autos started plying but there was no Metro operation. Autos were not getting enough passengers to make the services sustainable. So, many autos on different routes had suspended operation even after resuming the services,‚Äù said Mana Chakraborty, INTTUC president in Kolkata. There are some routes that connect two Metro alignments like the Central Avenue- Kadapara auto service that connects Phoolbagan station of East-West Metro with MG Road station of North South Metro. With the services of both the Metro alignment being suspended, only five per cent of autos could ply, said Mohammed Akram, a member of the route committee. The number of auto routes increased while some routes were realigned with the extension of Metro services. For instance, in February, the Metro service was extended till Dakshineswar from Noapara, which added two more stations like Baranagar and Daskhineswar, from where there are nearly 24 routes. ‚ÄúIn the absence of buses, these autos connect us to the city‚Äôs lifeline. They are reliable, pocket-friendly and easy to park near Metro stations. Since auto routes are designed based on passengers‚Äô demands, their usefulness is immense. If the government regulates them properly, their usefulness will increase,‚Äù said Arindam Base, a transport economist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-resumption-brings-200-autos-back-on-streets/articleshow/84658330.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Hence, with just 2 lakh registration left to reach the ceiling, 20-50 lakh new applications would be received on the food security portal if registration is opened, said an official. ‚ÄúTherefore, it would be difficult to reopen the registration of NFSA beneficiaries with so few left to be registered as per the ceiling set by the Centre,‚Äù said an official. They said the state government doesn‚Äôt have enough resources to reopen the registration of NFSA beneficiaries. The department had also directed the officials to clear around 3.87 lakh pending applications ‚Äî received before closing of the process of registration on May 18, 2020 ‚Äî for adding new names of beneficiaries to the National Food Security Act. Of the total, around 50,000 applications have been cleared, said another official. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to increase the limit on the number of beneficiaries - which was earlier determined based on the 2011 census - under national food security scheme (NFSA) on the basis of the estimated current population (2021) in the state.Gehlot had urged that on the basis of the estimated population of 8 crore in 2021, the government of India should provide food security to an additional 74 lakh persons in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fresh-registration-under-food-act-not-possible-govt/articleshow/84660629.cms||---

The court rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the accused against whom the FIR was to be filed. The matter pertains to an allegation against a 59-year-old businessman who allegedly threatened a man (complainant), and tried to force him to sign an agreement to repay Rs 2.58 crore. The court said that due to the delay in filing the IFR, crucial CCTV footage was lost as officials of Amboli police station failed to take immediate action on the complaint. The complaint approached the magistrate‚Äôs court after the police did not take any action. ‚ÄúThis court is of the opinion that the.. Commissioner of Police, Mumbai, should be made aware of this fact with a request to do the necessary or at least to give directions to the police in Greater Mumbai for doing necessary on such reports immediately, or within a prescribed period as guided in aforesaid case law. Otherwise, it is an injustice with ordinary citizen,‚Äù the court said. The complainant alleged that the accused Naresh Raval had called him to the office of a lawyer for a meeting last year.

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects 2 pleas to quash CBI FIR against Anil Deshmukh||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday dismissed two petitions to quash completely or partly an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and unknown others for criminal conspiracy and offence of undue gains as a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, while dismissing the state‚Äôs petition to delete two paras from the FIR, said the CBI can legitimately inquire into the aspect of transfer and postings of police officers, ‚Äúso also (the) reinstatement of Sachin Waze after 15 years, to the extent those transfers and posting have nexus with offences alleged against then Home Minister and his associates keeping in view the observations of the bench in the order of April 5‚Äù. It added, ‚ÄúConversely,‚Äù the April 5 order ‚Äúcannot be construed as giving unfettered authority to CBI‚Äù to probe transfers and postings ‚Äúgenerally which do not reflect upon the alleged acts and conduct expressly attributed to then HM‚Äù. The HC, noting the state‚Äôs concern, expressed by senior counsel Rafique Dada, of CBI using the April 21 FIR to do a roving inquiry into its administration and demoralising the police force, said the transfer and posting referred to in the para of the CBI FIR which the state wanted gone ‚Äúis essentially linked to allegation of abuse of official position by then home minister and his confederated (sic)‚Äù. The state‚Äôs objection was to two unnumbered paras mentioning Waze‚Äôs reinstatement as API, Waze getting all the sensational cases and Deshmukh‚Äôs alleged ‚Äòexercise of undue influence‚Äô over transfers and postings and hence over performance of police officers‚Äô duties. Deshmukh, 70, through his senior counsel Amit Desai, had said the FIR was ‚Äúvague‚Äù and ‚Äúmotivated,‚Äù and wanted it totally quashed. He said lodging of FIR needed prior sanction since he was a public servant and the state‚Äôs prior consent was needed for CBI to probe. His counsel had said even ‚ÄúAjmal Kasab got the benefit of the rule of law in this country.‚Äù The HC said, about his plea, ‚ÄúThe audacity of the submission that the FIR does not disclose a prima facie offence is belied by the hard facts of the case.‚Äù The HC held prior state consent was not necessary for a CBI probe, ‚Äúespecially when the Division Bench has adverted to the necessity of entrusting the enquiry to an independent agency as it found that cognizable offences were prima facie made out‚Äù. On whether prior sanction was needed as mandated under Section 17A of PCA since Deshmukh was a public servant, the HC said the section ‚Äúis not held by court to be a fetter when a higher court is convinced that impartial probe is needed by an independent agency‚Äù. The HC had on April 5 directed CBI to do a preliminary enquiry (PE) into a complaint by advocate Jaishri Patil, based on ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh‚Äôs March 20 letter alleging ‚Äúcorrupt malpractices‚Äù by Deshmukh who allegedly asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore per month from almost restaurants and bars. The HC also noted it had expressed its anxiety during the hearing on how or whether the probe would be broadbased to ‚Äúinvestigate the acts and omissions of officers who might have had a role,‚Äù apart from Deshmukh. The HC judgment records that CBI, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, assured it about the ‚Äúintegrity of investigation‚Äù and that it would be ‚Äúdone dispasstionately‚Äù as investigation is ‚Äúissue-centric‚Äù. It was not uncommon that a person who sets the law in motion is also eventually indicted, CBI had submitted, adding its ‚Äúendeavour would be to honour the spirit of the order under which the investigation has been directed‚Äù. The HC did not accept the state‚Äôs submission that consistent demand by CBI for former state intelligence commissioner Rashmu Shukla‚Äôs report amounts to derailing or interference of its probe into the leaking of her report. If the state is saying nothing of substance was found in her report, ‚Äúwe are unable to appreciate the steadfast resistance‚Äù by state to share it with CBI, it said. The HC agreed with Mehta, for CBI, that the plea by Singh was to ‚Äúcleanse the system of police postings and transfers allegedly made for extraneous consideration, in future‚Äù. To the state‚Äôs submission that Singh had sought to put past postings and transfers on the radar, the HC said that on April 5, the CJ-led bench had observed that Singh‚Äôs letter raised issues that placed citizens‚Äô faith in police and state machinery at stake, necessitating an independent probe. The HC granted no stay on the dismissal verdicts. To the state‚Äôs plea for stay, it said ‚Äúit was not expedient to stay, else it would amount to interfering with the investigation which is underway‚Äù and to Deshmukh‚Äôs counsel Desai who sought a stay saying question of law was involved, HC saw ‚Äúno justifiable reason to stay‚Äù its judgment. Kamlesh Ghumre, advocate for Deshmukh, later said, ‚ÄúOnce we study the judgment, we will be able to decide the future course of action.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe clarify that the observations are made‚Äù only for the state‚Äôs petition, said the HC, and not on other pending petitions of Shukla and Singh, to be heard on July 28. Inherent powers to quash FIR are required to be exercised in exceptional cases, said the HC. ‚ÄúAt the stage‚Ä¶when the truth is yet to be unearthed, this Court cannot embark upon the inquiry into the correctness or otherwise of the allegations.‚Äù ASG Aman Lekhi for CBI assured the HC that ‚Äúnobody would be spared‚Äù and it would ‚Äúnot play favourites‚Äù and ‚Äúit would be an unsparing investigation irrespective of the rank‚Äù. The bench said CBI must be alive to its responsibility and quoted from Lord Denning on police duties to say ‚Äúthey serve none but the law‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-rejects-2-pleas-to-quash-cbi-fir-against-deshmukh/articleshow/84662676.cms||---
---||Jaipur||200 shady dhabas busted on Jaipur-Delhi highway in a year||JAIPUR: At least 200 dhabas (eateries) on Jaipur-Delhi highway were found to be working in collusion with gangs involved in diesel thefts, milk adulteration and bootlegging, revealed a report titled ‚ÄòOperation Highway‚Äô prepared by Jaipur (rural) police. The operation was undertaken about a year ago and each suspected dhaba was closely examined. Some of the eateries were found to be working as shelter grounds for gangs. Jaipur Rural SP Shankar Dutt Sharma said police had learned about gangs stealing chemicals, diesel and edible oils from tankers which took a brief halt at dhabas. ‚ÄúAt other places, we found truck drivers were working in cahoots with the gangs and allowed ghee (butter) to be stolen from their tankers,‚Äù he said. One particular crime evoked special interest when Shahpura police station learned that some accused were stealing crude oil from an underground pipeline of the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). According to Sharma, all these criminal incidents had one common footprint- dhabas on the national highway. ‚ÄúWe set out to find what was going on at these dhabas. What we found was shocking, the illegal activities had become the mainstay of their business while serving food was just a secondary priority. Primarily because the illegal business earned a windfall for them,‚Äù Sharma said. Since 2019 onwards, a total of 1,643 accused have been arrested for bootlegging, 154 for drug smuggling, 176 for pilfering oil, diesel, milk, etc. ‚ÄúThe main aim was to clear the highway of the criminals that had swamped the long stretch that cuts across many cities,‚Äù Sharma said. Interestingly, police found that many of the complaints pertaining to the loot from tankers ferrying crude oil, milk, and chemicals, had turned into a major criminal enterprise wherein the gangs steal from the tank and mix it with substandard items. On June 6 last year, police found that a gang had stolen ghee from the truck of a branded company. The subsequent investigation revealed that the accused had mixed the branded ghee with chemicals and tried to sell it to local shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/200-shady-dhabas-busted-on-jaipur-delhi-highway-in-a-year/articleshow/84660715.cms||---

A boulevard down the road too has been littered by the plates. On Thursday morning, walkers at the lake expressed dismay at the shoddy manner in which their concerns over pollution caused by the littering was handled by Rabindra Sarobar police and KMDA. "After the report was published in TOI, police and KMDA promptly asked the person distributing food to the underprivileged in thermocol plates to move away from the spot in front of CRC. The car park in front of the club was turning into a litter hole with plates being dumped on the pavement next to the Rabindra Sarobar gate. The litter site was relocated a short distance away," said environment activist Sumita Banerjee. The plates are also being dumped in the boulevard opposite the Rabindra Sarobar entrance that leads to Indian Life Saving Society (ILSS). "The objective is noble, but the used plates thown everywhere have become a menace,‚Äù said emission expert Soumendra Mohan Ghosh, a regular at the lake. Locals said scores of vagrants converge in the afternoon to avail of the free meals. After the meal, the place is littered with plates with no attempt to manage their disposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/styrofoam-garbage-shifted-150m-from-rabindra-sarobar-gate/articleshow/84658401.cms||Subhro Niyogi

A Central Railway official told TOI that boulders fell on the railway tracks due to the landslides and heavy water logging occurred at many spots on the south east ghat section areas before Karjat. The official said restoration work in the ghat sections was on at full pace. The northeast ghat section between Kalyan and Igatpuri (Kasara ghat) also witnessed similar condition due to the heavy and continuous rain. The railway official said the section had been restored for train movements by afternoon. The cancellation of 14 trains left railway passengers in a spot. Ashok Kumar Mishra, a resident of Allahabad coming to Mumbai on Patna-CSMT Special, said, ‚ÄúI had boarded the train around 5:30pm on Wednesday and should have reached Mumbai by 2:30pm on Thursday. But when the train reached Bhusaval, we got to know that it had been cancelled due to the landslides in the Kasara ghat section. I am stuck in Bhusaval with many passengers and we don‚Äôt know how to reach Mumbai,‚Äù he told TOI over the phone. ‚ÄúRailway officials told us that they would adjust as in another train. Social distancing in the time of Covid would go for a toss because we still have a journey of over eight hours to cover,‚Äù he said. Another railway official said around 38 locations, along both the ghat sections, witnessed train disruptions due to water logging, washout of embankments, boulders on the tracks and landslides. ‚ÄúKasara received 136mm of rain in just four hours and Karjat got 86.8mm in an hour. Till 4pm, as many as 34 trains ‚Äî both covering long distances and connecting cities within the state, had to be cancelled. Besides, 26 long-distance trains were diverted and 36 trains short-terminated,‚Äù a senior Central Railway official said. Pune rail division public relations officer Manoj Jhawar said inter-city trains such as Deccan Queen, Deccan Express, Indrayani Express and the Kolhapur-bound Koyna Express were cancelled in the morning. ‚ÄúThis is the first incident of landslides due to rain this year,‚Äù another Central Railway official said. Authorities said restoration work on the Lonavla ghat section was on at war pace. ‚ÄúTwo boulder special trains, four ballast rakes, two Poclain and four JCB machines have been mobilized with labourers and machineries despite the blockage of the highways. The Ambarnath-Badlapur section has been made fit for train movements and the suburban services have been extended from Ambarnath to Badlapur. Ballast filling was done on the Panvel-Karjat section and the section has been given a green light,‚Äù a senior Central Railway official said. ‚ÄúIn the Vasind- Khadavali section, over 100 labourers have completed the repair work. The ‚ÄòUp‚Äô and ‚ÄòDown‚Äô lines between Kasara and Igatpuri have been made fit for train movement. At the southeast ghat section, around 17 points have seen disruptions and four JCB and two Poclain machines with 200 labourers have reached the affected sites. Between Badlapur and Karjat at Bhivpuri Road, about 25 labourers are on restoration work. The condition of the tracks can be assessed once the floodwaters recede on the Badlapur-Vangani section,‚Äù the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/landslips-derail-train-services-in-ghat-areas/articleshow/84660731.cms||Joy Sengupta

Only the overnight vehicles were operational ‚Äì one bus operated from Goa to Mumbai on Thursday by taking the Pune highway route and one from Mumbai to Goa, via Pune,‚Äù Saish Prabhu, proprietor of Manish Travels told TOI, adding that even the passengers on these buses were rescheduling their travel. Paulo Travels did not suspend any of its operations through the day but opted to take an alternative route via Belagavi and Kolhapur to reach Mumbai. This has added a difference of an additional hour or so to the otherwise 15-hour journey. ‚ÄúWe have bookings for both Goa to Mumbai and vice-versa. The buses may be slightly delayed due to traffic congestion, but we cannot do much,‚Äù an employee said. Atmaram Travels has been opting for the Pune route to Mumbai owing to such recurring issues with the direct route to Mumbai. ‚ÄúDue to the heavy rains, we operated only two night travel buses to Mumbai. Since we are used to the route via Pune, we didn‚Äôt have to change our schedule, but the buses that travel via Kankavalli and Malvan were affected,‚Äù said the proprietor, Rubin Gopi. Neeta Travels had suspended its buses to Mumbai due to the second wave of the pandemic. Similarly, the Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC) is currently only operating its interstate buses to a few locations in Karnataka and has no buses going to Maharashtra destinations till August 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-disrupts-traffic-interstate-buses-rerouted-trips-cancelled/articleshow/84660796.cms||Nida Sayed

The grant will be utilised only for the rasoi scheme. The finance department has released the first installment of approximately Rs 6 crore. An official at the directorate of local bodies said, ‚ÄúEarlier, the grant money was sometimes utilised for other projects. In this situation, it would be difficult to fund many works.‚Äù The decision was taken as ULBs in the state were facing financial burden to run the state government‚Äôs ambitious scheme. The urban development and housing (UDH) department on the demand of the district administration and hospitals, had recently announced to make special arrangement to provide fresh and nutritious food to Covid patients. Powers were delegated to the urban bodies and district collector to establish the Indira Rasoi extension counters in hospitals and isolation wards as per the requirement so that the Covid patient as well as their families and hospital staff can get the benefit of the scheme. ‚ÄúAs the work scope was widened, there was a stress to arrange funds too. This is the reason a dedicated fund has been reserved for the scheme‚Äôs successful implementation,‚Äù added the official As part of the scheme, 100 grams of pulses, 100 grams of vegetables, 250 grams of chapati and pickles per plate will be provided to people in 358 Indira Rasois (kitchens) which have been set up in 213 urban local bodies across the state.

Personal talks of own ministers, former chief ministers and opposition leaders were heard by tapping the phone. Therefore, the Congress party demands a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court in the Pegasus espionage case.‚Äù Dotasara alleged that the Modi government had earlier made the veteran leaders of its own party sit at home. ‚ÄúIn the second phase, the Modi government came to power by hiding behind the valour of the army. Forget the promises, when no one other than the government can get the software, who is doing this spying. The central government should disclose this,‚Äù he demanded. Dotasra also used the occasion to attack BJP on the charges of manipulation in the Rajasthan Public Service Commission (RPSC) in the RAS examination 2018 with his relatives getting highest score in the interview. ‚ÄúIf you have the guts, get me investigated in any case.

---||Pune||Pune: Khadakwasla releases water; total stock in dams over 50%||PUNE: Water was released from the Khadakwasla dam into the Mutha river for the first time this monsoon on Thursday after the reservoir‚Äôs storage increased to over 90%. The irrigation department started releasing the water at 2,446 cusec in the afternoon and increased the rate of discharge to 25,036 cusec after 11pm. Irrigation department officials said the water discharge was a precautionary measure as the water level in the reservoir rose above the 90%-mark following heavy spells of rains in its catchment areas. ‚ÄúWater discharge is initiated generally after the level in the reservoir reaches this level. The rate of discharge is increased in a phased manner, depending on the rainfall in the catchments and the inflow of rainwater so that flooding in low-lying areas can be avoided,‚Äù P K Shelar, sub-divisional engineer with the Khadakwasla irrigation circle, said, adding the rate of discharge will be reduced once the intensity of rainfall in the catchments reduces. On Thursday evening, Khadakwasla had 1.9 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water. It is the smallest among the four reservoirs in the Khadakwasla circle and so, was filled to 100% faster. Panshet 60% full, Varasgaon was filled to 51% and Temghar‚Äôs storage stood at 36% on Thursday evening. Water was not released from the three dams on Thursday as the water levels were still below 75%. Meanwhile, the four dams collectively added over 2 TMC of water throughout Thursday, pushing the collective storage to 16.38 TMC (56.18%). The dams had added more than four TMC water since Wednesday morning, when the collective stock had stood at 12.24 TMC. On Thursday morning the storage had increased to 14.24 TMC. Temghar recorded 190mm rainfall till Thursday evening, while Varasgaon and Panshet received 101mm and 95mm, respectively. Khadakwasla received 15mm of rainfall. The stock in Pavana dam, which supplies water to Pimpri Chinchwad, increased to 5.17 TMC (60.7%) on Thursday evening. The catchments of the dam received 89mm of rainfall throughout the day. In the Bhima basin, water storage in Kalmodi and Kasarsai increased nearly to their respective capacities, necessitating water discharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/khadakwasla-releases-water-total-stock-in-dams-over-50/articleshow/84660766.cms||Sarang Dastane

Meanwhile, Dotasra said he is ready for any investigation. Addressing a press conference here Kataria said the recent incidents have dented the people‚Äôs faith in the Rajasthan Public Service Commission. Kataria demanded reducing the marks of the interview to prevent manipulation in the interview so that those candidates scored good marks were not deprived of appointment. Three of Dotasra‚Äôs relatives scored one of the highest score of 80 out of 100 in the interview. Only six out 18 toppers got such high score in the interview. He said all of them got 80 marks out of 100, though in the written examination they scored below 50%. Either there was some miracle or corruption. Those who scored less than 50% in the written examination and 80 marks in interview smacks of manipulation and only an inquiry could unearth the truth, he said. He said recently some employees, including a member of the commission were arrested by ACB for demanding bribe for awarding higher marks in interview for RAS 2018. He said the issue will be raised in assembly in monsoon session.

It was the second such ‚Äúencounter‚Äù killing by Agra Police in five days. Around midnight on Thursday, police were conducting regular vehicle checks at the Jagner crossing in Agra. ‚ÄúTwo men on a motorcycle tore past the barricade. The team present there informed the control room. A chase began,‚Äù Agra SSP Muniraj G said. When the men saw they were being tracked, they ducked into the dense forests of the Kachpura jungle. But just as they turned, the SSP said, the bike skidded. One of them fell. ‚ÄúWe asked them to stop but they opened fire. We asked them to surrender but they kept firing,‚Äù Muniraj G said. ‚ÄúIn retaliation, the police team fired back. One person was injured.‚Äù Another police team followed the other man, the SSP added, who also ‚Äúgot injured during an encounter‚Äù. Both were taken to the community health centre at Kheragarh, from where they were referred to the SN Medical College in Agra. Both died. Police said they later identified the two men ‚Äî Badan Singh, 30, and Akshay Pandey, 28. Badan SinghAkshay PandeyThey had been on the lookout for Singh since last week, when an Agra surgeon kidnapped by the Badan Singh gang and taken away to the ravines of Chambal, their hideout, was rescued by cops after a 30-hour operation. Singh‚Äôs associate driving the car from which the doctor had been picked up and the woman who had ‚Äúhoney-trapped‚Äù him were arrested but Singh and five of his gang members were on the run. One of the five men booked along with Singh, Bhola, surrendered at Etmaddaula on Wednesday night. ‚ÄúBadan Singh was wanted in four kidnapping for ransom cases in Agra alone,‚Äù SSP Muniraj G said. ‚ÄúMadhya Pradesh Police had also declared a reward for his arrest.‚Äù Police records show he was wanted in multiple cases of kidnapping for ransom, attempt to murder and under the Arms Act in Agra. Pandey, meanwhile, faced 17 criminal cases for attempt to murder and under the Arms, Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and Gangster Acts in Agra and Firozabad. He was from Etah. Last Saturday, two robbers who had allegedly looted 19kg gold ornaments worth Rs 9.5 crore from a Manappuram gold loan finance company office after holding the staff hostage were shot dead by the police in an ‚Äúencounter‚Äù 17 km from the scene of the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/gangster-aide-with-chambal-hideout-who-abducted-up-surgeon-killed-in-encounter/articleshow/84653324.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Pune||2016 report on 23 landslide-prone villages in Pune district gathers dust||PUNE: Six years after a report raised the alarm on landslide-prone areas in Pune district, the administration is yet to take full cognizance of the detailed study drawn up for the 23 villages which are in the high-risk area in four talukas. While the administration maintains that it had committed to the construction of safety walls as per the report, the villagers are demanding permanent settlements as was done in case of Malin village that was buried under a landslide in 2014. A detailed report was submitted by College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) in 2016 on the instructions of the District Disaster Management Authority. The Pune district administration was allocated Rs 3.65 crore for this project by the state government. The report was based on a survey of these 23 landslide-prone villages in the district after testing the soil and doing the slope stability analysis for each of the sites. It also marked 10 of these villages as highly prone to landslides. However, according to the district administration, there is stiff opposition from the villagers to shift to safer locations and they are also demanding permanent residences as was done in the case of Malin. Such demands were delaying the implementation of the plan, a district official said. According to the district administration, a meeting was conducted in February this year to take stock of the situation. ‚ÄúConstruction of safety walls to prevent landslides was initiated in five villages in Maval taluka and one village in Bhor. The remaining villages are demanding full rehabilitation. The residents want permanent residences and that has delayed the implementation of the plan. Moreover, Public Works Department that is carrying out the work said two villages listed in the report in Maval taluka, Bhushi and Velhe, need not have such walls. These demands have slowed down work,‚Äù a district administration official said. The administration will now be forced to consider the rehabilitation demand separately and secure funds for it, he added  CoEP professor B Birajdar said their report was in great detail after assessment of all these villages in 2016. It gave the slope stability reports and suggested remedial measures for these 23 villages. ‚ÄúWe had given the proposal for 10 locations which are critical. We are keen to help the administration in the execution, but we are not aware of the progress of the implementation of our report,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2016-report-on-23-landslide-prone-villages-in-district-gathers-dust/articleshow/84660782.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Nagpur||Courts can‚Äôt allow to amend complaint while rejecting it under Civil Procedure Code: Supreme Court||NAGPUR: Maintaining the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court‚Äôs verdict, the Supreme Court has ruled that the trial court can‚Äôt allow the applicant to amend his complaint under Order 7, Rule 11(d) of Civil Procedure Code (CPC) once it was rejected. ‚ÄúThe Order 7 Rule 11(d) evidently covers cases falling within the ambit of clauses (b) and (c) and has no application to a rejection of a plaint. In the circumstances, HC was justified in coming to the conclusion that further direction issued by the trial judge was not in consonance with law,‚Äù a division bench comprising justices Dhananjay Chandrachud and MR Shah said. The case pertains to a civil dispute where petitioner Sayyad Ali had taken a loan from the respondents by providing his property as security at Mouza Kanholi in lieu of repayment. He also lodged a police complaint against the respondents after they executed the sale deed of his property. Eventually, he filed a civil suit on November 26, 2012 against them. One of the respondents challenged his case by stating Order 7, Rule 11(d) of CPC contending that Ali didn‚Äôt seek cancellation of sale deeds on the ground that they were executed only as a security for the loan transaction. Further, no declaration was sought by him to the effect that the sale deeds did not confer any right, title or interest on the respondents. While rejecting petitioner‚Äôs application on August 01, 2017, the trial court granted him time to amend his complaint by paying fees for seeking proper relief. The respondents Prakash Goyal and others then challenged the move in HC. While allowing their revision application on September 14, 2018, the HC held that it was necessary for Ali to seek a declaration that the sale deeds were executed merely as a security for repayment of loan and a failure to seek such a declaration would come within purview of the proviso to Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act 1963. ‚ÄúThe trial court committed an error in granting time to the petitioner to amend the plaint. Where the rejection of the plaint takes place under Order 7 Rule 11(d), there would be no question of granting time to him to rectify the defects,‚Äù the HC judge had held. The petitioner then moved the apex court. The case came up for a hearing before a bench of justices Chandrachud and Shah. ‚ÄúThe Order 7 Rule 11(d) deals with a situation where time has been fixed by the court for correction of valuation or for supplying of requisite stamp paper. Under the proviso, the time so fixed shall not be extended unless the court, for reasons to be recorded, is satisfied that petitioner was prevented by a cause of an exceptional nature from complying within time fixed by it and that a refusal to extend time would cause grave injustice to him,‚Äù the SC judges said before rejecting Ali‚Äôs plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/courts-cant-allow-to-amend-plaint-while-rejecting-it-under-cpc-sc/articleshow/84658588.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

With guidelines being changed depending on the availability of the vaccine stock, the government is making efforts to ensure 1.5 lakh jabs are given daily. Ever since 100 vaccination centres in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) began a drive for high-risk groups apart from urban primary health centres (UPHCs), guidelines have changed. At UPHCs, only second doses were being given. GHMC centres were providing both first and second doses (both varieties) depending on the availability. Availability of vaccine type depends on the second dose requirement in that particular area. After vaccine supply shortage in the past few days, all GHMC vaccine centres were supplied more than 600 doses of Covishield each on Thursday. ‚ÄúThe vaccines will be available at one centre or the other, people can find out from officials and take the dose. We are making all efforts,‚Äù a GHMC official said. Officials were conducting rapid antigen tests on people tuning up for vaccine doses in areas reporting a spurt in Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, in view of short supply of vaccine, districts have been asked to give priority for second dose beneficiaries, but no such guidelines were issued in GHMC. However, second dose was being given preference depending on the turnout on a particular day. Despite rain on Thursday, 1.8 lakh doses were given. ‚ÄúPeople, especially in urban areas, are eager to get vaccine. Also, most people are preferring government vaccine centres,‚Äù an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-govt-eyes-1-5-lakh-covid-vaccine-jabs-a-day/articleshow/84660867.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: FIR against Param Bir Singh, senior cops for extortion||MUMBAI: The Marine Drive police has registered a case of extortion, criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy against former police commissioner Param Bir Singh, serving deputy commissioner (crime branch) Akbar Pathan, assistant commissioner Shrikant Shinde and 6-7 other police officers for allegedly trying to extort Rs 20 crore from a developer. Within hours of filing the FIR, police also arrested builder Sanjay Punamiya, a resident of Marine Drive, and an associate Sunil Jain. They were produced before the 8th Metropolitan Magistrate court, which remanded them to police custody till July 27. Punamiya and complainant Shyam Sunder Agarwal were partners in realty projects in Gorai, Borivli and Bhayander, but they parted ways in 2011 after a dispute. The complaint says Punamiya used his links with Singh over the years to intimidate and extort funds from Agarwal after they fell out. Bldr filed 18 cases against former partner using links with Singh: FIRAn FIR for extortion filed against former top cop Param Bir Singh claims builder Sanjay Punamiya had 18 cases of cheating and extortion filed against former business partner Shyam Sunder Agarwal using his connections in the police force. In 2017, Thane police arrested Agarwal in an alleged Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act (ULCRA) scam involving faking documents to avoid surrendering land to government. After Agarwal was arrested, Punamiya sent an associate Manoj Ghatkar to offer a settlement. Ghatkar met Agarwal's nephews Sharad and Shubam at Param Bir Singh‚Äôs residence, says the FIR. Ghatkar threatened to have them booked under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act unless they paid Rs 20 crore, the FIR said. Of this, Rs 9 crore was paid and Punamiya's associate Sunil Jain was handed over the Bhayandar property of Agarwal. Singh was Thane police commissioner in this period. The FIR says Punamiya continued to threaten Agarwal in the name of Singh to extract the remaining Rs11 crore. In 2021, Punamiya filed another complaint against Agarwal at Juhu police station for threats allegedly made through gangster Chhota Shakeel. Singh was Mumbai commissioner of police then; the case was assigned to the crime branch. Police raided Agarwal‚Äôs Vile Parle office and confiscated documents which were never brought on record, said his advocate Shekar Jagtap.

The initiative will be launched from August 1 in ward numbers 7, 15, 28, and 29. Garbage from 92,000 families, and over 5,000 commercial establishments would be collected from the doorstep, officials said. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said that the initiative has been launched after examining the solid waste management system in Indore city, which holds top rank in Swachh Survekshan of the Union government. According to Patil, the civic body wants to improve solid waste management in the residential areas with the help of source-based waste management. ‚ÄúThe segregation, transport, processing and composting of garbage should be done at source.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Collector offers Rs 8 lakh per acre, displaced farmers seek Rs 70 lakh||HYDERABAD: Siddipet district collector P Venkatrama Reddy on Thursday informed the Telangana high court that the government was ready to pay Rs 8 lakh per acre along with a 200 square yard plot for each of the four farmers whose land was taken away in Kondapaka‚Äôs Duddeda village. However, the farmers rejected the offer and sought Rs 70 lakh per acre as per the market rate. The collector had earlier claimed that the administration took away six acres after the farmers had voluntarily resigned from their land. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy sought to know from the government if it had paid any compensation in lieu of the land taken away from the farmers. The bench had asked the collector to negotiate with farmers and pay them a better compensation. It even asked him not to make distinction between ryotwari pattas and assignment pattas as the high court had already ruled in Mekala Pandu case that assignee farmers should be paid on a par with regular patta holders. All the farmers in the current case were assignees who have been cultivating the land. The bench had earlier rejected the razinama theory proposed by the collector amid allegations by the farmers who said it was a fraud played out by the collector himself. State counsel Harender Pershad said that since the farmers themselves had submitted razinama, the government need not pay any compensation. ‚ÄúBut, we are ready to pay some amount to them,‚Äù he said. The bench sought a rejoinder from the counsel of the petitioners and posted the case to September 23. Stating that the collector‚Äôs version was unacceptable to them, counsel for the farmers H Venugopal said the land of the farmers was not taken away from the petitioners for the purpose of constructing a collectorate complex. ‚ÄúIt was given to Yapral Narasimha Reddy but the collector is saying that it was done to compensate him for the land he gave to the state to raise double bedroom houses elsewhere,‚Äù he said. The counsel expressed doubts in the claim since the farmers in the current case were not given any alternative land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/collector-offers-rs-8l-per-acre-displaced-farmers-seek-rs-70l/articleshow/84660915.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Oppn gets into aggressivemode to checkmate TRS||Hyderabad: In the last few months of the second term of the TRS government, the opposition parties have become vocal by organising agitations, protests and padayatras against the government‚Äôs policies and functioning and also by engaging in a war of words with ministers and ruling party legislators. The increased political activity is not specific to Huzurabad where bypolls are scheduled, but revolves around various issues affecting the state. The BJP was aggressive on issues like podu land, flood relief payment and Covid-19 management in the state. Now, the Congress has stolen a march over the BJP by taking up various agitational programmes on issues like increased oil prices, land auction by the state government and alleged phone tapping. With Congress upping the ante, the TRS government even issued a rejoinder on the allegations made on land auction in Kokapet. TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy even highlighted how Hyderabad infrastructure has taken a beating with the advent of rains and tried to pooh-pooh TRS ministers‚Äô claims of turning Hyderabad into a world-class city. If Revanth is forcing his way, YSRTP chief YS Sharmila is gearing up to conduct agitations on various issues, including podu land issue. She has already announced that every Tuesday her party will take up protests and hold deekshas demanding issuance of a job notification. An agitational programme was to be taken up on Wednesday but was called off due to heavy rains. ‚ÄúMore than inducting leaders from other parties into our party we will focus on fighting people‚Äôs issues,‚Äù she said. Congress MLA Danasari Anasuya alias Seethakka came forward to take up non-stop protest programmes demanding solution to podu land issue in tribal areas. While the left parties are yet to become active, they announced that they will support Anasuya‚Äôs agitation. TJS founder professor M Kodandaram has also expressed solidarity with Seethakka. Mahajana Socialist Party president Manda Krishan Madiga said time has come for oppressed sections in the state to unite and defeat the TRS. Political observers, however, said the tempo in agitations and protests was expected. ‚ÄúEspecially during the middle of the second term of any government, opposition becomes restless to unseat the ruling party. They intensify their activities. Interestingly, all the opposition parties have new chiefs in the state,‚Äù political analyst S Ramakrishna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/oppn-gets-into-aggressivemode-to-checkmate-trs/articleshow/84660943.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Both the PMC and the PCMC are currently taking vaccines to residents of slums and the bedridden. These are special drives ‚Äî some relying on mobile units ‚Äî as such beneficiaries are often unable to reach vaccination centres or are residents of congested neighbourhoods that immediately need vaccine cover. The drives also need good supply. Officials from the PMC said the 21,000 Covishield doses they had received on Wednesday evening were completely used up by Thursday evening. In Pimpri Chinchwad, PCMC officials said special-drive beneficiaries are now being accommodated in regular vaccine queues due to shortages. PCMC chief Rajesh Patil said that vaccine outreach programmes have been affected due to the weak supply. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said region officials are currently helpless as supply is sent from the Centre. ‚ÄúThe only consolation is we have been told that supply to private and civic sites (statewide) will improve from August. Small hospitals seeking less than 6,000 Covishield and 2,880 Covaxin doses will get their supplies from Friday,‚Äù Deshmukh said. He added that another vaccine batch for the month is expected on Friday evening. For Friday, the PCMC is set to hold Covishield drives from 63 sites for the 18-plus group. Four sites will host Covaxin drives. On Thursday 59,130 beneficiaries were vaccinated across Pune district.

It is from here that Mumbaikars receive a continuous supply of clean water from their taps each day. Any disruption to the plant‚Äôs functioning, like the recent flooding, can affect the quality of potable water. BMC engineers have to ensure that the plant runs smoothly.‚ÄúAfter clearing up waterlogging at the plant, cleaning of the entire system and repairs were taken up on a priority basis. We have tried to ensure that the distribution of water supply is least affected. From Friday, residents should get clean and clear water,‚Äù said Ajay Rathore, chief engineer of the BMC‚Äôs hydraulics department. The BMC, though, had requested citizens to boil drinking water before use following Sunday‚Äôs shutdown of the Bhandup flitration plant. In Worli, advocate Dhanpal Jain said muddy water in taps raises concerns of water-borne diseases. ‚ÄúWe are already living through a pandemic and public health cannot be put at risk any further.

The outflow of the reservoir was 200 cusecs. Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, officials also opened three floodgates of Himayatsagar reservoir, and discharged floodwater into Musi River. With this, five floodgates of this reservoir have been opened. Officials immediately alerted the Hyderabad district administration and requested to take precautionary measures in downstream areas and urging it to evacuate people on either side of the Musi. Residents of Bandlaguda, Hyderguda, Langar Houz and Karwan along the Musi were alerted about the flood threat. Meanwhile, Sangam Ghat near Bapu Ghat of Langer Houz is inundated due to river overflow after twin reservoirs gates were opened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/floodgates-of-osmansagar-also-opened/articleshow/84659543.cms||Sunil Mungara

It also asked the state government to present a report on district-wise medical infrastructure. The bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing the petitions filed by Shivani Kaushik, Gaurav Kumar Singh and others, also asked the state government to provide details about the current status of vaccination against Covid-19 and number of active cases. The court has asked chief secretary to file a counter affidavit on all the issues in the next hearing which has been scheduled for July 26 along with the counter affidavit giving complete information about the ESIC hospital-Bihta, which was converted into a Covid-dedicated hospital. The dean of ESIC-Bihta and the state government were supposed to present the complete information about sanctioned strength of beds, manpower (doctors, nurse, ward boy and security personnel), medical equipment and other infrastructure of the hospital. However, they failed to provide their counter affidavits during the hearing on Thursday, due to which the hearing on the matter was adjourned till next Monday. The counsel of the petitioner, Nikhil Singh, said the state government has to reply on daily cases of Covid-19 and status of medical infrastructure in districts. ‚ÄúThe state government failed to submit counter-affidavit on Thursday. So, the court has asked them to submit it by Monday. The court has also said the state government should have informed it earlier rather than wasting the court‚Äôs time,‚Äù Singh added. As per sources, against 247 sanctioned posts of nursing at ESIC hospital, only 56 are filled. Similarly, there are 21 and 118 sanctioned posts of ward boys and housekeeping staff, of which only nine and 50, respectively, have been filled. The court also heard the petition to increase the honorarium of doctors reinstated on contract in the state. After hearing the matter, the court directed the principal secretary of health department to take a decision on representation filed by the doctors on contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/list-measures-to-tackle-third-covid-wave-hc-to-bihar-govt/articleshow/84657852.cms||Faryal Rumi

Many by-lanes in Sitarampur area near Ramannakunta lake at Bowenpally in Secunderabad Cantonment reported heavy water logging. Unfinished laying of sewer lines to prevent sewage into the lake is one reason for inundation of streets. ‚ÄúOur troubles have been continuing for the past nearly three decades and we do not know when we will get rid of them,‚Äù Sai Kiran, a resident of Sitarmpur told TOI. All the rainwater is now entering the bylanes and causing inconvenience, said Kiran. SCB senior superintendent (SWM), M Devender said they tried to complete the sewer lines works ahead of monsoon, but were delayed due to shortage of labour. ‚ÄúThe rainwater coming from upstream areas of GHMC, now flowing in the by-lanes, instead of the lake,‚Äù Devender said. In fact, special teams have been deployed at Ramannakunta lake to tackle any flood situation, he said. While over 500 families of another 15 colonies along the nalas in SCB ward no-VI, also under the grip of panic after water levels at Hasmathpet lake reached full reservoir level. Last October, water overflowed from this water body and the retaining walls of the Cantonment‚Äôs nalas were completely washed away. Keeping in view the flooding of the areas in 2020, several residential welfare associations (RWAs) have sent representations to the cantonment board for strengthening the nalas, but till date, the works have not been initiated on ground. The superintendent said they had inspected the lake last month and found that some civil works were in progress at the bund portion. A total of eight special teams have been formed to tackle incessant rains related issues to cover all eight SCB wards in the Cantonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/20-colonies-face-flood-threat-as-water-in-two-secbad-lakes-rise/articleshow/84659657.cms||Sunil Mungara

Ashish Vashisth has been sent to three days in police custody after it emerged that Delphia labs had allegedly conducted fake tests and provided staff to upload forged test reports on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal. The SIT found that Max Corporate Services, which was not ICMR approved, had signed an MoU with Nalwa labs and Dr Lalchandani labs to become eligible as one of the agencies tasked with conducting the tests in Kumbh by the state government. But when it came down to on-ground testing, Nalwa labs said it did not have sufficient manpower and signed another agreement with Delphia lab to provide staff to conduct the actual testing and uploading of reports, the SIT found. ‚ÄúThe FIR in the matter did not name Delphia, we found its involvement during investigation,‚Äù said an SIT official. Nalwa Laboratories, Dr Lalchandani and Max Corporate Services are named in the FIR. Last month, Haridwar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr S K Jha was also questioned by the SIT after it found that Delphia was one of the firms that was awarded a contract to provide free first-aid services at Kedarnath in Rudraprayag. Jha was the CMO of Rudraprayag at that time. SIT officials TOI spoke to on Thursday said the investigation in the matter is on. SIT head circle officer Rakesh Rawat told TOI that it was Max Corporate Services which introduced Delphia labs to Nalwa labs. ‚ÄúDelphia also submitted bills to the tune of Rs 4 crore for testing to Max Services which submitted them to the government,‚Äù he said. Directors of Max Corporate Services, Sharad Pant and Mallika Pant, had got a stay in June from the high court on their arrest, Rawat said. Earlier, a detailed investigation had found that nearly a lakh fake tests were conducted in Kumbh. In one instance, a single phone number was used to register over 50 people while one antigen test kit (which has an exclusive number and is meant for single use) was shown to have tested 700 samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/director-of-lab-which-conducted-fake-kumbh-tests-held/articleshow/84656087.cms||MS Nawaz

The couple runs a computer coaching centre and stays in the same building at Yerawada, where the woman, too, resides. Police said the woman told the couple that the government had floated a scheme under which land can be purchased at a cheap rate. Through some glib talk, she convinced the couple to give her Rs27lakh, which the husband-wife did, following which she gave them forged and fabricated land documents, police added. ‚ÄúThe arrested woman had told the couple that she was an officer with the state revenue department. The arrested woman also promised to inform the victims about government schemes, which helps common people at large,‚Äù police said. Police said, ‚ÄúIn October 2020, the arrested woman informed the victims that the government would be selling some land in the city to common people at cheap rates. The victims evinced interest in the scheme‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn January and February this year, the arrested woman called the victim to the collector‚Äôs office and other government offices. This was done to impress the victim,‚Äù police said. ‚ÄúThe woman then promised to allot a land parcel within the city to the victims and asked them to pay Rs27.50 lakh in cash. After receiving the amount, the arrested woman provided fabricated receipts of the state treasury to the victims,‚Äù police said. Police said, ‚ÄúShe also issued fake and fabricated documents stating that a land parcel has been allotted to the couple.‚Äù Police claimed, ‚ÄúAs the arrested woman is a housewife, she might have taken the help of other persons to prepare the fabricated receipts of the state treasury and other land documents. More persons will be arrested soon in the case.‚Äù Police have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any document which he knows or has reason to believe to be a forged document), and 472 (counterfeits any seal, plate or other instrument) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/yerawada-woman-held-on-charge-of-duping-couple-of-rs27l-after-posing-as-revenue-officer/articleshow/84658838.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal Higher Secondary results give us a fighting chance: Other board students||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education‚Äôs decision not to award a deluge of high scores to its Class XII boards candidates offered hopes for an even playing field for students from all boards and councils, when it came to undergraduate admissions. Unlike Madhyamik, a limited number of Higher Secondary students has scored above 90%, leading principals of several colleges to point out that now, CBSE and CISCE Class XII scores would determine how the college admission scene played out. CISCE and CBSE marks are likely to be better than last year but if the two boards awarded too high marks, the principals apprehend, there will be a rerun of 2020 admissions. ‚ÄúThe results of board examinations are very relative in these situations. A lot will now depend on how CBSE and CISCE award marks. If they give high marks, then those from HS might find it a little tough. Otherwise, it will be a level playing field,‚Äù said Siuli Sarkar, principal of Lady Brabourne College. Soumyadipto Pal, an ISC candidate, said, ‚ÄúI am a medical aspirant. But as fewer HS candidates have scored above 90%, and even above 80%, this year, I plan to apply in some of the premier colleges for general degree programmes as well.‚Äù He added that considering the new formula devised by the CISCE, he expected better score this year than those who took the boards in 2020. Last year, many students made it to the merit lists of multiple subjects by dint of the high marks they scored from the formulae devised for cancelled papers due to the pandemic, but did not ultimately take up those seats as they did not have a knack for those subjects. As a result, the deserving ones and those genuinely interested candidates had to wait for a long time before their turn came for their chosen subjects in their preferred colleges or had to settle for institutes they were not keen on. A principal at a government college pointed out that last year, so many Class XII pass-outs had scored above 90% that they had made it to the cut-offs of almost all subjects and also, applied to multiple ones, but subsequently, never took admission in those fields. ‚ÄúThis kept the seats vacant and colleges had to reopen admission portals several times to invite more applications. This year, the HS results at least indicate that such a situation can hopefully be averted,‚Äù said the principal. Many colleges have been preparing in advance so that a long-drawn admission process, like that in 2020, can be averted. ‚ÄúWe have devised a formula, which will take marks in various subjects into consideration to compute qualifying marks. The merit list will be drawn up on that basis,‚Äù Madhumanjari Mandal, principal at Scottish Church College. Many colleges waited for HS results before coming up with a detailed admission notice. Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira in Belur has uploaded a notice on its website with details of how to apply and listing out important dates.‚ÄúInterested students can visit our website to get all details. Various departments have determined the admission criteria,‚Äù said Swami Ekachittananda, principal of the college. The HS results saw the pass percentage rise to 97.5 from 86 in 2020. But only 9,013 candidates were placed in the 90%-100% zone. In the 2020 HS exams, the number of examinees scoring above 90% had witnessed a nearly four-fold jump, with as many as 30,220 scoring this high. The huge rise in students scoring above 90% last year had made it difficult for ISC and CBSE students to get college admissions. A CBSE school principal pointed out that the rational marking by the HS Council would allow students from CBSE to compete with state board students, unlike last year, when some of the candidates, despite bagging 92% in CBSE Class XII, found seats in second-grade colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hs-results-give-us-a-fighting-chance-other-board-students/articleshow/84658880.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Tillari dam authorities were forced to discharge additional water from the reservoir as a preventive measure that saw the Tillari river water level rising to 40.3m close to the danger level of 43.6m. This consequently resulted in Chapora river flooding the low-lying areas in Sal. The footbridge at Sal was also nearly submerged, creating panic amongst villagers. The rainfall recorded in Tillari region on Thursday was 71.6mm. Similarly, release of water has been in progress from the Anjunem dam reservoir which rose to 88.4m, consequently leading to rise of around 4m in water levels of Kashti and Valvanti river at Sakhali and Kerim respectively, as well as Bicholim river. This led to flodding in low-lying areas in Sakhali, Bicholim and vicinity. Authorities of the water resources department (WRD) commenced pumping out water from Sakhali and Bicholim rivers to avoid flooding in the main town. Excess water was also discharged from Amthane dam. Bicholim disaster management cell‚Äôs in-charge and Bicholim mamlatdar, Pravinjay Pandit said the situation is under control.

The TBM started excavating this stretch from the Civil Court station site four months ago and in the process, tunnelled under the Mutha river. Another TBM, excavating a parallel tunnel, is likely to reach this site in the next few days. Both TBMs are set to cover around 678 metres each. Two tunnels are being excavated ‚Äî one each on the up and down lines on this route. A MahaMetro official said they faced no major hurdles during the excavation between Civil Court and Budhwar Peth stations. ‚ÄúIt is an important milestone.

The work on the elevated and underground portions of the Metro corridors has been expedited,‚Äù Brijesh Dixit, managing director of MahaMetro, said. The Metro will run underground from the College of Agriculture to Swargate stretch. Of the 12km underground work (including the up and down tunnels), MahaMetro said it has so far completed 7km of work. A total of three TBMs have been deployed for excavation of tunnels.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand high court questions state on stone crushing policy||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Thursday questioned the state government on its stone crushing policy and the fact that it is yet to demarcate residential, silent and industrial zones. The court observed that it is "surprised that the state is having such a casual attitude about its own future". The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma remarked that the policy goes against the court judgment where guidelines were issued prohibiting any stone crushing unit within half a kilometre radius of a forest. The new policy titled 'Stone-Crusher, Mobile Stone-Crusher and Hot-Mix Plant Policy 2020', however bans stone crushers only in the 300m radius. The court said the government is effectively ignoring the water pollution control Act, noise pollution rules and saying that it will come up with its own policy. ‚ÄúHow can that be? The policy has to be in consonance with law,‚Äù the court observed. The bench was hearing over 35 petitions challenging the state‚Äôs policy or the permissions given to individual stone crushers for functioning. It pointed to a 2010 judgment where it issued guidelines for the functioning of the stone crushers. The court expressed its displeasure over the argument by the pollution control board (PCB) that any land where a stone crushing unit has been given licence automatically becomes an industrial zone according to the state government. The court was also informed that the state is yet to demarcate lands as per the guidelines of the noise pollution control rules. According to these rules, the lands were to be categorised into residential, industrial and silent zones. ‚ÄúState will have to come up with an idea where you are going to put up your industrial hub. It can‚Äôt be that industries are cropping up every half a kilometre. What sort of planning is that? It will lead to total chaos and I am surprised the state is keeping such a casual attitude about its own future. It doesn‚Äôt seem to understand what planning is then,‚Äù the court observed. The PCB, meanwhile, said that it had come up with a draft notification last month on demarcation of land in the state and the draft has been sent to the state government as well. The government has come up with its notification based on the PCB‚Äôs draft. The court has now given the government and PCB till August 12 to place these notifications and listed the case for further hearing after that. The next hearing, the court said, will be in the physical court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-questions-state-on-stone-crushing-policy/articleshow/84656142.cms||Prashant Jha

By Thursday evening, the dam was releasing water at 2,100 cusec. The dam's catchment areas received 299mm rainfall in the 12-hour period ending 8pm on Thursday. The Warna dam‚Äôs catchment area, along the Warna tributary of the Krishna river, experienced a cloud burst-like condition. The irrigation department initiated the release of water at 22,000 cusec. The discharge from Koyna and Warna increased the Krishna river level by around 15 feet in just 12 hours. The river was flowing at 28.3 feet at Sangli‚Äôs Irwin bridge at 8pm on Thursday. The warning and danger marks for the river at Sangli city are 40 and 45 feet, respectively.

The downpour has wreaked havoc in Udham Singh Nagar district, leading to inundation and traffic snarls at many places. The farmers in this area ‚Äì also known as the rice bowl of Uttarakhand ‚Äì are particularly distressed as standing water in fields can damage paddy and sugarcane crops. Rains caused water logging at several places in Rudrapur, including the city‚Äôs main market, Awas Vikas colony, Ghaas Mandi, Model Colony and Civil Lines. Manish Kumar, a resident of Awas Vikas colony, said it has become risky to drive two-wheelers on roads. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much water in the potholes that we can‚Äôt see them. We don‚Äôt know when to brake. It‚Äôs very dangerous,‚Äù said Kumar. R K Singh, meteorologist at the G B Pant University in Pantnagar said that on Thursday, ‚ÄúKashipur received 07 mm of rainfall, Bazpur 03 mm, Rudrapur 49 mm, Kichha 49mm, Sitarganj 29mm and Khatima 27mm. ‚ÄúThe Baigul, Kali, Krishna, Sookhi, Kalyani, Sharda, Fikka and Gola rivers in the district are running at full flow. With rains predicted in the next couple of days, these rivers may cross the danger mark,‚Äù he warned. Pithoragarh in eastern Uttarakhand is faring no better. Heavy rainfall and landslides triggered by it have disrupted normal life in the district. More than a dozen roads including the National Highway 9, connecting Pithoragarh to Tanakpur, have been blocked at multiple places for the past three days. This has affected the supply of essential items in the district. ‚ÄúOur vegetable trucks take a 70-km long route to reach Pithoragarh,‚Äù said Mohammad Saleem, a vegetable vendor. The Pithoragarh road was blocked since Tuesday but was opened for a few hours on Wednesday, only to be blocked again at night at Swala, Dhaun, Bhartoli and Chupkot, informed the National Highway Authority of India. In the adjoining district of Champawat, traffic movement has been restricted. ‚ÄúNo vehicular movement is allowed in the district between 6pm and 6am,‚Äù said T S Martolia, additional district magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/heavy-rain-batters-terai-pithoragarh-supply-of-essentials-impacted/articleshow/84656164.cms||Aakash Ahuja

As a result, wastewater from the nullah entered several houses in the Ramanand Nagar and Shahupuri Kumbhar Galli localities of Kolhapur city. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) had deployed teams to extract the stranded residents. Ranjeet Chile, KMC‚Äôs chief fire officer, said, ‚ÄúMost people, even when in distress, are not willing to evacuate. Most of the people have moved to the top floors of their buildings and are sending back the rescue boat. The water level had receded later in the day. However, 30 people have been evacuated from their homes and have been shifted to the KMC school in the Jarag Nagar area. Parts of Sutarwada, Shahupuri 6th lane and Nagala Park were affected.

The task is being taken up by Green India Challenge (GIC) by involving nearly one crore people including TRS party workers right from ordinary members to ministers, NGOs, and people from different areas and professions. ‚ÄúDuring chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao‚Äôs birthday, we had targeted about one-crore sapling ‚ÄòKoti Vruksharchana‚Äô plantation in February. We succeeded in planting about 1.7 crore in a single day. About 1,500 saplings from Kadem nursery were brought for the programme in February. Now three crore saplings are available in our state,‚Äù Green India Challenge founder and MP Joginapally Santosh Kumar said. Of the three crore saplings, one crore will be planted in Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority jurisdiction, and two crore will be planted in districts. As KTR is also working president of TRS, ministers, MPs, MLAs and MLCs have already started preparations in their respective districts and constituencies. For instance, Ibrahimpatnam MLA Manchireddy Kishan Reddy identified three land parcels each with 10 acres area exclusively for the plantation programme. Many leaders are preferring plantation in Miyawaki style to plant more saplings in less space. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also agreed to join the green movement of Green India Challenge during the monsoon on the request of TRS MP Santosh Kumar. On July 4, over 10 lakh saplings were planted in one hour under Green India Challenge on the occasion of MLA Jogu Ramanna‚Äôs 58th birthday in Adilabad district. This achievement was submitted to Guinness Book of World Records challenging the existing record of plantation of 3,03,000 saplings in Turkey in 2019. It also received appreciation certificate from representatives of Wonder Book of Records for successfully executing the task in Durga Nagar region. Recently, Mahabubnagar set a new Guinness Record for the ‚Äòlargest seed ball sentence‚Äô at a programme organised as part of Green India Challenge||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/three-crore-saplings-to-be-planted-across-telangana-on-ktrs-birthday/articleshow/84661318.cms||---
---||Nagpur||House rejects Nagpur Municipal Corporation‚Äôs move to double development charges||NAGPUR: Almost six months after the administration doubled the development charges, the general body of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Thursday passed a resolution and prevented the civic body from levying 100% revised charges. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed cancellation of the notification issued by the administration. Earlier this year, NMC had doubled the development charges in the city with retrospective effect from July 2016. Development charges for residential constructions have gone up from 2% to 4% of the total cost of land and construction, while they were 8% instead of earlier 4% for commercial constructions. ‚ÄúThe decision has hit hundreds of builders and thousands of individual house owners, who paid development charges on or after June 30, 2016. For major projects, the additional charge has run into lakhs,‚Äù ruling party leader and BJP corporator Avinash Thakre said in the meeting while submitting an adjournment motion and demanded to reject the administration‚Äôs move to levy the doubled development charges. The state government approved NMC‚Äôs proposal on November 3, 2020, and the civic body issued a public notice in newspapers on January 13, 2021. NMC had doubled the charges to raise money for its contribution towards Nagpur Metro project, which is 5% (or Rs434 crore). Against its share, the NMC had provided 9 pieces of land to MahaMetro, which comes to around Rs73 crore, while for the remaining contribution, it needed funds. As NMC was unable to pay its share, the officials decided to double development charges. The extra 100% development charge will be known as ‚Äòcity transport fund‚Äô and will be provided to MahaMetro, said municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. He also pointed out that being a partner, NMC will have to bear profit and loss on operation of MahaMetro. He informed the House that while allowing NMC to double development charges, the state government had offered four other options to pay its contribution to MahaMetro and they included transfer of development rights, public private partnership, advertisements and funds generated through stamp duty. To this, Thakre pointed out that the NMC is yet to receive stamp duty of Rs268 crore from the state government and it should be adjusted towards NMC‚Äôs contribution. Similar charges were revised in Mumbai and Thane by respective municipal corporations and nowhere permissions of the general body was sought, the civic administration informed the House while justifying its stand. Former mayor and MLC Pravin Datke pointed out that NMC is paying excess money to MahaMetro. ‚ÄúInstead, we should recover money from them for using our properties to construct pillars,‚Äù he said. To this, Radhakrishnan informed the House that NMC has already demanded Rs1,000 crore from MahaMetro for constructing its pillars (right of way) in road medians and other places in corporation limits. ‚ÄúHowever, the latter has rejected our demand claiming no such charges were recovered from Metro rails anywhere in the country,‚Äù the commissioner said. Other decisions GB directed the administration to send a proposal to state government to consider naming the exhibition hall coming up at Ambazari garden area after Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Mayor directed the administration to utilize artificial intelligence services to monitor two garbage lifting companies Order has been issued to appoint competent officers to monitor GPS-enabled vehicles of both the firms Directive has been issued to release funds for development works by following the budget of the standing committee chairman Nod for additional funds and constructions of elevated storage reservoirs Mayor directed the administration to approach state government to extend land lease for setting up long-pending demand of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar memorial near Yeshwant stadium||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/house-rejects-nmcs-move-to-double-development-charges/articleshow/84658678.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The team members have also suggested other improvements in operational practices. The team visited the Vaikunth crematorium to check the pollution levels following complaints from residents. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said the experts‚Äô suggestions include training staff operating electric crematoriums and improving the way in which the bodies are handled. The chimney already has a couple of scrubbers. With the addition of another scrubber, the smoke coming out can be better filtered. The issues of location and height can be sorted out up to a large extent with the additional scrubber, experts claimed. ‚ÄúThe team‚Äôs suggestions will be implemented. The experts have also given suggestions to control the smoke and improve the standard operating procedures,‚Äù said Shrinivas Kandul, a senior PMC official. The civic body has installed sensors to check the air quality at residential and commercial establishments located around Vaikunth. The presence of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur particles will be checked. The air quality of the area will be compared with other neighbourhoods in the city, to see if locations around the crematorium are more polluted. The team of experts has also installed temporary sensors to monitor air pollution in real time for their study. There are 24 electrical- and gas-operated cremation facilities within PMC limits. Civic officials claimed that they are using eco-friendly methods, like the use of white coal, to cremate bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-suggest-ways-to-check-pollution/articleshow/84658920.cms||---

Senior officials at St Lawrence communicated with the board after a section of students and their parents pointed out anomalies between the Class X candidates‚Äô scores in Class IX term exam and marks secured in project work in Class X that were considered for the results. While the Board had given 50% weightage to each, the school appears to have submitted 25% weightage to the Board. Students and parents have been staging a demonstration at the gate since Wednesday, demanding a rectification of the error. Parents said there was a mismatch between the score they had derived by applying the Board‚Äôs formula and the results. The difference in the marks, they said, was exactly what could be derived if one calculated the marks with 25% weightage to Class IX results. The principal of the school, who had joined recently, could not be contacted for comments. But other officials at the school said they were pursuing the matter with the Board to ensure no student suffered due to a mistake in tabulating the scores. ‚ÄúThe Board has received complaints from multiple schools regarding miscalculation of marks and is looking into it,‚Äù said Kalyanmoy Gangluly, president of the Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/board-gets-plaints-over-madhyamik-miscalculation/articleshow/84659002.cms||---
---||Dehradun||U'khand, UP police brass move in tandem to ban kanwar yatra in 'entirety'||Bijnor/Dehradun: The police brass of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand are working in tandem to implement the ban on the kanwar yatra ‚Äúin its entirety‚Äù. While in UP, police have decided to book all those trying to take out the yatra, in Uttarakhand the Rapid Action Force (RAF) has been called to man the state's borders. UPs ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said, ‚ÄúThe kanwar yatra has been banned in its entirety. All kanwariyas will have to stay indoors." He added: "Those kanwariyas who try to cross into Uttarakhand will be booked under provisions of the Epidemic Act." While in Uttarakhand, senior police officials said that those trying to sneak into by force will face action. Uttarakhand police have also sought a few companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) for deployment at the inter-state border areas. The hill state‚Äôs DGP, Ashok Kumar, had earlier told TOI, ‚ÄúPolice are going to enforce the decision of the state government. We are going to take all necessary steps to stop kanwariyas from entering Uttarakhand." Senior police and administrative officials of the two states have held two rounds of discussions already. The first inter-state coordination meeting on the yatra was held on July 6 in Dehradun, followed by another meeting in Haridwar on July 20. Every year, during the month of ‚ÄòShrawan‚Äô in the Hindu calendar, around July-end, lakhs of people -- mostly youngsters-- from UP, Delhi, Himachal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana march to Haridwar to fetch water from the Ganga. They offer the holy water at Shiva temples back home. This year, Uttarakhand scrapped the yatra after facing flak for holding the Kumbh in Haridwar which saw an assembly of lakhs of pilgrims just before the onset of the second wave of the pandemic. The UP government had, meanwhile, decided to go ahead with the yatra but the Supreme Court took a tough stance on it and asked the administration to reconsider its move. The state government then told the apex court that it will not hold the yatra this year. Bijnor superintendent of police (SP) Dharamveer Singh said, ‚ÄúWe have received a joint letter from Uttarakhand‚Äôs director general of police (DGP) and UP‚Äôs ADG (law and order). The higher authorities have asked to prohibit the entry of kanwariyas into Uttarakhand.‚Äù Bijnor borders Uttarakhand and most pilgrims cross the district to reach Haridwar. ‚ÄúWe are alerting village heads and sending out messages asking people to stay indoors,‚Äù the SP said. ‚ÄúPolice in all the districts from where the yatra passes have been put on alert.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-up-police-brass-move-in-tandem-to-ban-kanwar-yatra-in-entirety/articleshow/84656212.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||Kisan Sansad at Jantar Mantar: Farm laws face censure||NEW DELHI: The Kisan Sansad, the protesting farmers‚Äô sit-in at Jantar Mantar, began on Thursday with a two-minute silence in memory of those who lost their lives during the eight-month-long agitation. Six leaders were nominated the ‚Äòspeaker‚Äô and ‚Äòdeputy speakers‚Äô of the session, while others sat as members of the farmers‚Äô parliament to discuss the three farm laws they are campaigning to have repealed, among them the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Bypass Act, 2020. Their sirens blaring, police escorts and a pilot car led two buses filled with the protestors to the Kisan Sansad site at 12.10pm. Another arrived at 12.26pm and the last at 12:38pm. The ‚Äòparliamentary session‚Äô was to have started earlier, but the 200 farmers permitted to participate daily at Jantar Mantar alleged they were delayed by the cops. ‚ÄúIt was only after raising slogans to protest the 45-minute delay that we were able to reach Jantar Mantar,‚Äù said Raminder Singh Patiala, member of the legal cell of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of farmers‚Äô unions. ‚ÄúOur Kisan Sansad will run concurrently with the Indian Parliament‚Äôs monsoon session till August 13.‚Äù Initially there was confusion with regard to the media's entry to the barricaded area, but the cops allowed them in soon after the farmers passed a resolution to have the media at the sit-in. Amid all this, Covid norms, such as wearing masks and keeping a distance from each other, were routinely flouted. During the session, the farmers passed a ‚Äòninda prastav‚Äô to condemn the statement of Union minister Meenkashi Lekhi. ‚ÄúShe described farmers as mawalis (hooligans) and insulted India‚Äôs farmers,‚Äù alleged Raminder Singh Patiala. Lekhi later responded to the criticism and said, ‚ÄúMy statement has been misinterpreted. If I have hurt any sentiments, I take back my words.‚Äù Forty-five speakers gave their opinion on the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020. As the farmers will discuss this law on Friday too, no final resolution was passed against the Act on Thursday. Some MPs visited the protest site but were told to be the farmers‚Äô voice inside Parliament and that no stage or talk time would be shared with them. Sukhwinder Singh said this was the first time that a parliament of farmers was in session simultaneously with the Indian Parliament, just 2km away from the protest site. ‚ÄúWe have been agitating for eight months and these barricades won‚Äôt stop the people from learning about the Kisan Sansad,‚Äù the joint secretary of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Samiti, Punjab, said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the people who make the government and if we, the people, are not happy with it, then it has to do something about it.‚Äù Alongside those who had come from the Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu border protest sites were farmers from other states. Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav said farmers from more states would come to the capital to take part in the Sansad. K T Gangadhar, who was among the 20 farmers from Karnataka who participated in the day‚Äôs proceedings, said, ‚ÄúWe are against the privatisation of mandis, contract farming and the amendments in the Essential Commodities Act.‚Äù He added that every week, around 200 farmers from Karnataka would sit in protest at Ghazipur border. Benoy Thomas of Vellad village in Kerala‚Äôs Kannur district was among the 13 farmers from Kerala who arrived in the city on Thursday. Thomas said, ‚ÄúI am a lawyer, but I cultivate two acres in my village. According to the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, any person can now store agricultural produce without limit. This will lead to hoarding and during wars or pandemics, the government may not be able to provide food grain to the poor.‚Äù Joy Kannanchira added that farmers had been protesting against the farm bills across Kerala. Six farmers from Maharashtra have been sitting at Singhu border since July 18. Shankar Darekar, a native of Nashik, said at Jantar Mantar that contract farming of grapes had been taking place in Maharashtra for around 20 years, but the farmers were often cheated. ‚ÄúThough we harvested the crop in February, we have only received partial payment so far,‚Äù Darekar claimed. ‚ÄúEvery year, around 20% of buyers disappear without paying the farmers in full. But the new laws have reduced jail terms for such unscrupulous traders from seven years to three years and the cases will only be heard in the sub-divisional magistrate‚Äôs court.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kisan-sansad-begins-agri-laws-face-censure/articleshow/84659037.cms||Sakshi Chand

---||Nashik||Four-hour downpour inundates Nashik city‚Äôs low-lying areas||NASHIK: A downpour lasting almost four hours on Wednesday night inundated several low-lying areas in Nashik city. Train services and vehiclur traffic was also affected on the Nashik-Mumbai route following waterlogging, landslide and damage of rail tracks near Kasara and Igatpuri. Incessant rainfall started in the city on Wednesday morning, and after 9pm, it became a torrential downpour that continued for nearly four hours. The Nashik district, overall, received 935.1mm rain in the 24-hour period ending at 8.30am on Thursday. Igatpuri, Peth and Trimbakeshwar collectively received about 700mm of rainfall during this time. Nashik city alone got over 35mm, which is the highest this season. The heavy rain caused the Godavari river water level to rise and inundated some of the low-lying areas of Nashik city including the Bhandi Bazaar, Dahipool, Indrakund and Ramkund areas. Residents of these areas stayed up all night to remove their household items fearing that the water may enter their homes. Akshay Sable, who lives near the riverbank, said: ‚ÄúThe rising water level kept us up all night. We frequently called the water resources department to check if the dam was going to discharge water.‚Äù Devan Jani, an activist working on Godavari river conservation, said the fact that the Godavari level had risen so much despite water not being released from the dam was a matter of concern. ‚ÄúGenerally, the water level rises when there is discharge. But on Wednesday, the water in the catchment areas ‚Äî that could not be absorbed into the soil because of the various so-called developmental activities ‚Äî flowed into the river causing a flashflood-like situation,‚Äù Jani said. Nashik resident deputy collector Bhagwat Doifode said the water had started receding in the low-lying by early Thursday morning. ‚ÄúNo loss of life or property has been reported. There is currently no heavy rain-related alert for Nashik district from the IMD for the next four days,‚Äù he added. The Nashik Municipal Corporation‚Äôs fire brigade department received 10 calls pertaining to trees being uprooted. The firemen went to the locations and cleared the trees. Vijay Suryawanshi, the tehsildar of Surgana, said several villages in the taluka were cut off for three-four hours as a few small bridges were submerged. However, the water receded by early morning on Thursday normalising the situation in the taluka. Meanwhile, long-distance trains in the Bhusawal division of the Central Railway were disrupted following damage of the rail tracks at Kasara and Igatpuri areas. There was waterlogging and small boulders had fallen on the tracks. The Central Railway is carrying out the restoration work on war footing. The Railways diverted few Mumbai-bound trains from Jalgaon via Nandurbar and have terminated nine trains at different stations like Bhusawal, Nashik Road, Manmad and Igatpuri. The MSRTC provided 35 special buses to take these passengers to Mumbai from Nashik, Manmad and Igatpuri. ‚ÄúIt is a tough time for us. But there isn‚Äôt any other way out. We have to take this trip by bus. Hopefully, we will get home safe,‚Äù said Sandesh Phatak, a resident of Borivali who was traveling from Nagpur and had to get off the train at the Nashik Road station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/4-hour-downpour-inundates-nashik-citys-low-lying-areas/articleshow/84653765.cms||---

---||Nashik||Gangapur dam‚Äôs water level rises||Nashik: The water level in the Gangapur dam increased by 800 million cubic feet (mcft) in 24 hours following heavy rainfall in the catchment areas. The water storage in the dam has now risen to 50% of its capacity. The dam is a part of the three-dam complex ‚Äî comprising Gangapur, Gautami-Godavari and Kashyapi dams ‚Äî that provides drinking water to the Nashik city. This is good news as the water stock in the dam complex had dropped to an alarming 33% of capacity month-and-a-half into the monsoon, sparking concerns. On Wednesday, the collective storage in the complex was 2,782 mcft (30% of the overall capacity of 9350 mcft). By Thursday, the collective storage had increased 1,141 mcft to reach 3,923 mcft (42% of capacity). ‚ÄúThere has been a big leap in the storage level. It has now exceeded the storage level during the corresponding period last year. However, this does not indicate that the district currently has good water storage. The threat of water shortage still looms large,‚Äù said resident deputy district collector Bhagwat Doifode. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), which had decided to enforce weekly water cut in the city, will continue with the schedule till a further decision is taken. ‚ÄúThe NMC had announced weekly water cut on Wednesdays. If the dam water levels do not cross the 50%-mark by July-end, then the NMC would be supplying water on alternate days. Since the water level in the dams is rising, any new decision will be taken only in August,‚Äù said the NMC officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gangapur-dams-water-level-rises/articleshow/84653740.cms||‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º ‡§®‡•á‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï
---||Nagpur||More children need glasses now, but real spike feared once schools reopen||NAGPUR: Increased screen time, online schooling, assignments, and sedentary lifestyle have already started showing ill effects on kids. More than a year of online schooling has led to more eye problems in children, with a number of kids as young as 5 to 8 years of age requiring spectacles. Doctors said that when schools reopen, many more children will start realizing they have vision problems. Paediatric ophthalmologist Dr Jyoti Acharya said she is seeing more kids needing glasses post the second wave. ‚ÄúKids are requiring glasses at a younger age. Digital eye strain (DES) is one of the main reasons. The worrisome fact is that most kids can‚Äôt identify and tell anyone that they have vision problems,‚Äù she said, adding that it‚Äôs the responsibility of parents to identify vision problems in kids and bring them to doctor if necessary. A study to determine prevalence, symptoms, frequency and associated risk factors of DES among children attending online classes during Covid-19 pandemic published earlier this year in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology has alarming results. More than 50% children attending online classes suffered through DES. ‚ÄúThere is an increased prevalence of DES among children in Covid era. Parents should be considerate about duration, type and distance of digital device use to avoid DES symptoms in children,‚Äù the study concludes. Dr Puja Bang, additional professor of ophthalmology at AIIMS Nagpur, said a large number of students are reaching AIIMS complaining of eye problems after the second wave. ‚ÄúKids already having glasses are getting higher numbers, but also those who never had glasses are getting numbers,‚Äù she said. According to her, it‚Äôs difficult for kids getting glasses at early age to get rid of them later in life. ‚ÄúAs a parent, I also understand that online schooling is unavoidable. So, we suggest to limit the screen time as much as possible, ensure proper rest to your eyes, and watch screen in best position and angle of viewing,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúStudies have shown that children‚Äôs screen time has nearly doubled during Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù said Dr Gopal Arora, renowned ophthalmologist. ‚ÄúA general human being blinks eyelids 12 to 14 times in a minute. But, while using screen, this rate reduces to 5 to 7 times. While focusing on some pixels on small screens like mobile phone, eyes get strained. Eventually, it leads to kids requiring glasses at early age,‚Äù he added. Ophthalmologist Dr Mrinal Phadke said school reopening is must for younger kids or they will suffer from pandemic of eye problems. ‚ÄúKids between 4 to 8 years of age should not see screen for more than 2 hours. Unfortunately, no one can follow this in the online schooling format. One more year of online activity, and most kids will have glasses when schools reopen,‚Äù she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/more-kids-need-glasses-now-but-real-spike-feared-once-schools-reopen/articleshow/84656284.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The vaccination of all citizens above 18 years of age and above 45 years of age will resume on Friday at the government centres including all the NMC centres. Covishield will be provided free of cost to citizens in this age group. Citizens will be vaccinated from 10am to 4pm. Registration can be done both online and offline. At present, Covshield is available at NMC and other government centres while Covaxin is at three centres ‚Äì Government Medical College, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital, Indora and Late Prabhakarrao Datke Hospital. Meanwhile, private hospitals asking for more than the fixed charges for vaccines are now under the NMC scanner. Municipal Commissioner Radhakrishnan B, on Thursday, ordered Wockhardt Hospital to reimburse the surcharge for Covishield vaccine they were charging from the beneficiaries. As per the NMC, private vaccination centres are expected to charge Rs780 for Covishield vaccination. But Wockhardt hospital was found charging Rs1,050. A citizen lodged a complaint with the health department. The municipal corporation issued the first notice to the hospital administration on June 24. After receiving no reply from the hospital administration, the health department recently sent a reminder and warned disciplinary action against the hospital. After the final warning, the hospital admitted the mistake. According to the hospital administration‚Äôs policy, a registration fee of Rs 270 was being charged. But now, as per the instructions of the corporation administration, the prescribed fee of Rs780 will be charged for each vaccination. The hospital administration has also clarified that those who were earlier charged Rs1,050 for vaccination will get the additional amount reimbursed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccination-to-resume-at-nmc-centres-today/articleshow/84656356.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The canals, which run about 90 to 110 km on each side of the Godavari river, originated at Nandur madhmeshwar pickup weir in Niphad taluka of Nashik district to provide drinking water to regions like Shirdi, Rahata in Ahmednagar district and Vaijapur in Aurangabad district. ‚ÄúThe works were proposed to the state government. The government has approved the renovation, which will be carried out in a span of eight months,‚Äù Sagar Shinde, said the executive engineer of the water resources department‚Äôs Nashik irrigation division. On July 5, the state government gave its approval for the project, which proposed that the 69 culverts constructed in arches with stone and lime, will now be replaced by the RCC pipes. ‚ÄúSince the structures have crossed the life expectancy, we are not only renovating these culverts but also increasing their capacity to carry water. This will help in saving water. During the rotation period, when water is released for the beneficiaries, the water will be delivered at a faster pace, thus cutting down the seepage and evaporation factor,‚Äù Shinde said. The canals are the key channels to provide water for drinking, agriculture and industries in the parched areas of both districts. Since they are old structures, the need to renovate the canal was being felt during the past years. There were also instances when parts of the canal were breached forcing the water resources department to carry out immediate repairs of the canals. The Nashik irrigation division had proposed the renovation of the canal to the government in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-govt-approves-rs-75cr-to-renovate-godavari-canals/articleshow/84653800.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Ahmedabad||Crime branch to inquire into murder charges only||Ahmedabad: Around one and a half months after a missing complaint was filed when the live-in partner of a police inspector went incommunicado, the cops have finally decided to focus on the murder angle. Sources in police said that crime branch officers have obtained the documents of the case in which Sweety Patel, 37, live-in partner of police inspector A A Desai, went missing from her house in Karjan town of Vadodara district on June 5. ‚ÄúPrima facie inquiry suggested that she might have been killed, because we have not found any concrete evidence which suggested that she had gone out of Vadodara district,‚Äù said a police officer. The officer said that the cops will now probe how she was killed, where the body was disposed off and if any other person was involved in the offence. The investigation of Sweety Patel‚Äôs missing case was handed over to the detection of crime branch (DCB) and Gujarat Anti-terrorism squad (ATS) on Sunday by MoS (home), Pradipsinh Jadeja. Patel, who was believed to be Desai‚Äôs wife, was his live-in partner only, and they had constant arguments over their relationship status. The Vadodara district police had been investigating the case after her father Mahendra Patel filed a missing person‚Äôs complaint at Karjan police station on June 11. Desai, the prime suspect in the case, was heading the rural SOG (special operations group) in Vadodara until he was directed to go on leave in the case. On the other hand, the forensic tests including DNA match with a partially charred body found in Atalia village in Bharuch with Patel‚Äôs son were initiated. Sources in police said that Desai and Patel were staying together since 2016, after both separated from their previous spouses. On June 4, Patel and Desai had a dispute over some family issue after which both left their house. After that Patel went missing and her father approached police to find her out. Suspect PI refuses narco test Ahmedabad: Suspect PI, A A Desai on Thursday refused to undergo narco-analysis test in the case of his missing live-in partner at the forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar. ‚ÄúHe had accepted SPS brain fingerprint test and polygraph test but refused to undergo narco analysis test,‚Äù said a police officer. Narco test involves the injection of a drug called sodium pentothal, also referred as truth serum, which induces a hypnotic or sedated state in such a manner where a person, who underwent the test, is only supposed to divulge true information. On the other hand, polygraph test is based on the assumption that physiological responses that are triggered when a person is lying. Brain fingerprinting is a lie detection technique where a person is made to see some images and stuff and electroencephalography (EEG) used to determine whether specific information is stored in a person‚Äôs mind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/crime-branch-to-inquire-into-murder-charges-only/articleshow/84659062.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Police said the man, Ravindra Madhukar Mahalle, 54, a resident of Nehru Nagar, was out of danger and admitted to IGGMCH after being rescued from Gandhi Sagar at around 4pm. The NMC staffer who rescued him, 28-year-old Vikram Dome, told TOI that he and his colleague (senior leading fireman Shankar Bijwe) were returning home after winding up their duty at Ganjipeth fire station. ‚ÄúI was riding pillion while Bijwe was driving the two-wheeler and we were headed towards Sakkardara. While crossing Gandhi Sagar we spotted a crowd gathered near Ganesh temple situated at its bank,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe stopped and I rushed towards the lake to find out what happened,‚Äù he said. Eyewitnesses told him that a few seconds ago, a man had jumped into the lake. Dome spotted air bubbles over the lake indicating that the man was still alive. Wasting no time, Dome, in his uniform and shoes, dived into the lake and swam towards the direction where the man had plunged. He dived deep into the lake and it took a few minutes for him to find Mahalle. Dragging him by his shirt, Dome swam towards Ganesh temple side, said eyewitnesses. With the help of onlookers, Mahalle was pulled out of the lake. Dome applied his life saving training to save Mahalle. ‚ÄúHe and Bijwe then took Mahalle to the nearby Ganeshpeth police station, from where he was admitted to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital,‚Äù said API Vaishali Wadaskar. She, however, could not say what forced Mahalle to take the extreme step. Sources said Mahalle had suffered huge financial loss due to Covid-induced lockdown, which perhaps forced him to take such a strong step. Dome, a graduate in arts and one-year diploma in Civil Engineering, said he was feeling satisfied to save someone‚Äôs life in three years of service in NMC fire department. ‚ÄúI used to attend calls to fish out bodies from lakes,‚Äù Dome said, adding he had dreamed of joining the police service but landed up in the fire department, where he is happy now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/off-duty-fireman-jumps-into-lake-to-rescue-man-trying-to-end-life/articleshow/84656406.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The structural audit report of the facility was valid till July 15. ‚ÄúThe Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has developed other jumbo facilities for dealing with likely surge in positive cases. The dismantling of the structure may not affect the efforts to contain the pandemic in civic areas,‚Äù said civic officials. The PMC officials said the civic body had reduced 300 general beds at CoEP jumbo facility in June due to less demand. However, the occupancy of the oxygen and ventilator-supported beds was high in June at the jumbo hospital. In July, the demand for oxygen and ventilator-supported beds has gone down, so the empty facility was shut down. ‚ÄúThe civic administration has stopped admission at the hospital in the first week of July. The final decision regarding dismantling of the facility will be taken by the authorities concerned,‚Äù said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official. The CoEP hospital has 800 beds, out of which 700 were occupied during the peak of second wave. Now all 800 beds are vacant. The old facility at Baner has 450 beds. The new Covid facility in Baner has around 300 beds. More Covid facilities have come up at Baner and Swargate. The number of oxygen beds has been increased. Oxygen plants have been set up across civic areas, said civic officials. ‚ÄúThe cost of running this makeshift hospital is a key factor in doing away with this facility. Crores of rupees are required every month to keep this facility up and running. These funds can be used for building civic medical infrastructure. The contract for the jumbo hospital is over. So, the facility can be dismantled ,‚Äù said a senior PMC official. The officials added that the civic areas have 19,000 hospital beds, including oxygen and ventilator-supported beds. The number of beds was doubled during the second wave, compared to the first wave. They include beds in private hospitals as well beds in government and PMC hospitals. The civic body had planned to dismantle the jumbo hospital after the first wave ebbed in January. A committee of experts had suggested sharing of the infrastructure at jumbo hospitals with local civic hospitals. Government hospitals in rural areas were supposed to get some equipment and other materials for strengthening the health facilities. But the hospital was continued in the wake of the second wave. Suhas Divse, PMRDA commissioner, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. He did not reply to SMS sent to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/coep-jumbo-covid-hospital-likely-to-be-dismantled/articleshow/84659095.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Hindustan Park depends on tanker water||KOLKATA: Some residents of south Kolkata‚Äôs tony neighbourhoods of Hindustan Park, Purna Das Road and Rashbehari Avenue have been battling severe water shortage, buying water from KMC and a private trust for the past fortnight. KMC has launched a probe into the reason behind the problem since there is no shortage in supply from either the Tallah reservoir via the Auckland Square booster pumping station or from the Kalighat booster pumping station. Unable to bear the prolonged water crisis, residents of the locality submitted a memorandum to the KMC executive engineer early this week, seeking a solution. ‚ÄúThere is no water pressure. As a result, we are not getting even half the amount of water that used to come earlier,‚Äù said octogenarian Dhrubajyoti Chaudhuri, who has been living in the locality for decades. Initially, many thought the problem was with their individual household and had to do with the ferrule or clogging of the supply line from the main pipe to the underground reservoir. But soon, they realized others, too, were suffering. ‚ÄúAll the houses are going dry. We have had to buy water every alternate day. This is a financial drain. KMC has only now taken note and seems to be looking into the issue,‚Äù said Pratip Mukherjee, another resident. KMC water department officials on Wednesday installed meters at some pockets to check water pressure there. ‚ÄúTo find the actual cause, we need to know the exact pressure of water existent in several neighbourhoods around Hindustan Park,‚Äù said an official. The Dev Sen household Bhalo-Basha has not yet faced the water crisis, perhaps because there aren‚Äôt too many occupants ever since author Nabanita Dev Sen‚Äôs demise last year. ‚ÄúWhen others are complaining about a drop in water pressure, there must be a problem,‚Äù said Antara Dev Sen who lives in the family house. She pointed out the character of the area had changed from being a sleepy para to a buzzing mixed use locality with restaurants and boutiques. Also, many large houses have been replaced with multi-storied buildings. The two-three-storey houses, with a family on each floor in the past, have given way to five-six-storey buildings with two to three flats on each floor. The changed demography has put pressure on resources. ‚ÄúMost of the new houses and even the older ones have shops on the ground floor. This is a floating crowd that spends the entire working day in the locality. The pressure on resources is understandable,‚Äù said Shyamasree Chatterjee (75), from Rashbehari Avenue. A KMC water supply official said engineers would try to locate any sort of crack in ancillary pipes that supply water to households.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hindustan-park-depends-on-tanker-water/articleshow/84659124.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Traffic cops give rule book to beacon norm violators||Kolkata: Traffic police are handing over the rule book to those flouting the beacon rules during special raids. That move that came into effect on Thursday is seen as an attempt of the police to safeguard themselves from being unduly challenged while checking such vehicles on roads. Several sergeants from specific guards like Tiljala and Jadavpur are carrying with them the transport department‚Äôs notification that also mentions the entire list of the officials who are eligible to use beacons on vehicles. Cops are also keeping handy the beacon manual mentioning the conditions when the eligible officials can use it. Cops handed over these documents to those who were pulled up for using beacons illegally on their vehicles. ‚ÄúOnce an offender reads the documents, we ask them why they violated the rule,‚Äù said a sergeant of Tiljala guard. Lalbazar sources said that 56 vehicles had been asked on Thursday to remove the beacons that were being used illegally. This takes the total number of illegal beacon cases in the city to 370 since last Saturday. ‚ÄúThe raid is being carried out across the city. We are compiling all data and keeping it for our future reference,‚Äù said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. However, cops did not rule out the possibility of getting repeat offenders. ‚ÄúWe are checking the data collected from all individual traffic guards and matching the registration numbers of the vehicles caught by us. If we find repeat offenders, we will seek advice from the transport department on what action would be taken,‚Äù said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traffic-cops-give-rule-book-to-beacon-norm-violators/articleshow/84659093.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

There are about 170 part-time lecturers at the level of assistant lecturers in grant-in aid colleges who would be eligible for full-time posts, said sources. Already about 150 such part-time faculty members have been given full-time positions recently, sources further said. The commissioner for higher education has sent a notification in this regard to all the principals of grant-in-aid colleges in the state. Details like the academic performance of the part-time faculties in their graduation, postgraduation programmes, year of passing and the details of college and university where they pursued their studies have been sought. ‚ÄúOther details like their performance in NET, SLATE and the PhD programmes followed by them have also been sought,‚Äù said a sources.

A portion of the laterite structure then collapsed. We immediately deputed a conservation assistant to the site to inspect it. There is, however, no damage to the rest of the structure,‚Äù said Amarnath Ramakrishna, superintending archaeologist of Archaeological Survey of India-Goa (ASI). President of Safa Masjid committee Murtuza Mulla, said that the vibration created by the heavy vehicles moving from the opposite bypass road has weakened the lake wall. The water tank wall had also developed cracks and the ASI, which has been maintaining the monument, had recently filled the cracks. But the weakened structure collapsed, Mulla said. Ponda was home to 27 exquisite mosques built by Adil Shah, most of which were razed by the Portuguese after overtaking Goa. The Safa Masjid is, therefore, the lone surviving mosque in Ponda built by the Bijapur Sultan in 1560. The Safa Masjid is Indo-Islamic in style and is built on a raised platform, separated from its auxiliary minars. Its prayer hall is set beneath a pointed terracotta tile roof today but was earlier built from mud bricks influenced by the rudimentary forms of construction of that era. The mosque‚Äôs masonry tank is built with exposed laterite stones and is lined with 44 hammams dotting its four Mehrab-style archs. Until 1969, the Mullas of the masjid took care of its maintenance, after which, the Safa Masjid was declared as a national monument under the purview of the ASI, making it an important heritage monument of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/part-of-asi-maintained-safa-masjid-collapses-due-to-rain/articleshow/84661500.cms||---

The second round of evaluation will be done by university officials. This decision has been taken by the university administration to verify if a student actually performed well or marks were just awarded to ensure passing marks. The move, say varsity officials, will bring in more transparency. The order comes at a time when semester exams (barring the final semester) have been cancelled in the wake of the pandemic and students are supposed to be promoted to the next year on the basis of their performance in internal assignments. The university has asked all its affiliated colleges to submit the marks of the students by August 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/internal-assignments-to-be-re-evaluated-for-students-who-are-awarded-more-than-80-marks/articleshow/84656432.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Only 4 columns built for LPG crematorium in 5 years||NAGPUR: Senior corporator Abha Pande on Thursday claimed to have exposed the nexus between a private contractor, project management consultant (PMC), and NMC engineers, in the construction of an LPG crematorium at Shanti Nagar Ghat. ‚ÄúWork order of the project was issued in January 2017, but only the columns of the eco-friendly cremation facility have been constructed since then,‚Äù she said in NMC general body meeting. She demanded action against the concerned NMC engineers, blacklisting of the private contractor and PMC for submitting vague project reports. In 2016, NMC received over Rs49 lakh for constructing a LPG-based cremation facility at Shanti Nagar ghat from the MPLAD funds of former Rajya Sabha MP Avinash Pandey. Subsequently, NMC issued a worker order on January 3, 2017. The work was to be completed in six months. However, the contractor awarded the work only constructed the columns for the structure. NMC‚Äôs project department allegedly also paid over Rs12 lakh to the contractor. Pandey pointed out that now the project department is asking the Satranjipura zone to get the works completed from the contractor, whereas it should be the former‚Äôs responsibility. Superintendent engineer Ajay Pohekar admitted that the administration had failed to get the work done from the contractor on time. He justified that the area selected for the set up inside the Shanti Nagar ghat is falling short and hence the delay. If the space fell short then what did the PMC appointed for the purpose do, Pandey asked. To which, Pohekar had no answer. Pohekar admitted that against a DPR of Rs49 lakh, NMC will face shortage of over Rs19 lakh and will approach the collectorate. Pohekar also admitted that NMC had not taken any action against anyone so far. He, however, assured the House that the work will be completed within three months. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed the administration to get the work done at the earliest without further delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-4-columns-built-for-lpg-crematorium-in-5-yrs/articleshow/84656429.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||States unlocked but Indian Railways continue Covid special trains, charge more||NAGPUR: Almost all the states have unlocked after fall in Covid-19 cases but the Indian Railways still continues to operate mail/express trains as Covid specials, putting additional burden on passengers. Several passenger welfare bodies and individuals have demanded to remove the special tag for the mail/express trains and operate them as regular trains. Even travel in most economical air-conditioned Nagpur-Pune Garib Rath (02113-02114) is coming at a cost. ‚ÄúThough these passenger trains are being run as Covid specials, no social distancing or Covid protocol is being followed. Many passengers are not wearing masks and there is no sanitization in trains. In Garib Rath, even side middle berth is being allotted to passengers,‚Äù said Shenaz Pathan, an executive working in Pune. ‚ÄúTravel in entire Garib Rath used to cost Rs850 earlier but now with a special tag, the fare comes to nearly Rs1,400. If the railways are really following the Covid protocol, why the side middle berth is not being disabled? It is already not giving blankets and bedsheets to passengers,‚Äù Pathan added. Brij Bhushan Shukla of Rail Yatri Sangh (RYS) said, ‚ÄúThe additional fare is basically to recover the losses when trains did not operate during the first wave and had limited operations during the second wave. But now when the entire country is unlocked, these trains should be regularized.‚Äù Central Railway officials told TOI, ‚ÄúIt is a policy decision by the Railway Board to run special trains. Any decision in this regard will be taken by the board. The fares of special trains are always on the upper side.‚Äù Shukla added even passenger trains should be operated for the common man as private bus operators are charging through the nose. ‚ÄúFor 1.5-hour travel to Seoni, I paid Rs400. It normally costs Rs150,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen 90% of the passenger trains that were withheld during Covid have started operations, why not regularize them? The railways have withdrawn all concessions and while passengers are paying 25-30% additional fare, there is no improvement in services like sanitization and cleanliness. There is no enforcement about wearing masks by passengers. Even unreserved passengers are being allowed and there is a waiting list in several trains,‚Äù said Basant Kumar Shukla, secretary of Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK). SECR‚Äôs Zonal Railway Users‚Äô Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) member Pratap Motwani echoed the same views. ‚ÄúPeople are already a harried lot due to LPG and fuel prices and most food items have exhibited higher inflation. It is high time railways should run mail/express trains as regular trains and restore concessions,‚Äù Motwani said. Benishyam Khandelwal of Innovative Citizens Forum, Tumsar, working for passengers‚Äô welfare, said, ‚ÄúWhile illegal vendors have a free run in trains, passengers under SECR have been asked to book tickets in advance even for short distances. The special tag to trains is a hidden fare hike. Earlier, travel between Tumsar-Gondia used to cost Rs20 but now it costs Rs60. Similarly, from Tumsar to Nagpur it costs Rs184 instead of Rs45 earlier.‚Äù ‚ÄúCiting Covid protocol, no tickets are being issued after the chart is prepared. Covid special train tag is just to extract extra fare from poor passengers. Covid protocol can be followed even if the special status is removed. Under the garb of special trains, it is virtually a fare hike,‚Äù said Khandelwal. Train traffic disrupted Due to heavy rains and water-logging in Mumbai and surroundings, the Central Railway on Thursday canceled CSMT-Gondia, CSMT-Howrah, and Howrah- CSMT Covid specials. Besides, Puri-LTT and Howrah-CSMT express trains were diverted via Vasai Road-Nandurbar-Jalgaon. Railway officials said due to rains tracks between Kasara and Igatpuri have been damaged and work was going on to restore traffic on war-footing. On Thursday, the CSMT-Nagpur Sevaram Express short-originated from Nashik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/states-unlocked-but-rlys-continue-covid-spl-trains-charge-more/articleshow/84656434.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||Delhi riots case: Cancellation of Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha‚Äôs bail very unlikely, says SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said it is ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù to be persuaded by the Delhi Police to cancel the bail granted to Delhi riots case accused Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha even as it made plain its discomfort over the Delhi High Court‚Äôs bulky bail judgment ‚Äúunwarrantedly‚Äù interpreting provisions of anti-terror law UAPA and NIA Act. Before Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi could open arguments on behalf of the Delhi Police, which has sought setting aside of the Delhi HC's more than 100-page judgment granting bail to the trio and even when the counsel for the accused was seeking adjournment, a bench of Justices Sanjay K Kaul and Hemant Gupta asked, ‚ÄúWhat is your (Delhi Police's) grievance ‚Äî grant of bail or the long observations and interpretation of law by the HC? Do you want to take them (the trio) back into custody?‚Äù Justice Kaul said, ‚ÄúPrima facie these observations were made by the HC in the context of the case (bail plea of the three).‚Äù The SG interjected to request the judge not to make observations even before the Delhi Police opened its argument. This irked Justice Kaul, ‚ÄúIt may be a political matter for you, not for us. It is a simple bail matter.‚Äù However, Justice Kaul went on also to say, ‚ÄúWe agree the provisions of law need not have been discussed and interpreted in a manner as had been done by the Delhi HC.‚Äù Mehta and Lekhi said the Delhi Police would argue on both points ‚Äî bail and unwarranted observations by the HC ‚Äî to seek setting aside of the HC judgment. ‚ÄúWe are on both the points and we will persuade the bench on both points,‚Äù Mehta said. ‚ÄúVery unlikely,‚Äù Justice Kaul remarked tersely, before dictating the order that two issues are to be debated ‚Äî cancellation of bail which would be based on factual score; and the other related to legal plea about desirability of the HC interpreting provisions of UAPA and NIA Act while deciding on the bail petitions. On June 18, the SC had issued notices to Kalita, Narwal and Tanha on Delhi Police's appeal. It refused to stay the HC order granting them bail but had expressed surprise over the HC‚Äôs more than 100-page bail judgment and barred it from being cited by other accused in riots cases to seek bail. It had said, ‚ÄúWhat is troubling us is that in a bail petition, the HC authors a 100-page judgment, and that too discussing all laws. This is something very very surprising. What we can say is that since bail has been granted, those who got the relief will not be affected. But, otherwise we will stay the effect of this order.‚Äù The SC postponed the hearing by four weeks, acceding to the request of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the accused activists. Sibal said these youngsters do not have the wherewithal to print and translate documents running into 20,000 pages which were submitted along with a chargesheet by the Delhi Police. ‚ÄúIf the Delhi Police could give us a pen drive containing all the documents, it would help us in reading it better,‚Äù he said. Post-dictation of the order, Justice Kaul expressed the bench's discomfort over the recent trend of counsel arguing for hours together on bail petitions and the courts taking into consideration all the arguments to render a bulky judgment. ‚ÄúIt (the trend) is troubling us. Law and issues not relevant to the issue of grant or rejection of bail should not be argued. We will earmark only two hours for both sides in this case to complete their argument when the hearing resumes,‚Äù the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cancellation-of-kalita-narwal-and-tanhas-bail-very-unlikely-says-sc/articleshow/84659255.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Pune||Anger builds over Maharashtra board‚Äôs lack of vision on websites||PUNE: The state board has displayed a total lack of planning and preparedness in the past one week as technical snags in almost all the processes starting from results to marks tabulation crashed every time students logged in to the respective websites. The registration portal for the Common Entrance Test (CET) for junior college admissions was down even on Thursday due to ‚Äútechnical reasons‚Äù. Till Wednesday evening, close to 1.5 lakh students had managed to register for the first-ever entrance test for admissions to first-year junior colleges (FYJC). School principals said the state board should have cited the issues and been prepared for these technical issues. Students said the server crash was delaying the application process. The state board said that they had constraints with respect to involving private players in the entire processes as student data was at risk and they had to rely on government agencies for the entire technical programming. School principal Kiran Mete said, ‚ÄúFirst, the results website crashed, then the entrance link crashed and later even the HSC marks tabulation software has generated issues resulting in slow process of the entire system leaving students at a loss.‚Äù Harshima Pandya, a Std X student, said the sheer lack of presence of mind by the state board had put lakhs of students on tenterhooks on the day of the result. ‚ÄúThere was a nearly six-hour technical snag after the announcement of the result and for that period all of us were left anxious. This year was different in terms of marking system too so we were all so eager to know our results and when the time came, the website gave up. It was frustrating,‚Äù she said. Vasant Ranpise, parent of an SSC student, said for or over one year everything has taken the digital mode and the state board should have been more than ready to host lakhs of students. ‚ÄúThe government has its own IT agencies and there are many experts sitting in these departments who could help the state board in solving the issues faced. This should have been done before announcing the results. A trial run was important. This is not just frustrating but also embarrassing for the authorities too,‚Äù he said,. A school head, Vivek Gaud, said they were trying to fill up the marks of HSC students in the provided software but it is so slow that after a while the link refused to move forward. ‚ÄúWe have to fill up marks of almost 400 students and at this pace it will take several days to complete the work. When will the board announce the results in such a case?‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/anger-builds-over-boards-lack-of-vision-on-websites/articleshow/84659111.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: 140 trees near Bapu Kuti in Sevagram to face the axe||NAGPUR: Despite opposition by Wardha Vriksh Bachao Nagrik Samiti (VBNS) and three generations of Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs family, the public works department (PWD) has decided to cut 140 trees on the road near Bapu Kuti in Sevagram. ‚ÄúOnly trees that pose danger to passers-by and stand in the middle of the road causing traffic congestion will be felled. From July 22, we have decided to first plant 10 times trees in lieu of those to be felled on the roadside, and only then 140 trees will be felled,‚Äù said Prakash N Boob, executive engineer, PWD, Wardha. Boob said the claim by VBNS that these trees were planted during Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs stay at Bapu Kuti is not correct. ‚ÄúWe conducted a survey by Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehradun, to determine how old the trees are. The FRI said these trees are 60 years old,‚Äù said Boob. ‚ÄúWe never claimed all trees were planted by Gandhiji. We have always maintained they were planted by Gandhians in the 40s and 50s, and possibly, some even by Gandhi himself. But even if these trees were 60-years-old, are we to save only trees planted by Gandhi?‚Äù asked ecologist Alok Bang, Sushma Sharma, Dr Anupama Gupta and others of VBNS. They questioned, ‚ÄúShouldn't we save trees that are 60 years old? We are sure even FRI will agree that the ecological value of 60-year-old trees is not the same as planting 10 times more one-year-old saplings.‚Äù Criticizing PWD‚Äôs plantation drives, Bang said, ‚ÄúWhat is the current survival percentage of saplings planted last year? Planting 10 times the number is not the point, but how many of them will survive to be 60-year-old trees is the main issue.‚Äù VBNS had last year spearheaded a stir to save 150 of the remaining trees. In September last, three generations of the Gandhis too had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray after which felling of trees was stalled. However, members of VBNS said, ‚ÄúThe PWD has breached our trust. During a joint survey on March 24, it was agreed to trim branches, cut drain sections for girth widening, redesign road to remove dividers and widen road, fill gaps around trees, cut old trees and provide guards to planted trees.‚Äù ‚ÄúDuring our survey on June 29, it was observed that little work has been done either to save surviving trees or prevent road accidents, which led to public rage in the past. The felling of trees will give a free hand to cut more trees,‚Äù said Sharma. ‚ÄúIf the PWD has decided to fell 140 trees there seems no change in their stand. Earlier too they had planned to fell over 200 trees. Even if the trees are 60 years old, that doesn‚Äôt mean these should be felled. These trees have environmental value,‚Äù said Sharma. There are at least 1,500 big trees in the 12km stretch between Dattapur and Sevagram. Of these, PWD planned to fell 200 trees, and 79 trees have already been felled last year. The trees are being chopped to widen Wardha-Sevagram-Samudrapur-Girad-Umred (SH-326) up to Shedgaon, including Hamdapur junction to Wardha-Hinganghat (SH-328). The PWD decision seems to be under political pressure as president of MIDC Association Pravin Hiwre has threatened a stir by all parties to fell remaining trees. The association has taken signatures of 2,900 citizens in support of felling the trees, and submitted a memorandum to guardian minister Sunil Kedar, who is in favour of felling these trees right from the beginning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/140-trees-near-bapu-kuti-to-face-the-axe/articleshow/84656449.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Hyderabad||DRI, NCB grappling for clues on flow of narcotics||Hyderabad: Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) are baffled about the relentless efforts by drug peddling gangs to smuggle in heroin via Africa through airports. Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) suspect involvement of India-based African cocaine peddling gang behind the racket. Despite multiple seizures of heroin at airports by central LEAs across India in past two months, the gang continued the same modus operandi of using African peddlers to carry heroin in their baggage from South Africa to India. The kingpins have been careful, DRI sleuths say with flight tickets booked either with cash or using credit cards of mules. The phones of the arrested accused have no contact numbers from India. ‚ÄúOfficially, they have booking in some hotel, but after leaving the airport they check into some other hotel in Shamshabad according to the instructions of their handlers. The mules are briefed to wait till they are contacted by a receiver,‚Äù a DRI official said. The 35-year-old Zambian woman arrested on Monday, was supposed to meet another gang member at a hotel in Shamshabad who would take her to Delhi. After handing over the consignment in Delhi, she was supposed to start a return journey in six days from Hyderabad to Johannesburg, where she received the contraband from a South African. ‚ÄúAll the arrested have come on business visas. Their return tickets were booked about a week from the date of arrival from Hyderabad to Johannesburg,‚Äù one official said. The four peddlers arrested recently initially claimed ignorance about the contraband concealed in their baggage, gave evasive replies like ‚ÄúI am here to see Charminar,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am here to look for business prospects,‚Äù but later confessed to being mules for a payment of $200 to $1,000 plus expenses. A few of them came on medical visas and the rest on business and visit visas. Officials suspect African cocaine peddlers operating from Indian cities are part of a racket and have been working with Punjab-based heroin peddling gangs for past few months. Despite multiple seizures, the gang is still using the same modus operandi, indicating the profit is worth the risk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dri-ncb-grappling-for-clues-on-flow-of-narcotics/articleshow/84661494.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The rate for the district was nearly at 6% for the last two weeks, according to health officials. While Level 3 restrictions are in place in Pune district, some relaxations are expected to be introduced after the review meeting on Saturday. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and elected representatives will attend the meeting. The state is said to be mulling over giving fully-vaccinated persons some concessions. At the last review meeting, Pawar had said that a proposal to allow malls to operate with fully-vaccinated persons was being discussed. The health department is also considering proposals to operate railways and push the service sector. Health officials will take the final call on the proposals. District health officials told TOI that, for the first time ever, the positivity has dipped in the last three weeks. In fact, cases in Pune rural have reduced thanks to adequate containment measures. Collector Rajesh Deshmukh said that after two to three weeks, there has been a dip registered in the positivity rate and it is a good sign and the measures will be further intensified in the coming weeks. He, however, said the decision on any kind of relaxation will be discussed at the review meeting on Saturday. According to district health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar, the positivity rate has dipped below 5% for the first time. ‚ÄúPMC‚Äôs weekly positivity rate is 3.9%. For PCMC, the rate is 5% and in Pune rural it is 5.4%. With a dip in cases due to containment measures in rural areas, the positivity has reduced. We had strengthened surveillance activities in the district, identified hotspots and super spreaders as well as strengthened monitoring of containment areas.

This came on the back of a sharp recovery in mobility following a decline in Covid infections, and a resilient rural market expanding faster than the urban, which infused growth back in discretionary categories. Total income rose to Rs 11,982 crore from Rs 10,716 crore. Despite the backdrop of rising input costs, HUL‚Äôs domestic consumer growth was ahead of analysts‚Äô expectations at 12%. Volume growth was 9%, albeit on a base of negative 8% in the corresponding quarter of previous year (Q1FY21). Ebitda margins, too, remained at a healthy 24%. HUL said its focused actions on net revenue management and savings have enabled it to manage inflationary pressures and deliver a healthy bottom line performance. HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta said the company‚Äôs firm focus remains delivering volumeled competitive growth and margins in a healthy range. ‚ÄúIn a challenging environment, we have delivered a strong performance across top line and bottom line. Our performance in the quarter has been resilient and is reflective of our capabilities, the agility in our operations and the intrinsic strength of our portfolio,‚Äù said Mehta. However, HUL said it is cautiously optimistic about future demand recovery||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hul-q1-net-up-10-on-lower-infections/articleshow/84663777.cms||---

On the directions of UT adviser Dharam Pal, the administration has asked all departments to submit a list of projects (proposed and ongoing), which are to be completed by the end of the current financial year. They were asked to speed up projects which were delayed due to Covid. As the UT adviser is regularly holding review meetings of different departments, department heads were asked to submit details like litigation related to projects, dispute with contractors and other relevant details which caused delay. The UT administration also issued written instructions to different departments to prepare a list of projects which could be completed in a time-bound manner in 100 days after consultation with engineers. A senior UT official said the new adviser is carrying out field visits of different projects and asking officers to submit details. The UT will review these projects and issue further instructions if required. The instructions were issued after the recent announcement by UT administrator V P Singh Badnore, wherein he stated that he, along with new UT adviser Dharam Pal, was making a 100-day programme to review pending projects. He said he would attend the review meeting of pending projects with the UT adviser. The UT administration had recently directed the health department to accelerate vaccination to cover the maximum population as soon as possible. Besides, the administration decided to focus on improvement of roads in the city. Recarpeting and maintenance work of roads would be taken up on priority after the monsoon. Relevant directions have been issued to the UT engineering department and municipal corporation. The administration is focusing on improvement of health infrastructure before the possible third Covid wave. Recently, the Centre asked the UT administration to strengthen medical infrastructure and accelerate pace of vaccination. Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba asked the states and UTs, including Chandigarh, to strengthen medical infrastructure, accelerate the pace of vaccination and enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/speed-up-the-projects-delayed-due-to-covid-ut-to-departments/articleshow/84656475.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Committee to look into Devasthanam Board, priests call off rally||DEHRADUN: A day after chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami announced that a high-power committee will be formed to look into the legality of the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act ‚Äî which hands over management of the Himalayan shrines and 51 temples to the board ‚Äî priests at the four shrines called off a protest rally scheduled on Friday. The priests, however, will continue their sit-in protest that started 42 days ago in the shrines to oppose the Act. The priests had alleged that they were not consulted before the Act was rolled out and said that it challenges the centuries-old administrative and power structure of the shrines ‚Äî Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri. Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of Char Dham Tirth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said, ‚ÄúWe welcome the decision of the CM, but will approach this cautiously as similar commitments were made previously.‚Äù Sati pointed out that Dhami‚Äôs predecessor Tirath Singh Rawat had announced in March that 51 small temples would be removed from the ambit of the board and the Act would be reviewed. ‚ÄúFour months have passed and nothing has materialised. We are not going to be misled this time,‚Äù he said, adding that a Jan Aakrosh rally planned in Uttarkashi district on Friday has been called off but protests will continue. ‚ÄúWe will wait for two weeks before deciding our next course of action. We will stop protesting only when a favourable amendment is made in the board or it is scrapped,‚Äù he added. The Devasthanam Bill was tabled by the Trivendra Singh Rawat government and passed in the state assembly in December 2019 and after official notification became an Act on June 15, 2020. Now with the high-power committee, Dhami wants to reach a consensus between the local stakeholders and the government. The CM had said that the committee will evaluate the impact on the stakeholders and issues faced by them after the formation of the board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/committee-to-look-into-devasthanam-board-priests-call-off-rally/articleshow/84656481.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Ex-Armyman‚Äôs second wife moves Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: A retired soldier‚Äôs widow knocked on the Gujarat high court‚Äôs doors on Thursday, after the Army denied her family pension on the grounds that she was his second wife. The petition was filed by 76-year-old Lalitaben Patel and her divorcee daughter Hetalben, both residents of Adalaj, seeking directions to the Centre and the Sena Seva Corps to grant them the pension that retired Army person Prabhudas Patel used to receive till his demise in December 2019. According to petitioners‚Äô advocate Girish Patel, Prabhudas Patel was born in 1943 in Kenya and was brought up in the African country. Upon his return to India, he got drafted into the Army in February 1963. He got married to one Tarulata Chavda in Surat in 1972. But eight days later, she left him and her whereabouts were not to be found. Patel got married a second time to Lalitaben in 1977. They had two daughters. He left the Army in 1978 and later accepted the job of a watchman with a state government department, from where he retired in 2003. He drew pension for the state government‚Äôs job as well as for his services with the Army. After Patel‚Äôs demise, his widow started receiving family pension from the state government, but the Army did not grant her any. She requested for the family pension, but was refused on the ground that she was the second wife of the pensioner and Patel‚Äôs service book had the name of the first wife. The widow wrote various letters to the Sainik Welfare and Resettlement Office stating that they had no idea of the first wife‚Äôs whereabouts, neither had she ever claimed the pension from any of the departments till date. She also placed earlier communications made by Patel on record, in which the retired soldier had requested the central department to make arrangements to grant pension to Lalitaben after his death. He had made several requests to change the records, in which his first wife‚Äôs name was mentioned. After waiting for positive response for a couple of years, the widow and her divorcee daughter filed a petition in the high court and submitted that after Tarulata left Patel, the latter apprehended that she would leave the country and informed the district collector. The Regional Passport Office was also intimated with request to stop her leaving the country. The petitioners have placed the communications on record along with the letters that Patel had written to insert the second wife‚Äôs name for pension scheme. The petitioners have also stated that if the first wife claims the pension, they would return the amount with interest. After preliminary hearing, the bench of Justice A J Desai and Justice A P Thaker admitted the petition and sought reply from the authorities by October 11, when further hearing has been posted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ex-armymans-2nd-wife-moves-hc/articleshow/84659228.cms||---

---||Pune||Seasonal illnesses make comeback; most fever patients don‚Äôt have Covid||PUNE: Seasonal viral illnesses that had been overtaken by the pandemic are now slowly reemerging. A sizeable number of people are reporting to doctors with fever, sore throat and other symptoms. But they're testing negative for Covid-19. General practitioners and physicians peg the ratio of seasonal illnesses to Covid at 90:10. In addition to vector-borne illnesses such as dengue and chikungunya, monsoon ailments like diarrohea, typhoid and skin infections have also seen an uptick. ‚ÄúLast June and July, fever meant Covid in most cases. Now, fever may indicate a host of seasonal ailments. It may sound odd, but it feels nice to see normal seasonal ailments making a comeback after a year,‚Äù said Santaji Kadam, a family physician in Karvenagar. Sahyadri Hospital's senior physician Atul Joshi said, "It is true. We are seeing other viral illnesses during this season. Last year, at the same time, there were only Covid patients but now, we're seeing patients with dengue, common cold and flu." The hospital has recorded a Covid positivity rate of around 4-5%. "Out of 100 Covid tests, only 4-5 patients are coming positive," Joshi said. At onset, it is very difficult to differentiate between common flu and Covid symptoms. "After 3-4 days, if symptoms are persistent and there is extreme fatigue, then Covid needs to be ruled out," Joshi said. At Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH), infectious disease expert Parikshit Prayag said, ‚ÄúWe are now seeing influenza, dengue and other seasonal infections. Covid is not the only infection we are seeing. There were months when we barely saw any other tropical infection.‚Äù At DMH, Covid positivity is currently around 5-10%. "Although we have started seeing other infections, Covid remains an important consideration in all our fever patients," Prayag said. Testing is also key. "When there are flu-like symptoms, it is important to test for Covid. Testing helps in planning and also isolates a patient and curbs the spread," Prayag said. Even with the dip in Covid, experts said citizens should not neglect flu-like symptoms. "Whenever one has flu-like symptoms, consulting a doctor is more important than dismissing them outright," Prayag said. Critical care expert Kapil Borawake said, "One should continue to consider all fever patients as Covid cases, unless proved otherwise through testing." Specialists said Covid-appropriate behaviour has to continue. "The latest serosurvey results are reassuring, but physicians are still worried about the possibility of a third Covid wave, September onwards," said senior physician Narendra Javadekar. Virologists at the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV), however, have emphasized that there may be other influenza strains in circulation but thinking that SARS-CoV-2 is no longer a predominant strain would be a 'mistake'. "It is a phase when we have to be alert," said NIV scientist Pragya Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/seasonal-illnesses-make-comeback-most-fever-patients-dont-have-covid/articleshow/84659202.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The cops escorted the protesters from Singhu to Jantar Mantar and back to Singhu on Thursday, the first day of the farmers‚Äô Kisan Sansad. Around 30,000 police and paramilitary personnel were deployed across the city, with around 6,000 at Jantar Mantar. Amid the strict security arrangement at Jantar Mantar, media people were allowed in only after a thorough scrutiny of their identity cards. Initially there was confusion as media persons were not allowed to enter the protest site and were confined to an enclosure. But they were later permitted into the barricaded protest site after the farmers intervened and said they wanted the media to be allowed inside. Police said the journalists were stopped as part of the crowd management since a large number of media people wanted to go in at the same time. A scuffle broke out and a 45-year-old cameraperson of a news channel suffered injuries when a man identified as Prabhjot Singh, 41, who claimed to be working as a freelance journalist entered the media enclosure and began abusing and mocking the members of the national media who were present at the Kisan Sansad site. Singh could actually be seen going close to the spots where reporters from specific news organisations were standing and throwing invectives at them. A police officer said, ‚ÄúAmid all this, a scuffle took place and Prabhjot Singh allegedly hit the cameraperson with the stick he was using to hold his phone while recording the proceedings. The victim started bleeding and was taken to hospital, having injured his hand. Further action will be taken against the attacker once we receive a complaint from the victim, but so far we haven‚Äôt received any.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-escort-farmers-from-singhu-back/articleshow/84659238.cms||---

With no arrangements to pump out excess water from the lake, the heavy rains from July 15 have caused flooding of pavements, green patches and the duck island (partially) located in the middle of the lake. The iron grille around the lake has also been damaged. There is barely any space to walk now and the locals fear that another spell of showers will bring the lake water to the level of the road. ‚ÄúThe lake brims with water every year, but it hasn‚Äôt rained as much as this year, so the situation hadn‚Äôt yet been worrisome. But this time, it has rained continuously for days and water from the entire Model Town area flows into the lake, which is 5-6 ft below the road level,‚Äù said Pushpendra Goel, vice-president, Lake Area Residents‚Äô Association (LARA). ‚ÄúWe thought the water would recede after it stopped raining, but the situation is still disturbing.‚Äù Mukesh Agarwal, LARA general secretary, also pointed out the need to make suitable arrangements for the ducks since their roosting area has been submerged. Aggarwal added, ‚ÄúWe approached the authorities, including North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Delhi Tourism and the area councillor, to consider installing a pump to remove the water from the area. We were assured by the civic body that one would be arranged soon, but we are yet to see any progress. However, with the help of the public health department, we have been able to arrange the spraying of insecticides.‚Äù A north corporation official claimed there was no outlet for pumping out the excess water from the lake. ‚ÄúWe got to know about the overflowing in the lake from the residents and have arranged a pump. By Friday, we will also take other steps, including rescuing the ducks. Due to Covid protocols, boating in the lake had been discontinued, but the responsibility of running the boating services and maintenance of the lake was Delhi Tourism‚Äôs, so we will contact them too,‚Äù said the official. Due to the rain and the overflowing of the lake, residents also complained about snakes coming out of their holes and entering nearby houses. ‚ÄúWe received complaints from two houses and contacted a wildlife NGO for help,‚Äù said Mahendra Agarwal, secretary, LARA. ‚ÄúBesides, rats have also been spotted, probably because their habitats too are inundated with rainwater.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/naini-lake-threatens-to-enter-model-town-homes/articleshow/84659346.cms||Vibha Sharma

The CEO carried out an inspection of various parks in residential sectors, including 62, 63, 46A, 93A, 50, 12 and green belts across sectors 93B, 105 and 108. While in some sectors, labourers were found missing, at others, garbage and horticulture waste was seen even as pruning of trees and grass was found unsatisfactory in some places. An official said, ‚ÄúThe contractor of Sector 50 Meghdootam park was fined Rs 5 lakh as one toilet was shut and the other had a broken door. The contractor of Sector 46A park, where only three labourers were found working, was fined Rs 6 lakh. The contractor of Express View park at Sector 93A was fined Rs 10 lakh for unsatisfactory work of pruning of grass and overall lack of sanitation.‚Äù Further, while no gardener was found working in the central verges and green belts at many places, the contractor of sector 63 A-block park was blacklisted for no labour found working in the park even as garbage was found littered near the entry gate. Meanwhile, following complaints of lack of upkeep and overall maintenance in Sector Beta 1 parks, GNIDA officials visited the area on Thursday and the residents apprised them of broken roads, wire fencing, benches, swings etc. Officials were also shown areas where the drains are choked leading to overflow of sewer water and encroachment on roads in the sector. ‚ÄúToday sector Beta 1 was visited by Ashok Kumar Arora general manager GNIDA along with other officials including Praveen Salonia senior manager and managers Surendra Bhati, Prabhat Shankar, Karan Singh Tyagi, BP Singh and Surendra Singh. During their visit, we apprised the officials that since the possession of plots in the sector, its parks, roads, community centre and overall maintenance is not up to the mark,‚Äù said Harinder Bhati, resident of the sector. Bhati, who is also a member of the Active Citizen Team (ACT), a residents‚Äô body in Greater Noida, added that while there‚Äôs seepage and cracks in the walls of the community centre, majority benches and swings in the sector parks are broken. ‚ÄúDue to the non-functioning lights in the Shaheed Bismillah Park in the sector, it has become a haven for anti-social elements. Not only that, boundary walls of parks in some blocks are broken leading to stray cattle damaging the plants and grass,‚Äù said Bhati. Manoj Nagar, another member of ACT apprised officials over the clogged drains in the sector leading to overflow of sewer water. ‚ÄúOne major problem is that most residents have built concrete slabs in front of their homes leading to inaccessibility to drain cleaning. This has to be attended to by the concerned contractor who hasn‚Äôt bothered so far,‚Äù said Nagar. Anupam Yadav, a resident added that while most wire fencing in the sector is broken, a boundary wall should be built in its place. ‚ÄúThis will not only help curb stray cattle, but also address the issue of encroachment on sector roads,‚Äù said Yadav. Arora from GNIDA assured action on all the problem areas and issued a warning to the concerned contractors. ‚ÄúWe will address all the complaints pointed out by the residents. I have also issued a warning to the concerned contractors. Staff from the authority have further been directed to monitor the work thoroughly,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/park-upkeep-contractors-fined-rs-21l/articleshow/84659379.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

One of them even died due to massive bleeding, the authorities at a leading private hospital said on Thursday. Liver abscess (pus formation in liver) is commonly caused by a parasite, entamoeba histolytica, which is transmitted through contaminated food and water, a doctor said. These patients, 10 men and four women in the age group of 28-74, were brought to the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) in the past two months with ‚Äúunusual manifestations‚Äù, the doctor added. The doctors suspect that poor nutrition and use of steroids could have led to pus formation and compromised their livers. ‚ÄúWhat we found unusual was that, after recovery from Covid, patients who were otherwise immunocompetent, within 22 days had large areas of both lobes of liver filled with pus at multiple locations, requiring drainage and hospitalisation,‚Äù said Dr Anil Arora, chairman, institute of liver gastroenterology and pancreaticobiliary sciences, SGRH. While the lives of 13 of these patients could be saved, one of them with large multiple abscesses died due to massive bleeding after rupture of abscess in the abdominal cavity, he said, adding the rest were stable and had been discharged.

Excessive rainfall has been recorded in pockets of Akola, Washim, Buldhana and Yavatmal. According to data collected by the agriculture department, as many as 76 revenue circles have received more than 65 mm rainfall. This is the threshold limit to declare excessive rains in a given area. A joint survey will be conducted by the revenue and agriculture departments to assess losses to crops and other property in line with the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) norms, said government sources. Each revenue circle has 4 to 10 villages depending on the size. Districts like Buldhana, Washim and Akola have been prone to dry spells. Both Buldhana and Washim have suffered water shortages in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Akola has also been in the grip of water shortage from time to time. This year, in Washim, 13 revenue circles have got excessive rainfall, while the number is 12 in Washim and 26 in Akola. Yavatmal has been the most affected district, with 28 revenue circles affected. These are in Pusad, Umarkhed and Mohgaon talukas. The Yavatmal district collector said water receded later in the day and there was no untoward incident. The likely damage to crops is also moderate and surveys will be carried out by the concerned talathi, said an official from agriculture department and the gram sevak. Even as rains were needed, districts of western Vidarbha, which come under the Amravati division, have seen excess rains affecting crops in some of the revenue circles. However, the situation can still be salvaged, said agriculture department sources. Advisories have been issued by the state‚Äôs agriculture department, asking farmers to remove water logged in their farms. In eastern Vidarbha, rains have helped salvage the paddy crop. Transplantation of paddy shoots had been delayed due to the gap in rains. It could be resumed due to recent downpour. There are no reports of crops being affected in the Nagpur division, which covers eastern Vidarbha, said sources in the agriculture department. Sachin Kulkarni, a water conservation activist from Washim, said, ‚ÄúThe pockets that suffered some of the worst dry spells have received good rains this year. However, lack of proper management has also led to rainwater going waste. The choice of sites for dams and barrages could have been better to ensure more conservation.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rains-hit-pockets-of-western-vid-help-paddy-plantation-in-east/articleshow/84656701.cms||Shishir Arya

As many as 15 industrial associations from Rajkot, Morbi and Federation of Kutch Industries Association (FOKIA) represented their issues to the team that comprised of industries commissioner Rahul Gupta, GIDC vice-chairman and MD M Thennarasan, GPCB member secretary AV Shah and others. Talking to TOI, Gupta said ‚ÄúThe industrial associations discussed their set of problems, most of them which pertained to GIDC. The concerned officers have responded accordingly and we have assured them to iron out issues that can be solved expeditiously. Some issues and suggestions were policy-related which will have to be highlighted at the appropriate level.‚Äù Representatives of the association said that they are paying Rs 52 for 1,000 litre Narmada water, which they felt was exorbitant. Another suggestion was to construct Awas Yojana for GIDC workers in a common plot. Parth Ganatra, vice-president, Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) said, ‚ÄúWe also suggested that the fire NOC should be issued by GIDC only and there should be allotment of some space of industrial estates for commercial activity.‚Äù Ganatra said this was the first time that such an open house was organized and officers came to their doorstep to listen and solve their issues. ‚ÄúWe are hopeful that such open discussions yield positive results and similar open houses are held every six months,‚Äù he said. Dr Rajiv Kumar Gupta, additional chief secretary, industries, said, ‚ÄúThe team of senior industries department officials has been pro-actively interacting with industry stakeholders across Gujarat over the past many weeks. This exercise has immensely benefited all. Several nagging issues faced by industries have been resolved in a time-bound manner. The ease of doing business is our priority,‚Äù FOKIA‚Äôs major suggestion was that in the last 15 years, no new GIDC estate has come up in Kutch and developing one will benefit MSMEs. The umbrella organization of all Kutch industries also urged expediting the gauge conversion of Bhuj-Naliya-Vayor project and extending it to Koteshwar-Lakhpat. Nimish Phadke, managing director, FOKIA said ‚ÄúWe have represented these issues to the government from time to time but after the discussion in the open house, we are hopeful that the issues will be addressed in a short period of time.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/saurashtra-industries-assured-of-quick-redressal/articleshow/84656689.cms||---

But their own Union minister of state, who comes from a backward caste, has announced in the Parliament that the Centre will not carry out caste-based census. Why has the Centre decided to skip the enumeration of OBCs? Why is it that BJP has so much hatred for the OBC and EBC?‚Äù Tejashwi asked. He said surveys are done to count number of animals, vehicles and every possible thing. ‚ÄúCounting of people based on religion is also done, but counting of those who are from the suppressed castes is skipped. The government just has to add one extra column while carrying out the census and it will not incur any extra financial burden on it,‚Äù Tejashwi said. He announced that the RJD will continue its fight for the cause as the matter is related to ‚Äú65% of the population of the country who are suppressed, neglected and harassed‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhy is the Modi government avoiding counting the number of Hindus from the backward castes? Are those 70-80 crore backward caste people not Hindus?‚Äù Tejashwi further asked. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said legislators of all the parties, including BJP and JD(U), had supported the resolution in the Bihar assembly as well as in the Council for a caste-based census. ‚ÄúBJP‚Äôs current stand shows that they are directed by the RSS,‚Äù Gagan said. JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said the ruling party had been batting for caste-based census from the very beginning. ‚ÄúThe knowledge of exact population will help the governments make proper schemes and implement them. It was on the initiative of CM Nitish Kumar that a resolution in this regard was passed in both Houses of the state legislature and a proposal was sent to the Centre,‚Äù Nishad added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-seeks-caste-based-census-in-country-slams-bjp/articleshow/84656684.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ex-IPS officer Bhairon Singh appears before probe agency||JAIPUR: Retired Delhi police officer Bhairon Singh Gurjar appeared before Rajasthan anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Thursday in connection with his alleged involvement in a bribe-for-marks case in interviews for Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS) exam 2018. DG (ACB) BL Soni told TOI that Gurjar appeared before the bureau at 10.30am and left around 2.30pm. ‚ÄúThe case is currently under investigation. If need be, we may call him again,‚Äù he said. Sources in the bureau said Gurjar, a former top cop of Delhi police, was accompanied by his lawyers. Gurjar is the husband of a Rajasthan Public Service Commission (RPSC) member. His name came up when the ACB on July 9 arrested a junior accountant of the RPSC in Ajmer while taking a bribe of Rs 23 lakh by promising higher marks in the interview round for the RAS 2018. During subsequent interrogation, the accused revealed the name of another accomplice, Narendra Singh Poswal. The ACB learned that Poswal, who worked as a toll-booth supervisor in Dausa, had claimed himself to be a personal assistant (PA) to Gurjar. The officials said when they asked Gurjar about his connection with Poswal, the former denied that Poswal was his aide. The ACB officials, however, said their investigation into the alleged bribery case will continue. ‚ÄúWe still need answers to some more questions. Poswal‚Äôs claims of being Gurjar‚Äôs aide will be probed further,‚Äù an official said. The ACB last week had asked Gurjar to appear before the agency, but he sent a reply to the officials claiming that he was unable to appear because he was traveling. He finally arrived on Thursday when the bureau asked him some important questions in relation to the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ex-ips-officer-bhairon-singh-gurjar-appear-before-acb-in-bribe-for-marks-case/articleshow/84659408.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two kill realtor to avenge kin‚Äôs murder, held||NEW DELHI: To avenge their uncle‚Äôs murder at the hands of a realtor, two cousins waited for three years. Jailed in 2018 for the murder, the realtor was acquitted and released a few months ago, following which he was shot by the duo, who have now been arrested. According to DCP (North West) Usha Rangnani, the accused were identified as Sohail (22) and Aas Mohammad (20), residents of Raghubir Nagar. The realtor, Vinod Bhati, was shot around 12.30pm on June 26 this year at his office by the two accused, who opened indiscriminate fire. The case initially remained blind, but later police got some leads after looking into Bhati‚Äôs history and found that the two suspects had absconded. On July 21, the cops received information about the accused coming to a park in Pitampura to meet an associate. A trap was laid, and the accused were spotted coming out of the park by the informer. The cop flagged them down, but they tried to flee. They were, however, overpowered and arrested. A pistol was recovered from one of them. During interrogation, the cousins revealed that they had murdered Bhati to seek revenge for the murder of their uncle, Mohammad Riyaz. On October 14, 2018, Bhati and his associates caught Riyaz, a criminal, in Raghubir Nagar after a minor argument and thrashed him. During the assault, Bhati allegedly stabbed him in the head with a knife. Riyaz fell down bleeding profusely, while Bhati fled. He was later arrested and was in judicial custody since. However, after being acquitted due to lack of evidence, Bhati came out of jail on April 1. Initially, he kept a low profile, but soon opened an office in the name of ‚ÄúGanesh Properties‚Äù and resumed a normal life. However, the brothers got to know about his release and decided to kill him. They tracked him down to his office, and on June 25, shot him multiple times and fled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-kill-realtor-to-avenge-kins-murder-held/articleshow/84659440.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Two months on, Warora tigress still moving with wire snare in Chandrapur forest||NAGPUR: Even after two months, Chandrapur forest officials have failed to capture a five-year-old tigress moving in Salori forest of Warora range with a wire snare stuck in her neck. Images show the big cat has suffered wounds around the neck and is in distress. It is also feared that the tigress is pregnant. ‚ÄúIt is possible that the tigress may be pregnant, but our priority is to capture the animal and treat her before releasing it the wild,‚Äù said NR Praveen, chief conservator of forests (CCF), Chandrapur. The tigress with a wire snare was first sighted on May 23. It is almost two months, neither the tigress has been captured, nor any accused persons have been nabbed for laying the wire snares. The tigress is moving in Warora and adjoining Bhadravati ranges. Sources said the snares, a regular practice by locals to poach herbivores for bushmeat, were suspected to have been laid by Palasgaon (Shingru) villagers, who were relocated on zudpi jungle land near Salori two years ago. In April 2019, some villagers from Palasgaon (Shingru) were held for the death of a tigress entangled in a steel wire trap in Khatoda inside Tadoba. During that period, the village was in the process of being relocated. ‚ÄúNow, it seems, the same poaching tricks are being used to kill wild animals here,‚Äù said sources. Praveen admits there are three tigers, leopards, and other wild animal species in the Salori forest, which is contiguous with the buffer zone of Tadoba. ‚ÄúOur teams are trying hard to capture the tigress. Besides, forest cover has grown dense due to rains, making our task difficult. A day before our team was sitting on a machan waiting for the tigress to come for a bait it had killed, but the animal turned up after 6.30pm, minutes after the team had left waiting for the entire day,‚Äù said the CCF. Praveen added, ‚ÄúWe have been recording pictures of the tigress on camera trap, but it is avoiding humans. Perhaps, we erred earlier by deploying too many people to capture the tigress, causing commotion. Now, we have restricted the numbers to two small rescue teams including a tracker, sharpshooter, and a wildlife vet. We expect to capture the animal soon. Even during rains, the capture operation is continuing.‚Äù Vishal More, president of All People‚Äôs Admire Society (APAS), an NGO from Warora working to save wildlife, alleged that Warora RFO Madhukar Rathod messed up the entire operation by not acting in time. No efforts were taken to nab the culprits who laid the wire traps, he said. Rathod was unavailable for comments. ‚ÄúThere is lack of coordination between the RFO and staff under him, which has created the mess. Who had stopped the forest teams to capture the tigress in May and June when there were no rains and visibility was clear. A lot of time was wasted due to the indifferent approach of forest staff. Now, the neck wound of the tigress has worsened and is clearly visible,‚Äù said More.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-months-on-warora-tigress-still-moving-with-wire-snare/articleshow/84656780.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Additionally, the students would also get accidental, hospitalization and death insurance from NU from the new academic session 2021-22 which commenced this month. A panel set up by NU Management Council (MC) under its member Vishnu Changde has prepared a detailed proposal where every student would be charged about Rs30 every year for Rs3 lakh insurance to cover the fees. The panel would be meeting on Friday and Saturday to finalize the insurance firm. On June 18, TOI was the first to report about NU‚Äôs plans of offering insurance to its students from the new session. NU is perhaps the only traditional university in Maharashtra where its students aren‚Äôt insured till date. The MC panel had proposed to charge this amount after extensive discussions with the firms offering insurance and taking into account the number of students. ‚ÄúI had been following this proposal since the outbreak of Covid-19 where I saw many students lose their legal guardians to the deadly virus. Accidental and death insurance are being offered by all other universities. We would be the first one to offer insurance to cover fees in case of a legal guardian‚Äôs death. We arrived at the figure of Rs3 lakh as it would take care of those pursuing education in engineering and other professional courses,‚Äù Changde told TOI. NU has taken quotations from various insurance firms, including those run by the government. The students would be offered accidental insurance along with the hospitalisation charges and in case of their death, their family members would receive the amount. ‚ÄúA lot of discussion took place on where the amount would be transferred in case of students‚Äô death. Option of opening a joint account of college and students or the university was also considered. The formalities would be finalized by Saturday after our meetings,‚Äù said Changde. The Maharashtra government had made it mandatory for all universities to insure all its enrolled students for accidents, hospitalization and deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-1st-nu-to-offer-fee-insurance-on-death-of-parents-guardian/articleshow/84654492.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Deshmukh, 70, through his senior counsel Amit Desai, had said the FIR was ‚Äúvague‚Äù and ‚Äúmotivated,‚Äù and wanted it totally quashed. He said lodging of FIR needed prior sanction since he was a public servant and the state‚Äôs prior consent was needed for CBI to probe. His counsel had said even ‚ÄúAjmal Kasab got the benefit of rule of law in this country.‚Äù The HC said, about Deshmukh‚Äôs plea, ‚ÄúThe audacity of the submission that the FIR does not disclose a prima facie offence is belied by the hard facts of the case.‚ÄùThe HC held prior state consent was not necessary for a CBI probe, ‚Äúespecially when the Division Bench has adverted to the necessity of entrusting the enquiry to an independent agency as it found that cognizable offences were prima facie made out‚Äù. On whether prior sanction was needed as mandated under Section 17A of PCA since Deshmukh was a public servant, the HC said the section ‚Äúis not held by court to be a fetter when a higher court is convinced that impartial probe is needed by an independent agency‚Äù.The HC had on April 5 directed CBI to do a preliminary enquiry into a complaint by advocate Jaishri Patil, based on ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh‚Äôs letter alleging ‚Äúcorrupt malpractices‚Äù by Deshmukh who allegedly asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore per month from restaurants and bars.The HC also noted it had expressed its anxiety during hearing on how or whether the probe would be broadbased to ‚Äúinvestigate acts and omissions of officers who might have had a role‚Äù, apart from Deshmukh. The HC judgment records that CBI, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, assured it about the ‚Äúintegrity of investigation‚Äù and that it would be ‚Äúdone dispassionately‚Äù as investigation is ‚Äúissue-centric‚Äù. It was not uncommon that a person who sets the law in motion is also eventually indicted, CBI had submitted, adding its ‚Äúendeavour would be to honour the spirit of the order under which the investigation has been directed‚Äù.The HC did not accept the state‚Äôs submission that consistent demand by CBI for ex-state intelligence commissioner Rashmu Shukla‚Äôs report amounts to derailing or interference of its probe into leaking of her report. If the state is saying nothing of substance was found in her report, ‚Äúwe are unable to appreciate the steadfast resistance‚Äù by state to share it with CBI, it said.The HC agreed with Mehta, for CBI, that Singh‚Äôs plea was to ‚Äúcleanse the system of police postings and transfers allegedly made for extraneous consideration, in future‚Äù. To the state‚Äôs submission that Singh had sought to put past postings and transfers on the radar, the HC said that on April 5, the CJ-led bench had said Singh‚Äôs letter raised issues that placed citizens‚Äô faith in police and state machinery at stake, necessitating an independent probe.The HC granted no stay on the dismissal verdicts. To the state‚Äôs plea for stay, it said ‚Äúit was not expedient to stay, else it would amount to interfering with the investigation which is underway‚Äù and to Deshmukh‚Äôs counsel who sought a stay saying question of law was involved, HC saw ‚Äúno justifiable reason to stay‚Äù its judgment. Kamlesh Ghumre, advocate for Deshmukh, later said, ‚ÄúOnce we study the judgment, we will decide the course of action.‚Äù‚ÄúWe clarify that the observations are made‚Äù only for the state‚Äôs petition, said HC, and not on pending petitions of Shukla and Singh, to be heard on July 28. Inherent powers to quash FIR are required to be exercised in exceptional cases, it said. ‚ÄúWhen the truth is yet to be unearthed, this Court cannot embark upon the inquiry into correctness...of the allegations.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-state-resistance-to-sharing-ex-intel-chiefs-report-puzzling/articleshow/84659535.cms||---

---||Kochi||‚ÄòState govt won‚Äôt extend validity of PSC rank lists‚Äô||Thiruvananthapuram: The government will not extend the validity of PSC rank lists as steps are being taken to report all vacancies and make appointments at the earliest, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the assembly on Thursday. Replying to a submission by opposition leader V D Satheesan, the chief minister said that it is not the policy of the government to extend the validity of rank lists or not report existing vacancies. He said that all exams, to be conducted by PSC for preparing the new rank lists and interviews that are presently delayed, will resume immediately after the intensity of the pandemic subsides. He said that an online facility was set up to report all vacancies to PSC, and the administrative vigilance team is conducting inspections in all offices to ensure that all vacancies are reported on time. In addition, a committee under the chief secretary is also functioning to ensure that all vacancies are reported in a time-bound manner. The opposition leader raised the matter as the validity of close to 500 rank-lists in various posts at the entry level in the government would expire on August 4. He demanded that the government should extend their validity by six more months.  He added that the government is behaving as if PSC rank holders are enemies and that the government is yet to fulfil its promises that were given to PSC rank holders before the elections. He alleged that the government‚Äôs efforts are to fill the vacancies through temporary back-door appointments, when the efforts of thousands of youths are going in vain. The opposition leader said that even when the government claims that all the steps have been taken to fill existing vacancies, only two more weeks are left for the rank lists to expire and within that time, appointments cannot be completed. He added that since the exams and interviews are also not happening, preparations of new rank-lists are also delayed, which will create a vacuum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-govt-wont-extend-validity-of-psc-rank-lists/articleshow/84656825.cms||---

Police received a report that the victim, Snehlata Trivedi was found dead at her residence in Hiran Magri area on July 19. The incident came to light when one of the relatives visited her in the evening. The accused was identified as Rajkumar Joshi, a vegetable vendor. According to Rajeev Pachar SP, Udaipur, the accused has a previous criminal record. He was jailed for 10 years in a case related to the rape of a Spanish tourist in the year 2000 but being a juvenile then, he was later released. The accused was working as a medical attendant before the lockdown and also served the victim‚Äôs husband when he was bed-ridden. After the lockdown, the accused was jobless and started to sell vegetables in the area. Knowing that the elderly woman used to live alone in the house after her husband‚Äôs death, he visited her. The accused called the woman out, since he was known to her, she called him inside the house and offered him water. He tried to loot the valuables and when she resisted, he pushed her with a towel around her neck and hit her head on the wall. After killing her, he fled away with jewellery, cash and mobile. The police, after a detailed investigation of the crime, identified the accused and nabbed him from the Ghantaghar area after a long chase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/elderly-woman-murder-accused-vegetable-vendor-held/articleshow/84659500.cms||---
---||Chennai||Fudged data shows high vax coverage in Tamil Nadu; experts cry foul||CHENNAI: Two gross statistical errors made by the directorate of public health have falsely projected 62% of Tamil Nadu‚Äôs population as being relatively safe against Covid-19 infection. Public health experts now fear this claim may not just underestimate risks but also have a drastic impact on the policies, plans and funding the department receives amidst the anticipated third wave. Analysis by TOI showed that the DPH fudged vaccination coverage figures in its daily report to the state government to hype coverage to 30%, though it is only half that in reality. For instance, on July 20, the vaccination coverage report said that of the eligible 6.06 crore adults in the state, 1.49 crore people have taken the first dose and 34.22 lakh have taken the second dose. This means nearly 25% of the population has taken the first dose and 6% has taken the second dose. So, how does the directorate claim its 30%? A senior official in the public health department said they simply added the number of people who took the first dose and the number of people who took both doses to show the number of doses that have been completed. Epidemiologists point out that in that case, officials should have divided the tally with the dosage target, which is twice the population because everyone gets two doses of the vaccine. The target dosage, in that case, would have been 16%, just half of what the government‚Äôs claim. This is because less than 2 crore of the 12-crore doses were administered until July 20. ‚ÄúThis is needless misinterpretation of data, which can cause serious problems when the data is used to plan health policies, including unlocking strategies and preventive steps against the anticipated third wave,‚Äù said public health expert R Sunderraman, former director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre. ‚ÄúEveryone knows there is a vaccine shortage. What is wrong in saying the exact number?‚Äù he said. Data reporting gets worse when the DPH uses an unscientific method of adding serosurvey results to spruce up the number of people with antibodies. Two doses of the vaccine help people develop artificially-induced antibodies that give them protection against the virus. But people who are naturally infected also develop these antibodies. The state has done three serosurveys to measure antibodies in people. The first survey, done in 2020 before the vaccine launch, showed 32% of people had antibodies. Senior microbiologists like Dr Gagandeep Kang from Vellore Institute of Medical Sciences had earlier told TOI that seropositivity rates and vaccination rates cannot be added, as some seropositive individuals would have been vaccinated later. ‚ÄúEven with high levels of seropositivity and vaccination, we still have a large population that is unprotected. But that will, hopefully, decrease with increased vaccine coverage over time,‚Äù she said. The state has added this number to the number of people vaccinated to show that 62% of the people have developed antibodies. The percentage of people with antibodies dropped to 23% in the second phase done in April. The comprehensive results of the third phase, which is expected to be higher than the first two phases, is still not available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fudged-data-shows-high-vax-coverage-in-tn-experts-cry-foul/articleshow/84659539.cms||---

The doctor‚Äôs licence has been suspended for nine months.Another doctor had allegedly provided wrong information in her annual confidential report (ACR) and mentioned misleading qualification on her prescription letterhead which led to suspension of licence for six months.A panel of ethical committee of RMC comprising Dr Ish Munjal, Dr Jagmohan Mathur, Dr Srikant and Dr Deepak Sharma heard the cases and suspended the registration of both the doctors.‚ÄúThey will not be allowed to practice medicine for the tenure of suspension of their licences,‚Äù said an RMC official.An official said, the doctors who were suspended for six months is an associate professor of JLN Medical College who had mentioned in her ACR that she had contributed in 177 medical journals, but actually, it was found that she had only contributed in 55 medical journals. Also, she had mentioned in her prescription letterhead that she had done PhD in cardio which is actually not a degree or qualification and it was misleading information she was providing to the patients, the official said.Besides, the associate professor of SMS Medical College had taken a patient from SMS Hospital to his private hospital where he provided her treatment for 15 days. When his condition deteriorated, he shifted the patient again to SMS Hospital, but the patient died.

In her petition, Salini O G, who has been transferred as assistant director in the directorate of general education (higher secondary), has said that the remarks against her in the government order that cancelled her ‚Äúgood service entry‚Äù has caused her immense mental trauma and has deeply hurt her self-respect. She has petitioned that at least the remarks against her made in the order should be withdrawn even if the government decides to cancel her ‚Äúgood service entry‚Äù. Jayathilak had issued the order last week cancelling the ‚Äúgood service entry‚Äù of Salini citing that the integrity of the officer was doubtful. ‚ÄúFacts that have been brought to the light subsequently from a preliminary inquiry and examination of certain files clearly show that her integrity is not beyond doubt,‚Äù the order had said. In her petition, the officer said that it is not clear what is the charge against her to conclude that her integrity is doubtful. She further said that she has neither been heard nor any explanation been sought from her before reaching at such a conclusion to cancel the ‚Äúgood service entry‚Äù that was conferred on her suo-moto by the government. On July 7, she was forced to avail leave for two months, reportedly after being admonished by higher-ups. This week, the government had transferred her outside the secretariat to the general education directorate. Meanwhile, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the petition by the officer has been handed over to the chief secretary who would examine it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/official-petitions-min-seeking-removal-of-adverse-remarks/articleshow/84656890.cms||‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º ‡§®‡•á‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 1,000 Ruparel students still await start of online class||Mumbai: While colleges across the city started online lectures around June 15, over 1,000 students from Matunga‚Äôs DG Ruparel College are yet to attend a single class. Lectures for self-financed courses such as BMS, BSc-IT, BSc-Computer Science have not started at all as the college has not appointed teachers for the current academic session. Students have already taken admission to the second and third-year programmes and even paid the fees. While most other colleges have completed 30 days of teaching, students from the college will be at a loss when the Mumbai University announces a common exam schedule. A college official said services of teachers for self-financed courses are terminated at the end of every academic year and they are re-appointed at the start of the year. This year, there have been delays in the appointment process, said the official. The official said the advertisements inviting applications from teachers were released on June 22, which usually happens in May. Interviews were conducted this week and the college is hoping to start classes soon. A source from the college said that there was a new management and it was not sure about the developments. Apart from some divisions of BMS, BSc-IT and BSc-Computer Science, two unaided divisions of SY and TYBCom are also affected. Some students have approached activists from the Yuva Sena. University senate member Pradeep Sawant said these students were at home for a month waiting for online classes to begin. ‚ÄúThe college has already admitted students to the second and third year and taken the tuition fees. We have demanded that classes start immediately and asked the government to take action against the management. The new management may have some new plans for the campus, but they cannot delay classes for so long,‚Äù said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1000-ruparel-students-still-await-start-of-online-class/articleshow/84659871.cms||Yogita Rao

The accused was also fined Rs 11,000, of which Rs 8,000 will be given to the child as compensation. While the child did not depose due to health issues, special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma cited the evidence of her mother and aunt to seek the conviction of the accused. The accused has been in jail since his arrest on June 8, 2018. The mother told the court that since the child was born with severe health concerns, her husband was never attached to her. Later, she left him and moved to another house which she had purchased but the accused started visiting that house too. One day, the accused came to their house again and attempted to sexually assault the child. The woman then confided in her employer who, in turn, told her about an NGO. The NGO helped the woman lodge an FIR.

Commenting on the protest march call by the Joint Government Doctors Coordination Committee (JGDCC) from civil hospital, Mohali to the residence of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on July 23, Dr Gurinder Singh Walia, former joint director, animal husbandry, Punjab and member, Punjab State Veterinary Council, said it was really unfortunate that an elite class of doctors was compelled to take the protest to the roads to shake up the government, which had failed to fulfill people‚Äôs aspirations. He added that while every government employee expected an increase in salary upon implementation of 6th Punjab Pay Commission recommendations, it had belied their belief. Dr Nitn Kumar Gupta, former chief executive officer of Punjab Gau Sewa Commission said it was a black day in history of Punjab when doctors had been forced to agitate on reduction of their salaries. He urged the CM to take cognisance of their demands in the interest of poor patients and government doctors, failing which they would be forced to migrate to greener pastures abroad. Those present in the meeting included former deputy directors Dr Nirmaljit Singh Mahal, Dr Rajinder Kumar Vasdev, Dr Raghunandan Sharma, Dr Guriqbal and vets Dr Ramesh Sofat and Dr Rajiv Bhandari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/senior-vets-take-to-roads-against-npa-cut/articleshow/84656867.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Vaccine shortage forces Kolkata Municipal Corporation to shut Covaxin-only jab centres||KOLKATA: An acute shortage of Covaxin supply on Thursday compelled Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) to shut its Covid vaccination centres (CVC) that administer the vaccine. The stock of Covaxin was grossly inadequate and hence it was not possible for the civic body to keep its clinics that administer only Covaxin doses open, according to Atin Ghosh, member of the KMC Board of Administrators (BoA). However, a section of KMC health officials felt even a temporary closure might inflate the backlog of Covaxin second doses, which now stands at 40,000 doses. There are 38 KMC vaccination clinics that administer only Covaxin shots. ‚ÄúAt present, our stock of Covaxin is so poor that we can‚Äôt even spare five vials for each centre exclusively meant for administering Covaxin doses. So, after a round of discussion with the civic brass, we have decided to keep our Covaxin clinics shut for this weekend. Hopefully, we will resume vaccination from next week provided the supply of Covaxin improves,‚Äù a KMC health department official said. Besides 38 vaccination clinics, KMC has been running a Covaxin mega centre at Roxy Theatre. The mega centre will also remain shut this weekend, added a civic official. A KMC health department official associated with the Covid vaccination process on Thursday expressed worries over the dearth of Covaxin doses. ‚ÄúWith scanty supply hardly meeting huge demands, the pendency is now increasing every day. We don‚Äôt know what will happen if the supply doesn‚Äôt improve by this weekend,‚Äù the civic official said. Sources in the KMC health department said the shortage of Covaxin had forced them to allot five vials to each of the 38 vaccination clinics in the past two weeks. ‚ÄúEven two weeks ago, the scene was not encouraging. We were facing a crisis throughout this month, which has led to a backlog of 40,000 second-dose recipients,‚Äù a KMC health department official said. However, an improvement in the supply of Covishield doses on Thursday allowed KMC health officials to allocate 200 doses to the clinics that administer only Covishield. Over 150 KMC vaccination clinics administer Covishield doses. ‚ÄúWith an improved supply of Covishield, we could clear a part of the backlog so far as second doses of Covishield is concerned,‚Äù said a KMC health official. According to a KMC medical officer posted in Tollygunge, 70% of the additional allocation of Covishield doses was kept reserved for the recipients of second doses. Most private hospitals have a very low reserve of Covaxin and a few have been administering between 50 and 60 doses a day, as opposed to Covishield, which is averaging above 600. RN Tagore International Insrtitute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), for instance, has been administering less than 50 a day. ‚ÄúWe have a very limited quantity,‚Äù said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Peerless Hospital administered 62 doses of Covaxin on Thursday while its Covishield tally was 385. ‚ÄúCovaxin supply has always been low and there‚Äôs no change,‚Äù said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-shortage-forces-kmc-to-shut-covaxin-only-jab-centres/articleshow/84656881.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Private hospitals to scale down requisition as delayed vaccine delivery leads to cash crunch||KOLKATA: Several private hospitals have decided to scale down their requisition for Covid vaccines when they apply for doses next month to avoid blocking a huge amount of money that has to be paid online in advance, landing them in a cash crunch. For many private CVCs, consignments are still pending and efforts are on to arrive at the optimum number of doses that should be requisitioned for August, taking the pending doses into consideration. Belle Vue Clinic, for instance, paid Rs 2.5 crore for 36,000 doses in the last week of June. It had to wait more than two weeks for the consignment to arrive, severely pulling down its daily administration of doses. ‚ÄúIt also meant that the money remained blocked. So, this time we are not ordering more since a delayed delivery leads to a cash crunch. It happened to a number of hospitals, including us, earlier this month,‚Äù said CEO P Tondon. He added that the hospital plans to assess its stocks later this month and decide on a new order. AMRI Hospitals had ordered 50,000 doses and paid Rs 3.1 crore for the consignment in late-June. ‚ÄúWe received 30,000 doses last week and are expecting the rest. Depending on the demand at the end of this month, we will place our order for August If it remains constant, we may not order more than 15,000-20,000. We won‚Äôt be blocking our money unnecessarily,‚Äù said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Under the new procurement system that came into effect this month, private CVCs can apply for up to three times of the average number of vaccines administered by them each day during the ‚Äòbest week‚Äô of last month. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) received its requisitioned quota of 35,000 doses last week after a gap of seven working days. Its administration of doses had dipped during the interim period and it was down to its last 200 vials of Covishield on July 14 prior to the arrival of fresh stocks. ‚ÄúIt would be better if the gap is narrowed a bit but anything around that as an outer range should be manageable,‚Äù said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. The hospital is currently doing 1000 vaccinations per day at the hospital. Peerless Hospital, however, is taking stock of the consumption and may reduce its requisition from last month‚Äôs 35,000. The hospital paid Rs 2.2 crore for the supply. ‚ÄúWe would like to avoid running out of doses, which, we were very close to last week. We hadn‚Äôt anticipated the delay and this time we would like to have enough in stock. So, we may apply for a similar number of doses despite the financial strain unless we are left with a substantial number in stock,‚Äù said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hospitals-to-scale-down-requisition-as-delayed-vax-delivery-leads-to-cash-crunch/articleshow/84656923.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Oxygen boost to construction as Covid demand dips||KOLKATA: Infrastructure and construction activities that were stalled due to unavai-lability of industrial oxygen during the second wave have gathered steam with the demand for medical oxygen reducing on the face of receding Covid numbers. From construction at Metro sites to subways and Tallah bridge, a variety of other infra projects are slowly coming back on track with the home ministry permitting the use of liquid oxygen for certain industries from last month. Industrial use of liquid oxygen was banned in April after a spike in the number of Covid patients requiring liquid oxygen support. ‚ÄúWork has started progressing at a fast pace at the Noapara-Barasat via Biman Bandar project. Our GM and senior officials conducted a site inspection to assess the progress of work last week and were satisfied with the current pace at which the work is under way,‚Äù said a Metro spokesperson. TOI had earlier written how Covid curbs and shortage of industrial oxygen and manpower had slowed down Metro and other infra projects. Metro officials said in the last one month, work on other sections like Taratala-Joka is also back on track. According to a state PWD official, although the state government still gives maximum priority to medical oxygen, industrial use of liquid oxygen is slowly being brought back that has sped up progress of some stalled projects like Tallah bridge reconstruction, construction of Dhana Dhanye auditorium and construction of multiple subways on VIP Road and New Town. Hidco chairperson Debashis Sen too took to social media on Wednesday addressing the issue where he said: ‚ÄúThe pedestrian subway connecting Hidco Bhavan with the other side (Smart Plaza) is almost ready except for escalators. This was delayed because industrial oxygen required for steel cutting was not available due to medical demands on oxygen.‚Äù Bengal has a net production of 350 tonnes of liquid oxygen per day out of which 215-220 tonnes is used for industrial purposes and the rest is being used for medical purposes. But during the peak Covid second wave period, the demand for medical oxygen had gone up to 370 tonnes per day. ‚ÄúNow that the requirement of liquid oxygen in healthcare is almost back to normal, we wrote to the state government to lift the embargo on the usage of industrial oxygen. We are happy that industrial oxygen is again back in supply,‚Äù said Sushil Mohta, chairman of Merlin Projects Ltd and president of Credai West Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/o2-boost-to-construction-as-covid-demand-dips/articleshow/84656990.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

These works have been allotted to successful bidders at a cost of over Rs 9 crore after tender process. Executive engineer level officers are monitoring the works, which are from different divisions. Upgrade of sewage and stormwater drainage will be done in villages of Daria, Khuda Jassu, Kishangarh, Makhan Majra, Mauli and Raipur Kalan. Tender process of work in the remaining seven villages is in process. Before initiating the tender process, senior engineering officers visited sites in all the villages and met residents to assess their demands. Works were finalised based on the requirement in these villages and permission of senior officers taken to call the tender. Sources said heavy and time consuming work is required in some of the villages. Since the civic body authority has received dedicated money for development works in these villages, there is no issue of finances but managing finances for crucial works is a challenge for the authority. Therefore, development plans of villages are being prepared after going through the finances received in the form of fund for development of villages. As these villages have no municipal councillors now, nominated councillors have been given these villages to handle grievances of residents. Nominated councillors held regular meetings during which village residents apprised them of their villages, based on which the engineering department prepared the plan. The 13 villages, for which developmental plan has been prepared are Behlana, Daria, Dhanas, Khuda Lahora, Khuda Jassu, Khudda Ali Sher, Kaimbwala, Maulijagran, Makhan Majra, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Sarangpur and Kishangarh. Earlier, all these villages were under the control of the Panchayat department of the Chandigarh administration. The civic body authority has taken over records of these villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/seweage-and-stormwater-infra-to-be-upgraded/articleshow/84656957.cms||Deepak Yadav

It has also directed district collectors to scrutinise another 6.3 lakh works under the scheme and suggest whether they need an open inquiry or departmental probe. The government‚Äôs actions follow the submission of a report on the scheme by a 4-member committee led by retired additional chief secretary Bijay Kumar. The committee was set up after a CAG report passed strictures against the scheme in 2020, saying it was ineffective. The state government then decided to conduct an open inquiry against the works which reported irregularities. The committee was meant to suggest which of the works should face the inquiry. The Fadnavis government had spent Rs 9,634 crore in five years on the scheme, which was aimed at making the state drought-free. It was wound up by the MVA government in 2020. By then, around 6.33 lakh works had been completed. The Bijay Kumar committee was asked to scrutinise 1,128 JSA works listed in the CAG report and also 671 complaints on the scheme received by the department. Its role was to suggest which of these needed an open inquiry because the charges were more serious or a departmental probe. It was also asked to recommend probes if needed in the case of any of the other works executed by the scheme. The committee submitted its report in May and recommended that of the 1,128 works listed in the CAG report, 626 cases need an open inquiry and 298 need a departmental probe. It also suggested that of the 671 complaints on works received by government, 305 cases need an open inquiry and 18 a departmental probe. The state government accepted the report and decided that all the 924 cases that the committee wanted probed from the CAG cases require an open inquiry from the ACB. It also decided that another 249 cases which emanated from complaints received by the government need an ACB probe. The state also decided that district collectors should scrutinise the remaining 6.31 lakh works undertaken under the scheme according to parameters laid down by the Bijay Kumar committee. The collectors have been asked to suggest whether any of these needed an open inquiry or departmental probe. The parameters say an open probe should be recommended in cases where there are tender irregularities, state guidelines are not followed resulting in financial losses and misleading information or bills are given. Also, in cases where CSR funds or public donations are appropriated by officials and proper accounts are not maintained. Responding to the MVA‚Äôs decisions, former CM Devendra Fadnavis said, ‚ÄúWe welcome the probe. In fact, our government had initiated a probe into 650 JSA works. Clearances for the scheme were given at the level of collector and seven departments were implementing the scheme.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-acb-told-to-probe-1173-jalyukta-scheme-works-6-3-lakh-others-to-be-scrutinised-by-collectors/articleshow/84659726.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

On Thursday, health officials took feedbacks from vaccination centres across private and government hospitals and gynaecologists to strategise its plan of action. In early July, the Union health ministry had appro-ved vaccination of pregn-ant women. Senior clinical trial expert Santanu Tripathi said the decision to include pregnant women in the inoculation drive was taken consciously by the central government, having been convinced that the benefits of vaccination will potentially outweigh the risk of the disease in pregnancy. ‚ÄúSince we have enough general safety and tolerability data for both Covaxin and Covishield in India, it appears reasonable to expect that these vaccines would be optimally safe in pregnancy. In Bengal, vaccination against Covid-19 in pregnant women is slated to start in a couple of days. Pregnant women shall be appropriately counselled so that they take an informed decision on getting vaccinated." said Tripathi. Tripathi, along with other senior health department doctors, including Bibhuti Saha, were at the Thursday meeting attended by various hospitals. Questions like in which trimester should the jab be given, whether it should be Covishield or Covaxin cropped up during the meet. ‚ÄúPregnancy is an immune-compromised stage, leaving women very susceptible to the infection that can cause pre-term delivery. We will intensify our counselling in favour of taking the vaccine shot,‚Äù said Arati Biswas, gynaecology and obstetrics professor at Calcutta National Medical College. ‚ÄúMany patients consulting me are eager to take the jab. Their two major concerns are when to take the shot and which vaccine. I have counselled them to take any of the two vaccines, preferably after the first trimester,‚Äù said CMRI consultant gynaecologist Samir Ray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/special-jab-drive-for-pregnant-women-likely-to-begin-soon/articleshow/84657035.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

With prolonged use of steroids particularly during the second wave, bone health has taken a beating and these cases have started to pouring in. ‚ÄúThese cases were not there during the first wave but started showing up of late. The overuse of steroids during the treatment of Covid-19 is the suspect behind this unnatural bone damage. Steroids make bones soft and then cartilage reduced blood supply. While avascular necrosis might have many reasons, the cases being reported now are induced by steroids or Covid. Covid is known to cause thrombotic conditions, that is letting thrombus/clots in vessels supplying blood to the femur bone which could lead to necrosis,‚Äù said Dr M Kaushik Reddy, consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Apollo Hospitals. In majority of the cases the hip joint is affected and many of them require a complete replacement. So experts suggest not to delay consulting a doctor in case of experiencing pain in the hip joint and difficulty in sitting cross legged. Atleast 50 cases in the last two months have been reported in tertiary hospitals in the city. ‚ÄúThese cases have started being reported off late. Prolonged use of steroids ‚Äî sometimes for two to three months is the reason behind this increase, even when the dose is not high, it has an impact,‚Äù said Dr J Sathyanarayana, professor and HOD of orthopaedics, Gandhi Hospital. Total hip replacement surgery is required at an advanced stage as the problem is of serious nature. ‚ÄúOf late we are seeing an increasing incidence of spontaneous infections of bone and joints including septic arthritis of hip, knee and pyogenic discitis in post Covid patients who were treated with steroids and Tociluzimab,‚Äù said Dr Krishna Kiran, chief orthopaedic surgeon, Medicover hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cases-of-bone-sepsis-necrosis-on-rise-among-covid-recovered/articleshow/84661994.cms||Amrita Didyala

The MRF facility is equipped with hopper-tippers and compactor capsules for transfer of waste from smaller (3.2 cum) vehicles to 20 cum capsules where the waste will be compacted to one fifth of its original volume. The volume reduction will save cost of its transportation and space required for disposal. Addressing the gathering after inauguration of the station, the governor appreciated the efforts of Chandigarh Smart City Ltd and the Municipal Corporation in strengthening solid waste management in city. He said that with the availability of these MRF stations, the MC could reduce the rush of garbage collection at a single point, that is in Dadumajra and with MRF facility, segregation system of dry and wet waste would be strengthened. According to the governor, the MC had planned to set up a waste to energy plant in Dadumajra to process garbage. He said these stations aimed at reducing the time and cost involved in collection and transfer of waste, besides generating income by recovering reusable and recyclable waste. K K Yadav, municipal commissioner-cum-CEO, Chandigarh Smart City Ltd said that waste from sectors 1, 2, 3,4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, 25, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 and part of 61 would be brought to the MRF-cum-garbage transfer station at Industrial Area, Phase I, Chandigarh. He said that the MRF stations would be equipped with parking facilities and vehicle washing facilities. ‚ÄúThese will be monitored through 20 CCTV cameras. Each transfer station will have material recovery facility cum transfer stations with two conveyer belts for each station, industrial shed, three weigh bridges, one wash system, CCTV, mechanical equipment for volume reduction of waste to one fifth of its original volume and nine truck loaded capsules to carry compacted waste to the processing plant/composting plant site. The project is being implemented through two contract packages, one for civil and one for mechanical works,‚Äù Yadav said. Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said door to door waste collection vehicles would bring segregated waste, that is, dry and wet waste in different compartments at the material recovery facility, which has a dedicated space for sorting of recoverable dry waste into different categories like paper, card, recyclable plastics, glass bottles and metal etc. Dry waste left after recovery of recyclable materials would be compacted in huge compactors to the compost plant in Sector 25, Daddumajra, Chandigarh. Weigh bridges have been provided for measurement of dry and wet waste within the material recovery facility. Earlier, the governor and other dignitaries planted saplings of ornamental trees in the compound area of MRF station.

She was referred to JJ Hospital, Byculla, that is known for handling high-risk pregnancies.

While an immediate decision to the question about the party leadership was not forthcoming, some of the Congressmen who met Gandhi at his official residence said that a decision is likely to be made in the coming week. Till then uncertainty continues over the state presidentship issue. Initially indications were that Gandhi wants to retain Chodankar as the state president, but by evening there was no clarity on what is in the mind of the high command. Party insiders said that most of the Congressmen expressed their concern over Chodankar‚Äôs ability to lead the party for the coming polls and called for changes in the state party leadership. Gandhi reportedly remained non-committal and directed them to quell the factional divisions and work to revive the party. ‚ÄúA decision has to be taken about the party president. There needs to be clarity only then can we shift into high gear for the elections,‚Äù one of the Congressmen who participated in the meeting said. Gandhi had summoned state party president Girish Chodankar, opposition leader Digambar Kamat, Navelim MLA Luizinho Falerio, South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha, former Union minister Ramakant Khalap, Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco. Gandhi had one-on-one meetings with them and later met with AICC general secretary K.C.

Gandhi met senior leaders of Goa and told them to work unitedly and to promote young and new faces to win the assembly elections, Rao said in a statement. During the meeting, Gandhi sought inputs about the political situation in Goa and discussed various strategies for the coming assembly elections. ‚ÄúI expressed my views about certain steps to be taken to improve the party ahead of the elections. An alliance was also discussed and we have expressed what we feel. We discussed prospects of the party and steps to be taken to ensure that we form the government,‚Äù Khalap said. Gandhi asked the Congressmen to work on various strategies to mobilise the party cadre, improve membership and regain people‚Äôs trust, Chodankar told TOI.

On the first day of the second session of the 15th assembly on Thursday, the opposition sought a leave for adjournment motion citing the matter. Vijayan said that the minister intervened in this matter as he believed that it was his party‚Äôs internal affair. ‚ÄúThe minister has not done anything wrong. There was no attempt on his part to weaken the case,‚Äù he said. However, the chief minister said that the police should not have delayed the registration of FIR and the state police chief was asked to probe why there was a delay even as the petition was received from the survivor on June 28. Kundara MLA P C Vishnunath said that the state has reached a point where even the governor joined the protest on ‚Äòatrocities against women‚Äô. He said that the survivor‚Äôs statement was not recorded by the police even after registering an FIR. However, the CM said that the governor‚Äôs protest need not be misinterpreted and the protest in a Gandhian way was for creating awareness on the matter. Vijayan said the survivor will be given all legal protection and there need not be any concern regarding the probe. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that there was no justification for the action of the minister who had clearly misused his office to intervene in the case. He asked if the CM has given instructions to all ministers to settle such criminal cases and cases on atrocities against women by trying to reach a compromise between both parties. The opposition leader said that the government talks about schemes like Sthree Paksham for the dignity of women, but it stands with the attackers and not the survivors. Satheesan said that Saseendran is not eligible to continue in office and should either resign on his own or the chief minister should demand his resignation. The opposition staged a walkout after speaker M B Rajesh denied permission for the adjournment motion on the basis of the explanation given by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-supports-saseendran-pulls-up-the-police-instead/articleshow/84657160.cms||---

The decision was taken at a core committee meeting chaired by chief minister Vijay Rupani on Thursday, according to a press statement. Given the declining number of Covid-19 cases in the state, a decision was taken in this regard, it said. Attendance is not compulsory and students will have to produce a consent letter from their parents for attending on-campus classroom studies, it added. The government of Gujarat‚Äôs decision to begin inperson classes in schools for Class 12 students is seen by many as a sign of a gradual return to normalcy. Others present at the core committee meeting included education minister Bhupindersinh Chudasama, energy minister Saurabh Patel, state home minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja, chief secretary Anil Mukim, additional chief secretary for home department Pankaj Kumar and few other senior government officials. The government aims to reopen schools and colleges in a staggered manner with all social distancing measures and Covid-19 precautions in place. On day one of reopening for class 12 students on July 9, schools across the state witnessed about 39% attendance. Out of a total of 59,591 students of schools that sent attendance details to the education department, 23,283 students attended on the first day. The Class 12 and Class 10 board exam for repeaters had kept classrooms across the state occupied. ‚ÄúThe board exams for repeaters will be over by the time the schools reopen for Class 9 to Class 11 students, hence we expect the attendance numbers to go higher next week,‚Äù said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/classes-9-11-to-reopen-with-50-attendance-on-monday/articleshow/84659847.cms||---
---||Goa||Swelling Vashisthi river stops trains, 6,000 stranded on KR route||MARGAO: Close to 6,000 passengers travelling on long-distance trains were stranded at various stations on the Konkan Railway route on Thursday following Indian Railways‚Äô suspension of train services in Maharashtra‚Äôs Ratnagiri district after the Vashisthi river overflowed due to incessant rain in the region since Wednesday. At least 12 trains were regulated due to disruption of services on the route, while several others were cancelled, diverted or rescheduled, officials of the Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd (KRCL) said. Regulating trains means halting them at any of the railway stations enroute the journey until rail traffic is normalised. KRCL‚Äôs deputy general manager (PR), Baban Ghatge, said the water level at the Vashishti river bridge between Chiplun and Kamthe stations had risen above the danger level, and that the level crossing near the bridge was also waterlogged. Train services were suspended temporarily in view of passenger safety, he said. ‚ÄúOnce the water recedes, trains that have been regulated at various stations will resume their onward journeys,‚Äù he said. Konkan Railway officials said all the affected trains have been halted at safe locations and that the stranded passengers were being taken care of. ‚ÄúWe have made all arrangements for providing them with meals, tea, water and refreshments at the railway stations,‚Äù a senior Konkan Railway official said. Railway officials have, by rough estimates, tagged the number of marooned passengers at nearly 6,000. ‚ÄúThe number would have been much more had it been in normal times. The trains that are currently plying are only at 60% capacity,‚Äù an official said. 01152 Madgaon-Mumbai CSMT Janshatabdi of Thursday and 02120 Karmali-Mumbai CSMT Tejas Special of Friday have been cancelled, a press release by the Railways said. Goa-bound trains that were affected included Mumbai CSMT-Karmali Tejas Special that was terminated at Roha station and the rake was brought back to Mumbai CSMT. Mumbai CSMT-Madgaon Janshatabdi was regulated at Khed railway station, and the Mumbai CSMT -Madgaon Daily Special at Mangaon station. Among the affected trains that departed from Goa were the Madgaon-Mumbai CSMT Mandovi that was regulated at Kankavali. Train services were also affected owing to a landslide between the Kasara-Kalyan section of Central Railway on Thursday morning. Sources said heavy rain caused flooding, washing out of tracks, boulder crashes and mudslides in the Kasara ghat region. Rail tracks were submerged at the Umbermali station near Kasara, and there were boulder crashes in the ghat section. Railway officials said that services of some trains were suspended, some others were diverted along alternative routes. The 02618 H Nizamuddin-Ernakulam Daily Special was diverted via Manmad Jn, Daund Chord line, Pune Jn, Miraj Jn, Londa Jn and Madgaon Jn. Restoration work was under way on a war footing to clear tracks of the boulders, they said. Coastal Konkan, parts of Mumbai metropolitan region, Vidarbha and several districts in western Maharashtra witnessed floods on Thursday following heavy rain since Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/thousands-stranded-as-swelling-vashisthi-river-stops-trains-on-konkan-railway-route/articleshow/84660149.cms||---

GHAA has given a deadline till July 28 to the HC to open courtrooms ‚Äúas a last resort to avoid any friction, confrontation and feeling of ill will and distrust‚Äù. If the chief justice agrees to the request and physical hearing is resumed by then, the association will put off its protest. In a meeting held on Wednesday, GHAA unanimously resolved ‚Äúto boycott all official functions‚Äù like full court reference, judges‚Äô oath taking ceremonies and Lok Adalats. It has also resolved not to accord any welcome or farewell of any judge either on appointment, elevation or retirement. The GHAA resolution said that the association ‚Äúnotes with disgust‚Äù that despite frantic requests and appeals by lawyers who are faced with immense difficulty and hardship and despite a decline in Covid-19 cases, the HC has not resumed physical functioning particularly when the government has permitted opening of all activities including malls and gymnasiums. The association has also decided to hold parallel function on the occasions of January 26, August 15 and October 2. It said that it had to pass this resolution ‚Äúwith great pain‚Äù.

---||Ahmedabad||Man gets life for murder of cop at Ahmedabad crime branch office||AHMEDABAD: A sessions court on Thursday held a resident of Rajasthan, Manish Balai, guilty of the murder of constable Chandrakant Makwana in the office of city crime branch at Gaekwad Haveli in 2016, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Additional sessions judge, D V Shah, held Balai, 40, guilty mainly by the evidence of last seen together under provisions of Section 106 of the Evidence Act. As no CCTV footage of the crime branch office was available for the night of April 21, 2016, when Balai was being interrogated by Makwana in connection with a robbery and drug peddling case. On perusal of circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution, the court concluded that not much time had elapsed between the murder and Balai‚Äôs escape. Makwana and Balai were alone in the office of the Anti-Organised Crime Squad at the time of the offence. The constable was found dead with his head bludgeoned by an iron rod. Moreover, Balai wearing Makwana‚Äôs shoes also played a part in nailing the accused. Balai was also punished with three months in jail for stealing Makwana‚Äôs shoes. The court acquitted Balai of charges of killing for the purpose of stealing the constable‚Äôs wallet. The court discarded Balai‚Äôs defence, that a news report on a local television channel revealed that the constable was fearing for his death because of a sizeable haul of narcotics a few days ago involving Kishorsinh Rathod. Balai‚Äôs advocate had even examined three journalists to put up a defence. On the other hand, the prosecution relied on 65 witnesses and 132 pieces of documentary evidence. Balai was nabbed two days after the incident at Karjan railway station, after the city police launched a massive search operation. The court ordered the state government to pay compensation to Makwana‚Äôs family and said that if the family felt that the amount was not enough, they can approach the legal aid authority to avail of the benefit of the victim compensation scheme. Balai, who was targeted by people present in the court campus at Bhadra last week, was not brought to the court and was produced from Sabarmati jail through video conference. The court was critical of the incident and the prosecutor expressed regrets about it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-gets-life-for-murder-of-cop-at-crime-branch-office/articleshow/84659853.cms||---

Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said the decision was taken on Thursday as many developers abandoned their projects after obtaining bank loans based on the letter of intent (LOI) issued by the SRA. ‚ÄúHow can banks or a non-banking financial company (NBFC) pass a loan on the basis of an LOI without any guarantee when the land is not freehold? We shall be issuing a government resolution in this regard,‚Äù said Awhad. Many in the real estate industry slammed the decision.

CHB has already uploaded details like current ownership, details of license fee and ground rent paid, penalty for late payments and balance due of about 17,000 allottees of small flats and about 1,700 allottees of affordable rental scheme and about 4,500 allottees of commercial units on real time basis. The board now plans a tie up with NIC, Chandigarh and will upload details of all kinds of residential properties, including leasehold and freehold, on its website. Sources said the board will start with Sector 63 and later the same model will be replicated in other sectors. A senior CHB official said the idea behind the exercise is to minimise human interface and maximise the use of technology. Besides saving allottees‚Äô time, the move will enable diversion of staff engaged in the work into some other work, he added. Recently, CHB had introduced the facility of online payment for all kinds of dues. To encourage digital payment, the bureau decided to hold a computerised draw every month to give a reward of Rs 1,000 each to 010 online payment transactions, irrespective of the amount paid. Intially, the scheme was started for a few months but recently, to encourage online payments, CHB decided to continue with reward of Rs 1,000 each to 10 online payment transactions during 2021. A computerised draw to decide 10 winners was being held every month. The board had introduced the facility of online payment of all kinds of dues and now, the allottees are not required to visit the office. They can pay their dues online by visiting the website of the housing board:www.chbonline.in. Online payments can be made through net banking, debit cards and credit cards, without extra charge. As per available data, in April and May, there were 1,877 online transactions, including over 880 transactions in April and over 950 in May. The board collected Rs 65.60 lakh through online transactions in April and Rs 1.52 crore in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/details-of-all-chb-properties-to-be-available-online/articleshow/84657167.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Sources claim that bidders who had participated were offering as low as Rs 300 to Rs 500 more than the quoted base price. ‚ÄúWe have held back the e-auction till the real estate market warms up. The time and date will be decided when demand scales. Apart from low bidding amounts, not many players were there to ensure competition, so we called the e-auction off ,‚Äù said a senior AMC official. The civic body had put up 15 plots on sale of which only two had been sold till now. Earlier, the AMC had extended the auction registration time limit of other plots to July 1. Among the 15 plots which were put on auction there were three plots in Thaltej, four in Bodakdev, two in Nikol, three in Vastral and three plots in Naroda-Hanspura-Kathwada areas. Earlier in May, a plot in Bodakdev had fetched AMC Rs 77.04 crore. As many as 17 bidders had participated in the auction which measured 3,469 square metres. The minimum price of the plot was fixed at Rs 1.88 lakh per square metre totalling Rs 65.21 crore. AMC got Rs 77.04 crore which was 11.82 crore more than the fixed price.

---||Delhi||Delhi man uses mental health app for blackmail||NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old man has been arrested by the Shahdara district police for allegedly blackmailing women, mostly foreigners, after befriending them on an app made for people to share their mental health issues. DCP Sathiyasundaram said the suspect, Jatin Bhardwaj (21), was a resident of Dilshad Garden in east Delhi. Investigation in the case was started on a complaint by an Indonesian woman. She stated that she was using an app, Talk Life, meant for people suffering from depression and anxiety in South Asia when she came in touch with the accused. The accused allegedly came to know that the victim, who was suffering from depression, was from a poor financial background. He shifted to chatting with her on WhatsApp and allegedly offered to pay her money in exchange for her nude photos. He promised to pay her 200-300 US dollars every month for the photos. Bhardwaj adopted the same modus operandi with around 15 women belonging to South Asian countries. He offered money and succeeded in getting pictures from three women. The complainant told police that she sent him her picture and video as she was desperately in need of money to support her family. However, she was not provided any financial aid, as promised. The accused then started demanding more photos and videos and threatened to upload them on social media sites, like Instagram, if she didn‚Äôt comply. Subsequently, an FIR was registered on her complaint at GTB police station. ‚ÄúThe investigators collected information related to the crime and analysed the details of the accused‚Äôs mobile number, which was found switched off. Call details and ownership of the mobile number helped the team apprehend the accused,‚Äù said the DCP. It came to the fore that in the process of using the app and other internet-enabled services, Bhardwaj had isolated himself from the outside world. ‚ÄúHe had made his mobile phone his entire world. He rarely came out of his room, probably once in a month or two, his family members said. His father said his son had not talked to him since the last six years and his mother provided him food in his room,‚Äù said Sathiyasundaram. During interrogation, the accused told police that he took a bath only once a year, which was on his birthday.‚ÄúThe investigation is still on and other involvements are being verified. A mobile phone that could contain nude videos and photos of the complainant and other women has been seized,‚Äù the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-uses-mental-health-app-for-blackmail/articleshow/84657306.cms||---

Police said that Rekha Solanki, who lived on the footpath near Bhadrakali temple in Karanj, was in a relationship with Sabir Pathan,19, and Raju Damor, 23, who also lived there. Rekha, earned money picking rags, and told the two men last week that she wanted to get rid of her husband, Jignesh Solanki, who spent all her money.

The four ‚Äî Rekha, Pathan, Thakkar and Damor ‚Äî met on the eastern side of the riverfront near Ellis Bridge, drank liquor together and had dinner on July 17. They then approached Jignesh and took him to Ellis Bridge where Rekha, her two boyfriends and their aide thrashed Jignesh and then strangled him with a rope.

---||Chandigarh||Union minister Meenakshi Lekhi should resign for calling farmers hooligans, says Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday demanded the immediate resignation of Union minister Meenakshi Lekhi for dubbing the farmers protesting the Centre‚Äôs three farm laws as hooligans. At the same time, he also condemned the alleged attack on a journalist at the farmers‚Äô protest site at Delhi‚Äôs Jantar Mantar. Accusing the BJP leader for using derogatory language for the farmers, who have been peacefully agitating for the past nearly eight months, Amarinder said it reflected the party‚Äôs anti-farmer mindset. ‚ÄúGiven the ruling party‚Äôs brazen attempts to stifle all voices of dissent and protest, the fact that it failed to break the spirit of the farmers was clearly rankling,‚Äù he said. While the assault on the journalist covering the Kisan Sansad deplorable and action should be taken against the guilty person, the Union minister‚Äôs reaction was totally uncalled for and provocative, the CM said. Lekhi, he said, had no right to defame the farmers in such a manner. The Delhi Police should file a case and investigate to identify the accused, and the law should take its own course, he said. Pointing to the ‚Äúdisparaging comments‚Äù made by various BJP leaders against the farmers since their agitation started at the Delhi borders, he said the ruling party had been trying to malign the farmers and undermine their peaceful protests from the outset. He recalled that the saffron party leaders had earlier even tried to defame the farmers with slanderous descriptions like ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô and ‚Äòurban Naxalites‚Äô. Having failed to deter the farmers, who had been braving the elements in this fight for their rights and some even losing their lives, the BJP leadership was once again resorting to such shameful tactics out of sheer frustration, he added. Amarinder said the simmering anger among the farmers, who are losing their lives and livelihoods due to the Centre‚Äôs ‚Äúdraconian actions‚Äù, was a matter of serious concern and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should immediately take steps to resolve the crisis, which could have serious repercussions for the country. Intelligence reports suggest that pro-Khalistani elements from across the border are looking to exploit the farmers‚Äô resentment against India, he pointed out, warning of a grave security failure if these reports are not heeded by the Centre. Instead of indulging in such shameful acts in their desperate bid to make the farmers toe their line, the Union government should try to settle the issue at the earliest, he stressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/minister-should-resign-for-calling-farmers-hooligans-capt/articleshow/84659882.cms||---

According to the daily BMC vaccination update, private centres, that charge a fee for the jab, inoculated 35,429 Mumbaikars on Wednesday and Thursday. While the gap was necessitated due to a shortage of vaccine doses, sources said that the fresh stock of 62,000 doses that the BMC received on Wednesday would not be adequate. ‚ÄúThe BMC can vaccinate up to one lakh people in a day. Even if we vaccinate 30,000 people a day, the stock will barely last for two days,‚Äù said a senior civic official. As the turnout on weekends is 75,000 to one lakh, BMC officials are not sure if they can vaccinate record numbers this time. Meanwhile, state government officials said the Centre had indicated that it would supply 1.1 crore vaccines to Maharashtra in July, and the state has already vaccinated more than 1.2 crore people this month so far. According to the state vaccine update for Wednesday, 1,06,190 people were inoculated. Maharashtra usually vaccinates between three and four lakh people when it has adequate stocks. Maharashtra has, so far, given out more than 4 crore vaccines and leads in India in the mass vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-62k-doses-bmc-to-restart-vax-drive-today/articleshow/84659917.cms||---

Now, residents will have to pay the priest Rs 500 for ‚ÄúVahan puja‚Äù ceremony of a new two-wheeler and Rs 1,100 for four-wheeler. The belief is that it is auspicious to get the ceremony performed after purchase of a new vehicle. After the puja, the priest makes a ‚ÄòShubh Labh‚Äô sign on the engine and steering/handle of the vehicle. The ceremony ends with breaking of a coconut in front of the vehicle. The owner of the vehicle then pays the priest. Members of the Shree Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board (SMMDSB) say fixing of charges will help increase temple revenue.

The administration has allowed congregation of only 50 members at the Brahmin conclave, which will be held on the outskirts of Faizabad City after the organisers didn‚Äôt get permission of a venue within Ayodhya town. The conclave has been christened ‚Äî Seminar, Security and Progress of Enlightened Society. Mayawati‚Äôs party will be organising mega Brahmin conclaves across the state and use it as a launchpad to woo Brahmins in a repeat of its successful 2007 social engineering formula ‚Äî the Brahmin-Dalit combo ‚Äî to return to power. On Friday, BSP‚Äôs Brahmin face Satish Chandra Mishra will offer prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi before addressing the conclave and participate in the evening ‚Äòaarti‚Äô on Saryu banks to adopt a soft Hindutva approach.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No water cuts as lake stocks up 17% in just 24 hours||Mumbai: Putting all fears of water cuts at bay, the seven lakes that supply potable water to the city saw their total stocks rise 17% in a 24-hour period. This means, almost 64 days of water for the city was collected in just one day of heavy downpour. As on Thursday, at 7.8 lakh million litre, the lakes had enough drinking water stocks to last more than 180 days. Meanwhile, two more lakes overflowed on Thursday too.The ongoing robust wet spell has ensured total water stocks, which stood at 17% on July 16, have increased to touch 53.9% now. In the 24 hours between July 21 and 22, almost all major lakes recorded triple-digit rainfall figures, with Bhatsa, which is the biggest, receiving 336mm.Two more lakes‚ÄîTansa and Modak Sagar‚Äîoverflowed, taking the total number of supplying lakes where water levels have exceeded the maximum capacity to four. Civic officials said Modak Sagar began to overflow at 3.24am on Thursday and Tansa lake just over two hours later, at 5.48am. By comparison, last year, Modak Sagar lake had started overflowing on August 18 and Tansa on August 20. Tulsi and Vihar had already begun to overflow on July 16 and July 18 this year, respectively. Powai lake that supplies water to the civic body for non-potable purposes began to overflow on June 12 this year compared with July 5 in 2020.The Upper Vaitarna lake, which had 0% useful water content till Tuesday, saw it rise to 4% as it received 225mm rainfall in the 24 hours till 6am on Thursday. Out of the total water capacity of Bhatsa, which is 7.2 lakh million litre, 5.75 lakh million litre is allotted to the BMC for use in the city. Currently, Bhatsa has 3.7 lakh million litre stock or 51.4% of its total capacity.Ajay Rathore, chief engineer of the BMC‚Äôs hydraulics department, said due to heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the lakes, the civic body is not considering any water cuts. The city had experienced a 20% water cut in August last year amidst the Covid-19 outbreak due to low level of water storage in the lakes.The total water quantum in all the seven supplying lakes has now crossed 50%. As on Friday, it stood at 7.8 lakh million litre (53.9%), up from 5.3 lakh million litre a day earlier (36.7%)‚Äîan increase of 2.5 lakh million litre. The BMC supplies 3,850 million litre of potable water a day to the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-water-cuts-as-lake-stocks-up-17-in-just-24-hours/articleshow/84659947.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||‚ÄòIO impaired justice by seeking bribe‚Äô, denied bail||New Delhi: He has played with the course of justice by allegedly agreeing to file a diluted investigation report against an accused, a court has said while dismissing the bail plea of a police officer arrested for allegedly seeking a bribe of Rs 20,000.Special CBI judge Nirja Bhatia said the allegations against Mool Chand had grave consequences as he had not only sought to make personal gain at the cost of investigation but also participated to benefit the accused ‚Äúat the stage of trial, thereby, clearly showing intention to impair the trial in favour of the accused‚Äù. The police officer ‚Äúhas played with the course of justice by reflecting to agree to file a much diluted investigation report on which the opinion of the presiding officer is to be finally premised‚Äù, the court said.Chand was a head constable and the investigating officer (IO) in a case related to an alleged attack on two persons by a group of men in Badarpur. He had allegedly demanded the bribe and received Rs 11,000 as part payment. A trap was laid by CBI and he was allegedly caught red-handed on June 24 while demanding another Rs 8,000.The court said that being the IO, it was his duty to investigate the matter impartially in the interest of justice. ‚ÄúIt also shows that the dominant position of the IO is sought to be compromised against certain gains, which cannot be called legitimate. It is, hence, a very serious and grave matter and cannot be brushed aside lightly towards the quantum of the trap money.‚Äù It further said the mere fact that Chand had deep rooted background in the society and the investigation was likely to bear no further results since his police custody was not sought to be extended didn‚Äôt hold much ground. ‚ÄúThis is more so that the lenient approach in such a circumstance is not a desirable signal of giving up on issues of such a grave nature and far reaching consequences even where the court‚Äôs judgments are played with through the biased, partial and ill-investigated trial,‚Äù the judge said.Chand had also sought bail on the ground that his son was suffering from mental illness and required the father‚Äôs care as he was inconsolable after the arrest. However, during the inquiry, no document of diagnosis or prescription could be produced before the court to suggest any link between his condition and the need for the father‚Äôs care. The court noted that Chand‚Äôs conduct of frivolity to gain its sympathy on the serious issue of his son‚Äôs mental illness did not entitle him to any leniency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/io-impaired-justice-by-seeking-bribe-denied-bail/articleshow/84657332.cms||Usha Das

The number of active cases in Nashik rural has reduced from around 800 per day to 700 within a week. He said the situation in the rural areas was easing slowly due to the fewer cases being recorded and the number of patients recovering being higher than the daily cases. ‚ÄúThere is a drop in the number of active cases in Nashik rural, which is a good sign. The cases in the hotspots of the district have also reduced. It would be incorrect to say that the situation is normal, but the situation is being monitored ahead of the possible third wave of Covid,‚Äù said Pawar. The Covid situation in the rural areas, which had recently turned worrisome due to the rise in cases in talukas ‚Äî like Sinnar, Niphad, ‚Äî have now stabilised. Talukas like Nashik, Nandgaon and Niphad, which had about 150 to 250 active cases till a fortnight ago now have less than 70 active cases. The active cases in Sinnar have also fallen to around 100 from 300 cases. Pawar said though the daily positivity rate in the rural areas has jumped to 2% in the past three days, there was nothing to worry about it as the numbers are receding. ‚ÄúThe numbers of asymptomatic patients are also reducing. This shows that the testing of the citizens has also reduced marginally. The strict protocol about the testing, tracking and treating the people in high-risk contacts are being followed as per the directions of district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, which is yielding positive results,‚Äù said another officer from the district health office of Nashik Zilla Parishad. The officers, however, warned against people becoming careless and not following Covid-appropriate behaviour due to the drop in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-case-count-in-rural-nashik-reduces-steadily/articleshow/84654774.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Lucknow||50 students from six colleges score 100% in BCom: Lucknow University||LUCKNOW: Scoring cent percent marks in BCom is a rarity but at least 50 students from six colleges affiliated to the Lucknow University have scored 100% marks in their first semester, highly-placed sources in the university told TOI on Thursday. This became possible as examinations were not held this year due to the pandemic and students were awarded marks based on their internal assessment as recommended in the promotion policy of the state government. Since these students had scored 100% marks in internal examinations, the aggregate for final results also came out to be 100%. Commerce as a subject is taught in a number of colleges affiliated to LU. Of these, there are six institutions in which 48 out of about 700 students taken together have scored 100% marks in all the six papers taught in Semester I, said a senior professor associated with LU‚Äôs examination department. The examination department prepares the final result on the basis of the inputs provided by all the colleges before putting it in public domain for students. ‚ÄúIt is unusual for a student to score full marks in commerce papers in which the highest merit so far used to be around 80%. However, there has been no manipulation. We calculated the marks based on the results of internals,‚Äù said a teacher of a prominent government-aided girls‚Äô college. Significantly, students enrolled in LU have scored less than those in affiliated colleges. Earlier, it used to be vice versa. Some LU students even questioned how 100% marks can be given in internals. ‚ÄúAll students of my class have scored in the range of 75-90%, but in affiliated colleges, especially girls‚Äô college, some were awarded full marks. We also worked hard for our assignments but since we didn‚Äôt get cent percent in internals, our final scores are less,‚Äù said LU student Anshika Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/50-students-from-six-colleges-score-100-in-bcom/articleshow/84662066.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Farmers booked for sedition get bail||SIRSA: Five farmers arrested on sedition charges in Sirsa were released from Hisar jail on Thursday, after a bail petition filed on their behalf in the court earlier in the day was accepted by district and sessions judge Rajesh Malhota. All five, who denied filing bail petitions, reached here and broke the fast of senior farm leader Baldev Singh Sirsa, who had gone on an indefinite fast as a protest against the arrests, by offering him coconut water. Haryana Kisan Manch state president Prahlad Singh Bharukhera, one of five booked for sedition, said, ‚ÄúTruth has won today, so have farmers.‚Äù He said the July 23 Sirsa Bandh and the July 24 gherao of deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa‚Äôs house stand deferred now but the ongoing agitation against the three farm laws will continue and BJP leaders will be opposed as before. SP Arptit Jain said the five were released on bail but there was no agreement with farmers yet. The sedition section has not been removed in the case registered against them, he said. Ashwini Kumar Phogat, who pleaded in court on behalf of the farmers, said he had gone to Sirsa to argue the bail plea of farmers. However, when asked whether farmers had appointed him as their advocate, he said that he cannot talk about it right now. Balkar Singh, Nikka Singh, Balkaur Singh, all residents of Faggu village, Sahab Singh of Khairpur village and Daljit Singh of Ranga village in Sirsa district were arrested on July 15 after police registered cases against 100 farmers for storming into the July 11 meeting of BJP district executive body. The Civil Line police had registered FIR 204 on July 11 on the complaint of duty magistrate, district welfare officer Sushil Kumar and applied sections 124-A (sedition), 148 (armed riot), 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (injuring public servants) and 353 (criminal force to deter public servants) of the Indian Penal Code against them. BA student fails to take exam Among the farmers released from jail was Sahab Singh, who is a student of BA second year. He said he had to take offline papers and had sought the permission of court, which was refused. He said he will file a petition in the court again to take the exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-booked-for-sedition-get-bail/articleshow/84659929.cms||---

---||Nashik||Maharashtra health department asks all districts to prepare for third wave||NASHIK: The state government has written to all the district administrations directing them to prepare their plan to deal with Covid cases during the third wave of the pandemic. In his letter (dated July 20) to all the district collectors, chief executive officers of all the Zilla Parishads, municipal corporations and civil surgeons, Dr Pradeep Vyas, the additional chief secretary of the public health department, has stressed on the need to prepare for the third wave at the earliest. According to him, the state may report about 60 lakh Covid cases during the third wave and hence all plans need to be in place to deal with Covid patients, who need hospitalisation. ‚ÄúThe central government guidelines ask the state government to be prepared at the rate of 1.5 times the peak of the second wave. So all the authorities concerned need to prepare for the situation during the third wave. Accordingly, the state has directed us to prepare for the same and issued a set of guidelines,‚Äù said Dr Ashok Thorat, the civil surgeon of Nashik district. The state government has said collectively, including all the local self-governing bodies and the district collectors, have to prepare for a peak of 12.95 lakh cases in the third wave. The peak in the second wave was 8.03 lakh cases in the state. In his letter, Vyas has also provided a long list of requirements of beds, medicine, oxygen, ventilators, oxygen cylinders. According to the officer, Nashik district had 52,954 active cases on April 29, which was the peak time in the second wave. Hence, the likely number of cases during the peak of the third wave can be 79,431 cases. Considering 65% of patients will be home isolated, 27,801 patients may need to be hospitalised while 51,630 can be home isolated. The state has, therefore, asked the district authorities to prepare for 556 ICU beds in public hospitals, and 4,448 beds with oxygen supplies. The district is likely to require 114 metric tonne of oxygen during the peak period. ‚ÄúThere is also a huge list of medicines that has to be arranged. While the Government of India has already decided to supply the same, we will get the quota accordingly. In a couple of days, the list and the stock of medicines required will be finalised,‚Äù Thorat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-health-dept-asks-all-dists-to-prepare-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/84654785.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand health department directs six border districts to ramp up Covid-19 testing||RANCHI: The state department of health, medical education and family welfare has directed the administrations of six districts to ramp up their Covid-19 screening exercises. Earlier this week, the district administrations of Jamtara, Koderma, Garhwa, Lohardaga, Chatra and Deoghar were directed by additional chief secretary health Arun Kumar Singh to screen more people for the viral infection. In between July 12 and July 18, Ramgarh tested 3,525 people while Jamtara screened 3,969. Koderma tested 4,075 people while Lohardaga tested 3,019 people. Chatra screened 6,123 people while Garhwa screened 5,431 people and Deoghar tested 5,064 persons. ‚ÄúEven though our testing figures are impressive, a few districts have low numbers. Many of them share their borders with neighbouring states and there is a footfall of people who arrive through trains and buses,‚Äù Bhuvanesh Pratap Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 management in Jharkhand, said. ‚ÄúHowever, the district administrations have been given new guidelines to ramp up their testing. We are hopeful of seeing a rise from next week onwards,‚Äù he added. As many as 3.23 lakh people were screened across Jharkhand in between July 12 and July 18, the health department said in its report. However, the numbers have dipped from the last week of June, when nearly 4.4 lakh people were screened. ‚ÄúTesting depends on various factors. One of them is contact tracing. Since Covid-19 cases have dipped statewide, the contact-tracing programmes have also slowed down. During the second wave, many people voluntarily opted for testing after developing Covid-19 like symptoms. With cases waning, these numbers have reduced as well. However, we are testing around 50,000 people on average each day,‚Äù said a senior doctor in the state health services, who is associated with the screening programme. Earlier this month, over 4 lakh RAT kits were distributed and five mobile RT-PCR testing vans were launched to ramp up testing. The fatalities have also dropped significantly from the end of June. While 12 deaths were reported in the last week of June, one death was reported in between July 12 and July 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/health-dept-directs-6-border-districts-to-ramp-up-testing/articleshow/84670957.cms||Dhritiman Ray

A division bench of the high court observed that doctors seem to be treating patients like vegetables and should be more compassionate. A division bench of chief justice Dr. Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujit Narayan Prasad while hearing the petition online also observed that doctors have done a great job in dealing with patients suffering with Covid-19. But at the same time, there have been numerous instances of lack of proper care and treatment of patients by the medical fraternity, the court said. The attendants of patients are not informed of the treatment done to them. The attendants are at a loss to know the progress in the condition of their patients. The doctors should realise that the attendants are concerned about their kith and kin and at the end when the patient collapses, he is wrapped up in a plastic body bag, the bench quoted. ‚ÄúThe doctors should understand that they are warriors fighting coronavirus and not their patients,‚Äù the judges observed. The attendants of patients ought to be informed of the condition of their loved ones at regular intervals, the bench said. The court queried from the Rims director about the reason for the death of Usha Devi, a patient admitted in the autonomous hospital for the treatment of black fungus. The two children of Usha Devi ‚Äî Gaurav and Puja ‚Äî had written a letter to chief minister Hemant Soren seeking his help for treating their mother. The letter was published in the local dailies after which the high court took suo motu cognizance of the matter. The Rims director informed the court that Usha Devi was operated upon but she could not be revived and died after the surgery. The bench said that the patient was admitted in Rims a month ago and there was delay in the surgery. The high court ordered the Rims director to conduct an inquiry into the delay caused in surgery and furnish a report through an affidavit. Meanwhile, advocate general Rajiv Ranjan told the court that the state has geared up to meet the challenges of black fungus. There are 160 cases of black fungus in the state and a team of expert doctors has been formed at RIMS to deal with the menace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-pulls-up-rims-for-death-of-black-fungus-patient/articleshow/84656795.cms||---

The grand old party is demanding a judicial probe appointed by a Supreme Court-appointed committee and removal of Union home minister Amit Shah in connection with the issue. At least 100 party workers comprising MLAs, ministers and ex-legislators attended the march and the demonstration. Ironically, many of the protesters were found violating the Covid appropriate behaviour. Leading the rally, state finance minister and Congress president Rameshwar Oraon said their party will fight it out both inside Parliament and on the streets to curb and expose on Modi government‚Äôs yet another attack on the right of privacy of citizens. ‚ÄúThe Pegasus spyware, which is devised by an Israel company, has already said their technology is only transferred to government or government-backed agencies for spying for national security. Private individuals or agencies can‚Äôt access it. Modi government has to explain how come so many persons, including AICC central leaders like Rahul Gandhi, journalists, judges etc, are being spied upon using the software,‚Äù he said, adding that the party reiterates its demand for an SC-appointed probe and removal of the Union home minister. Former Ranchi MP and veteran Congressman, Subodh Kant Sahay, said any kind of surveillance in the country can‚Äôt be possible without the involvement of the PMO and the home ministry. ‚ÄúI have been in the Union cabinet for long and understand how things work. Modi-Shah must answer why are they so scared that they have snoop upon people illegally,‚Äù he said. State health minister Banna Gupta said while the country was battling with numerous problems including the Covid-19 pandemic, the Union government is busy spying, snooping, electioneering and the likes. ‚ÄúThe country is paying for the misplaced priorities of the BJP government at the Centre in form of deaths, joblessness, inflation among others,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pegasus-snoopgate-cong-stages-raj-bhavan-march/articleshow/84656982.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Earlier this week, the district administrations of Jamtara, Koderma, Garhwa, Lohardaga, Chatra and Deoghar were directed by additional chief secretary health Arun Kumar Singh to screen more people for the viral infection. In between July 12 and July 18, Ramgarh tested 3,525 people while Jamtara screened 3,969. Koderma tested 4,075 people while Lohardaga tested 3,019 people. Chatra screened 6,123 people while Garhwa screened 5,431 people and Deoghar tested 5,064 persons. ‚ÄúEven though our testing figures are impressive, a few districts have low numbers. Many of them share their borders with neighbouring states and there is a footfall of people who arrive through trains and buses,‚Äù Bhuvanesh Pratap Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 management in Jharkhand, said. ‚ÄúHowever, the district administrations have been given new guidelines to ramp up their testing. We are hopeful of seeing a rise from next week onwards,‚Äù he added. As many as 3.23 lakh people were screened across Jharkhand in between July 12 and July 18, the health department said in its report. However, the numbers have dipped from the last week of June, when nearly 4.4 lakh people were screened. ‚ÄúTesting depends on various factors. One of them is contact tracing. Since Covid-19 cases have dipped statewide, the contact-tracing programmes have also slowed down. During the second wave, many people voluntarily opted for testing after developing Covid-19 like symptoms. With cases waning, these numbers have reduced as well. However, we are testing around 50,000 people on average each day,‚Äù said a senior doctor in the state health services, who is associated with the screening programme. Earlier this month, over 4 lakh RAT kits were distributed and five mobile RT-PCR testing vans were launched to ramp up testing. The fatalities have also dropped significantly from the end of June. While 12 deaths were reported in the last week of June, one death was reported in between July 12 and July 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-directs-6-border-districts-to-ramp-up-testing/articleshow/84656519.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The officials have identified a total of 119 structures on the banks of Harmu river and on the catchment area of Kanke dam and they will be demolished within the next fortnight. Apart from that more such illegal structures are being identified and will be removed after following due procedures. On Thursday, they removed 23 illegal structures situated on the banks of Harmu river and Kanke dam. Talking to TOI, the circle officer of Argora, Arvind Kumar Ojha, said: ‚ÄúA total of 81 structures have been identified in my area which have illegally come up on the areas adjoining the banks of Bhusur river. We have already issued notices to all of them and after they have failed to remove their illegal structures. We have removed a total of 18 in Hinoo area.‚Äù Asked on what parameters are they qualifying a structure as illegal, Ojha said, ‚ÄúAny construction which has been done within the 15m radius of the river bed or a water body, which is considered as the catchment area, that has to be removed. This is being done as per provisions of the building by-laws and it will continue for some time now.‚Äù In Kanke area, 15 illegal structures situated near the dam were removed. ‚ÄúWe have identified a total of 38 structures in my area, of which 15 have been demolished and rest 19 too will be completed within a week,‚Äù an official said. Meanwhile, a team of senior officials comprising Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan and RMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar visited the Harmu river stretch near Mukti Dham on Birsa Munda Rajpath in the morning and inspected the measurement being done by the government officials at the site. A few multi-storeyed buildings have been constructed on the both sides of Harmu river and the officials said that if any of the buildings are found to be in catchment area those will be demolished. Meanwhile, the district administration team had to face ire of people in new Bandhu nagar area in Hinoo where around eight structures, which included a few houses, were demolished on Wednesday. When TOI asked the residents, whose houses were demolished, about the land documents, they said that they weren‚Äôt given any when they purchased the land from middlemen as they had assured them that nobody will claim the land. ‚ÄúI had purchased 2.5 decimal land in Bandhu Nagar for Rs 2.5 lakh and have been living here for more than seven years. I had purchased the land as it was way cheaper than what I was getting in other parts of city,‚Äù said Surendra Singh whose house was also demolished during the eviction drive. Vinita Kumari said that they didn‚Äôt know that it is government land and middlemen said that the land belonged to them so they had purchased it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rmc-begins-clearing-encroachments-in-city/articleshow/84656742.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Jamshedpur||India Meteorological Department predicts showers across Jharkhand till July 27||RANCHI: The Ranchi office of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted widespread rains with thunder activities across Jharkhand in between Friday and July 27. The rains will occur owing to the influence of south-west monsoon trough and a low pressure system which is developing over northern Bay of Bengal, weather scientists here said. ‚ÄúUnder the influence of a low pressure area over north-west Bay of Bengal and the monsoon trough, Jharkhand will experience light to moderate rains throughout the week. Heavy rainfall is also expected to occur in isolated parts,‚Äù the IMD said. Most parts of the state, including Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Daltonganj did not receive appreciable rainfall on Thursday. ‚ÄúMonsoon was normal over the state in the past 24 hours. While many places recorded light to moderate rains, Koderma recorded the highest rain (52 mm) till 8:30am on Thursday,‚Äù the IMD said.

A bicycle rider and a person riding a scooty were hit by a truck near Bari-Cooperative intersection under City police station. Following the incident, locals blocked the NH demanding installation of a speed breaker at the spot to avoid such incidents. The agitators kept the bodies on the road and blocked traffic for about two hours. It was only after SDO Chas Dilip Pratap Singh Shekhawat, DSP City Kuldeep Chaudhary and MLA Biranchi Narayan came to the spot and assured possible help that the blockade was lifted. The MLA held the meeting with the officers on the spot and talked to the officials of NHAI over the phone demanding installation of the breakers at the intersection. The SDO said, ‚ÄúWe will soon hold a meeting with NHAI officials and ensure that speed breakers are installed to avert such incident. A compensation will be paid to the kin of the deceased as per government norms.‚Äù A police officer said the truck was going to Nayamod from the station‚Äôs side. He said the truck first hit the cyclist and in order to escape, it also hit the scooty. The scooter rider has been identified as Arun Ojha, a resident of Bari Cooperative. He was an outsourced employee at the BSL plant and was on his way to work. The cycle rider, Dhananjay Kumar, was also a resident of Bari Cooperative.

---||Vadodara||Avoid multivitamin, zinc pill overuse, say doctors||VADODARA: Too much of anything is bad, they say, including those things generally perceived to be beneficial for health. Like multivitamin tablets and zinc supplements that promise to boost your immunity, but an overdose may lead you to the dreaded black fungal infection or mucormycosis (MM). And the list also includes overabundance of steam inhalation too! A case in hand is 60-year-old Rohit Baria, a retired school peon from Vadodara, who got infected with Covid in May and recovered after 10 days of hospitalization. But three weeks later, he developed MM symptoms in June. During treatment, Baria told the doctors that he kept popping in multi-vitamin tablets frequently to keep his immunity levels high, but the excess usage obviously backfired. ‚ÄúThough he was administered steroids for Covid treatment, his blood sugar wasn‚Äôt that high to cause black fungus. Baria‚Äôs excessive intake of multi-vitamin pills containing iron and zinc seemed to be one of the reasons behind MM. He also admitted to have taken too much of steam inhalation,‚Äù said Dr Neel Thakkar, a Vadodara-based pulmonologist. ‚ÄúLike Thakkar, many persons, who got infected with MM, have been found taking unchecked doses of iron and zinc tablets. An excessive intake of these pills increases iron and zinc in the blood and it gives an ideal environment for black fungus to develop,‚Äù Thakkar told TOI. He added that besides various studies on causes behind the occurrence of mucormycosis and the British Medical Journal (BMJ) too have mentioned excessive multi-vitamin as one of the reasons leading to black fungus infection. An article published in BMJ in June this year has suggested avoiding overuse of iron and zinc supplements for the management of Covid-19 and also to cut down overzealous use of steam inhalation. ‚ÄúAfter recovering, many Covid patients take steam several times a day. But too much steam burns the mucosa protecting layer in the nose and allows the black fungus to grow easily in the sinus. The fungus then spreads to other parts,‚Äù said Dr Parth Rana, Retina and Ocular Trauma Surgeon from Ahmedabad. Dr Parita Pandya Shah, an ENT specialist in Vadodara, said, ‚ÄúA 32-year-old patient from Godhra who had recovered from Covid wasn‚Äôt either diabetic or administered steroids and yet he got MM. He said that he used to do excessive steam inhalation after recovery, which damaged his mucosa layer and likely caused black fungus.‚Äù ‚ÄúUnfortunately, he died during the treatment. I have been telling all my patients not to go for home medication and avoid too much steam inhalation as well as popping unprescribed iron and zinc tablets,‚Äù she added. Surat-based infectious diseases specialist, Dr Pratik Savaj is, in fact, a part of a study being conducted to ascertain various causes of MM. ‚ÄúWe are studying the role of zinc and iron overdose in causing mucormycosis. I have personally stopped prescribing multi-vitamin pills with zinc and iron to my patients,‚Äù Savaj added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dont-overdo-multivitamin-zinc-pills/articleshow/84655041.cms||Tushar Tere

As many as 97 people tested positive and 129 cured, bringing down the active caseload to 1,376. The state‚Äôs daily average case positivity rate marginally reduced to 2.58%. The positivity was around 3% last week. The recovery rate was 97.36% on Thursday. Five deaths were reported from Goa Medical College (GMC). A 52-year-old woman from Bardez, the youngest fatality of the day, had comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease. She died after 10 days in the hospital. A 73-year-old woman, who was admitted to GMC after contracting the virus, died after five days of treatment. She had cancer among other comorbidities. Three men ‚Äî a 72-year-old from Bicholim, an 82-year-old from Calangute and a 90-year-old from Porvorim ‚Äî all having comorbidities, died after treatment of about eight days. On Thursday, 18 patients required hospitalisation and five were discharged. The Margao urban health centre saw its caseload increase to 99, while the tally of the Ponda and Cortalim, the two bigger centres, had 75 and 72 active cases, respectively. Sanguem, Vasco and Ponda have relatively more active cases, but fewer than Ponda, Cortalim and Margao. In South Goa, the case tally of Shiroda, Navelim, Marcaim, Loutolim and Canacona has dropped below 30. In North Goa, Panaji‚Äôs caseload was 70 and that of Siolim 71, the two centres with the high caseload, and Mayem, had the lowest case tally of eight.

---||Goa||Less severe cases also seeing post-Covid syndrome: Doctors||PANAJI: People afflicted with a mild Covid-19 infection or those who may have come out of it without complications upon hospitalisation may consider themselves lucky not to have experienced the deadly face of the virus. Yet, they may be victims of post-Covid syndrome. Though hospitalised patients run a higher risk of developing post-Covid syndrome, doctors are also seeing it in patients who were home isolated. It may present in the form of fatigue, chest pain, aches and pains, erratic bowel symptoms, decreased exercise capacity, shortness of breath, hair loss among women, and, more importantly, psychological problems. Consultant physician at Healthway Hospital, Dr Chitralekha Nayak said that she has seen multiple patients complaining of fatigue during their follow-ups. ‚ÄúI think, post-Covid-19 syndrome happens to the majority, barring maybe those who were asymptomatic. One patient I saw had become so weak that she said she was unable to carry out even simple tasks, and that she felt tired all the time.‚Äù The syndrome, chest physician Dr Anil Mehndiratta said is not uncommon among patients who were cured without requiring hospitalisation. ‚ÄúI have seen several patients suffering from weakness, breathlessness, palpitations, and other problems, who were home isolated.‚Äù Besides physical problems, Mehndiratta said that many tend to suffer from psychological problems, too. ‚ÄúThey must seek counselling, increase their fluid intakes and follow a healthy diet,‚Äù he said. Since the immunity of a person post-Covid-19 is naturally down, he/she is likely to be exposed to any opportunistic infection. ‚ÄúI saw a family that two months ago had got Covid-19. Recently, all members of the family were down with fever. Upon testing, it turned out they all had dengue,‚Äù Nayak said. She said after the first wave of the pandemic, they saw very few patients that had post-Covid syndrome. Currently, things are different. As the second wave slowed down, the number of patients coming with varied complaints has increased and it is difficult to pinpoint an illness. Due to the risk of developing clotting, if any patient complains of chest pain and leg pain, his condition has to be evaluated to rule out any cardiac problem or a clot in the leg, Nayak said. ‚ÄúIt is better to over investigate than to miss a symptom hinting of a bigger ailment,‚Äù she said. By October, Nayak said they will know if post-Covid syndrome will last for a longer period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/less-severe-cases-also-seeing-post-covid-syndrome-docs/articleshow/84659584.cms||Bindiya Chari

The maritime partnership exercise between the Indian Navy and the Royal Navy saw the two navies conducting a range of multi-ship, air, sea and sub-surface maritime evolutions, as well as, close quarter manoeuvring, said the British High Commission. The wargames also included the F-35B stealth fighter which operates from the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth. This is the maiden exercise between the Indian Navy and the Royal Navy‚Äôs latest aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth. The exercise enables both the navies to advance their interoperability and cooperation ahead of similar maritime exercises later this year. ‚ÄúThis is a month that will see the Royal Navy and Indian Navy meet and work together in two oceans ‚Äì beginning in the Indian Ocean as the UK carrier strike group arrives for the first of multiple UK-India exercises and events. Later this summer, both will participate in a separate exercise in the Atlantic Ocean,‚Äù said First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin. He described the deployment as a sign of the strength and significance of the growing relationship between the two navies. A total of 10 ships, two submarines, approximately 20 aircraft and almost 4,000 personnel are participating in the maritime exercises. The Indian navy deployed INS Satpura, INS Ranvir, INS Jyoti, INS Kavaratti, INS Kulish and a submarine for the exercise. The Indian Navy‚Äôs long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft P-8I also participated. ‚ÄúAs HMS Queen Elizabeth and her carrier strike group cross the Indian Ocean, it is only natural that we should exercise with the Indian Navy,‚Äù said Commodore Steve Moorhouse, commander of the CSG. An Indian warship will also conduct exercises with the Royal Navy off the coast of the UK in August. The Indian Navy said that regular interactions between the two navies have augmented ‚Äúinteroperability and adaptability in the ever-changing security scenarios.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/indian-uk-navies-maiden-wargames-in-bay-of-bengal/articleshow/84659729.cms||---

The man breathed his last due to multiple organ failure. But before he succumbed his sperms were collected and preserved at the hospital following orders issued by the Gujarat high court. When the patient was on a life support system, his wife had moved the HC pleading that the sperms of her husband be preserved so that she can conceive through IVF if her husband does not recover. Anil Nambiar, zonal director of Sterling Hospitals said that the man died early on Thursday morning. He added that the body was handed over to the family. The woman had to move the HC as the pending Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill stipulates that no man‚Äôs sperm can be obtained without his consent. The hospital management had insisted on a court order in the absence of consent. The HC on Tuesday directed Sterling Hospital at Vadodara to preserve the sperm as sought by his wife.

The park will be developed by a private player and the model concession agreement and request for proposal is in the pipeline. MoRTH and the Goa government have yet to identify a location for the logistics park, which is one of the 35 being planned by the Centre across the country. ‚ÄúPre-feasibility study is in progress. Land parcel to be identified,‚Äù the MoRTH said. On October 2017, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had mandated MoRTH to develop 35 logistics parks across the country. The logistics parks will be developed under Public Private Partnership (PPP) on Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) mode. ‚ÄúBased on the outcome of the detailed project report or feasibility studies and approved bidding document, the tender will be invited from companies,‚Äù MoRTH officials said. These logistics parks will enable optimum and efficient vehicular movement in the country and thus lead to reduction in vehicular pollution and congestion, and enable the reduction in warehousing cost. As part of a 2030 plan, the Centre has been promising to setup a multi-modal logistics hub in Panaji since January 2019, but state government officials said that a logistics park in Panaji will be counter productive. A multi-modal logistics park will require a vast container terminal along with a rail link to quickly move containerised cargo. The closest rail link to Panaji is the Karmali railway station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/study-on-for-multi-modal-logistics-park-in-panaji/articleshow/84659649.cms||---

On July 1, notices had been served on 40 accused persons, including former BSP ministers Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Babu Singh Kushwaha, and 20 government officers for recording their statements. While Siddiqui, who joined Congress in 2018, turned up for questioning, Kushwaha expressed his inability for July 20 questioning and sought more time for preparation. Vigilance sleuths are now planning to interrogate Kushwaha in the first week of August. An FIR was lodged in the memorial scam in 2014 after the Lokayukta probed alleged irregularities and corruption and recommended the filing of FIRs under the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 409 of the IPC (criminal breach of trust by public servant) against 199 persons, including former BSP ministers Siddiqui, Kushwaha, and 12 BSP MLAs in 2013. Vigilance officials said the project managers had used red sandstone purchased at exorbitant rates. The sandstone used in construction of parks and memorials was procured from Mirzapur district, but was routed back to Rajasthan in order to make more money, thereby causing massive losses to the state exchequer. Vigilance had also filed first chargesheet in memorial scam in October 2020, in which it had named six government officials. The Enforcement Directorate had also registered a case of Prevention of Money Laundering Act in the memorial scam and had attached properties of engineers and contractors in Lucknow in connection with UP memorial scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/former-bsp-minister-naseemuddin-grilled-in-memorial-scam/articleshow/84662235.cms||---
---||Delhi||Courts can enforce a CM‚Äôs promise to public: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: In a ruling that is likely to have ramifications for politicians and elected functionaries, the Delhi high court on Thursday said a clear promise or assurance made by a chief minister or a governmental authority leads to a reasonable expectation from citizens that it will be fulfilled. Such a promise is ‚Äúclearly enforceable‚Äù by courts, it added. The HC gave the AAP government six weeks to frame a policy on CM Arvind Kejriwal‚Äôs March 2020 announcement that if a poor tenant was unable to pay rent during the pandemic, the state would fund it. Once the CM had given a solemn pledge, a duty was cast on the Delhi government to take a stand on enforcing the promise or not, the court said. ‚ÄúProper governance requires the government to take a decision on the assurance given by the CM, and inaction on the same cannot be the answer,‚Äù Justice Prathiba M Singh said, adding it was not clear why the government chose to ‚Äúcompletely disregard‚Äù it and not act on it. HC: Heads of govts expected to make responsible promisesJustice Prathiba M Singh said, ‚ÄúIn a democratic setup, people who hold an elected office, especially heads of governments and states, and those holding responsible positions are expected to make responsible assurances/promises to citizens, especially in times of crisis and distress. There would obviously be a reasonable expectation that an assurance or a promise made by a senior constitutional functionary, not less than the CM himself, would be given effect to.‚Äù The promise was to act as a balm on the wounds of landlords and tenants, who were severely affected, Singh said. ‚ÄúA statement given in a consciously held press conference, in the background of the lockdown announced due to the pandemic and the mass exodus of migrant labourers, cannot be simply overlooked.‚Äù The verdict came on a petition by daily wagers and workers, along with a landlord, seeking to enforce the promise made by Kejriwal on March 29, 2020 that if any tenant was unable to pay rent due to poverty, the government would pay it on their behalf. The bench stated that there was a ‚Äúreasonable expectation‚Äù by citizens that the CM knew the background in which such a promise was being made, the number of people who would be affected and the financial implications. ‚ÄúThe statement was not made by a government functionary at a lower level in the hierarchy, who could be devoid of such knowledge. The CM is expected to have had the said knowledge and is expected to exercise his authority to give effect to his promise/assurance. A citizen will believe that the CM has spoken on behalf of his government,‚Äù added the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/courts-can-enforce-a-cms-promise-to-public-delhi-hc/articleshow/84664008.cms||Abhinav Garg

Nobody knows how the tiny Rhesus macaque migrated to the zoo, but the monkey has happily adopted it as its home. He seemed to have bonded well with the wild animals there as well, as none of the other species seem very annoyed as he flits in and out of their cages. ‚ÄúIt was seen for the first time about two months ago. The macaque initially spent some time on the trees and then began going around the zoo. It hops around in the wild animals‚Äô enclosures fearlessly,‚Äù said Pratyush Patankar, zoo curator.It is often seen monkeying around the enclosure of the leopards and teasing the big cat. ‚ÄúWe tried to capture it with the help of forest officials but our attempts didn‚Äôt succeed,‚Äù Patankar added. The five-year-old macaque also gets into a fight with the primates kept in the zoo cages. ‚ÄúWe have 11 Rhesus macaques in enclosures and this wild one often gets into fights particularly with the male monkeys,‚Äù Patankar said.The fights are sometimes fierce and the zoo staff have to intervene and shoo it away. It feeds on the fruits and any food is available in and around the zoo. This monkey is usually not seen in the urban areas of Vadodara that is dominated by the langoors. An intelligent primate, Rhesus macaques usually live in groups. ‚ÄúBut we had got complaints from the airport authorities some time ago that some Rhesus macaques ventured on the runway,‚Äù Patankar said. The Rhesus macaque usually feeds on fruits, roots, herbs but in urban areas it also gobbles up any food available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/wild-rhesus-macaques-antics-inside-zoo-adds-to-attraction/articleshow/84655190.cms||Tushar Tere

Rajender Malik, father of Olympic wrestler Sonam Malik of Sonipat, said it was tough for the family to support a daughter who was one of the country‚Äôs medal hopes in 2021. ‚ÄúThe state government gave the Olympic qualifiers Rs 5 lakh but the cash award is unpaid,‚Äù he said. Sonam Malik qualified for the Olympics by beating Rio‚Äôs bronze medallist Sakshi Malik and her due prize for last year is abour Rs 25 lakh. Dharamvir Malik, father of wrestler Anshu Malik of Jind, said the family had scurried in vain for the pending cash award of Rs 20 lakh, roughly. Sonam is a medal hope in the 62-kilogram category and Anshu Malik in 57kg. Vijender Panghal, father of world number one boxer Amit Panghal of Rohtak, said the family must have pleaded at many levels and, every time, got assurances that prize was coming. He said: ‚ÄúWe are told that new sports director, IPS officer Pankaj Nain, is making personal efforts to expedite the process.‚Äù Ram Kishan Bhaker, father of ace shooter Manu Bhaker, said: ‚ÄúAfter winning more than 20 international medals, she is made to wait for her reward. It‚Äôs due for years and we hope it comes after the Olympics at least.‚Äù Sandeep Punia, who qualified for 20km race walking in Tokyo, has written to the deputy sports director about the department‚Äôs ‚Äúdeliberate objection‚Äù to his application for cash awards, out of ‚Äúgame‚Äôs politics‚Äù. Sources said barring the 2018 Commonwealth Games and Asiad, the awards are due for all events such as Asian and world championships, and the cadet tournaments in wrestling. One of the parents of a Tokyo-bound Olympian told TOI: ‚ÄúThe cash awards are a big motivation to the athletes and their families who go to their maximum limit to take them to this level. Awards before the Olympics would have given us confidence that the sports policy is no only on the paper but also on the ground.‚Äù Gajender Phogat, Haryana chief minister‚Äôs officer on special duty for publicity, who had visited the families of many Tokyo-bound athletes, confirmed that they had asked about the cash awards.

The ramifications of this issue relate to snooping on elected MPs like terrorists, snatching fundamental rights and national security,‚Äù the TMC said. TMC members had a parliamentary strategy meeting on Thursday where the party‚Äôs new general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, whose phone is among those alleged to have been put under surveillance, was present. ‚ÄúWe want nothing short of replies from the PM and the home minister.

TMC chief whip in Rajya Sabha Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said two party MPs have been giving notices under Rule 267 in the Upper House since the first day for a discussion on the Pegasus issue but it has not been taken up. ‚ÄúThe PM and home minister should tell us who employed NSO,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wont-let-house-run-till-modi-or-shah-makes-a-statement-tmc/articleshow/84664050.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||Delhi||No interference, acted in public interest, says Delhi LG Anil Baijal||NEW DELHI: Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Thursday rebutted deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia‚Äôs accusation that he had been indulging in ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù acts by holding meetings with officers without involving the ministers concerned on subjects that are within the elected government‚Äôs jurisdiction. Calling his charges baseless, in a letter to the deputy CM, the LG said the AAP government had attached incorrect connotations to his actions carried out in good faith and to facilitate coordination between the central and state government agencies for ensuring effective implementation in the interest of people‚Äôs welfare. Baijal was responding to a letter that Sisodia had written to him on July 17. The LG recalled that no such issue had been raised earlier over similar meetings he had called as a constitutional functionary. All meetings strictly within ambit of constitutional provisions: LGBaijal said that instead of appreciating the objectives and outcomes of the meetings, aspersions had been cast upon him which was unfortunate. ‚ÄúAt the outset, I would like to strongly refute the insinuations and statements made in the letter against this office which are devoid of any merit and without any evidence,‚Äù wrote the LG in a six-page letter. He asserted that all the meetings were strictly within the ambit of constitutional provisions and responsibilities entrusted to the LG‚Äôs office and were held with the basic objective of facilitating effective planning, preparedness and implementation of specific programmes and tasks in larger public interest, given the multiplicity of agencies in Delhi and the necessity to ensure interagency coordination for seamless and harmonious functioning. ‚ÄúAll the meetings were convened through videoconferencing on the open platform of NIC and not within the confines of Raj Niwas. The meetings were convened only to monitor the implementation of programmes and schemes where no policy decisions were required to be taken. If policy issues were involved, then the hon'ble minister concerned would have also been invited,‚Äù said the LG. The LG also objected to Sisodia‚Äôs communication being made public. ‚ÄúWhatever might have been the reason, this communication should not have been made public in view of the sensitivity of the issues related to the role and responsibilities of constitutional functionaries. You could have discussed this matter with me and I would have cleared your doubts through a one-to-one discussion,‚Äù the LG stated in the letter. Baijal pointed out that nine followup meetings were held on issues like vaccination, oxygen infrastructure, enforcement, etc., all related to assessment of the present Covid-19 situation with the objective to ensure effective implementation of the advice given by national-level experts and the decisions taken at Delhi Disaster Management Authority meetings. The LG is the DDMA chairman. Some of these meetings were attended by the CM, deputy CM, health minister and others. ‚ÄúWas it a violation of constitutional and democratic principles to convene meetings on issues pertaining to the management of Covid in the larger public interest?‚Äù the LG asked. He said that being a nominee of the President, it was his duty to ensure that the laws made by Parliament are executed in their true spirit. ‚ÄúThe judgement of Supreme Court has also desired that the LG should act as a facilitator,‚Äù he pointed out, adding that hence two meetings were convened to facilitate implementation of national schemes like PM SVANidhi (micro credit scheme for street vendors) and ‚ÄòOne Nation One Ration Card‚Äô. Referring to Sisodia‚Äôs remarks that the LG was interfering in the working of the elected government, Baijal said he had called up the chief ministers of Haryana and UP over water supply to Delhi on CM Arvind Kejriwal‚Äôs request. The LG had also held three meetings -- on rejuvenation of water bodies, rainwater harvesting, etc. ‚Äî with DJB, DDA environment department and urban local bodies. ‚ÄúIt is not understood how convening meetings to enhance availability of water for the citizens of Delhi can be seen as interference in the working of the government?‚Äù the LG asked, listing several meetings he had convened in recent months. On Sisodia‚Äôs remark that only police, public order and land were under the purview of the LG, the letter said that governance cannot be divided into watertight compartments as the subject matters are interlinked. Explaining that some meetings were called by him for coordination between Delhi Police and departments of Delhi government, the LG asked whether it was wrong to call these meetings to ensure women‚Äôs safety in Delhi? Referring to Supreme Court‚Äôs 2018 judgement on the Delhi power tussle, the LG stated that in matters of public importance, the approach of the government must be conciliatory and reflect the spirit of mutual interdependence and cooperation in the interest of cooperative federalism. He said Sisodia did not cite any specific evidence or instance in his July 17 letter where directions given by the LG in the meetings in any manner obstructed implementation of decisions taken by the elected government. He stressed that through all the meetings, his ultimate goal and objective always remained strengthening cooperative federalism and people‚Äôs welfare. The LG said he remained undeterred and strongly committed to his constitutional duty and to the highest principles of democracy for the welfare of the people of Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-interference-acted-in-public-interest-says-delhi-lg-anil-baijal/articleshow/84664048.cms||AlokKNMishra

It could be reason for brisk downloads||KOZHIKODE: While the row over Pegasus spyware rages globally, an app of a Koyilandy-based public service commission coaching centre by the same name has seen brisk downloads with people mistaking it to be the Israeli spy software. Authorities of Pegasus PSC Coaching Centre in Kerala were surprised to see the sudden spurt in downloads of their ‚ÄòPegasus Online‚Äô app over the last three days ever since the spyware controversy erupted. While the total downloads of the app stood at 1,000 last week, it doubled over the past three days to touch 2,110 on Thursday morning. ‚ÄúWe understood that the new-found interest in the app was fuelled by reports over Pegasus software after we started getting plenty of calls from people who downloaded it outside Kerala, even north Indian states,‚Äù said PC Sanoop, owner of the coaching centre. Abin KT, a staff at the centre, said many callers asked how they could manage phone calls using the software. ‚Äú I am busy telling them the app is for Kerala PSC exam coaching,‚Äù he said, adding that even their Facebook page has been flooded with requests over the past few days. He said the app had the mythological winged horse as its logo and media reports, which used the image of it in the coverage of spyware, would also have contributed to this mistaken identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/whats-in-a-name-it-could-be-reason-for-brisk-downloads/articleshow/84664080.cms||---

Justice Rekha Palli on Thursday issued notices asking the Union ministry of information & broadcasting, Google LLC, Press Council of India and Electronic Media Monitoring Centre to respond to the petition filed by Ashutosh Kaushik. The court asked the authorities to file their replies within four weeks and listed the matter for hearing in December. Kaushik‚Äôs petition states that people have a right to ‚Äúmake mistakes without being haunted by them indefinitely‚Äù. It argues that the ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that anybody else can no longer trace them. It also enables a person to ‚Äúsilence past events‚Äù of the person‚Äôs life that are no longer occurring, the plea adds. According to the petitioner, whenever his name is searched on the internet, photos relating to news reports of his alleged brawl in a pub and a traffic violation come up on various search engines, including Google. He urged the court for removal of all such posts, videos and photos relating to him. The traffic violation attributed to him was reported in 2009 while the alleged brawl occurred in 2013. Senior advocate Arvind Nigam, representing Google, said the ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù was not yet a law in the country. Kaushik‚Äôs petition states that ‚Äúdespite attaining outstanding success on the silver screen, the petitioner had to suffer utmost psychological pain for his diminutive acts that were erroneously committed a decade ago‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/have-right-to-make-mistakes-not-be-haunted-indefinitely-says-plea-on-right-to-be-forgotten/articleshow/84664096.cms||---

Applications will be received y at government examination service centres in all districts from 10 am to 5.45 pm on all days except Sunday (July 25). After the board exams were cancelled, Class XII results were declared under a system where 50% weightage was given for Class X board exam marks, 20% for Class XI board exam marks, and 30% for Class XII practical and internal assessment. The government had said it would conduct a supplementary exam for aggrieved candidates and private candidates in September or October. There are around 39,000 private candidates this year. Those who have already applied need not apply again now. School principals said students, in general, were happy with the marks and many may not be interested in applying for supplementary exams. ‚ÄúDue to the weightage system followed by the state government, students scored high marks in Class XII. They would have lost touch with their subjects as two months have passed. Preparing to write exams in all subjects within two weeks is not possible,‚Äù a principal from a city school said. Of 8.16 lakh candidates, 77% scored above 400 of 600 marks. Around 5% scored above 551 of 600 marks,15 times the number recorded the previous year.

Its survey of 16,254 adult internet users in 16 nations found that nearly seven out of 10 consumers in India were targeted by a tech-support scammer in the past one year. The ‚ÄòGlobal Tech Support Scam Research‚Äô showed that India experienced a relatively high scam encounter rate of 69% in 2021, almost similar (70%) to that in 2018. In contrast, there was an overall five-point drop in scam encounters globally with a rate of 59% over the same period. In India, one in three (31%) of those surveyed continued engaging and eventually lost money, an increase of 17 points as compared with 2018. Millennials (aged 24-37) were the most susceptible, with 58% of those that continued with a scam incurring monetary loss. As much as 73% of men in India who proceeded to interact with a scammer were likely to lose money, the survey said. Every month, Microsoft receives around 6,500 complaints globally from people who have been the victims of tech-support scams. This is down from 13,000 reports in an average month in prior years. Posing as executives of a tech major, such as Microsoft or Google, the scammers contact users and create a fear psychosis or convince them to install a software. Once done, it gives the fraudsters illegal ‚Äòremote access‚Äô to their victim‚Äôs devices.

Their owners were nearby, trying to settle in for the long wait for dawn ‚Äì and the shot of hope. They had all marked their spots for Covid-19 vaccination scheduled for Thursday. Everyone in town wants one, but there isn‚Äôt enough to go around. There have been chaotic scenes earlier. These townsfolk wanted to beat the crowd, but there was no guarantee that their 14-hour overnight wait would pay off and all of them would get vaccinated ‚Äì in the order their footwear lay. ‚ÄúWe are getting fewer Covid-19 vaccines than what is required,‚Äù Mandsaur‚Äôs chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr KL Rathore told TOI. The district, with a target of 22 lakh Covid-19 vaccinations, has received only 30,000 doses. ‚ÄúThere is no pattern in vaccine allocation. Last week, we got 12,000 vaccines. We administered them within a day,‚Äù the CMHO said. AGAINST ALL ODDSVaccine supply can‚Äôt keep up with rush for shot of hopeNews that a fresh batch of vaccines had arrived and a camp would be held on Thursday spread like wildfire. Villagers, women included, gathered blankets, bedsheets and food and flocked to the centre to wait out the night. ‚ÄúVaccination is very important. I was here by 8pm on Wednesday. That‚Äôs the only way to get a token and get the dose,‚Äù Sharda Bai said. The community centre was not built to handle a crowd. Soon, their struggles started ‚Äì for toilets, drinking water and space to just curl up. Swarms of mosquitoes and humid conditions put nerves on edge. And then, it began raining heavily. The crowd in that cramped space was an invitation to Covid, but they were all pinning their hopes on getting a shot the next day. Late at night, some cops from Malhargarh police station arrived to manage the crowd, only to run into a wave of anger. After a lot of arguing and shouting, the police cut down the crowd to around 250 and shooed the rest away. The fewer numbers didn‚Äôt make the crowding and cramping any better. Mosquitoes buzzed and stung, but if you tried to kill one, you risked hitting a fellow vaccine-waiter. People were heard talking of the ‚Äòthird wave‚Äô, and how they have learnt vaccines are the only life-savers. Sixty-year-old Prabhuraj said: ‚ÄúI arrived here at 7am sharp after wasting the last couple of days in Narayangarh and Pipariya centres to get vaccinated. There are no arrangements there.‚Äù By Thursday morning, the numbers had swelled to 500. Health officials posted at the centre told reporters that there was only enough to vaccinate 100 women and as many men. The rest left angry and disappointed, lugging back their bedsheets and empty tiffin boxes. They will be back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/in-madhya-pradesh-town-overnight-wait-for-vaccines/articleshow/84664153.cms||Sagar Choukse
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh withdraws plea against HC stay on Amaravati land scam FIR||NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh government on Thursday claimed to have become wiser and withdrew from the Supreme Court its eight month-old petition challenging an AP High Court decision staying investigations into an FIR and stopping police from taking coercive action in an FIR relating to alleged land scam in Amaravati. The AP police had registered the FIR against former advocate general of the state D Srinivas and 13 others, including two daughters of a sitting SC Judge, for allegedly purchasing land in Amaravati with insider knowledge even prior to a decision was taken about the area being declared the capital of the state after its bifurcation. There were allegations that this retributive action of registering the FIR by the AP government was allegedly taken after the sitting Judge ordered expedition of trial in pending cases against elected representatives. Chief minister Jagan Reddy has nearly a dozen criminal cases pending trial against him. On Srinivas's petition, the HC had stayed investigation and coercive action against the accused persons. AP government had rushed to the SC in November last year and fought tooth and nail for vacation of the restraint order. The SC did not and advised the AP government to go before the HC and argue its case while reminding the state that SC generally does not entertain appeals against interim orders. On Thursday, AP government counsel Mahfooz A Nazki told a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari that the state government wanted to withdraw its appeal and contest the pending petition before the AP HC. The bench said, "Had it been an ordinary citizen's case, you know what would have happened. Moreover, in the last eight months, the AP government has not filed a counter affidavit before the HC and yet it wanted to come to the SC straightaway against an interim stay order." Nazki said, "We are wiser now and that the government would contest the petition filed by D Srinivas before the HC." Appearing for Srinivas, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra requested the SC to ensure expeditious disposal of the case in the HC, where it has been pending for more than eight months. The bench disposed of the AP government's appeal and requested the HC to expeditiously decide Srinivas's petition, preferably within four weeks. When a request was made to the bench to direct the AP government to file its counter affidavit before the HC to enable it decide the issues, the bench said, "It is the right of the AP government to file its response. If it chooses not to file, it is up to them." On November 25 last year, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the AP government, had claimed that the police have found a series of transactions and it was unprecedented that a HC proceeded with unseemly haste to restrain further investigation and grant anticipatory bail to accused while gagging the media. The SC had vacated the HC's gag order on media. For Srinivas, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Harish Salve termed the FIR a naked attempt to mar the reputations of ex-AG and others. "A capital city requires 50,000 acres of land. The decision about Amaravathi being chosen as capital was in public knowledge since June 2014. Thousands purchased land in the area as it was open to the public to buy land. What is wrong in the land purchases made in July 2015? Because the CM faced a flurry of cases and got no relief from the HC, he is doing this through the police. The police are being used as the infamous Gestapos of Nazis. The HC is also seized of a petition accusing the government of slandering the HC and its judges through vituperative social media posts," Rohatgi said. Salve had said the matter is of grave concern. "It is a vote of no confidence against the HC by the state government. From September 15 till date, the government has not filed a reply in the HC in the pending case and has moved the SC. They could have moved HC and requested to vacate the stay order."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/wiser-ap-pulls-out-case-linked-to-law-officials-from-apex-court/articleshow/84664167.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government nod to reopen educational institutions from August 2||JAIPUR: The state cabinet meeting held on Thursday gave in-principle approval to reopen schools and other educational institutions, including coaching centres, from August 2 and decided to regularise recruitment of computer instructors in schools. Earlier, the government had decided to recruit 10,453 computer instructors on a temporary basis which had invited protests by youth who recently met Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi in Delhi. Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra told TOI that ‚Äúall classes of schools and colleges will be opened from August 2 and an SOP will be issued separately‚Äù. The meeting discussed in detail the opening of various educational institutions, including schools, colleges and universities. The cabinet sought the opinion of experts and doctors in this regard. The status of opening educational institutions after the second wave in other states was also discussed. But the decision to open educational institutions has come under attack by parents' organisations. Abhishek Jain, state spokesperson of Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh, criticised the decision and said, ‚ÄúIt raises a question mark on the functioning of the government as a whole. On the one hand, the state government is claiming that there would be a third wave of corona, on the other, it is playing with the lives of children and parents by bowing to the pressure of private schools. Parents will not send their children to school until the state government and school operators take responsibility for the health of children.‚Äù The council of ministers agreed in-principle that it would be appropriate to open educational institutions following Covid protocol and taking all precautions. The cabinet had detailed discussion on the implementation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund announced by the Government of India. The concerned department was directed to frame guidelines for the scheme. Earlier, the cabinet approved the Rajasthan Jan Aadhaar Authority Rules, 2021, to make the benefits of various schemes accessible to the common man easily and transparently. Effective implementation of Rajasthan Jan Aadhaar Scheme will be ensured through this independent authority. It was also decided to bring the E-Mitra project under this authority. The cabinet approved the draft of amendment to the Rajasthan Tourism Business (Facilitation and Regulation) Act, 2010. This will make the provisions of the Act more relevant and in line with other legal provisions. It will make offences under this Act cognisable and punishable. This proposal will be presented in the assembly. The cabinet has also approved the proposal to amend the Rajasthan Computer and Subordinate Services Rules, 1992. With this amendment, candidates can be given appointment from the reserved list to the posts that remain vacant due to candidates, who are selected by direct recruitment to the post of information assistant, not joining for the same. The cabinet has approved amendment in the Rajasthan Medical and Health Subordinate Services Rules, 1965, for change in the educational qualification of the post of occupational therapist. With this decision, the vacant posts of occupational therapists in the medical and health department can be filled by direct recruitment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-nod-to-reopen-edu-insts-from-aug-2/articleshow/84660706.cms||Joychen Joseph

AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi told a press conference, ‚ÄúThis is not one swallow in one summer. This a pattern we have seen over seven years in which media houses have been targeted for their reporting and outspoken criticism of government‚Äôs actions.‚Äù Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee slammed the government for its ‚Äúvindictive action‚Äù against the media. ‚ÄúThe attack on journalists and media houses is yet another brutal attempt to stifle democracy. DainikBhaskar reported the way @narendramodi ji mishandled the entire #Covid crisis‚Äù she said, urging that the fight against ‚Äúautocratic forces‚Äù will be fought jointly. CPM accused the Centre of using central agencies for ‚Äúintimidation‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Modi government‚Äôs raid raj won‚Äôt work. Trying to scare and muzzle the truth from surfacing. But like the dead bodies floating in the Ganga, Modi government cannot hide,‚Äù CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Twitter. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said the I-T searches showed that the government was trying to scare the media. ‚ÄúThere was a time when frank, free and fearless reporting was admired, and could intimidate wrongdoers in governments. Now the intimidation comes from the govt, and dissimulation, discretion and defanging are the new watchwords,‚Äù Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-trying-to-gag-media-says-opposition/articleshow/84664180.cms||---

Banerjee further said: ‚ÄúThe incidents took place when our government wasn‚Äôt in charge.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Higher Secondary marks bring hopes of level playing field for other boards||KOLKATA: The Higher Secondary results, declared on Thursday, proved a mixed bag with an 11% increase in success rate against last year but a 70% decline in the number of students who had scored above 90%. The results also raised hopes of a level playing field for ISC and CBSE XII candidates. Last year‚Äôs runaway marks had queered the pitch for them during college admissions. Last year, the HS council had awarded 100% marks in all papers that were cancelled because of the pandemic. The Madhyamik results, declared on Tuesday, had further increased anxiety as all students had passed and a record 70% students had scored above 90%. This year, however, the formula adopted by the council to compute the results led to a moderation of marks, with 9,013 candidates securing 90% and above. last year, this figure was 30,220. In 2019 ‚Äî when the exam was held as usual ‚Äî 7,818 students had scored 90% or more. This year, there were no written exams. Unlike last year, however, full marks were not handed out. Instead, the council devised a formula that factored in Madhyamik scores, results of Class XI and project and practical scores of Class XII. This led to a more ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù assessment, several teachers felt. Like last year, the council did not publish a merit list. But there were 86 candidates in the top 10. The topper ‚Äî Rumana Sultana from Kandi, Murshidabad ‚Äî scored 499 out of 500, losing one mark in physics. She had come fifth in Madhyamik. Council president Mahua Das described this as ‚Äúa first of sorts achievement by a girl from the minority community‚Äù. The list of top-10 scorers was not shared publicly but sources said there were at least four students from the city in the pecking order: two boys from Hindu School and a boy and a girl from Pathfinder School, Jodhpur Park. Explaining the decline in students who had scored above 90%, Das said it could be due to the integration of Class XI term scores in the result, as many students don‚Äôt prepare for it as rigorously as they do for the Class XII board exam. In the 80% to 89% bracket, there were 49,370 this year against 84,746 of last year. In 2019, this figure had been 47,759. While HS students had a distinct advantage over those from other boards at UG admissions last year, college principals feel there will be a level playing field this year. ‚ÄúSeats in top colleges will go to the 90%-plus scorers. This year, the numbers are more realistic than last year‚Äôs. We will now wait and watch the ISC and CBSE XII results,‚Äù said the principal of a school, who was concerned about some bright students who had not made it to the top-10 ranks. ‚ÄúWe had sent our scores honestly and on time last year itself,‚Äù he said, indicating that schools that had sent their Class XI scores recently after the exams were cancelled and the formula was drawn up, had an advantage over others. Unlike in Madhyamik, where all students had passed, 22,114 students have been unsuccessful in HS. In all, 8,19,202 candidates had enrolled for the exams and 7,99,088 were declared successful. The pass percentage was a high 97.7%, up from 86% last year. The pass percentage of humanities, science and commerce streams were, 97.4%, 99.3% and 99.1% respectively. The council was upset that nearly 1,000 schools across the state had not submitted Class XI marks last year. After the exam was cancelled and Class XI marks became the basis of marks calculation for HS, these schools rushed to submit marks. ‚ÄúWe were surprised to see that these calculations were full of errors and marks had been inflated,‚Äù Das said, adding, ‚ÄúWe are going to take steps against these schools. We have used our own expert committee to moderate such marks. We have declared the results on the basis of marks calculated by us.‚Äù If such schools do not accept the marks that have been scaled down and awarded to students, the heads of such schools are free to apply for a review by July 26. All schools are required to preserve the Class XI answer scripts in question so that they could be produced before the council if required. Candidates got to see their marks on the designated websites of the council from 4pm onwards. No glitches were reported. Schools will be able to collect mark sheets of their students from 11am on Friday from 52 distribution centres. Parents will be allowed to collect them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hs-marks-bring-hopes-of-level-playing-field-for-other-boards/articleshow/84660658.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari urges HC to quash FIRs filed out of ‚Äòpolitical vendetta‚Äô||KOLKATA: Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari has filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court urging it to quash all FIRs filed against him out of ‚Äúpolitical vendetta‚Äù. He also prayed for directions to transfer all investigations done by state agencies such as police and CID to the central investigating agency, CBI. East Midnapore police had on Tuesday lodged an FIR against Adhikari for violating disaster protocol, admitting to illegal snooping and attempting to stop officers from doing their duty. The FIR, which has no less than 12 penal sections, was drawn up after the Nandigram MLA, in a speech at a rally on Monday, warned district police chief Amarnath K ‚Äúnot to do anything that will lead to you doing duty in Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs Anantnag or Baramulla‚Äù. Adhikari had also said he had details of phonecalls made to the SP from ‚Äúthe nephew‚Äôs office‚Äù. The MLA, however, had chosen not to attach ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù to the FIR and said: ‚ÄúThey keep doing these things. I am not bothered.‚Äù This apart, the state investigating agency had started probing the unnatural death of Adhikari‚Äôs security guard Subhabrata Chakraborty in 2018, based on a recent three-page complaint by the deceased‚Äôs widow praying for a fresh probe into the alleged suicide. Another case relating to alleged ‚Äúfinancial irregularities‚Äù in Contai Cooperative Bank, of which Adhikari is chairman, is pending in HC. In his petition, Adhikari stated that all proceedings were initiated after Trinamool took office for the third time and following his joining BJP from Trinamool. A few days back, the BJP leader had also moved the Supreme Court after receiving a notice from HC on CM Mamata Banerjee‚Äôs election petition challenging the Nandigram assembly poll results. Adhikari had urged SC to transfer the election-related case to any of the high courts for securing the ‚Äúends of justice‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-urges-hc-to-quash-firs-filed-out-of-political-vendetta/articleshow/84661851.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||West Bengal monthly income scheme for women heads from Sept 1||KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress government will roll out its ambitious Lakshmir Bhandar scheme ‚Äî a basic monthly income scheme for the woman head of family ‚Äî on September 1. Under the scheme, part of Trinamool‚Äôs poll promises, female heads of general-category families will be provided Rs 500 monthly and those of SC/ST families and of other backward classes will be provided Rs 1,000 per month. The Bengal government will start receiving applications for the scheme at the month-long ‚ÄòDuare Sarkar‚Äô camps that will start from August 16 and continue till September 15. CM Mamata Banerjee said applications filed later than September 1 will get their dues from the launch date. The state set aside Rs 10,000 crore for Lakshmir Bhandar scheme in the recently announced state Budget. This formed a bulk of the Rs 18,650 crore increase in budgetary outlay, compared to last year, to fund people-oriented schemes. According to sources, the scheme would include every household from SC/ST community and for general category, the income support would be given to all households except ‚Äúthose having at least one tax-paying member (42.3 lakh people) and those owning land more than 2 hectares (2.8 lakh people)‚Äù. This makes female heads of 1.6 crore households eligible for the scheme. This may require a total spending of around Rs 12,900 crore every year, which may push up Bengal‚Äôs monthly average consumption expenditure of a household, which is now around Rs 5,249, by another 10-20%, sources said. ‚ÄúDuare Sarkar camps will be held from August 16. These camps, like before, will also have applications for Lakshmir Bhandar. People can apply along with their Swasthya Sathi cards but would need a separate application. They will start receiving benefits from September 1. All those who apply even later will get their benefits from September 1 cut-off date,‚Äù the CM said. She urged the state administration to deploy more officers and personnel to ensure women received this benefit before Durga Puja. She added that applications for newly announced schemes such as student credit cards, revised Krishak Bandhu scheme and Khadya Sathi scheme too would be received at these camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-mthly-income-scheme-for-women-heads-from-sept-1/articleshow/84661872.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Trinamool Congress leader shot dead by armed goons in Birati||KOLKATA: In yet another shooting at a posh locality in the northern fringes of the city, a Trinamool Congress leader was riddled with bullets by a group of miscreants on bikes at Birati in North Dum Dum on Wednesday night. The goons pumped at least five bullets into Subhrojit Dutta (40), killing him on the spot, police said. The attack took place around 10.50pm on Wednesday when Dutta, a resident of Birati‚Äôs Shibachal and Trinamool committee member of ward no 18 in North Dum Dum municipality, was returning from the party office at Birati‚Äôs Banik More. ‚ÄúFive armed miscreants came on two motorbikes, fired at him indiscriminately from point blank range and fled along Belgharia Expressway,‚Äù a local trader said. On hearing gunshots, locals rushed to the spot and took Dutta to North Dum Dum municipal hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Cops suspect that supari killers may have been engaged to gun down the leader. A five-member CID team visited the crime scene on Thursday afternoon. Manoj Kr Verma, police commissioner of Barrackpore commissionerate, who also visited the spot, said five bullet wounds were found on Dutta‚Äôs body. According to local sources, Dutta was associated with a building materials supplying business on partnership. His family implicated his former business partner, Babulal Singh. ‚ÄúBabulal had borrowed Rs 4 lakh from my son. But he was getting involved with criminal activities. Later, my son left the partnership and demanded his money back. That‚Äôs why Babulal hatched the conspiracy to kill my son,‚Äù said mother Rekha Dutta. Sources, however, said Babulal, who was earlier a TMC activist, was seriously injured after being beaten up by local TMC supporters at Banik More on Wednesday afternoon, hours before Dutta‚Äôs murder. North Dum Dum MLA and state minister Chandrima Bhattacharya, however, said: ‚ÄúThere is no factional feud or any rival group within Trinamool in North Dum Dum. BJP-backed goons deliberately killed Dutta to unleash a reign of terror in a peaceful area.‚Äù BJP leader Archana Majumdar said: ‚ÄúThe murder is the fallout of a rivalry between two Trinamool groups over real estate syndicate.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-leader-shot-dead-by-armed-goons-in-birati/articleshow/84661463.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Opposing counsels face off in HC over NHRC violence report||KOLKATA: Polarized response to the NHRC report synopsis submitted to the Calcutta High Court on post-poll violence in West Bengal found reverberations in the courtroom on Thursday when senior lawyers locked horns over the report‚Äôs contents. Senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani, representing NHRC during the hearing before the five-judge bench, contended it was a ‚ÄúGujarat riot-like situation‚Äù in Bengal that called for setting up of an ‚Äúindependent investigating agency‚Äù. Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the state government, contended that NHRC had submitted a ‚Äúpolitically motivated report‚Äù. The repartee got bitter when the senior counsel appearing for deputy commissioner of police Rashid Munir Khan sought disclosure of the portion of the 3,500-page NHRC report dealing with sexual assault on women (Annexure I, Volume 8) to enable him to file a reply. Jethmalani vehemently opposed Kapil Sibal‚Äôs prayer, saying the synopsis of NHRC report clearly indicated the complicity of state police in threatening the victims. ‚ÄúAs a result, police cannot be trusted with the identities of the rape victims as mentioned in Annexure I of the report,‚Äù Jethmalani said. Singhvi contested the NHRC observations. ‚ÄúIt is a politically motivated report. The homily on independence of NHRC is laughable,‚Äù he said. Advocate Subir Sanyal, on behalf of NHRC, submitted to the bench that Annexure I listed the names of rape victims and the details of spot investigation conducted by NHRC on rape allegations. ‚ÄúThe annexure was not submitted in the interests of the rape victims. Making it public will put the safety of the rape victims at stake,‚Äù he said. The bench, while turning down the state‚Äôs prayer seeking a copy of Annexure I, ordered: ‚ÄúWe do not find that there is any requirement to supply Annexure I as it contains the names of the victims of sexual violence. Entire report shall be supplied to the investigating officer/agency which will investigate the matter.‚Äù The bench, however, granted some more time to the state government to file its response to the NHRC panel report. ‚ÄúTime was granted on the last date of hearing. However, no affidavit has been filed. Last opportunity is granted to file an affidavit, if any, on or before July 26, 2021,‚Äù it ordered. The bench will hear the matter again on July 28. A seven-member NHRC panel had submitted a synopsis of the report on Bengal post-poll violence to the HC on July 13, saying it was ‚Äúlaw of the ruler‚Äù instead of ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù in Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/opposing-counsels-face-off-in-hc-over-nhrc-violence-report/articleshow/84661716.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Every central agency is now a Pegasus agency, says West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee called the ‚ÄúPegasus scandal... a super-emergency worse than Emergency‚Äù on Thursday and repeated her demand for an impartial probe. ‚ÄúEvery (central) agency is now a Pegasus agency,‚Äù Banerjee said, urging civil society, intellectuals and students to lead the protest against the attempt to ‚Äúthrottle voices‚Äù of democracy to prevent the country from becoming ‚Äúa dangerous autocracy‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis is worse than Watergate. They will instil fear and will not let anyone talk in Hitler-style. The judiciary has been captured, political leaders cannot speak out. (Central) agencies should be renamed Pegasus A agency, Pegasus B agency. The agencies, from A to Z, have all become Pegasus. They cannot even trust their own officers and ministers. I am told even RSS office-bearers were under surveillance,‚Äù Banerjee said. ‚ÄúIt is expected that either the PM or the union home minister will speak on the issue when Parliament is in session. There are questions to be answered. Who purchased this? It is (made) in Israel, sold by NSO and only governments can purchase it. Even (former Chief Justice of India) Ranjan Gogoi‚Äôs friends and domestic helps were under surveillance. Judiciary has been targeted,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúYou need to either put your phone in a deep fridge or cremate it if you want to be safe,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOur democratic rights must be (kept) safe. We cannot lose our democracy, our voice, our fundamental rights. This is a very dangerous game,‚Äù the Bengal CM said, adding: ‚ÄúPublic life is unsafe. But I will not let people of my country be unsafe. They may even try to kill me but I do not mind.‚Äù ‚ÄúOne thought WhatsApp was safe. But it is most unsafe. Facetime videos too are compromised. Pegasus has digested everything. Subrata Bakshi, PK (Prasant Kishor) and Abhishek (Banerjee) were there during a pre-election meeting at my Kalighat office. We kept our phones away and just spoke. But even that video got recorded. I used to confer with PK several times. I had to speak with Abhishek on political matters several times. PK got his phone (forensically) audited. It has been cloned. If their phones are cloned, so is mine. My officers talk to me, you journalists reach out to me. But this is not a phone any more, it is a recorder. I have been speaking about this for a long time,‚Äù she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/every-central-agency-is-now-a-pegasus-agency-mamata/articleshow/84660702.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mining corporation to auction sand mining rights, says West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: All sand mining auctions in Bengal will be done by West Bengal Mining Development Corporation instead of district magistrates, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday. To usher in transparency and accountability into the allotment of five-year sand mining rights along river beds statewide, the allotment process would be monitored by the state chief secretary and finance secretary. Bengal, the CM said, would also introduce CCTV coverage and digital mapping of sand mines. The state, she added, would also introduce a helpline number for people to report illegal activities. Police, she said, would probe all complaints even if these were against officers or leaders. ‚ÄúNone will be spared,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúEarlier, DMs were empowered to allot mining rights for five years. But now it will be done centrally, and the chief secretary and finance secretary will monitor the entire process,‚Äù Banerjee said. Those allotted sand mining rights were lifting more sand and other resources four times more than legally entitled, she said. ‚ÄúThe state is losing its resources. These are state resources,‚Äù she said. Banerjee said coal was under the Centre‚Äôs control and wanted CISF to be strict. She said state police had been asked to be vigilant to stop illegal mining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mining-corpn-to-auction-sand-mining-rights-says-cm/articleshow/84661559.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government starts plan to back 4,050 Covid orphans||LUCKNOW: The state government has identified 4,050 children who lost both or one parent or guardians to Covid-19 since March 2020. These children will be given Rs 4,000 a month till they turn 18 years old while the government will also take care of their boarding, lodging, schooling etc. The Bal Seva Yojana was formally launched by Governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday with a transfer of Rs 12,000 to the account of each child. Out of the 4,050 beneficiaries identified, 240 are those children who have lost both parents while 3,810 are those who have lost a parent or legal guardians to the pandemic. The CM said that he has asked the women and child development department to also identify those children who have lost their parents to diseases other than Covid or for any other reason so that they, too, can get assistance from the state. ‚ÄúDuring this period, some non-Covid deaths would have also taken place. As a government sensitive to its people, we have to ensure that no child is left without support. Therefore, I have asked the women and child development department to prepare a separate list of such children who have lost their parents to other issues as well. We are also identifying women who have lost their husbands, especially those who have been left without a source of income and will bring out a special scheme for them,‚Äù the CM announced. Governor Anandiben Patel appealed to the public to step out and help with the rehabilitation of children who had been left without families. Commending the government for planning the life ahead of the Covid-affected children and not just transferring funds to them, the governor said that children needed someone to guide them. ‚ÄúI have directed all universities to identify such students who don‚Äôt have parents and adopt them. This does not mean only taking care of their fees but starting a programme in which one teacher can take responsibility of one child each, call them home once a month, celebrate their birthdays and be there for them when the child needs guidance,‚Äù she said. She added that UP has several such families who would like to come forward and take responsibility of such children. Under the Bal Seva Yojana, the government will not just give Rs 4,000 a month to each child but also provide tablets or laptops to children in schools, colleges, or pursuing vocational education. Those children who are below the age of 10 years and have been orphaned will be housed in state government children‚Äôs homes. Currently, such homes are functional in Mathura, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Agra and Rampur. Minor girls will be housed in Kasturba Gandhi Girls Schools run by the Centre or in children‚Äôs homes run by the state government. There are 13 such homes in the state. The government will also provide them with the facility to stay in the 18 upcoming Atal Residential Schools. The government will also provide financial assistance of Rs 1,01,000 for the marriage of girls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-government-starts-plan-to-back-4050-covid-orphans/articleshow/84664181.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: AIADMK to hold agitations against DMK||CHENNAI: Against the backdrop of the DVAC conducting searches on the premises of a former AIADMK minister, the main opposition, AIADMK, on Thursday decided to hold a state-wide agitation ‚Äì likely to be black flag protests in front of houses, against the DMK government for not implementing the poll promises, including the reduction of fuel price, ‚Çπ1,000 monthly-aid to women home makers and abolishing NEET immediately after coming to power. The agitation is expected to take place on July 28, sources said. A meeting of party coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami in the party headquarters at noon, attended by former ministers and district secretaries of Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur, saw leaders expressing strong views on the ‚Äúfalse-narrative‚Äù of the DMK to win over the people in the elections after a hiatus of ten years. ‚ÄúEPS said the DMK held black flag protests against opening of Tasmac outlets during Covid, whereas the party after coming to power opened them. The DMK leaders made tall claims in pre-elections about abolishing NEET in the first assembly session but failed. All such false promises have to be taken to the people,‚Äù said a senior functionary. The dual leadership decided to drop into the party office at noon and called up the local secretaries and senior leaders after the reports emerged on the DVAC raids on the properties of the former minister. There was an open discussion with each leader slamming the DMK‚Äôs failure, while focussing on the AIADMK members as political vendetta. Condemning the government‚Äôs move, several participants told the leadership to expose the shortcomings of the M K Stalin-led government in its three-month regime, sources said. A few functionaries had even taken a dig at the DMK leaders, who earlier criticised the AIADMK government of being subservient to the Centre, now hailing the BJP ministers at the Centre in Delhi. The state‚Äôs attempts to merge the newly-created Dr J Jayalalithaa University in Villupuram to Annamalai University in Cuddalore came in for sharp criticism. ‚ÄúPanneerselvam said the DMK did not waive the crop and jewel loans as promised in its election manifesto but conveniently turned its focus on taking revenge on the AIADMK,‚Äù another leader said. The meeting reached a consensus to tell the people how they were misled by the DMK by its poll promises. Former higher education minister K P Anbalagan is said to have complained about the denial of access to garland the statue of Jayalalithaa on Marina since last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-aiadmk-to-hold-agitations-against-dmk/articleshow/84664234.cms||Julie Mariappan
