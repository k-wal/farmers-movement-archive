Albeit delayed, the new-look Commercial Street was reopened for the public recently and we saw many excited shoppers make a beeline to experience this first hand over the weekend. Stores hope for an increase in sales The pandemic has been bad for most businesses, especially those that could not adapt to an online mode. There’s been a big slump in sales for merchants of stand-alone establishments along the Commercial Street stretch. But they are hopeful that the makeover will boost the confidence of shoppers to head out and spend. "In the last 30 years, there’s never before been a good development like this, so this is a welcome move. This pathway now allows easy movement for shoppers and vehicles. The makeover has been slightly delayed due to the pandemic, but the response during the first weekend has given us hope that things will only get better," says Mayank Rohatgi, secretary, Bangalore Commercial AssociationSanjay Motwani, president, Bangalore Commercial Association echoes the sentiment, adding, "Commercial Street now has a truly international look and feel. We hope this helps in increasing tourism and business prospects. Parking and vehicle movements are being monitored and run on trial basis now. We are looking at removing parking options during weekends, but continue vehicular movement. We have good footpaths, so pedestrian movement will be unhindered."  The merchants on the street are also hopeful that this makeover will help people experience Commercial Street better. Umair Fazal says, "Commercial Street is one of the oldest shopping destinations of the country. Compared to most other streets, we have the widest mix of products, be it clothing, accessories or even eating joints. With this facelift, we hope that visitors to the area can experience it better." Shoppers say yay to the makeover Shoppers, especially young professionals, love the new-look Commercial Street. "There’s more room to walk now. Commercial Street is one such place where you need space to shop. This walker-friendly move is great for us," says Priyanka, a young working professional.  Priyanka's friend Bhavika adds, "Commercial Street has always been a favourite for Bengalureans, so this added experience will only ensure that people remain loyal to this shopping hub." Some others are of the opinion that while the makeover is akin to Church Street, they also need to implement the no vehicle rules over weekends. No parking will be tough on senior citizens Senior citizens find this move inconvenient. Rajshri, a shopper, says, "I find it hard to walk long distances. So, if we were to park far and walk across, it makes it hard. They should retain parking on one side of the road, especially for those who need it, we would not mind paying for that too. But the long walk can be hard for senior citizens like me."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengalurus-shoppers-love-commercial-streets-spruced-up-new-look/articleshow/84726923.cms||Sunayana Suresh

Tasked with shedding 10kg by his boss, the 172-cm tall cop has been been doing 5-km jogs twice a day since January this year. On July 16, Mahesh was among the 250 personnel who took weight test at a KSRP camp. With his weight dropping from 132kg to 118kg, Mahesh was among 22 KSRP personnel who were successful in achieving the 10kg target. In the backdrop of deteriorating health conditions of many KSRP personnel, a health camp was conducted last year where doctors opined that unhealthy lifestyle and and overweight were common issues plaguing the cops. In January, 250 overweight personnel from KSRP Bengaluru were told to shed at least 10kg in seven months. “In Bengaluru unit, 220 of the 250 personnel have lost weight. Of them, 22 lost more than 10kg. Others have been asked to shed weight at the earliest,” said additional director general of police, KSRP, Alok Kumar, who has taken the initiative to ensure his force is in good shape to execute their responsibilities. Ramakrishna Prasad MV, battalion commandant, said they arranged a one month weight-reduction camp. “We were taught how to eat. We all eat but don’t know how to eat. Eating systematically helps in proper digestion and maintaining good health,” Mahesh said, recalling that earlier he would feast on one entire chicken every day. Mahesh is now continuing with his diet and jogging regimen. Assistant reserve sub-inspector A Anant, 53, who reduced from 96kg to 84kg, said jogging and playing badminton helped him a lot. “Drinking warm water on empty stomach in the morning and not drinking water soon after meals were also beneficial,” he said. Head constable JM Handi, who lost 15kg, said: “I worked out in the gym. Besides, I changed my habits and ate food with less fat.” Handi weighed 104kg in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/jog-diet-help-22-cops-lose-10kg/articleshow/84740728.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Convict V Radhakrishna, then deputy range forest officer, BBMP, Yelahanka, had demanded Rs 7,000 from a contractor in December 2015 to give permission to remove two trees for carrying out a construction work. A Lokayukta police team headed by then police inspector Sudhir R laid a trap and arrested Radhakrishna on December 11, 2015, when he was accepting the bribe. Lokayukta police conducted an investigation and filed a chargesheet before the court. Radhakrishna was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs 10,000. In default of payment, he will have to undergo simple imprisonment for one more month. On July 19, Gopalakrishna Rai T, 78th Additional City Civil and Session Court and special judge for PC Act, said: “The offence proved by the prosecution is serious in nature. However, the court has to take into consideration the family status of the accused while imposing the sentence. It is a fit case to sentence the accused to undergo simple imprisonment.” The prosecution produced the records of phone conversation held between the accused and the complainant, the CDR of phone number and other evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/forester-gets-1-yr-jail-in-bribery-case/articleshow/84740731.cms||Santosh kumar.B

In May this year, the defence ministry had sent letters to government departments to provide names and contact details of the persons from their respective sectors whom they would like to recommend for inviting for the parade. They were asked to indicate the special contribution and achievement of the persons in “few lines”. The guests will get a “personal invitation” for two and will be provided “assured seating in a befitting enclosure”, the letter said. Sources said June 15 was the deadline for sending the names so that the necessary preparations can be made. The government has put the revamp of Rajpath on fast-track to ensure the project gets completed by November. This is the first project in the entire Central Vista redevelopment plan that will be completed when India celebrates the 75 years of Independence. Recently, Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said the redevelopment of Rajpath will be completed in time and “Citizens will get an avenue they will be proud of.” The Rajpath redevelopment project involves large-scale stonework, construction of underpasses, underground amenities blocks and horticulture work and sufficient space for parking. Twelve bridges on the artificial canals are being built, which are expected to be selfie points for visitors. The government has maintained that there will be more public space and increase in the green cover after the project gets completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/celebrities-achievers-to-be-special-invited-guests-at-next-republic-day-parade/articleshow/84740923.cms||Dipak K Dash

Most parts of the projects are being done in controlled factory environments that ensure good finishing and completion of these buildings in less than a year. These pre-fabricated parts are brought to the sites for assembling. A total of 3,284 multi-storey flats being built at Agartala, Lucknow and Rajkot have their factories at Indore, Bhopal, Bhilai and Pune. Similarly, for another 1,024 flats under construction at Indore, the work is in full swing at factories in Nagpur, Pune, Hyderabad and Bhilai. This is for the first time the government has taken up six pilot housing projects using new technologies to build multi-storey flats up to 13 floors across six cities in just one year, primarily focusing on pre-fabrication technologies. The companies executing the projects recently assured the PM to complete them within the set timeline. Modi on Sunday said he had reviewed the real time progress of these projects with the live feed from drones deployed at factories and project sites. The pilot projects were launched by the PM on January 1 to promote large adoption of new technologies for faster construction “These technologies will provide solutions to many issues including maintenance, painting the flats and pollution at project sites as most of the work is done in a factory controlled environment. Construction is one of the major contributors for air pollution,” said an official. In Rajkot, monolithic concrete construction technology from France is being used to make the houses strong enough to face natural disasters. Similarly, Canada's technology is being used in Lucknow, which will not require plaster and paint. In Chennai, the pre-cast concrete system technology from the US and Finland is being used to construct houses faster and cheaper. In Ranchi, flats are being built using the German 3D construction system just like Lego toys. Each room will be built separately before creating the whole structure. In Agartala, houses are being constructed with steel frames using New Zealand's technology to combat earthquakes. This technology is best suited for areas having higher earthquake risk. Due to poor soil condition at site, piling up to 30 meters depth is done for structural safety. Highlighting how new technology can accelerate construction of houses, Modi said, “There was a time when it would take years to complete even a minor construction. But today due to technology the situation is changing in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-tech-reduces-flat-construction-time-to-less-than-a-year/articleshow/84741089.cms||Dipak K Dash

Incidentally, the warmth between Congress and TMC on social media came a day before Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee flies to Delhi, where she is expected to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other senior opposition leaders. The Twitter post by Congress and Derek’s response indicate a build-up after poll strategist Prashant Kishor met Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi earlier this month. This was followed by Congress lending support to TMC on a host of issues — including the 10th Schedule relating to defection — during the all-party meeting on July 18. Read Also'Khela Hobe' till BJP is ousted from Centre: Mamata BanerjeeWest Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday took her "Khela Hobe" slogan to the national stage and declared that "Khela" will now happen in all states until the BJP is removed from the country.

In that meeting, Mamata named Sonia among the senior leaders she would invite for a mega opposition rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds “during the winter”. Mamata is likely to meet PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday. She has a scheduled meeting with opposition leaders at Banga Bhawan later in the day. The CM has also sought an appointment with the President and is likely to be in Parliament. She will be in Delhi from July 26-30. There was, however, no official word on the Mamata-Sonia meeting. A senior TMC leader aware of the developments refused to confirm or deny it. “No comments,” the leader said to a specific TOI query. The Congress twitter post targeted the PM on the Pegasus issue. Featuring Abhishek with a heading ‘Aap Chronology Samajhiye’, it said: “PM Modi’s insecurities are endless. PM Modi took the adage, ‘keep your enemies closer’ a little too far.” Read AlsoDidi to meet oppn netas after PM talkKOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has lined up a possible conclave of the top leadership of all major opposition parties at New Delhi’s Banga Bhawan on July 28, hours after her scheduled noon meeting with PM Narendra Modi.

There are three more persons, including former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa, who were featured in the “Aap Chronology Samjhiye” series of tweets. Nobody can support the way anti-BJP voices were targeted,” said Bhattacharya. “Rahul Gandhi had been very critical of phone tapping by the Modi government.

The high fare, around Rs 1,500, too is no deterrent for travellers seeking to soak in the panoramic view of the Western Ghats in these coaches. South Western Railway (SWR) records show occupancy rate in Vistadome coaches has crossed 100% on most days. On Saturday (July 24), Vistadome coaches from both sides recorded the highest booking: 119% from Yeshwantpur and 120% from Mangaluru. Ingenious rail passengers have found their own way to get around the high fare and have the best of the Vistadome too. “As the fare for a Vistadome coach is high, many people book tickets for non-AC coaches from Yeshwantpur to Hassan and then book another ticket to hop on to a Vistadome coach from Hassan and traverse the ghat section to save money,” said rail enthusiast Abhishek R. The service started from Mangaluru on July 11 and bookings are now full. These coaches have been provided in train nos. 06211/06212, 06575/06576 and 06539/06540 operating between Yeshwantpur and Mangaluru. Each train has two Vistadome coaches and each coach can accommodate 44 people. On Saturday, there were 105 passengers in Vistadome coaches that left Yeshwantpur and 106 in Mangaluru. Between July 12 and July 31 (20 days), more than 100% bookings have been recorded from Yeshwantpur on 12 days. The lowest booking (56.8%) was seen on Day 1 of the service from Yeshwantpur on July 12. However, since July 15, bookings have constantly hovered above 94%. On Mangaluru -Yeshwantpur route, 89.7% occupancy was seen on the inaugural run (July 11). The lowest booking was on July 12 (22%). However, bookings have crossed 100% for five days between July 11 and 31. SWR officials said travelling in Vistadome coaches during monsoon is a new experience for passengers, particularly between Subrahmanya Road and Sakleshpur, which has several bridges, waterfalls and tunnels. Aneesh Hegde, chief public relation officer of SWR, said: “We have received an overwhelming response from passengers, especially on weekend.” According to Abhishek, most passengers in the Vistadome coaches are from Bengaluru, who take the day train and then return by bus the same night. “However, passengers travelling in a Vistadome coach from Mangaluru cannot get the panoramic view of the ghat section as the engine in front of the coach blocks the view,” he explained. “We are in talks with Southern Railway to look into the possibility of attaching these coaches on the rear side from Mangaluru Junction too, but there are some practical constraints,” said Hegde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/swrs-vistadome-coaches-a-hit-see-100-occupancy-on-many-days/articleshow/84741483.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The scheme will be inaugurated at Kauvery Hospital. Funds to procure the vaccines under the CSR initiative will be borne by restaurant chain Adyar Anandha Bhavan and the hospital will be providing the jabs for free, said health minister Ma Subramanian. The scheme will soon be gradually implemented across districts, he said. Subramanian also clarified that the current practice of private hospitals providing vaccines at a price would continue, along with the free vaccination drive. Tamil Nadu has administered 1,94,93,414 vaccines so far, including 89,360 vaccinations on Sunday. The decline in new Covid-19 cases and deaths continued, with the state reporting 1,808 fresh infections and 22 deaths. TN’s total toll stood at 33,911, the third highest in the country. Chennai recorded a new low in daily cases (126) after the first wave. Coimbatore topped the infection chart with 169 new cases. Checks were intensified at 13 check posts along the Coimbatore-Kerala border with infection spread gaining pace in nearby Kerala districts.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Civic body cracks down on street light contractors||CHENNAI: An annual 40 crore contract to maintain street light posts and high mast posts in 10 corporation zones is likely to be cancelled this week as the Greater Chennai Corporation has issued show-cause notices to all the contractors. The contract was first awarded in 2012 and renewed every year. An internal audit revealed that the contractors were overcharging for electrical fittings and other spares. Besides, at least 3,5000 lights across the city weren’t functioning at any given time because of laxity on the part of the contractors. One of the important tender conditions to deploy qualified electricians and supply 27 materials every month was not fulfilled. Instead of 15 electricians, only eight or ten were deployed by the contractors and they were not qualified. “We had to coordinate with three contractors to make one light run. For the post, there’s one contractor, for the LED fitting, the LED companies have to be chased, and for monitoring all these street lights under the group monitoring project, another contractor is in charge. And the fact is that none of them work as per their contract but get paid the full amount,” said an official. Two companies – Philips and Schreder -- had supplied the LED lights and provided 7 years guarantee. That ended last year after which the companies refused to repair or replace the LED fittings. Corporation engineers placed tubelights and CFL bulbs in those locations. However, they continued to pay 2 crore to 3 crore per zone for annual maintenance to corporation contractors for maintenance of the posts even though they didn’t have LED lights on them. Also, only about 600 posts would require maintenance or replacement a year. But contractors were paid for all 1.7 lakh posts every year. Other maintenance work such as repair of pillar faults and fixing of cable box problems was also not attended to for the past four months. The contractor had to maintain registers, be available 24x7 and also go on city rounds to ensure all lights glowed. None of this was done. Since only a penalty of 500 and 5% of the pole cost was levied on them for not working, they were willing to pay that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/civic-body-cracks-down-on-street-light-contractors/articleshow/84742261.cms||Komal Gautham

The woman, Janathulla Firdose, 22, of Puzhal was unhappy with her wedding that was fixed with her maternal uncle. Though she had tried to convince her family members against the marriage, they refused to accept her reasoning and forced her to accept the proposal. Police said Firdose sent a Whatsapp video in which she narrated her ordeal.

The TNCA, which has picked 60 of the 600, will further prune them to 24 to represent the state in the under-19 category. Karthiga’s efforts have come in for praise from police commissioner Shankar Jiwal. The Class X student from a Government High School in Kannagai Nagar near Okkiyam-Thoraipakkam, is a resident of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) colony in the neighbourhood. The girl, whose father Raja is into the iron scrap business and mother Ramya works at a garment manufacturing company near Velachery, was part of the Boys and Girls club attached to the Kannagi Nagar division for the past two years and was coached by Deepak and Hussain on the premises. Raja, who left his native village near Thisayanvilai in Tirunelveli due to a family feud and migrated to Kannagi Nagar three years ago, and his wife Ramya have two other children daughter Priyadarshini, a Class XII student, and son Selvan, a Class XI student. “My daughter,” Ramya told TOI, “starts her training at 6am and returns home around 8.45am before rushing to school, now online.” She again visits the ground around 3am and returns home around 7pm.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru saw short & intense rain spells on Sunday, some areas waterlogged||BENGALURU: Short bursts of rain returned with more intensity on Sunday to create havoc for the second consecutive day on Commercial Street and Avenue Road, while parts of central and south Bengaluru, especially the neighbourhood of Lalbagh and Ulsoor Lake, witnessed severe waterlogging. Residents of Kodandaram Layout, off Annaswamy Mudaliar Road in Ulsoor, said water entered their basements and some low-lying houses. Greenleaf Layout in Koramangala 4th Block also reported flooded streets. V Purushotam, convener, Halasuru Rising RWA, said: “Annaswamy Mudaliar Road was recently whitetopped but last week, it was waterlogged. After we informed the AEE concerned, that problem was fixed butwater is now flowing to the side roads and flooding the basements as well. We have informed the AEE again, who has assured us that they will look into the matter.” Flooding started just a few minutes after rain began. While shop owners and shoppers on Commercial Street braved waterlogging whenever the sky opened up, business establishments on Avenue Road remained closed during the day, saving everyone the trouble. Shop owners said waterlogging did not last more than 15 minutes. Both Commercial Street and Avenue Road are being redeveloped. On Saturday, most parts of the city received moderate rain, between 10mm to 25mm, according to Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre. On Friday, the rain was heavier. BBMP officials admitted that even 10 minutes of rain is leaving streets waterlogged but water recedes after 10 to 15 minutes. They described the phenomenon as local flooding due to heavy bursts of rain. According to BS Prahalad, chief engineer for stormwater drains, BBMP, there has been a change in rain pattern in the last five years. “A flash flood in Vrishabhavathi valley and Hebbal valley is the most dangerous. When a flash flood occurs, it is not for the entire city but in certain parts only. Houses have already been built on low-lying areas and rainwater gravitationally flows into them,” he added. Four stormwater valleys — Vrishabhavathi valley being the biggest followed by Hebbal valley, Chalaghatta valley and Koramangala valley — contribute to the city’s natural drainage arrangement. According to Prahalad, spreading the drainage network and augmenting the capacity is the only way to address the issue. This is not the first time that the city is witnessing local flooding this season. Heavy rain on June 4 had led to water entering over 200 households in a low-lying area at Yelachenahalli. Syed Salman, who managed to help several families after water gushed into their houses, said:“The level of water came down within 30 minutes, but by then it had caused enough damage.” He said a family was desperate to hold on to clothes and jewellery it had bought for a wedding due in August, but could not. “Mostly low-income families live in the area and they lost everything, including cash, jewellery, ration, clothes and so much more. Water entered with such force that most people did not know what to protect first,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-sees-short-intense-rain-spells-some-areas-waterlogged/articleshow/84742311.cms||---

The court has now ordered the bank to pay him a compensation of Rs 10,000 and refund his money. The complainant runs a granite unit and had a current account with the bank for the last 15 years. On April 9, 2014, he submitted a request with the bank’s branch on Cunningham Road to send Rs 1.5 lakh to a client through the RTGS facility in online banking. He furnished the correct IFSC, the receiving branch, and the name of the beneficiary. However, he submitted the wrong bank account number. In March 2015, the Bengalurean noticed that the bank had transferred the money to an unknown account instead of his client. Further examination revealed he had given the wrong account number and the bank staffers had picked up the IFSC, branch and holder’s name for that account and transferred Rs 1.5 lakh without cross-checking the correct IFSC and account-holder details provided by the customer. However, the bank authorities refused to accept their mistake and didn’t bother to refund the money. With all other grievance redressal options failing, the granite unit owner approached the Bangalore Rural and Urban 1st additional district consumer disputes redressal forum in Shantinagar on July 25, 2017. The bank’s lawyer slammed the complaint as false and not maintainable by law. He stated that the complainant himself had said he had furnished the wrong bank account number for the RTGS money transfer. In their order pronounced on June 30, 2021, the consumer forum noted that there was indeed a mistake on the part of the bank staff in completing the transfer. Even though the customer gave the wrong account number, the bank authorities had committed a mistake by sourcing IFSC and other details for that account, instead of the correct details provided by the customer. The judges said that the bank neglected all guidelines and steps to be followed before the transfer and didn’t bother to retrieve the money despite the customer being its loyal client for 15 years. The judges ruled that the bank’s general manager must refund Rs 1.5 lakh to the complainant along with interest and also directed him to pay Rs 5,000 towards damages and another Rs 5,000 for court expenses, all within 30 days from the order. The bank was also told that if need be, it can retrieve the wrongly remitted money from the account concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bank-told-to-refund-1-5l-wrongly-transferred-pay-bizman-10k-relief/articleshow/84742362.cms||Petlee Peter

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Woman fights chain-snatcher but police file FIR only after 20 hours||BENGALURU: Attacked by a knife-wielding thief in the front yard of her house near Devanahalli on Friday evening, a homemaker put up a spirited fight by holding on to her gold chain in one hand and his weapon in the other. Realising that he was up against a tough woman, the mugger fled when she raised an alarm. He, however, managed to take with him a part of the chain. Navita Devaraj, 30, from Koira village in Vishwanathapura rushed to the police station, 4km away, but the cops were of little help. Two constables accepted her statement, but they neither sounded an alert for the chain-snatcher on the run, nor came back with Navita for a spot inspection. On Saturday morning, when the news reached senior officials, sub-inspector Venkatesh visited Navita’s house. Finally by 4.30pm, an FIR was registered, almost 20 hours after the incident. A mother of two boys aged eight and four, Navita told TOI: “Had I let loose my grip on the chain or the knife, the mugger would have overpowered me. Since my sons and mother-in-law were inside the house, I realised that I had to face him alone. I wanted to fight back and save my chain, after all it was my mangalasutra.” The intruder had covered his face with a handkerchief. Navita suffered a minor cut on her neck, but was unhurt in the hand as she clung to the knife handle. Navita’s husband Devaraj, who owns a grocery shop in Koira village, had gone to Bengaluru when the incident happened. “My wife went to the police station with my friends, hoping they would come for a spot inspection. Only when we approached the sub-inspector in the morning was the inspection carried out and FIR registered,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-fights-chain-snatcher-but-police-file-fir-only-after-20-hours/articleshow/84742458.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Standing under a huge umbrella in pouring rain, Shah reminisced that during his boyhood, he had read in geography that Cherrapunjee,54km from the Meghalaya capital in the East Khasi Hills district, received the highest rainfall in the country and expressed regret that it has lost this status over the years. In an obvious reference to Mawsynram, he said that “another place” around 80km away is now the wettest place. The Union home minister along with chief minister Conrad K. Sangma on Sunday inaugurated the much-awaited Greater Sohra Water Supply Scheme in the presence of DoNER minister G. Kishan Reddy, junior DoNER minister B.L. Verma and minister of state for science and technology, Jitendra Singh, ministers of Meghalaya and government officials. The Greater Sohra Water Supply Scheme was conceptualised by the Meghalaya government and funded by the DoNER ministry under NESIDS in 2019 at a cost of Rs 24.08 crore. The project will supply water to Sohra town and 12 other nearby habitations and is designed to cover a population of 22,943. Shah also initiated the launch of the Sohra Afforestation Project, which is a joint initiative of the director-general of Assam Rifles and the Meghalaya government. The plantations would be completed within three years and maintenance support would be provided up to 5 years. Shah underlined the importance of afforestation and tree plantation and said, “Earlier Cherrapunjee used to have rain throughout the year, but due to indiscriminate harvesting in the name of development, the situation has changed.” He added that an ambitious project to make Cherrapunjee green again has started today. Shah said the entire area of Cherrapunjee will be be adopted by the Assam Rifles for plantation. He said as part of the Prime Minister's ambitious Jal Jeevan Mission, supported by the DoNER ministry and the Meghalaya government, under the Northeast Special Infrastructure Scheme, the Greater Sohra Water Project costing Rs 25 crore, will provide pure drinking water through taps to every household.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/shah-stresses-on-restoring-sohras-ecological-glory/articleshow/84739157.cms||Manosh Das

Even as suspense ruled the day, BJP national president J P Nadda said in Goa: “Yediyurappa has done good work and his government is functioning well. We don’t see any political crisis in Karnataka.” Returning to Bengaluru after an aerial survey of the flood-affected Belagavi district, the CM said: “I have not received any message till now (6pm). It may come tonight or tomorrow morning. I’ll do as the party says: Will continue or resign (depending on the advice) and start working for the party.” Yediyurappa, 78, said he would take a decision on his own if the party didn’t send any message even on Monday. Earlier in the day, the CM had said he was expecting a message from the party by 5pm Sunday on the road ahead. Whether he would meet governor Thaawarchand Gehlot on Monday after attending the second anniversary of his government, the CM said: “You will know about the ensuing developments.” Union minister for law and parliamentary affairs Prahlad Joshi, among the frontrunners to replace Yediyurappa, arrived in Bengaluru from Dharwad on Sunday and later cancelled his flight ticket to New Delhi. While this fuelled speculation of a likely change in leadership, state mines and geology minister Murgush Nirani, another contender, landed in New Delhi. BJP national general secretary CT Ravi, who is also in the race for the CM’s post, said in Goa that the party had given Yediyurappa “all kinds of opportunities” and added that the party has many deserving candidates, suggesting a change was imminent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/waiting-for-leaderships-signal-on-my-future-as-cm-b-s-yediyurappa/articleshow/84742735.cms||---

As a result, payout due to Covid-19 claims is likely to exceed the insurance claims of other ailments in the first quarter of the current fiscal. Insurance companies have already settled claims of more than Rs 16,000 crore due to Covid and the numbers are still rising, according to industry executives. “As an industry, we had 10 lakh claims in the first quarter of this year, which is the same as the number of claims for the whole of last year. The claims are close to the provisions that we had made last year,” said Ritesh Kumar, MD & CEO, HDFC Ergo General Insurance. He added that if his company’s experience was anything to go by, 25% of the claims were yet to come in. According to PolicyBazaar health insurance head Amit Chhabra, in the first wave of the pandemic, claims for Covid treatment were a third of the total health claims. This dropped to 31% as the first wave ebbed in the December quarter even as the share of private treatment increased. Before the second wave hit, there was a sharp drop in Covid hospitalisation cases and a rise in elective procedures, which resulted in the share of Covid claims dropping to 14%. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, Covid claims are expected to be more than 50%. Even now claims are coming in for reimbursement for hospitalisation and domiciliary treatment. Another reason for the increase in Covid claims during the first quarter is the drop in other ailments due to the lockdown. “There are fewer accidents. Eating out drops, so chances of contracting infectious diseases also drop and elective surgeries like cataract and knee replacement are postponed,” said Chhabra. On the other hand, Covid has led to growing demand for health insurance. Premium collected for health insurance has jumped to 58,572 crore in FY21 from Rs 51,674 crore in FY20. As insurers learn to live with Covid claims, they are devising health insurance products keeping it in mind. A key aspect of Covid is that consumables form a large portion of the hospital bills, which are not covered under standard health policies. Insurers are now designing policies that cover consumables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-19-claims-to-exceed-50-of-q1-health-payouts-16000-crore-cleared/articleshow/84742731.cms||Mayur Shetty

Police identified the deceased as Vallichatti Bhavani, 28, of Hyderabad, a software engineer working in the UK. The SUV (TN01 BK 8632), with Yashika Aannand at the wheel, was coming to Chennai from Mamallapuram. Bhavani was in the front passenger seat and two men, their friends, were in the rear. Around 11.50pm, as they were nearing Soolerikadu on the East Coast Road, Yashika allegedly lost control of the vehicle which broke through an iron railing on the side of the road and plunged into a pit. A few passersby including motorists rushed to the spot and sent the four to the nearest hospital. Bhavani had died on the spot and was declared brought dead at the hospital, police said. After being provided initial treatment, the others were shifted to a private hospital on Greams Road where they are undergoing treatment. While Yashika suffered injuries to the neck and a fracture to the hip, the two men escaped with minor injuries. The body of Bhavani, who had suffered severe head injuries, was sent for a postmortem to the Chengalpet government hospital. The Mamallapuram police registered a case and are investigating. After initial inquiries, police said that Bhavani had come to the city from the UK four days ago. She visited her friends on Saturday and the four including Yashika Aannand decided to visit Mamallapuram to look at the sculptures and the monuments and also played on the beach. They had come to the shore town around 6am. Since Bhavani had to take a flight back to the UK on Sunday, they decided to return in the night itself to Chennai, when the accident took place. The rear part of the vehicle was completely damaged. The Mamallapuram police registered a case of rash driving and causing death due to negligence. Police said an examination had confirmed that that the actor was not drunk at the time but could have lost control while speeding. A further probe is on in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/actor-yashika-injured-in-accident-1-dead/articleshow/84742978.cms||---

The gang also attacked two women and a man before escaping. Raghu, the man the gang wanted, managed to escape. The deceased was identified as Senthil, Raghu’s brother. The incident took place when at least 20 people had gathered at the house to observe the 13th day ritual of Raghu’s deceased father.  Around 11.30pm, several family members were talking under a shamiana when a country bomb was hurled inside the compound wall.  Within a couple of minutes, the 10 men entered. While most of the men managed to run away, the gang members began attacking two women, asking them about Raghu’s whereabouts. Police said Raghu was involved in two murders including that of a man named Prabhakaran in 2013. In 2014, to avenge Prabhakaran’s killing, the gang hacked Raghu’s elder brother Saravanan to death. Two weeks ago, Raghu’s father died and the rituals were in progress on Saturday. The 10 men who entered the premises after knowing that Raghu had come to attend the ritual saw him scaling a wall and escaping.  His brother Senthil, an autorickshaw driver, came out on hearing the noise and saw the women and others being attacked. He tried to run away but in vain as the gang encircled him at a dead-end of the street. They hacked him with machetes and smashed his face with huge stones to ensure he was dead. They later escaped on their bikes. Senthil’s wife, his daughter and her husband suffered injuries and are now in hospital. The Kancheepuram police registered a case. Senthil’s body was sent to a government hospital for post-mortem and a hunt was launched for the killers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gang-attacks-home-of-murder-accused-kills-his-elder-brother/articleshow/84742987.cms||---

While pointedly offering to “share its experiences” on issues related to human rights, the government said such issues were universal and extended beyond “a particular national or cultural perspective”. Giving out India’s own laundry list of issues that the government plans to raise with Blinken, official sources said this would include the implications of the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, need for sustained pressure on Pakistan to check terror-financing and resumption of international air travel. “As a long-standing pluralistic society, India is open to engaging those who now recognise the value of diversity,” said a government source, while spelling out the agenda for talks with Blinken. The remarks indicate that India would have its own take on any “conversations “ the US may consider on the subject. The Biden administration has been consistent in speaking out on issues related to human rights while not allowing it to come in the way of bilateral cooperation with India. Most recently, after the death in custody of Jesuit priest and tribal rights activist Stan Swamy, the state department called upon all governments to respect the "vital role of human rights activists in healthy democracies”. After his visit to India in March this year, secretary of defence Lloyd Austin had said he had raised issues related to the rights of India’s minority communities in his meetings with foreign minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh. However, while there was no official denial by India, senior government sources had said the same evening that there was no such discussion and that human rights and values were mentioned only as shared attributes. Official sources said India attached “considerable importance” to Blinken’s first visit to the country since he assumed office. “India will press for gradual resumption of international travel, while maintaining health protocols, especially easing mobility of students, professionals, business travellers, family reunions, humanitarian cases, etc. The need for resilient supply chains of critical medicines and healthcare equipment is likely to come up," said a source, adding that the two countries will also focus on Covid containment and recovery. On vaccines, India is likely to seek “open and consistent” supply chains for materials and items required for vaccine production. Discussions on deepening Quad engagement will also be a key focus area with plans for a foreign ministerial Quad meeting later this year. The US is also planning a Quad summit this year. Officials said India will also take forward Quad vaccine initiative to enable supply of vaccines produced in India from early 2022 to countries in Indo-Pacific region. “Two sides will also exchange assessments about the Indo-Pacific region, with focus on Covid assistance, economic slowdown and security scenario. Latest developments pertaining to West Asia and Central Asia area also likely to be covered,” said a source. “India will also engage with the US on other global issues. Political and cultural rebalancing are important trends. India supports a truly multipolar, democratic and diverse world order and expects international conversations to reflect this evolution. We believe in equity and fairness, whether in development, climate change or global decision-making,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-pushes-back-against-us-human-rights-discourse/articleshow/84743336.cms||Sachin Parashar

Flood and landslide deaths across the state rose to 149 while 64 were still missing. CM Uddhav Thackeray visited some of the affected parts and learnt that the locals were still asking for food, water, medicines and fodder for animals. “There is massive shortage of food and water for the locals,” Rajendra Shinde, a Chiplun (Ratnagiri) resident, said. “Doctors are unavailable but the administration is claiming arrival of medical teams. Even muddy roads have not been cleaned.” Amid the chaos, there was confusion over the number of missing too, as the Mantralaya control room figure of 64 was contradicted by the CM’s office, which counted 100 people as missing in the 72 hours till Sunday evening. The Mantralaya control room said 35 of the total 64 missing were from the worst affected Raigad district, where 60 people died. A landslide in Taliye village of Raigad following incessant rain on Thursday was the major killer, claiming 53 persons. The missing figure in Taliye was 31. With 45 houses destroyed, survivors were complaining about lack of food, water and medical help. Tribals of Taliye in Mahad taluka, said an earthquake 14 years ago had resulted in a crack in a hillock, causing the latest landslide, but authorities did not confirm the claim. “No tremor related crack record is available in the administration records,” Raigad additional SP Sachin Gunjal said. An official said most of the missing would be cases of people buried in landslides or washed away in the flood waters. Another official said the rescue operations had not stopped, with NDRF, SDRF, army, navy and coast guard teams still at work in affectd districts. A total of 2,29,074 people have evacuated from their homes in Konkan region and the western part of the state — 1,200 of these were from Ratnagiri, 1,000 from Raigad, 1,271 from Sindhudurg and 1,69,998 from Sangli among other places. “A one-and-a-half-year-old child is still missing at the landslide site in Chiplun,” inspector Ram Yadav of the NDRF said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-rain-toll-hits-149-64-still-missing/articleshow/84743788.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Techie wife finds man’s profile on gay dating apps||BENGALURU: A software engineer in Bengaluru has sought divorce after she found her husband’s profile on two gay dating apps, reports Petlee Peter. She claimed that they had not consummated their marriage of three years and that he had misled her about his sexual orientation. In June 2018, Shalini (name changed), working at a tech major in Bengaluru, tied the knot with Vikram (name changed), an employee of a leading private bank. The alliance was arranged by the elders. This was the 31-year-old man’s second marriage. The couple started residing in Jayanagar after the wedding, but things weren’t rosy for 28-year-old Shalini. Vikram apparently kept away from her, stating that he was struggling with the fact that his first wife had cheated on him. “He shied away from her most of the time, claiming he was heartbroken, and later started to cook up stories, including that he didn’t receive enough dowry,” said a counsellor attached to Parihar, Family Counselling Centre (Women’s Helpline), Basavanagudi police station, who handled the case last month. On some occasions, the banker drove her away and made some accusations about her. “During last year’s lockdown, she saw him glued to his cellphone and spotted a few apps. As things became worse during the work-from home period the whole of last year, the woman decided to check her husband’s phone activity,” the counsellor said. Woman alleges cheating, files complaintDuring the lockdown this year, the woman combed her husband’s handset and found that he had put up his profile on two dating apps and was chatting with partners. The woman confronted him for not showing interest in the marriage and accused him of portraying her in a bad light in front of their families to hide his sexual orientation. After the lockdown was lifted, the woman approached the women’s helpline and lodged a cheating complaint. In the counselling sessions that followed, the husband accepted that he had a profile on the apps but denied meeting anyone outside the marriage. But the woman decided to end the relationship and has now applied for divorce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hubby-on-gay-apps-wife-seeks-divorce/articleshow/84744594.cms||Petlee Peter

---||Bengaluru||67% eligible take second dose in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Of the 84.7 lakh people scheduled to receive the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Karnataka by July 23 (morning), only 67% or 56.7 lakh have been fully inoculated, reports Sunitha Rao R. The government is now making efforts to track down the remaining 33% or 27.9 lakh and administer the dose on priority. This group includes healthcare workers and frontline workers and people above 18 years of age. While the coverage varies, 11 districts have done better than the state’s average when it comes to administering the second dose. The remaining 21 districts are lagging, data as on July 20 shows. While Udupi has jabbed 90% of those eligible for the second time, Chamarajanagar has the lowest coverage at 49%. Koppal (50%), Yadgir (53%), Vijayapura (54%), Ballari (56%) and Haveri (57%), in that order, have fared better than Chamarajanagar, but still have considerable ground to cover. These districts are in contrast to BBMP, which has fully inoculated 83% of those eligible, while Bengaluru Urban district has covered 80%. “The target varies and mostly increases on a daily basis as more people who have completed 84 days after taking the first dose of Covishield and four weeks after taking Covaxin become eligible,” officials said. The state health and family welfare department admitted that there are many who are yet to turn up for the second dose of Covishield even after completing 84 days. Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka, said the state is taking steps to connect with people due for the second dose. “The priority is to administer the second dose to all those who are eligible and ensure complete immunisation,” Dr Chandrashekar said. “We are also checking through ASHA workers on the ground to inquire if first dose recipients are due for the second dose.” Confusion over intervalThere are many reasons for the relatively low second dose coverage, one of which is the government’s decision to change the interval between the doses of Covishield. This triggered confusion among some people, Dr Chandrashekar said. The second dose of Covishield vaccination must be taken within 12-16 weeks of the first dose, as per GOI guidelines. For Covaxin, the interval is 4-6 weeks. Dr Chandrashekar clarified that the Co-Win portal will accept registrations even if someone delays the second dose beyond 16 weeks. However, the vaccination data does not include many who have not received the first dose certificate, despite receiving the shot. Several district health officials TOI spoke with say many working professionals and labourers, who took the first dose in their hometowns and villages and returned to their places of employment like Bengaluru, are yet to take the second dose. “For example, some of those who took the first dose in Bagalkot have gone back to Bengaluru or to districts where they are employed. They have to be reminded that their second dose is overdue,” said Dr Anant Desai, district health officer, Bagalkot. The district has covered 59% of the target for the second dose. Infection delaysOfficials also point out that there could be cases where a person contracted the infection after taking the first dose. In such cases, they can take the second dose only after three months from the time they tested positive. “In most cases, the infection would not have been severe because of protection offered through the first dose,” an official said. “There have also been cases of people succumbing to Covid despite taking the first dose. However, that would be a very small portion of the 33% who are due for the second dose.” Back at workAnother official said, now that restrictions have been lifted, most of the working class are back at work and there are concerns about taking the dose on working days. “We have tried to analyse why labourers are shying away from taking the second dose,” said an official from North Karnataka, who is working on conducting vaccine drives for labourers at convenient timings. “Since Sunday is a holiday, they want to take it on a Saturday evening after working hours so that they won’t have to miss work in case they develop side effects like fever.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/67-eligible-take-2nd-dose-in-state/articleshow/84744600.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||India||Govt finalises 3 tweaks for state OBC powers||NEW DELHI: Aiming to overturn the Supreme Court judgment and restore the rights of states to identify the OBCs for local purposes, the Modi government is embracing the very changes to the 102nd Constitutional amendment that it had rejected from the opposition during the parliamentary process. The Union Cabinet may clear the amendment bill this week in a sudden move that appears designed to break the opposition blockade in Parliament. It is learnt that the social justice ministry will make three changes to Article 342A, which governs the process of identification of OBCs. While Clause 1 will specify that the President will identify the OBCs in the “central list” which will be considered as backward in a state, a detailed explanatory note to Clause 2 will make it clear that “Central list” mentioned in the Clause pertains to the OBC list prepared by the Government of India for reservations in the services under the GOI. The difference between “central list” and “Central list” is to clarify that the former refers to what has till now been called the “State list”. To stress the point, a new Clause 3 is being added to underline that every state can prepare its list of OBCs for reservation in the state government jobs. Ironically, these were roughly the suggestions given by the opposition parties during the tortuous debate in Parliament on 102nd amendment in 2017-18. While the government had rejected them, they were flagged by the Supreme Court in its May 5 judgement where it ruled that the 342A implies that only the Centre can identify the backwards for the Central list as well as the state lists. The SC judgement denuding the states of their power to identify the OBCs for local reservations, as had been the case since 1993 when Mandal reservations came into force, triggered a major controversy. Sources said the proposed Clause 3 will also negate the SC interpretation that 102nd amendment implies there will be a “single list”. Mentioned by three judges, it is seen as ordering that both the Central and State lists be merged to form one consolidated list. As reported by TOI, it has created uncertainty and the national commission for sub-categorisation of OBCs sought clarity on the issue, arguing it can’t move forward with its task till the meaning of “single list” was determined. Arguing for the Constitutional amendment post-SC judgment, the Centre says it is necessary “to protect the federal structure of the country and to empower the state governments to maintain state list of OBCs”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-finalises-3-tweaks-for-state-obc-powers/articleshow/84744639.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Sources in Congress said the move, which has been talked about for a long time now, is primarily to adjust members of the Pilot faction in the state government to end the uncertainty and bring focus back on governance. Following the Punjab experience, the Congress brass is concerned that it has to improve the image of the government to make it attractive for new voters in future elections, sources said. There is a feeling that CM Ashok Gehlot has dragged his feet on the ministerial reshuffle despite nudges from the AICC, and it is being viewed as upmanship on his part. The party has to manage a delicate balancing act as there are few vacancies against which it has to adjust the Pilot faction, Independents, BSP defectors and some loyal party MLAs. While sources said the basic formula has been frozen, AICC general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan, Ajay Maken said in Jaipur on Sunday that Congress leaders in Rajasthan have unanimously decided that a final call on the reshuffle of the state cabinet will be taken by the party’s central leadership. Maken will be visiting Jaipur again on July 28 and 29 for final consultations with party legislators and leaders. Maken and AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal reached Jaipur on Saturday night and held discussions with CM Ashok Gehlot. They also met party executive members and MLAs present in Jaipur. Pilot also attended the meeting. Pilot supporters raised slogans outside the PCC office as soon as Maken and Venugopal reached there and while they left the party office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajasthan-cabinet-rejig-likely-soon-sachin-pilot-may-be-shifted-out/articleshow/84744649.cms||---

An academic herself, Turnell’s wife Ha Vu has posted her appeal on Facebook, where she said the Myanmar state administration has issued an order saying that prisoners will be released due to dangers of Covid in prison. “Please, I beg you, let my husband, Sean Turnell, be released now. He has not been vaccinated so is at grave risk if he catches Covid, especially due to his personal medical history,” she has written. Ha has written that she does not wish this illness on anyone, the generals or their families or anyone else, as it is a terrible disease and the same be considered for Turnell’s family. “Insein is increasingly becoming a dangerous place with reported deaths caused by Covid-19. I'm begging you to let Sean go home to Australia,” she said. She has added that if this is not possible, Turnell be released and kept under house arrest. “Sean is a law-binding citizen, he will not run away from you and will only leave your country with your permission,” she said. Turnell’s lawyers said the prosecution needs him for the Official Secrets Act case against Aung San Suu Ki and so it is better to keep him alive. “I plead you to accept my request, a request from a desperate wife worrying sick about her husband’s health,” Ha said. So far, all efforts by the Australian government and the wider community have failed to secure Turnell’s release. A well respected and liked academic who specialises in trade and development and has written well received books on subjects like the Chettiars in Burma, Turnell has been a long-time advisor of Aung San Suu Ki.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/jailed-by-myanmar-junta-oz-economist-faces-covid-risk/articleshow/84744745.cms||---
---||India||Thousands of building plans approved by ‘fake’ architects in UP ‘map scam’||MEERUT: For any building to come up in Uttar Pradesh, a map — like a blueprint or a house plan — has to be approved by an architect. This is done online. But earlier this month, an architects’ body in Meerut found an anomaly — they had approved 20 maps between April and July 2 this year but the platform showed 56 had been ratified. The trail led to what appears to be a map scam — thousands of illegitimate approvals were given out allegedly by development authority workers posing as architects for anywhere between Rs 25,000 and Rs 2 lakh each. And the network, architects said, is spread across the state. In March last year, the state government revamped the Uttar Pradesh Online Building Plan Approval System Portal to take the process online and minimise human intervention — building maps could be created, checked and uploaded on the platform. But there were two loopholes. To use the platform, all one needed was an architect’s registration number. The other requirement was that of a phone number. But since registration numbers and phone numbers are not linked, someone with just a registration number could enter their own phone number and get an OTP to log in. Another glaring gap allowed an architect to log in with more than one ID. So, an impostor could generate a new ID for an architect and use that to gain access. That is what happened to an Azamgarh-based architect who found 144 approvals had been given out in Meerut using his name with a second ID created by an impostor. “When we got in touch with him, he said he had not sanctioned even one building map over the past year,” president of Meerut Architects’ Association Ankit Agarwal told TOI. “Our estimate is that at least 800 maps were approved illegally … Even the best architects here would not have approved more than 30 maps in a year.” Soon after the Meerut cases, many others came forward. An architect from Meerut, Anil Kumar Mehra, 75, discovered that his ID was being used in Hapur’s Pilkhuwa Development Authority. “I have given an affidavit saying I have nothing to do with the approval of maps issued in Hapur and requested that the maps be cancelled,” he said. Another from Lucknow, Jitender Tripathi, stumbled upon his ID being in the Gorakhpur Development Authority. “Dozens of maps were falsely approved using my name. It’s a faulty system that’s being abused. It’s ruining our reputation,” he said. After the operations were flagged, UP’s chief town and country planner Anoop Srivastava asked all development authorities in the state to file FIRs wherever these map scams were reported.“All vice chairpersons of development authorities have been asked to look into the matter after the state’s senior urban planning officials met in Lucknow,” he told TOI. “So far, 18 such IDs fraudulently created or used have been identified … We are trying to plug the platform loopholes by introducing digital signatures and linking them to Aadhaar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/thousands-of-building-plans-approved-by-fake-architects-in-up-map-scam/articleshow/84744803.cms||Sandeep Rai

The claims were made in a video, now available on social media, in which the fugitive separatist leader backs Union minister of state John Barla’s statement on separate statehood for north Bengal. The FIR says the purported video was released last week. The STF said it was trying to ascertain the source of the video. Though Singha is known to have threatened local north Bengal TMC leaders in the past, this is the first time he has spoken out against CM Banerjee directly. Among those who received threats from Singha are Cooch Behar TMC president Parthapratim Roy and former forest minister Binoy Krishna Burman. Singha was arrested in 1999 but released soon after by Assam police to force his KLO cadre to surrender. He has been a fugitive ever since.

The court also acquitted two others, who were awarded life imprisonment in the same case. The final hearing on their appeal took place on Friday. The division bench of justices Ashwani Kumar Singh and Arvind Srivastava observed that police had not bothered to visit the crime spot and submitted that the girl’s body had been recovered on the confessional statement of death sentence convict Balwant Singh. The body could have been recovered much earlier, it said. Additional public prosecutor (HC) Abhimanyu Sharma said the bench set aside the Pocso court order awarding capital punishment to Balwant in 2019. “It also set aside the life imprisonment order to the two other convicts, Chotu Singh and Anand Pandey,” he said. The bench observed that the prosecution miserably failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellants. The girl’s father had lodged an FIR against Balwant, Chotu and another unknown person on February 5, 2018, alleging that his daughter had been gang-raped and killed by the trio. Police first filed chargesheet against Balwant on May 3, 2018, and a supplementary chargesheet against the other two on September 20, 2018. The HC also found contradictions in the statements of the victim’s father, the investigating officer and the witnesses. It observed that the kidnapping took place on January 31 and body was recovered on February 5 after which an FIR was lodged. But there was no reasonable explanation about the delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-acquits-man-on-death-row-says-cops-didnt-visit-crime-spot/articleshow/84744928.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Cases were booked against TRS general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Banda Prakash, a resident of Warangal, on the charges of misappropriation of over Rs 12.2 lakh funds of Alluri Trust which runs the popular Alluri Institute of Management Sciences in Hanamkonda. Though the cases were booked on July 23, the whole issue came to light on Sunday. A Police inspector said the complainant, J Bhaskar Reddy, alleged that Prakash was involved in misappropriation of funds in the institution with two chartered accountants. Bhaskar charged the TRS MP of having filed false income tax returns colluding with chartered accountants Attaluri Satyanarayana and Attaluri Vamseedhar in the year 2016-17 and 2017-18 and committing a fraud of Rs 12.2 lakhs. Prakash, who is in Delhi to attend the monsoon session of the Parliament, told TOI over phone: “It’s a baseless allegation. The case was filed with ulterior motives. He (complainant Bhaskar) wants a position in the Trust. I was totally unaware that the case was filed in the court. Even the police did not inform me as courtesy that cases have been booked against me,” he said. “I am the secretary of the Alluri Trust. The father of complainant Bhaskar was a member of the trust. We have genuine reasons to reject the demand of Bhaskar to be on the Trust,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/police-book-trs-rajya-sabha-mp-for-swindling-education-trust-funds/articleshow/84744972.cms||Roushan Ali

The high court’s order came while hearing a plea filed by the Enforcement Directorate challenging a trial court’s order directing it to supply a copy of the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) to RJD Rajya Sabha MP Amarendra Dhari Singh, arrested in a money laundering case related to an alleged fertilizer scam. Justice Mukta Gupta issued notice and asked Singh to respond to the plea by the ED seeking to set aside the trial court’s July 15 order. “In the meantime, an affidavit of the director, Enforcement Directorate will be filed on record indicating the status of the ECIR in an investigation carried on by the petitioner (ED) and whether the same is merely a number or records some substantive information therein for the petitioner to start the investigation thereon prior to filing of the complaint case,” the judge said. The HC said that the affidavit will also indicate as to once a person is arrested how the grounds of arrest are informed to the arrested person in terms of the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. Additional solicitor general S V Raju, representing theEnforcement Directorate , contended that there is no specific power with the special judge of the trial court under the CrPC to pass directions to the agency to supply the copy of the ECIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-to-ed-how-is-a-person-informed-about-grounds-of-his-arrest/articleshow/84744995.cms||---

From Rs 24,700 crore in 2014-15, the allocation has increased to Rs 1.17 lakh crore in 2021-22, an increase of 448%. The road transport and highways ministry told Lok Sabha last week that the annual average construction of NH in the past seven years was 9,000 km and on an average, works were awarded for widening and construction of 10,781 km of NHs. It said 41 projects costing around Rs 26,500 crore have been delayed due to several reasons, including non-availability of land and financial inability of contractors. The data also shows that the highways ministry resumed notifying NHs after putting a brief break in 2019-20. In fact, in the past 10 years, declaration of NHs touched the lowest in 2019-20 when barely 495 km of state roads were converted to NHs. But in 2020-21, it increased to 5,381 km. The conversion of state roads to NHs has always been seen as a political achievement, both by the Centre and states. The data accessed since 2011-12 shows that the maximum length of 13,085 km of state roads were notified as NHs in 2016-17 and another 12,503 km was added to the NH network in 2017-18. In the subsequent two years, this fell to 6,174 km and 495 km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/4-fold-increase-in-fund-allocation-for-highway-development-in-8-years/articleshow/84745031.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||Medical students oppose draft rules on fixing of stipend||Medical students are disappointed by the proposed rules on fixation of stipend amount for MBBS interns. Instead of paying stipend on par with what is paid to MBBS interns in state government medical colleges, the National Medical Commission has proposed that stipend be fixed by the fee fixation committee of the respective state or university. The draft regulation for compulsory rotating internship put out by the NMC states: “All interns shall be paid stipend as fixed by the appropriate fee fixation authority as applicable to the institution /university/state”. Medical students and public health activists pointed out that this was vague and gave ample opportunity for private medical college managements to deny stipend to MBBS interns. Federation of All India Medical Associations founding chairperson Dr Manish Jangra stated that even before this proposed regulation, many private colleges paid stipend partially or fully only on paper. “This new draft regulation will lead to further uncertainty,” said Jangra. On the subject of medical interns and their compulsory rotatory residential internship (CRRI) period, four Lok Sabha MPs asked on July 23 whether there is exploitation of young doctors in the country with minimal pay, which would affect their career. Bharati Pravin Pawar, junior health minister, replied: “Health being a state subject, the concerned state decides the salary and allowances for the doctors working in the public health facilities. Therefore, no such information is maintained centrally.” The Board of Governors (BOG) of the Medical Council of India after it had taken over in October 2018 had proposed to include a provision in the Regulations on Graduate Medical Education which stated: “All the candidates pursuing compulsory rotating internship at the institution from which MBBS course was completed, shall be paid stipend on par with the stipend being paid to the interns of the State Govt. Medical Institution / Central Government Medical Institution in the state/UT where the institution is located.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/medical-students-oppose-draft-rules-on-fixing-of-stipend/articleshow/84744993.cms||---

Even in the Indian Navy, very few are privy to its flight path and mission objectives. Despite being a tad shorter than the lethal MiG-29K, the dull grey Dornier Do-228 lives up to its moniker ‘Cobra’ as it hunts and tracks down its prey. Inducted in 1991, the Dorniers continue to play an immense role in reconnaissance and surveillance for the Indian Navy and military intelligence, which is why the naval squadron’s services were requisitioned by the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army in 1999 for Operation Vijay. The Dorniers of INAS 310, known as the Cobras, were not always grey. The short-range surveillance aircraft, which typically fly over open seas, sported a blue and white paint scheme. This changed during the Kargil conflict when a detachment of three Dorniers from INAS 310 were deployed at the forward operating base at Naliya, Gujarat, which is just 80km from the Indo-Pak border. Base officials realised that at night the blue and white aircraft were a dead giveaway on darkened runways. The first sortie was launched on the night of May 24, 1999, and over the next few days the Dorniers pin pointed Pakistani ground radars at Karachi, Lahore, early warning radars along the Indo-Pak border, troops and other potential targets. From May till July 1999, the Dorniers flew clandestine, secretive missions gathering intelligence and information about enemy movement. The Kargil conflict was the first time that the Dorniers, with their 360 degree radar and sensors, were deployed for information warfare on land. “Initially, the Navy wanted to apply pressure on Islamabad by creating a maritime blockade and the Dorniers were meant to determine the surface assets, movement of commercial cargo, but as the Army and the Indian Air Force realised the technological capabilities, they requested for the Dorniers to fly right up to Rajasthan and even further north so that the Army and the IAF could plan their attacks on these radars or jam them,” said Commodore R Seshadri Vasan (retd), who as the chief of staff operations at southern naval command had a ringside view of the Navy’s role in the Kargil conflict. The Dornier had sophisticated Israeli sensors that could pick up transmissions and identify their location. The real-time intelligence was a pleasant surprise for the Indian Army HQ, which quickly asked the Cobras to fly close to the Indo-Pak border to snoop on enemy troops. “The Dorniers would fly low, sometimes at 500ft, to collect information about Pakistani warships, troop movement along the international border, radar stations, missile batteries and other signal intelligence,” said Captain (retd) Viriato Fernandes, who was a senior air technical officer at Kochi with the INAS 550 squadron. Fernandes, who was awarded the Vijay Star for being part of Operation Vijay, rued the lack of awareness about the Navy’s “silent service”. He misses no chance to encourage Goan youth to join the Navy. Between May 24 and July 30, 1999, the squadron flew 174 missions in a dangerous environment for a total of 357 hours while collecting information for the Navy, Army and the Air Force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/remembering-kargil-when-cobras-played-cat-mouse/articleshow/84743099.cms||Newton Sequeira

His supporters were also confined to a hotel where Sahani was to address a press conference in the evening. Varanasi police told them that the weekend lockdown was still in force in Uttar Pradesh and any gathering would violate Section 144 of CrPC imposed in the state on the weekend. Sahani had reached Varanasi from Delhi to participate in the ‘Shahadat Diwas’ programme of former MP late Phoolan Devi in Ram Nagar area of the city. On July 22, the police had seized the statue of Phoolan, which was to be unveiled at the Ram Nagar function on Sunday. The police also removed the posters put up all over the way to the airport and in some parts of the city to welcome the VIP chief, who calls himself the ‘Son of Mallah’ and plans to field his party candidates in over 150 constituencies in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due early next year. Sahani, who was brought to the NDA fold in Bihar by BJP just before the state assembly elections last year, told the media that he would not be bullied by anyone. “We believe in struggle and have a long way to go,” said Sahani, who has been demanding reservations for his Nishad community and planning to make it a poll plank in the UP elections. “The police action was unwarranted. Police said Sahani’s public appearance could create law and order problems and detained our supporters at the airport. We were following the rules,” VIP national spokesperson Rajeev Mishra told TOI over phone from Varanasi on Sunday evening. Sahani wanted to return to Bihar by road but police asked him to return by a flight, he added. Mishra said the VIP has identified 160 assembly seats with a sizeable Nishad population in UP. “We want Nishads to be included on the list of scheduled castes, like in Delhi and West Bengal. Our slogan is ‘No reservations for Nishads, no alliance’,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sahani-detained-at-airport-in-varanasi/articleshow/84738091.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

NHRC found 18 of these tribes were not included in the final list issued by the government. The order followed a complaint by one Mohit Tanwar, who claimed 18 denotified tribes were unable to receive government benefits as they were not issued caste certificate and other documents. In the initial response to NHRC, state chief secretary said the government did not receive any complaint on non-issuance of caste certificates. “Eleven castes were denotified in 1961 and another 18 were denotified in 1962. The list of denotified tribes includes 14 from Scheduled Castes, nine from other backward castes and six other castes. All benefits, including reservation are being given to these 29 denotified tribes. Concerned district magistrates have been instructed to issue caste certificate vide government order of October 24, 2017. No complaint has been received and no discrimination has been done,” the chief secretary stated. NHRC, however, called it a “misleading report that concealed facts” and directed the principal secretary of social welfare department to submit a clarification. “The report is contrary to documents produced by the complainant. The contention is that the state government issued an order wherein only 11 tribes have been shown as denotified, whereas remaining 18 castes classified as denotified in 1962 have been excluded from the order and they are being deprived of benefits,” the NHRC order states. It also referred to a letter dated November 13, 2020, by the director, SC/ST Research & Training Institute, Lucknow, in which additional statistics officer has put on record that 18 castes denotified in 1962 have not been included in the list of denotified tribes and requested issue of a fresh order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nhrc-seeks-govt-reply-on-non-issuance-of-caste-certificates-to-18-denotified-tribes/articleshow/84743767.cms||Neha Lalchandani

According to the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles, the e-two wheeler category which sold 1,43,000 units in FY20-21, sold a mere 25,000 units in Q1 of this fiscal due to the Covid induced second wave lockdown. But in the nearly five weeks since the new subsidies made mid-range and premium e-two wheelers like the Hero Optima, Okinawa Praise Pro and Ather 450X and the Ampere Magnus and Zeal cheaper by Rs 18,000-Rs 20,000, the creamy layer of the market has seen a boom. Dealer estimates say the market has hit around 18,000 units in the last four weeks alone with the trend looking to continue.  “The entry level low range scooters, which earlier comprised 60% of the market, have seen their demand dry up. The mid range and premium segment have seen demand double. We expect the e-two wheeler segment to close this fiscal with 2.5 lakh units riding on this,” said Sohinder Gill, director-general SMEV. The reason for the shift in the market is that the new subsidies have made scooters which were in the range of Rs 75,000-Rs 80,000 hit the sub-Rs 50,000 price bracket. Consumers therefore have lost interest in the lower range products which don’t come under the subsidy. With states announcing subsidies one by one — Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan have announced recently — this trend will accelerate, say EV marketers. “sold 5,860 scooters in June, 80% of which were high-speed scooters with a major chunk coming from top-end Praise Pro. We have been receiving a two fold increase in enquiries in showrooms and highest sales have come from Madya and Bengaluru in Karnataka, Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, Nellore in AP and Pune in Maharashtra,” Okinawa’s MD Jeetender Sharma said his company,” he added. In the last one week, top two wheeler companies like Bajaj and TVS have announced ambitious plans of setting up EV plants. Nor is the rush restricted to two wheelers alone. Tata Motors is witnessing a similar surge in its electric cars as well. “We have seen such a sharp rise in bookings for Nexon EV that we are in discussion with suppliers to be able to produce enough to cater to this surge,” said Shailesh Chandra, president PVBU, Tata Motors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ev-sales-surge-on-subsidies-rising-fuel-cost/articleshow/84740097.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Civic officials said once the numbers come in, a requisition could be placed before the state health department for vaccine doses to inoculate them. “We started the door-to-door survey last week, engaging our frontline health workers to find out the number of residents, and the age groups, that are yet to get the first dose,” said BMC board of administrators member Pranay Roy, who heads the civic body’s health department. Officials said, according to estimates, BMC has administered about 75,000 doses combining those who have taken only the first dose and those who have received their second shots. “According to estimates, another 50,000 doses have been administered by the Bidhannagar sub-divisional hospital and about 1.5 lakh doses have been given by the private hospitals in the BMC area. This means nearly 2.7 lakh doses have been administered combining all the BMC centres, Bidhannagar SD Hospital and private hospitals. Of these, there should be around 50,000 who have received double doses,” said a BMC official. Many of the blocks in Salt Lake had tied up with private hospitals and conducted paid vaccination camps at community halls. Most of the primary health centres had to be shut due to shortage of vaccine, but BMC officials said they have been vaccinating frontline workers, hawkers and street vendors, and several wards have been organising vaccination camps to administer the second dose. Covid numbers in the BMC area are currently low. Around eight to 12 new cases are reported on an average every day in BMC, but there have been no Covid-related deaths reported in the past week, officials said. However, BMC has the most number of micro-containment zones among all civic bodies in North 24 Parganas. As of Sunday, there are 19 micro-containment zones in BMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/survey-starts-in-bidhannagar-to-compile-no-shot-data/articleshow/84740982.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Business||Covid to top insurance claims in Q1||MUMBAI: Even as the second wave of Covid ebbs, claims continue to pour in for health insurance companies. As a result, payout due to Covid claims is likely to exceed the insurance claims of other ailments in the first quarter of the current fiscal. Insurance companies have already settled claims of more than Rs 16,000 crore due to Covid and the numbers are still rising, according to industry executives. Bhargav Dasgupta, MD & CEO, ICICI Lombard General Insurance in an analyst call said that the second wave impacted the affluent class having better insurance. “Covid claims are significantly higher and the reporting tail is longer. Even as the number of cases came down, moderate and critical cases had substantially increased,” he said. ICICI Lombard has increased prices for group health insurance following higher claims. “As an industry, we had 10 lakh claims in the first quarter of this year, which is the same as the number of claims for the whole of last year. The claims are close to the provisions that we had made last year,” said Ritesh Kumar, MD & CEO, HDFC Ergo General Insurance. He added that if his company’s experience was anything to go by, 25% of the claims were yet to come in. According to PolicyBazaar health insurance head Amit Chhabra, in the first wave of the pandemic, claims for Covid treatment were a third of total health claims. This dropped to 31% as the first wave ebbed in the December quarter even as the share of private treatment increased. Before the second wave hit, there was a sharp drop in Covid hospitalisation cases and a rise in elective procedures, which resulted in the share of Covid dropping to 14%. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, Covid claims are expected to be more than 50%. Even now claims are coming in for reimbursement for hospitalisation and domiciliary treatment. Another reason for the increase in Covid claims during the first quarter is the drop in other ailments due to the lockdown. “There are fewer accidents. Eating out drops, so chances of contracting infectious diseases also drop and elective surgeries like cataract and knee replacement are postponed,” said Chhabra.On the other hand, Covid has led to growing demand for health insurance. Premium collected for health insurance has jumped to Rs 58,572 crore in FY21 from Rs 51,674 crore in FY20. As insurers learn to live with Covid claims, they are devising health insurance products keeping it in mind. A key aspect of Covid is that consumables form a large portion of the hospital bills, which are not covered under standard health policies. Insurers are now designing policies that cover consumables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-to-top-insurance-claims-in-q1/articleshow/84742158.cms||Mayur Shetty

According to health department sources, investigators reportedly recovered a diary where he kept records of vaccinated people to get them updated on Co-Win at the Moshut sub-primary health centre where he worked as a vaccine coordinator. Mondal may have stolen several vials and carried them in an ice box, and demanded anything between Rs 300 and Rs 1,500 for a jab, the probe revealed. But there was a time lag of more than two days as he needed the opportunity to access the authorised computer terminal to update the recipients’ details. When the recipients did not get the confirmatory message and certificate within two days, they informed the police, the probe revealed. Initial investigation also revealed Mondal followed protocol and the vaccines, in all probability, were genuine. “Though we have not got the results of the tests on the seized vials, we got corroboration from various witnesses to ascertain that the vaccines were genuine. However, Mondal was misguiding us in ascertaining the number of recipients,” said Baruipur SP Vaibav Tiwari. CMOH Somnath Mukherjee said, “We will hold a check-up camp to assess the recipients’ health. But the vaccines were genuine and the vials were in an ice box, so it is unlikely they will have adverse effects.” TOI got in touch with a woman who received a jab from Mondal. “I had all the symptoms of a post-vaccinated person. Initially, I had a fever, but now I am fine. I have also got a certificate,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-thief-carried-vials-in-ice-box/articleshow/84740957.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

The ruling party has won 47 out of 50 divisions, confining the primary opposition Telugu Desam Party to just three divisions. The BJP and Jana Sena have failed to win a single division. Shaik Noorjahan, who is the mayoral candidate from the YSRC, is likely to hold the post for the second time, having won the election with a huge majority of 1,495 votes from the 50th division. It may be recalled that YSRC won three three divisions unanimously after the completion of withdrawal time. When the elections were scheduled to be held for the remaining 47 divisions, some persons had moved the Andhra Pradesh high court, seeking to stall the polling process, alleging irregularities in the voters list. The high court had directed the State Election Commission (SEC) to conduct elections but to not count votes. Elections were held on March 10. After inquiring into the matter, the high court gave the green signal to start the counting process on May 8, making it clear that counting should be taken up by adhering to Covid-19 protocols. However, the process was stalled following the imposition of partial curfew across the state. Finally, SEC decided to count the votes on Sunday at C R Reddy Engineering College in Eluru. Meanwhile, two YSRC candidates who contested from the 45th and 46th divisions, passed away in the interim period. Sunday’s counting showed that both had won their divisions. By-elections to these two divisions are likely to be held later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ysrc-clinches-decisive-victory-in-eluru-civic-polls/articleshow/84738903.cms||Samson Raj

She was among a few students who had tied rakhi to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on August 15, 2019, at his residence and was gifted a school bag by him. Suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the muscles), a class X student of St Joseph College Pratibha Yadav didn’t give up, fought hard to overcome the physical challenges and scored 95.8% in her ICSE board results declared on Saturday. It was constant support from her constable father Tej Bahadur Yadav that motivated her not to consider herself weak. A resident of Ashok Vihar, Pratibha inspires to become a civil servant. “She is on a wheelchair and is completely dependent on her mother for routine work. Constant health issues and heavy medications had depressed her. I made her understand not to let her physical challenges overpower her mental strength. She is a bright and hardworking girl and now it’s proved from her percentage,” said a proud father Tej Bahadur. He said Pratibha was diagnosed DMD when she was 12 years old, the main symptoms of which include progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of both skeletal and heart muscle. Even to attend natures’ call she needs her mother’s support, he said and added the disease has impacted her ability to sit, stand, or walk. I am proud that without any tuition she has scored so well. I am thankful to all her teachers and schools for giving her admission and guidance, he added. “Had it been a regular examination I would have scored more. My success is not only due to my hard work alone, but also because of my teachers and parents. I aspire to be a civil servant,” Pratibha said, adding that “my success mantra was sincerity and finding positivity in every challenge. A negative mind can never concentrate well.” Pratibha’s father has appealed to private schools to support such students and shouldn’t deny their right to study. Founder manager of St Joseph College Anil Agarwal said, “She has proved the proverb right that ‘where there’s a will there’s a way’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/specially-abled-girl-who-tied-rakhi-tocm-beats-all-odds-to-score-95-8/articleshow/84743813.cms||---

The company was appointed for handling crop insurance scheme in Amravati district. Total 1,72,655 farmers in the district had availed the scheme this kharif season. Out of them, 3,291 farmers had applied for insurance claim in view of the damage caused to their crops. However, the company allegedly did not act promptly to settle the claims. Taking cognizance of this, Bhuse, who was in the district to visit places that received excessive rainfall and suffered heavy losses, went straight to the insurance company office and found that it was not established according to the set norms. He also did not receive satisfactory replies from company officers about the delay in settling the claims of the farmers. The minister ordered registering an offence against the company and also warned administration officers of action if they were found supporting or favouring the company. Around 6.98 lakh hectare land in the district is under kharif cultivation and sowing has been done in over 6.74 lakh hectare thus far. The district has received 392.50mm rainfall since June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-agriculture-min-orders-action-against-insurance-company/articleshow/84740622.cms||---

With massive water flow continuing from the upstream, it is expected that the Srisailam Project will reach FRL in the next three days. The water level has improved in the project thanks to flow from the upstream. The water level at the project had already touched 865 ft against the maximum level of 885 ft. The water reserves have also significantly improved to nearly 110tmc from just around 30-35tmc last week. With Central Water Commission (CWC) indicating that the inflows at Srisailam would continue at four lakh cusecs per day for a few more days, the project authorities anticipated that it would receive at least 150 tmc in the next three days. Interestingly, the project is left with flood cushion of just around 99 tmc. This means that at least 35-50 tmc water will go to the downstream project, Nagarjuna Sagar. Keeping in view of the fast surging water levels at Srisailam, the AP government has requested the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to allow it to go for power generation from the Right Bank Power Station. In a letter to the KRMB member secretary, engineer-in-chief C Narayana Reddy has explained the flood situation anticipated by the CWC and also the project authorities. He said that they were seeking prior permission from the KRMB for power generation as it is the authority to advise both the states during the floods and droughts with regard to the management of water. “As per the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, the successor state governments shall be responsible for managing natural calamities, while the river boards shall advise the two state governments on the management of disaster or drought or flood in the rivers of Krishna and Godavari, particularly in reference to the release of water for the management and mitigation of the natural calamities. The boards shall have the full authority to get their orders implemented by AP and Telangana promptly and effectively in respect of operation of the head works of the dams, reservoirs or head works of canals and works appurtenant there to including the hydel power projects, as notified by the Union government, on Krishna and Godavari rivers. “Keeping in view the present situation, Srisailam reservoir is going have surplus waters within three days, it is requested to allow to utilise water for power generation through Right Bank Power House by APGENCO, otherwise water will go waste over the spillway gates to nobody’s benefit,” said ENC Narayana Reddy. Telangana State Genco is continuing power generation from Left Bank power station for the past 50 days without permission from KRMB and even before the Krishna river witnessed floods in the upstream. According to AP, Telangana had already utilised 82 tmc of its share of 299tmc in the Krishna waters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/srisailam-draws-near-frl-ap-seeks-krmbs-nod-for-power-generation/articleshow/84738794.cms||Samdani MN

MMC principal Shashi Sharma said the college would award merit scholarships to all the girls who have secured gold medals or attained high ranks in 2020 PU examinations. All the 10 gold medallists and 57 rank holders of the college have been invited to the function. While the gold medallists would receive Rs5,100 each, the rank holders would be given Rs1,100 each. PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Choudhary would be the chief guest at the function, she said. Sharma said only a few guests have been invited for the occasion to maintain Covid protocols. The NAAC-accreditated college has been accorded with CPE (college with potential for excellence) status by the UGC. Quality teaching, facilities for extracurricular activities and availability of hostel accommodation (the college has 4 hostels) inside the campus makes MMC the most soughtafter institution for girls throughout the state and also from neighbouring states as well as Nepal. MMC students have not only excelled in academics, sports and music over the period but have also brought accolades to their alma mater with their extraordinary performances in software engineering and IT sectors. The alumnae of the college are holding responsible positions in many public and private sector organizations as doctors, engineers, lawyers, academicians, bankers, software developers, civil servants and politicians. An ISO-certified institution, MMC has introduced six-month certificate courses in health and dietetics and health and beauty care in its platinum jubilee year and proposes to launch various undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the forthcoming days after normalisation of the situation, said the principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mmc-gold-medallists-to-be-rewarded-today/articleshow/84737703.cms||B K Mishra

Talking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a meeting with the members of the party’s core committee here, Raj said it was wrong to blame others for the split in the party. Referring to Chirag’s ‘ashirvad yatra’, he said any political leader can take out yatra to garner support of the people and strengthen his outfit’s support base. “He is doing what he thinks is politically correct,” he added. Raj also refuted Chirag’s allegations that Paras stabbed him in the back. “What Paras uncle did at that moment was the need of the hour,” the Samastipur MP said. Asked about his views on caste-based census, Raj said the Centre should do so in the larger interest of the masses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-should-introspect-prince/articleshow/84738127.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||NGT takes note of Kolkata’s rising NO2 pollution issue||KOLKATA: The eastern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) of Justice B Amit Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Dasgupa (expert member) was keen to hear the case of the rise in nitrogen dioxide pollution in Kolkata after green activist Subhas Datta brought a TOI report to their notice. The report quoted the Greenpeace study which raised an alarm on the rise of NO2 pollution in eight capital cities, includ-ing Kolkata. Datta said the NGT showed extraordinary keenness to address the pending cases related to the city’s environmental degradation, particularly air pollution. “The phasing out of old vehicles and building of proper infrastructure for measuring the pollution level of BS-VI vehicles is absolutely necessary. The fire at legacy dump sites in and around the city is a major source of air pollution. This is why I raised the unresolved issues of the city’s environmental degradation, including the absence of proper bioremediation of the legacy dumpsite at Dhapa. The use of three trommels for biomining seems highly inadequate for the purpose," he said. A recent analysis of the impact of vehicular emissions on air quality was carried out by Switch ON, an NGO, studying the changes in the patterns of NO2 concentrations, which can be attributed to fuel combustion in vehicles. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of NO2 may contribute to asthma and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections like COPD and breathing discomfort, among others. Average NO2 concentrations on weekdays were found to be higher than on public holidays; five times higher in 2018, two times higher in 2019 and three times higher in 2020. Average NO2 concentrations on weekdays in 2018 and 2019 were up to 57% times higher than on Sundays. NO2 concentrations on weekdays were almost two-three times more than the national standard over the last three years, the study found. This indicated that NO2 has impacted the air quality severely on weekdays as compared to public holidays and Sundays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ngt-takes-note-of-citys-rising-no2-pollution-issue/articleshow/84740681.cms||---
---||Patna||District bar association alleges violation of rules in appointment of special PPs||PATNA: The Patna District Bar Association has moved the high court over alleged violation of rules in appointing special public prosecutors. The association is aggrieved that the state government was appointing special public prosecutors from the cadre of prosecuting officers like assistant, sub-divisional or district prosecuting officer, which are regular appointments as per Bihar Prosecution Manual. The special public prosecutors are appointed only after minimum 10 years of practice and on 3-year contract as per CrPC. In its writ petition, the association has urged that the special public prosecutors be appointed in accordance with the provision explained in Section 24(8) of CrPC. The association has also urged that government be restrained from appointing any other person from the cadre posts other than a practising lawyer as a special public prosecutor or prosecutors for special courts in the state. It has mentioned that APOs, SDPOs or DPOs are not practising advocates and they are getting regular payscale. The association has also highlighted some cases of appointments. In the petition, the association has alleged that the authorities are misusing the government resolution dated November 8, 2012 to fill up 50% posts of PPs or APPs from cadres of APOs, SDPOs or DPOs for conducting sessions trials. Counsel Gajendra Kumar Jha, representing the association in the high court, said the prosecution officers are not practising lawyers. “The petition was filed on July 22. I will try to mention it for early hearing as soon as the writ petition number is allocated,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/district-bar-association-alleges-violation-of-rules-in-appointment-of-special-pps/articleshow/84738258.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||‘Govt needs to act if consumption slows’||Mumbai: After two waves of Covid, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which is tackling cost headwinds, has said it will navigate a third wave as well. Armed with a portfolio of brands straddling the price and pack pyramid, HUL knows how to manage the price-value equation to retain consumers in its franchise. The FMCG major’s CMD Sanjiv Mehta said in an interview that the company’s focus remains volume-led growth. Mehta also wants HUL to deliver a modest improvement on margins — a balancing act indeed — even as he continues to “re-imagine” HUL from his home office, visiting factories and engaging with multiple stakeholders “virtually”. What Mehta, however, misses is the energy of the marketplace and the buzz of the office. While he admits there will continue to be a good balance on how organisations would work in the future, he warns against writing the obituary of the office. Excerpts: Has the resilience of rural markets surprised you? Why is the urban market taking time to recover? We should applaud the government for the intervention they did in rural India. Two-thirds of Indians live in rural India, which also has a large section of poor. The interventions in terms of MNREGA outlay, direct transfer of subsidy and free supply of food grains have been the right steps. These are some of the prime reasons why rural growth has remained resilient. Also, the first wave did not impact rural, the monsoons were decent, and the harvest was good. The per capita consumption of FMCG products in rural areas is 1/3rd that of urban. Given the low base, the growth rates in rural should consistently remain higher than urban. If it slows down, then it becomes a big concern, because that would mean that we are not lifting the poor. Growth in FMCG is in many ways reflective of the state of the economy. However, for the urban poor, there have been no interventions like direct transfer of money or free supply of food grains. The government should use technology and be able to identify the urban poor. And if economic hardships come in, they should be in a position to intervene. The more pointed and direct the intervention, the more beneficial will be the effect. Do you expect the government to come up with further incentives, given that the festive season is also around the corner? On the supply side, the government has taken series of steps including ensuring liquidity in the economy and providing support through guarantees. What remains to be done is on the demand side. Demand-side government hesitation could also stem from the thinking that if you put money directly in the hands of people, will they consume or will they save? With the rural poor, since their propensity to save is so little, they are likely to spend it all that you give them. This should also be applicable to the urban poor. FICCI had suggested the government to use consumption vouchers and that’s something which has been used in the past in other parts of the world. And importantly, consumption would also lead to more taxes. So, the net cost to the government would be less than the benefit provided to the people to spur consumption. These are some kinds of novel things the government could experiment with if consumption comes under strain. The September quarter of this year will be very important. We’ve just come out of the second wave and are moving towards normalcy. If consumption remains robust, then the government will not have to intervene more. But if consumption remains tepid, then the government will have to do some serious thinking about what further interventions are required to spur it. What are the shifts in consumption patterns that you’re seeing today? In the initial period of the pandemic, we had seen a move towards small packs and had also noticed that there were more frequent shopping trips by the poor whereas the higher income people were moving towards larger packs. We must also appreciate that in e-commerce, higher value density provides better unit economics. After that, we have not seen a very discernible change. But where the restricted mobility has impacted us, is in what we call as discretionary and out-of-home (OOH) categories — skincare, deodorants, colour cosmetics, ice cream and our food solutions business. To give you a picture, if in the June quarter of 2019, sales of these businesses put together, which are of reasonable size for us, were 100, it came down to 50% in June quarter of 2020 and in June quarter of 2021, it has moved up to 75%. It has not fully recovered yet, as it is directly linked to mobility of people. You have defended discretionary categories for their attractiveness. But does it worry you that consumers may be getting habituated to not consuming these products? No, it doesn’t worry me. It does take a knocking when mobility of people comes down but as the mobility starts to improve, we see a quick bounce back. One of the parameters we look at is penetration. Take for example skincare — I’m very happy with the improvement in penetration. These are categories which remain structurally very attractive, and we have leading positions in them. You’ve spoken about a focus on volume-led growth, but with cost pressures, would you keep a tight leash on price increases to ensure volume growth? What is the game we play as HUL? These are unprecedented times, and it will require playing the different levers of business smartly. But we play the game for the long term, and the three imperatives are — we don’t want to lose consumers or market share, we want to keep the price-value equation and we want to maintain the sanctity of our business model. That’s how we are going to play. Is naturals still a trend? Naturals is a secular trend. Our Indulekha brand both in terms of oils and shampoos is doing extremely well. On Ayush, we are focusing primarily on the southern markets. To strengthen our position in the naturals, we have launched Simple and last year we had launched Nature Protect in the Home Care categories. The naturals trend is not something which is going to go away. Do you miss the office? What’s the way forward? Innovations need collaboration. You need people to physically sit around, discuss, debate and brainstorm. The future of work is not going to be either or. There will be a good balance. All the people won’t need to come to work every day. And the crazy travel of the past will also reduce. But don’t write the obituary of the office and physical interactions. It would be a fatal mistake.One is now looking forward to physical meetings. I still do my factory visits virtually but it’s not the same. We do consumer engagements, but it’s still not a substitute for going to consumers’ homes. We would visit their kitchens and bathrooms and you can’t do all that now. It was also about being with your sales teams, working the markets, and then having a nice meal in the evening, where they would let their hair down and express themselves. One misses all of that. Patanjali has said that in five years it will overtake HUL... Someone had said this five year back that by 2020, they will become bigger than HUL. Well, they did not and will not beat HUL, certainly not in my time and under my watch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-needs-to-act-if-consumption-slows/articleshow/84742068.cms||Namrata Singh

Asked to react to the widespread opposition to these projects, Nadda said, “I don’t know the details of the project, but I have been told that there are two projects which are before the Supreme Court committee.” “One project has been cleared by the Supreme Court committee, and another is on the way,” the BJP president said. Recently, the Supreme Court-appointed central empowered committee had said that there is no justification for going ahead with the double-tracking project. Nadda said the state government will face environmental committees. “We will move ahead in a democratic manner,” he said. He added that flyovers, underpasses, metros, development, connectivity, national and international airports will be seen in BJP-ruled states. “In Congress-ruled states you will hear scams and corruption, and this is the culture of Congress,” he said. Congress had announced that if they are voted to office in Goa, they will scrap the three linear projects. “As far as BJP is concerned, it is the synonym of progress, and as far as Congress is concerned, it is the synonym of digress,” he said. “It is the duty of Congress to block everything and BJP’s target is to go ahead with development, and we will go ahead,” he said. The three projects have seen sustained opposition over the past year. TOI has highlighted that biodiversity and wildlife experts believe that the three Centre-sponsored infrastructure projects have the potential to exacerbate Goa’s water woes turning it into a parched state, while posing a mighty threat to the endemism and the flora and fauna of the region. Environmentalists and the public are agitating to save Mollem from the three linear projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-govt-will-go-ahead-with-3-mollem-projects-bjp-president/articleshow/84742510.cms||Murari Shetye

Citizens and motorists blame Vijayawada Municipal Corporation, Roads and Building department and Amaravati Metropolitan Development Authority for the poor state of roads in Urmila Nagar, Bhavanipuram and other areas in the constituency. A stretch of inner ring road from Tunnel Center to Kabela has become unmotorable with 1-foot deep potholes. Heavy vehicles passing through the inner ring road are frequently getting stuck in the potholes leading to traffic jams. The road adjacent to the wholesale dal market and iron yard were damaged due to the movement of heavy vehicles. Top layers of the road were washed away in the rain. The one- kilometer-long journey on this road now takes around 15 minutes with huge potholes. People The are unhappy with the condition of the roads. “The civic body has neglected our roads. Minister Vellampalli Srinivas is representing this constituency and still our roads are in bad shape. Despite repeated requests there has been no response from officials,” said K Narayana, a resident of Urmila Nagar. VMC’s engineering wing authorities said that they have started repair works on arterial roads in the city and are waiting for AMRDA and R&B department for the repair of main roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/in-vijayawada-west-pothole-riddled-roads-leave-motorists-in-the-lurch/articleshow/84739495.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Business||HDFC gets $250mn IFC loan for green, low-cost hsg||Mumbai: IFC, the investment arm of World Bank, has extended a $250-million loan to HDFC to support the mortgage lender’s moves to grow its affordable housing and emerging green affordable housing portfolio. This will enable low- and middle-income borrowers improved access to finance while supporting the country’s climate goals. According to Renu Sud Karnad, MD, HDFC, the loan will help deepen the housing finance company’s footprint in financing more affordable smart and green homes. “This partnership with IFC covering both themes affordable & green housing, we hope, will materially further our outreach,” she said. IFC has invested $920 million in housing finance companies. According to its estimates, there is a $1.3-trillion opportunity in green residential housing up to the year 2020. “With most banks and housing finance companies in India still at the stage of evolving their business models to lend to lower-income people, this investment should send a clear demonstration that green affordable housing is viable and needed, especially as India moves on the road to recovery from the impacts of Covid,” said IFC regional director (South Asia) Hector Gomez Ang. HDFC has earmarked at least 25% of this financing for green affordable housing, which reduces energy consumption and has a smaller carbon footprint. A joint statement said that the transaction is aimed at changing the positioning of green housing as a concept for the luxury market to include affordable housing. IFC has estimated that 275 million people — or 22% of the country’s population — don’t have access to adequate housing, spurred by rapid urbanisation and the lack of affordable housing finance. “Urban housing shortage was an estimated 29 million units in 2018, up by over 54% since 2012. The rural housing shortage is estimated to be twice that of urban areas,” the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-gets-250mn-ifc-loan-for-green-low-cost-hsg/articleshow/84742111.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Modi in Mann ki Baat: Goa has been a land of great spiritual heritage||PANAJI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday thanked the people of Goa for cherishing the common history of India and Georgia through the holy relics of St Ketevan. In his Mann Ki Baat programme, Modi mentioned the fact that India recently handed over to Georgia a relic of that country’s 17th century queen, St Ketevan, which was discovered within the ruins of the St Augustine complex in Old Goa. “At this event, India handed over the relic to the government of Georgia and its people, and India’s external affairs minister travelled there to participate in the event,” he said. “This ceremony not only strengthened Georgia’s relationship with India, but also with Goa, because the relic of St Queen Ketevan was found in 2005 at St Augustine’s church.” Modi said that Goa has been the land of great spiritual heritage. The St Augustine church, part of the Unesco world heritage site at Old Goa, is part of it, he said. “The words of appreciation used at this ceremony for India will be fondly remembered,” he said, adding that Georgia’s president, PM, religious heads and a large number of people participated in the event. Explaining the significance of the relics, Modi said that around 500 years ago, Queen Ketevan was the daughter of Georgia’s royal family. “After 10 years in jail, in 1624, she was martyr(ed). As per an ancient Portuguese document, St Queen Ketevan’s remains were kept at the St Augustine convent at Old Goa, but for a long time, it was considered that these buried remains had vanished in the earthquake that had hit Goa in 1930,” he said. While one part of the Georgian queen’s relics — long bone of her right arm — has been gifted to Georgia, the other part is still with the ASI’s museum in Old Goa. These relics were found in 2005 after several decades of research and efforts by ASI and Georgian authorities. The relics of the martyred queen landed in Old Goa because two Augustinian monks who are said to have witnessed the last years of her life brought them to Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/modi-in-mann-ki-baat-goa-has-been-a-land-of-great-spiritual-heritage/articleshow/84742656.cms||Murari Shetye

GACH principal Dr Dineshwar Prasad said a college alumni meet would also be organized in virtual mode. A number of alumni occupying top positions in different Ayush institutions in India and neighbouring countries would participate. Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad and senior officials of the state health department are likely to grace the occasion. Established in 1926, GACH at Kadamkuan provides necessary training to the students and also meets the medical needs of the people. It has got as many as 14 departments, eight of which are also running postgraduate teaching. The principal, however, regretted that the college faces acute shortage of teaching staff in its various departments. It has 76 faculties against the total sanctioned strength of 104. The medicine department has only one teacher against 10 sanctioned posts. If the situation remains unchanged, the department may be de-recognized by the competent authority, he apprehended. Prasad said with such a glorious history, the institution deserves to be upgraded as a centre of excellence in Ayurvedic medicine and the government must take suitable initiatives in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ayurvedic-college-hospital-to-celebrate-foundation-day/articleshow/84737888.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Patna: Just 5.7% of targeted ‘6 crore in 6 months’ fully inoculated||PATNA: Amid the threat of third wave of Covid, many people are seen visiting the nearest vaccination centres to get inoculated in the city. Some, however, are disappointed due to low supply of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. One Shashank Agarwal, who left the vaccination centre near IT roundabout without taking the jab, said, “I want Covaxin because of only 28-day gap between two doses as compared to Covishield that requires the gap of at least 84 days. I want to be fully vaccinated before the arrival of the third wave,” he said. Nidhi Sinha, another city resident, said, “Isn’t it better to get both the shots before the third wave? I have heard that primary and secondary immune response would help fight the disease and suppress its severity. I am even ready to pay for Covaxin if it is available.” Raj Balla, a resident of Patna City, said, “I am hopeful of booking my slot for Covaxin by next week. Even if I receive my first dose of vaccine by July-end, I would be fully vaccinated by the last week of August.” Health officials said the gap between two doses has created a significant increase in demand for Covaxin. The frequent revision in the gap between two doses is the main reason for the number of people fully inoculated being low in the state. The Bihar government has administered the first dose of Covid vaccines to 31% of six crore people it has targeted to vaccinate in six months. Among them, only 5.7% have received their second shots. As per the data available on CoWIN, altogether 2,92,209 beneficiaries were administered anti-Covid vaccines on Sunday, which included the first as well as the second doses. So far, 1,88,71,575 people have taken the first dose of the vaccines in the state and 34,68,378 second dose. The cumulative figure of vaccination in the state stands at 2.23 crore. The data available on CoWIN showed that maximum beneficiaries, 1.04 crore, who have taken one shot of vaccine are in the age group of 18-44 years, followed by 62.8 lakh in the age group of 45-59 years and 55.7 lakh senior citizens. Most people have been administered Covishield as two crore doses of the vaccine have been used in the state against 22.7 lakh doses of Covaxin and 2,038 doses of Sputnik V. In Patna, 19,08,768 people have got at least one jab of Covid-19 vaccines and 6,01,143 have received their second shots. Altogether 33,484 beneficiaries were inoculated in the district on Sunday. Dr Arun Shah, a Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician and former president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics-Bihar, said people should be choosy when it comes to vaccination. “All the vaccines are effective. Since there are so many variants of Covid-19, no one can guarantee that fully vaccinated people would not get infected by the disease. Many vaccinated people had tested positive during the second wave,” he added. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, said the first dose of vaccine provides protection against SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. “Enough antibodies are developed with one shot to fight the disease. The second dose further enhances the level of antibody. Those who have taken first dose of Covaxin need a booster (second) dose after 28 days to increase the quantity of antibody developed by the first dose. In case of Covishield, the second dose is required after 84 days,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/just-5-7-of-targeted-6-crore-in-6-months-fully-inoculated/articleshow/84737810.cms||Faryal Rumi

A magistrate and a posse of armed police force have been deployed at the village in the wake of tension. The girl’s family members have been absconding since the incident came to light. The house was locked when police reached the village on Saturday. The police claimed the girl’s father Sushant Pandey alias Vijay Kumar was arrested barely two hours after the youth’s thrashing. However, the other accused, including the girl’s uncle and his accomplices were absconding. Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant said Ashok Thakur, Ranjeet Kumar and Mukesh Kumar, stated to be the residents of Repura Rampur Sah village, have already been arrested for attacking the girl’s house on Saturday. “Raids were on to nab the other accused,” he added. The incident took place at around 11pm on Friday when the deceased, identified as Saurabh Kumar, was found in the girl’s house. The family members held him captive, tied him with a tree and assaulted with iron rods till he fainted. His private parts were also chopped off before dropping him at a private hospital in a serious condition. Saurabh’s father Manish Kumar alleged that he found his son lying in a pool of blood in the hospital at Muzaffarpur. He died during treatment on Saturday morning. He alleged that Saurabh had left home on Friday evening after receiving a phone call. “He has been killed,” he told the police. When the body reached Repura Rampur Sah, a number of people accompanied by his relatives blocked road and disrupted traffic on Muzaffarpur-Sahebganj road. Later, a group of people took the body to the girl’s house at Sonbarsa and performed his last rites outside the building. Another group went to the rooftop and ransacked the house. “Such an incident of burning the body outside the girl’s house has not taken place earlier in the village,” said septuagenarian Ramnath Thakur. Male members of the village have abandoned their houses apprehending police action. Local residents revealed that Saurabh was mercilessly beaten up last year when he had gone to meet his girlfriend. His nails were removed by the tormentors. However, the matter was settled after the intervention of the local panchayat. Apprehending trouble, his father had sent him to Odisha where he worked at a private firm. He returned home in June to attend his sister’s wedding ceremony. The locals told the police that he frequented the girl’s house again, leading to his murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tension-in-two-muz-villages-after-youths-brutal-murder/articleshow/84738329.cms||Ramashankar

---||Kolkata||July’s fifth organ donation, year’s ninth, a shot in the arm for movement in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The city has never had the organ donation movement going at the pace it is currently moving. On Sunday, Kolkata clocked the fifth organ donation of this month, a record-breaking number in terms of donations in a particular month. Despite the ferocious third wave, Bengal this year has already recorded nine donations, breaking 2020’s record of six. People in the organ donation movement hope new heights are achieved and many more donor families come forward to save lives. The deceased donor, Jaydeb Manna, was taken to IPGMER’s Trauma Care Centre four days ago. The 44-year-old resident of Howrah’s Shyampukur had sustained a head injury after falling from a high-rise building in Kolkata. “The head injury was grievous. Doctors tried their best to save him, but ultimately gave up and explained to us what brain death is. We were told we could donate his organs. We gave it a thought and agreed as his organs could save a few lives. We did not let go of this opportunity,” said Anita Manna, the deceased’s sister-in-law. Once the family consented to the donation, Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (ROTTO) allocated the heart to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) and the two kidneys to IPGMER. The liver was found unfit for transplant. The organs were retrieved and harvested on Sunday evening. All the three transplant surgeries were on in the two hospitals till reports last came in. “The heart is being transplanted into a 43-year-old man suffering from end-stage heart failure in our hospital. We offer our condolences and support to the grieving family of the donor,” said a spokesperson at RTIICS. Of the five donations so far in July, three have come from the state-run SSKM’s trauma care centre. “In fact, there had been three more brain-death declarations at the trauma care centre this month, but they could not be converted into organ donations as the families did not agree. But the fact that the trauma care centre’s critical care team has started identifying more brain deaths should prove to be a game changer in the near future,” said IPGMER director Manimoy Banerjee. Even in 2018, when there were 15 donations, the highest in the state so far, no particular month had seen five donations. The pandemic had hit the donation and transplant movement with Bengal recording only six donations in 2020. “The ultimate game changers are doctors in the intensive care units who can identify brain death on time and the transplant coordinators who can convince and motivate the deceased’s family for the donation. We respect the donors’ families,” said IPGMER nephrology professor Arpita Raychaudhury, joint director, ROTTO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/julys-fifth-organ-donation-years-ninth-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-movement-in-state/articleshow/84740938.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

These scraps have not only occupied space, but also give a dirty look to the hospitals and medical colleges, including the premier Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH). During the signing of MoU late on Saturday evening, health minister Mangal Pandey said the scrap materials have turned into heaps of garbage on the premises of different hospitals. “We have decided to beautify the health facilities in the state,” he said, adding the areas where the scraps have been kept will be used for other useful purposes. “The department has signed MoU with the MSTC Limited after getting approval from the state cabinet in April this year. All the existing rules will be strictly followed while executing the process of disposal of scrap materials,” the minister added. The MSTC will disposal of the useless materials through the e-auction, a process of conducting auction through online competitive bidding. Committees have also been set up at the district, medical college and hospital levels to physically verify the scraps and prepare lists of the useless items. The lists will be sent to the MSTC for starting the process of e-auction. The committees at the district level will be headed by civil surgeons. At the medical colleges and hospitals, principals and directors will head the committees. “Removing scrap materials from hospitals was never a priority in the state. As a result, scrap materials piled up on the premises of different hospitals across the state,” Pandey said. Additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit, other senior health department officials and officials of MSTC also attended the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-mstc-ink-pact-to-make-hospitals-free-of-legacy-waste/articleshow/84737937.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Vadodara||Many areas in Vadodara left waterlogged after downpour||VADODARA: Heavy rains lashed the city on Sunday evening leaving several areas, especially in the old city, waterlogged. The weather was overcast since morning and it kept drizzling throughout the day. But the skies turned pitch dark by 5 pm and soon it began pouring. Barodians, though, took advantage of the weather and went out for long drives away from the city. Many took to the Sindhrot bridge while others drove on the Halol Road to get an exquisite view of Pavagadh flanked by clouds. Thousands of visitors flocked to Pavagadh despite the administration putting a ban on private vehicles to the hill-top on weekends. Even the Sindhrot check dam on Mahi River saw an unprecedented rush on Sunday evening. In the past, incidents of drowning have been recorded at this spot. Foodies in the city, though, queued up outside the ‘bhajiya’ and ‘samosa’ stalls to gorge on their favourite snacks. In Vadodara rural areas, Karjan received 63.5 mm of rain, Dabhoi got 25.4 mm rain and Waghodia got 38.1 mm of rain. It poured heavily in Chhota Udepur district too and many rivers began overflowing by evening. While Chhota Udepur and Kawant taluka got 152.4 mm of rain, Bodeli received 101.6 mm of rain and Pavi Jetpur saw 63.5 mm rain. Such was the downpour that many closed their shops and headed home to avoid getting stuck. In Panchmahal, Halol and Jambughoda received 127 mm of rain each while the national highway in Shahera taluka got flooded with water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/many-areas-in-vadodara-left-waterlogged-after-downpour/articleshow/84739526.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Many rural households’ wait for potable water continues in Andhra Pradesh||AMARAVATI: The Covid-19 outbreak has crippled the state government plans to provide potable drinking water through household tap connections in rural areas. This has left nearly 50 per cent of the state’s rural population depending on unhygienic sources for drinking water needs. While many people fetching not-so safe ground water, others are consuming water from un-cleaned wells and local tanks. More than 1000 villages were getting water through transportation during peak summer when borewells dry up due to depletion of ground water. Many districts are struggling to reach the targets fixed under Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) due to shortage of workers. The delay in laying the pipelines, construction of over-head reservoirs is reportedly delayed the fixing of individual tap connections. Except Kadapa and Chittoor, the progress of granting household tap connections under Jal Jeevan Mission is poor in rest of the districts. Interestingly, Kadapa is the home district of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, Chittoor is native of panchayat Raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy, who is monitoring the scheme. In both Kadapa and Chittoor districts nearly 80 per cent households got the drinking water tap connections. The state achieved only 17 per cent progress in the last one year prompting the authorities to run from pillar to post to complete the targets by 2023. Surprisingly, Srikakulam district, where several thousands of commoners were becoming victims of kidney ailments, the works are going slow. Srikakulam was ranked at the bottom with only 15 per cent of households having drinking water tap connection. The Centre granted Rs.800 crore for 2020-21 under Har Ghar Jal programme of Jal Jeevan Mission. The Covid-19 situation paralysed the works due to which the state government could utilize just around Rs.290 crore. However, the Union Jal Shakti Ministry accepted the state government’s Detailed Project Report (DPR) on the issue and enhanced the grant to Rs.3200 crore to cover nearly 47 lakh households. “We have taken the Jal Jeevan Mission programme seriously and directed the district collectors to set special focus to achieve progress by the end of the year,” said panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy. The Panchayat Raj department wanted to provide connections to about 32 lakh households in the current fiscal, about 12.28 lakh tap connections in 2022-23 and another 6 lakh connections in 2023-24. However, the chief minister wanted the entire rural area to be covered by 2022-23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/many-rural-households-wait-for-potable-water-continues/articleshow/84739247.cms||Samdani MN

Two businessmen, Rajan Sarang and Prashant Modak, were arrested on Saturday and a court has remanded them in DRI custody. A fraudulent claim of Rs 49.2 crore involving 124 bogus companies has come to light till now though no remittances has been received for the exports made. Two other consignments with a declared value of Rs 22 crore have been kept on hold by DRI for probe. Officials have recovered a 9mm pistol from Modak’s flat; he has not been able to submit valid documents for its possession. Sarang, who owns Pavan Enterprise, was allegedly involved in clearing and forwarding of overvalued exports consignments of garments with the intent to claim higher drawback fraudulently. Modak has admitted to DRI about export consignments consisting of cheap quality of goods, said sources. The syndicate is run by a gr-oup of persons based out of Delhi, Surat and Mumbai, sources said. Gullible people were rop-ed in to submit KYC docume-nts on payment of a few thousa-nds as commission to create bogus companies and Import Exp-ort Code, a mandatory requirement for effecting exports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dri-unearths-rs-1800cr-export-incentive-scam-2-bizmen-held/articleshow/84744578.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: After 80 days in hospital, 35-year-old Covid patient goes home||PANAJI: During the height of the second wave, when the state was reporting an average of 50 deaths a day, Nikhil Madgaonkar, a Covid-positive patient, was admitted to Goa Medical College (GMC) in a critical condition. On Thursday, a full 80 days after he first set foot into GMC, the 35-year-old was discharged. His almost-three month hospital stay was unexpected, as when Covid struck him, he was healthy and had no comorbidities. But over the next few weeks, there were several lows, as he struggled to fight the post-Covid complications that afflicted him. “He came to us in a severe state, and was lodged in ward 147 and given invasive ventilator support,” said Dr Uday Kakodkar, administrator of GMC’s super-specialty block and head of pulmonary medicine. “Later, he was shifted to ward 146 and placed on non-invasive ventilation. His condition continued to be bad for a prolonged period.” Even after he turned Covid-19 negative, he remained in the non-Covid intensive care unit of the hospital for 13 days. Although he was slated to be shifted to the TB and chest disease hospital, St Inez, it was deferred by a few days, as he was not in a state to be moved out. “He was subsequently shifted to the TB and chest hospital for treatment of post-Covid lung fibrosis, and remained there for 30 days. He was required to be hospitalised for a longer period since he went through a series of complications,” Kakodkar said. He developed pneumothorax, a condition when air leaks into the space between the lungs and the chest wall. “With pneumothorax, his condition took a turn for the worse, and he was required to be operated on. But after his surgery, he had a second episode of pneumothorax. At some point, his condition was so bad that it was difficult to take an X-ray,” he said. Madgaonkar was a very challenging case, but he was managed and finally discharged on Thursday. During his stay, 17 X-rays were taken and two CT scans done. “He is still being treated for lung fibrosis, but he is sufficiently better to be managed at home, and will continue to be on oxygen therapy for a while,” he said.

---||Kolkata||KP to buy 500 night vision body cams||Kolkata: The Kolkata Police has decided to procure 500 body cameras with night vision for cops at the police stations for Rs 1 crore. At present, most police stations have one or two such cameras, which are used in limited operations, like major probes or in important law-and-order deployments. According to Lalbazar sources, the new gadgets will allow inspectors and sub-inspectors — those in charge of investigations — to use them for live feeds and future references. In a wider ramification, Lalbazar also proposed to ask duty officers of various police stations to use these. “Cops on sentry duty at police stations will also be asked to use these cameras. The special branch — on specific information gathering missions during law-and-order duties — will also be using these cameras,” said an officer, adding that multiple CCTV cameras inside police stations were not enough to read the expressions and reactions of people visiting. The move to buy this number of the gadgets for police stations comes almost four years after traffic personnel were armed with body cameras and supplied local police stations with at least one or two a year later. The detective department bought 100 such cameras in 2019 to record witness statements during raids. The cops said the cameras will be introduced to change the perception of common people about police, bring transparency, introduce real-time monitoring and sharing of actual footage for future reference. “The cameras will record the response of the masses. It will go a long way towards addressing the grievances of complainants and witnesses that they were either harassed or not taken seriously by cops,” the officer said. Officers felt using these cameras will help record not only the scene of crime, but statements of witnesses and suspects. “The advantage is that senior officers can now monitor an operation without actually visiting the site. Since we employ 3D technology in all major cases to map the crime scenes, the recordings can be invaluable,” said an officer. However, officers — both serving and retired — said the real gain would be the curbing of police “excesses”. “During raids at certain places, like bars and illegal call centres, we hear allegations of police excesses. With body cameras, we are sure the truth will come forth,” said a former ARS officer. According to the tender bid, the contractor will have to give three years of comprehensive warranty on all components from the date of acceptance of supplied items. After completion of this period, Kolkata Police may go for fresh AMC with the supplier. “Hence, the bidder should maintain sufficient stock of spares even after the expiry of the warranty period. The contractor is liable for repairing all or any damage detected during the warranty period, free of cost,” the bid stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kp-to-buy-500-night-vision-body-cams/articleshow/84740897.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The state government conducted the Investment Bazaar to accelerate and facilitate financing of energy efficiency projects and technologies in the industries sector. According to energy department officials, Vizag turned out to be a perfect platform for matchmaking of energy efficiency projects by bringing financial institutions and industries together. At the international webinar on ‘energy efficiency financing’ organised by the Organization For Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), France in co-ordination with BEE with delegates from Denmark, UK and USA, etc., BEE director general, Abhay Bhakre, said that energy efficiency financing was a highly effective initiative in promoting energy efficiency to achieve the goal of reducing the emission intensity of the country’s Gross Domestic Product by 33% to 35% by 2030 from the 2005 levels. Director (EE Financing), BEE, Vineeta Kanwal, said India has been working proactively to achieve 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil, fuel-based energy resources by 2030. She also spoke about the Investment Bazaar launched for the first time in India in Visakhapatnam by the AP State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM) under the energy efficiency financing platform. Andhra Pradesh is the only state to have conducted this event so far in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/global-experts-shower-accolades-on-vizag-energy-investment-bazaar/articleshow/84739581.cms||---
---||Delhi||Root cause of why heritage tree at Chandni Chowk can’t be adopted, yet||NEW DELHI: Despite the forest and wildlife department receiving around 30 applications to adopt a heritage tree in Chandni Chowk under Section 13 of Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, no individual or organisation can be handed over the responsibility for its upkeep unless Delhi Tree Authority (DTA) gives permission for it. However, the statutory body has not met since 2019. Between 2013 and 2017, DTA only met thrice, even though rules state it is supposed to hold a meeting every three months. It is also the apex body to oversee tree transplantation. Officials said before the heritage tree was allotted for adoption, a DTA meeting would be convened for post facto approval. Other key agendas would also be discussed. A notice was issued by the forest and wildlife department in January following a Delhi High Court order after an applicant sought protection of the tree. Subsequently, individuals, local bodies and organisations were invited to help the department preserve the tree by adopting it. A forest official said no meetings were planned by DTA yet, but one may be convened soon. “We are following the high court’s directions and due process will be followed. Before the tree is given for adoption, de facto approval is likely to be sought from DTA,” added the official. Section 13 of DPTA states, “Adoption of trees, notwithstanding anything contained in this act or any other law for the time being in force, the tree authority may, subject to such terms and conditions as it may specify in that behalf, after giving notice to the owner of the tree, to show cause, if any, as to why the trees should not be given in adoption, allow, by written permission, any corporate or institution to adopt the tree for such period as may be specified.” Rajeev Suri, a tree activist, had also written to the north forest division stating that under the rules, the tree officer or deputy conservator of forests could not issue such a notice on their own. “You are requested to re-examine the matter and direct withdrawal of the aforesaid public notice,” added the letter. Another forest official said this was the first time a tree was being adopted in Delhi and it would be done by following proper protocol. “If the rules state a DTA meeting has to be convened, we will do the same. So far, no such meeting has been planned, but it could be called before the end of the year to discuss certain key agendas,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/root-cause-of-why-heritage-tree-cant-be-adopted-yet/articleshow/84740765.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Ratheesh, 35, husband of the sister of the deceased woman has confessed to committing the crime, police said. Harikrishna, 25, working as a temporary nursing staff at Alappuzha medical college hospital, was found dead under mysterious circumstances in Ratheesh’s house on Saturday. Ratheesh, who had gone into hiding after the incident, was arrested late Saturday night. Ratheesh told police that he was having an illicit affair with the deceased, who was his wife’s sister. Harikrishna’s family was aware of the relationship but the parents were scared to oppose Ratheesh since he had a criminal background, police said. Ratheesh told police that they spent time together when his wife, who works at a hospital in Ernakulam, was away at work. However, in recent times, Harikrishna wanted to back out from this affair. She had fallen in love with another youth and wanted to marry him, and this angered the accused, police said. According to the police, Ratheesh picked up Harikrishna as usual on his two-wheeler and brought her to his house on Saturday. After an altercation, he strangled her to death. He confirmed that she was dead and he dragged the body outside the house. However, since it was raining, he dragged the body back to the room, locked the house and went into hiding. The sand particles found on the body had raised the police’s suspicions. Ratheesh was taken into custody from a relative’s house and interrogated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/brother-in-law-admits-to-killing-nurse-say-police/articleshow/84740748.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Prof bags award for study on stress-causing gene||Kolkata: Emotional stress and disorder are linked to the same cerebral gene that triggers mental retardation but requires to be addressed in a different manner, said a research by Sumantra Chattarji of the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bengaluru. A senior professor of neuro-biology, Chattarji was awarded the FRAXA Research Foundation’s Global Champion Award this week for his ‘commitment to Fragile X research’. Even though it’s the same ‘Fragile X’, or a breakage in the X chromosome cell (termed fragile X mental retardation 1 gene mutation or FMR), that causes both retardation and emotional stress, the latter occurs in the amygdala region of the brain while the former takes place at the hippocampus area, explained Chattarji, who did his post-doctoral research and PhD at Yale University and MIT.  “While retardation is linked to cognitive disorders, learning disability and memory, fragile X could lead to fear, anxiety, attention deficit and unstable mood. It’s a cluster of symptoms but the emotional part can’t be treated with drugs used for cognitive disorders,” said Chattarji, who has been researching on this since 2009-10. Fragile X is triggered by a chromosome break that stops the protein produced by the gene. “The impact leads to a disorder in the electrical communication in brain cells, particularly at their contact points, which leads to a connection synapse, hindering normal development of the brain,” he said, adding that while the cognitive impact of fragile X was extensively researched, none worked on amygdala or the emotional impact. There were a few drug trials on fragile X, but few focused on the emotional symptoms, he said. Chattarji started experimenting on animals to study the impact of amygdala synaptic defects and concluded it requires a different set of intervention. The researcher felt people suffering from retardation or emotional stress couldn’t afford to wait till drugs were developed and there was a need for families, schools and doctors to work together to understand the issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prof-bags-award-for-study-on-stress-causing-gene/articleshow/84740727.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Crime branch’s ‘wasooli’ list leaves cops red-faced during raid at gambling den||Nagpur: A ‘wasooli list’, naming cops from crime branch allegedly collecting money from anti-social elements, was recovered during a raid at a gambling den near Mankapur railway tracks some days ago, leaving the top brass red-faced. Though the matter was ‘probed’ and put to rest, it raised its ugly head once again last week during transfers, when one of the cops involved blurted out information about yet another ‘wasooli list’ of crime branch, much to the dismay of senior officials. This is something like the allegations by a former Mumbai police chief that the political leadership had demanded collection of Rs100 crore from bars and restaurants, which had led to the resignation of the state home minister some weeks back. The crime branch has been mired in controversies, with unsavoury allegations surfacing against it at frequent intervals. The specialized unit’s image was severely hit after the emergence of the ‘wasooli list’. It was found in the diary of a gambling kingpin, which an officer came across during an operation. Apart from two cops from the police station, the list contained names of cops from the crime branch. With DCP, crime, Gajanan Rajmane having an image of being an upright officer, the question remains for whom the cops were collecting the money from the gambler. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, a no-nonsense officer, had at that time asked Rajmane to conduct an inquiry and stem the rot. “We had taken serious note of the episode and each cop was issued strict warning to behave and counselled appropriately by the seniors. Administrative and disciplinary actions were also initiated against a few black sheep,” he said. It’s learnt the ghost of the ugly episode resurfaced once again when a controversial assistant sub-inspector (ASI) gave senior officers yet another ‘wasooli list’ during last week’s transfer interviews, when he was refused posting to a police station. The ASI is also learnt to have spoken of yet another ‘wasooli list’. The crime branch image was further jolted following a raid at Ajni last week, when there were allegations that the cops had given a long rope to a Congress corporator and his brother during a raid on a liquor den. Though their tenant was booked, no action was initiated against the politically connected brothers. Around a fortnight ago, the crime branch had questionably dropped the name of dreaded goon Ashish Rathod alias Maddy, convicted in a murder case, from the list of accused in the chargesheet of the ‘honey trap’ case. Maddy has at least two murders against him. Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) former medical officer Dr Pravin Ghantawar and Sahil Sayyed were chargesheeted in the case but Maddy, whose voice was supposedly heard in a leaked audio tape, conspiring to trap two BJP leaders, was made an eye-witness. There have also been allegations in recent times about biased duty allotment and distribution of responsibilities in the crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/crime-branchs-wasooli-list-leaves-cops-red-faced-during-raid-at-gambling-den/articleshow/84753870.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Cops bust fake marriage bureau defrauding grooms, hush up raid||NAGPUR: Jaripatka police, in collaboration with cyber cell, busted a fake marriage bureau near Dighori on Friday after a complaint by a youth, who was sent a noted theatre artiste’s photo from social media as a prospective bride. A couple was booked, 10 women and four men were rounded up, and 37 cellphones and one tablet were seized in the raid. However, the entire action was kept under wraps, and all suspects were released. The mastermind couple booked is now ‘absconding’. On Friday, Jaripatka police raided an apartment near Dighori, where several women were communicating with prospective grooms, masquerading either as bride or as employees of the fake marriage bureau. Despite the fact that the racketeers are likely to have duped several people, Jaripatka police appear to have taken no effort to arrest anyone in the case so far for detailed custodial interrogation and recoveries. Cops still don’t know how the racketeers managed to procure 38 SIM cards. The bureau was registered in the name of another woman, and not the couple booked, that is now ‘absconding’, according to cops. The women rounded up during the raid were learnt to be those who posed as prospective brides or bureau employees, to lay traps for the victims. Some of these women would later get ‘emotionally’ involved with the victims and extort more money on various pretexts after sending photographs of young and beautiful women as their own photos, said a source. The cops found that the marriage bureau’s bank account had been receiving substantial cash deposits from marriageable candidates across the state. Senior inspector Jatin Fetangale of Jaripatka police station said a couple was booked but they were not arrested. “The women rounded up were working on the instruction of their employers, and hence cannot be held responsible, but we have seized their mobile phones,” he said. “We are conducting a thorough investigation into the case.” According to a senior officer, the seizures and other formalities had consumed a lot of time due to which press communication could not be sent, which was unintentional. It’s learnt the matter came to fore after an Indora-based social worker approached cops, stating her son was duped by a marriage agency who had sent a photograph of a noted theatre artiste as a ‘prospective bride’ after accepting Rs3,000 registration fee. Her son was stunned to see the photograph of the theatre artiste, whom he knew. The artiste too was shocked when she came to know her photo was being used by this marriage bureau.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-bust-fake-marriage-bureau-defrauding-grooms-hush-up-raid/articleshow/84740729.cms||Soumitra Bose

The projects include building of a medical college in Bulandshahr and an ITI in Khurja and Bagpat each. Speaking on the occasion, Maurya said that the development works undertaken under the Yogi Adityanath government do not reflect a caste bias. “We are unbiased, which is why, be it a Yaduvanshi to a Raghuvanshi, all are with BJP,” he said, adding that “Ye sab jo sarkar kar rahi hai ye sirf jhanki hai, abhi hume bahut kuch karna baki hai (what all we are doing is just a glimpse of much more that we intend to do)”. The deputy CM patted his government’s back for putting an end to corruption and hooliganism and added that “no one has done as much work for the farmers as this government”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/our-devpt-work-dont-reflect-bias-dy-cm/articleshow/84738654.cms||Ishita Mishra

He was booked for uploading the dance profile video of a South Mumbai-based woman on a web portal without her consent. The 40-year-old victim, an executive of a company, runs a dance class. The case was registered on July 19 after the victim found her profile video shot by the photographer uploaded online alongside nude women. The suspect is yet to be arrested as the police are still probing the case. DB Marg police senior inspector Pradeep Khude confirmed that the FIR was registered based on the woman’s complaint. “The photographer made my profile video viral on objectionable sites and even sold it to some foreign web agencies without my knowledge,” said the victim in her complaint. The photographer has been booked under IPC sections 354 (C) (voyeurism), 500 (defamation) and under the IT Act. TOI has the FIR. The victim’s lawyer Vaibhav Khanolkar said she met the photographer in 2019 for shooting her dance video profile. “The victim later found out that her profile video had been edited and uploaded on an objectionable website without her consent. She lost two marriage proposals after prospective suitors informed her that they found her profile video along with objectionable contents,” the lawyer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-photographer-uploads-video-of-sobo-woman-online-booked-for-voyeurism/articleshow/84744602.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Goa||Goa CM Pramod Sawant will be party’s face for polls: BJP national president J P Nadda||PANAJI: With less than seven months for the state assembly elections, BJP national president J P Nadda on Sunday said chief minister Pramod Sawant would be the face of BJP’s campaign, but a formal announcement would be made by the party’s parliamentary board. “Pramod Sawant has done good work and carried out all-round development in Goa. We are going ahead under the leadership of Sawant. We have an arrangement within the party wherein the parliamentary board makes formal declarations on leadership. However, there is no second thoughts on it,” Nadda said. This is the first time that the party has announced its chief ministerial candidate for an upcoming assembly election. In 2012, BJP had contested the election under the leadership of then chief minister Manohar Parrikar, Union minister for state Shripad Naik and former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar. In 2017, BJP did not announce a chief minister candidate. When asked about Union minister for state Shripad Naik showing interest to work for the party in Goa, Nadda said, “He is doing a very good job in Delhi and taking care of things there. Everybody has an interest to come back. He has been assigned a job in Delhi, which he is doing very well.” On senior BJP functionaries staking claims for party ticket for the upcoming elections, Nadda said there is no division within the party, but like political parties, people may also have desires. “Settling those desires is the work of the party, which is a natural and continuous process and we will do that,” Nadda said. He even grazed the subject of family raj, given that many MLAs are aspiring for tickets for their spouses. “Family raj and giving tickets are two different issues and it cannot be connected to family raj. Family raj means you don’t allow anyone to grow. We decide tickets based on merits. We will accommodate them to take the party towards victory,” Nadda said. On his two-day visit to the state, Nadda discussed the political situation in Goa and ways to galvanise party workers to win the elections. Reacting to Congress claims that it will form the next government in the state, Nadda said it is the duty of political parties to claim victory. “But Congress from Delhi to Goa is a rudderless boat and the sailor does not know which side to sail. This is the situation of Congress,” he said. On Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s promise to give 300 units electricity free to Goans if they form the government, Nadda said, “First conduct a survey in Delhi to know the condition of people and you will get the answer. There is a difference between pragmatic politics and misleading the people.” Regarding mining and the Mhadei issues, Nadda said the party is positive of getting a solution to both. “We are worried about the development of Goa and whatever needs to be done, will be done,” Nadda said, adding that where Mhadei is concerned a judicious decision will be taken in due course of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-will-be-partys-face-for-polls-nadda/articleshow/84742924.cms||Murari Shetye

A resident of Umreth in Anand, Shailesh Patel was going to participate in Guru-Vandana (worship of teacher) event in the Gota area of Ahmedabad city on Nadiad highway. He said that two men waived hands at him seeking a lift in his car near Nadiad Expressway saying that there was raining outside and they were unable to get any vehicles. Patel offered the duo a lift in his car. When he was driving the car, he smelt something like liquor in the car and he decided to inform the police, said the FIR. When he reached near Hathijan Circle, he found a police point there and Patel approached the cops. He told the cops to check the parcels of the two persons as he suspected that they might carry some alcoholic substance in it. Cops checked the parcels carried by the two men and found there were 16 plastic bags containing country liquor. The FIR mentioned that they were carrying 48 litres of country liquor worth Rs 960. Vivekanandnagar police booked the two men identified as Ajay Talpada, 22, and Manoj Talpada, 20, residents of Nadiad in Kheda, under the prohibition act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/taking-a-lift-lands-two-bootleggers-in-lock-up/articleshow/84740784.cms||---

---||Meerut||Thousands of building plans approved by ‘fake’ architects in UP ‘map scam’||MEERUT: For any building to come up in Uttar Pradesh, a map — like a blueprint or a house plan — has to be approved by an architect. This is done online. But earlier this month, an architects’ body in Meerut found an anomaly — they had approved 20 maps between April and July 2 this year but the platform showed 56 had been ratified. The trail led to what appears to be a map scam — thousands of illegitimate approvals were given out allegedly by development authority workers posing as architects for anywhere between Rs 25,000 and Rs 2 lakh each. And the network, architects said, is spread across the state. In March last year, the state government revamped the Uttar Pradesh Online Building Plan Approval System Portal to take the process online and minimise human intervention — building maps could be created, checked and uploaded on the platform. But there were two loopholes. To use the platform, all one needed was an architect’s registration number. The other requirement was that of a phone number. But since registration numbers and phone numbers are not linked, someone with just a registration number could enter their own phone number and get an OTP to log in. Another glaring gap allowed an architect to log in with more than one ID. So, an impostor could generate a new ID for an architect and use that to gain access. That is what happened to an Azamgarh-based architect who found 144 approvals had been given out in Meerut using his name with a second ID created by an impostor. “When we got in touch with him, he said he had not sanctioned even one building map over the past year,” president of Meerut Architects’ Association Ankit Agarwal told TOI. “Our estimate is that at least 800 maps were approved illegally … Even the best architects here would not have approved more than 30 maps in a year.” Soon after the Meerut cases, many others came forward. An architect from Meerut, Anil Kumar Mehra, 75, discovered that his ID was being used in Hapur’s Pilkhuwa Development Authority. “I have given an affidavit saying I have nothing to do with the approval of maps issued in Hapur and requested that the maps be cancelled,” he said. Another from Lucknow, Jitender Tripathi, stumbled upon his ID being in the Gorakhpur Development Authority. “Dozens of maps were falsely approved using my name. It’s a faulty system that’s being abused. It’s ruining our reputation,” he said. After the operations were flagged, UP’s chief town and country planner (CTCP) Anoop Srivastava asked all development authorities in the state to file FIRs wherever these map scams were reported. “All vice chairpersons of development authorities have been asked to look into the matter after the state’s senior urban planning officials met in Lucknow,” he told TOI. “So far, 18 such IDs fraudulently created or used have been identified … We are trying to plug the platform loopholes by introducing digital signatures and linking them to Aadhaar.” Architects said development authority workers are the “only ones” familiar with the entire approval system. “There are junior engineers and draftsmen who can easily chart maps and approve them,” an architect said. And it’s not just people looking to get away with building violations, raising buildings in unauthorised colonies or, simply, skipping the queue. “Sometimes, people go to the development authority instead of going to an architect for approval because they don’t know the new rules.” The UP Architects’ Association is planning to take the case to court. “We have asked the authorities to cancel all such illegally approved maps,” Manish Mishra, secretary of the body, said. Srivastava was not sure: “That is a call we have to take once we know the full extent of the scam.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/thousands-of-building-plans-approved-by-fake-architects-in-up-map-scam/articleshow/84738675.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Nagpur||City records 73% rise in traffic violations||Nagpur: City traffic police have recorded a 73% increase in the number of cases of wrong-side driving and jumping red lights, riding without helmets or using mobile phones while driving, as mentioned in the mid-year report released by the traffic department. The data of different traffic violations of first six months of this year (2021) revealed that the 10 zones of traffic police have caught 4.42 lakh motorists and cumulatively collected Rs7.35 crore fine from them. In the same period (from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020), these 10 zones’ traffic cops booked 2.56 lakh violators and recovered Rs4.13 crore fines. The traffic police, under the leadership of DCP Sarang Awad, started a massive drive against offenders and are undertaking a variety of measures to reduce traffic violations. The department also witnessed a threefold increase in red-light jumping, ninefold rise in use of fancy number plates (as against 3,219 cases in 2020, the cops penalized 31,018 motorists this year) and more than twofold increase in use of cellphones while driving, which rose from 15,563 cases last year to 35,173 cases in the current year. Sources, however, said traffic violation cases were fewer last year due to complete lockdown. “The rise in number of traffic violations in the city shows that traffic police have become more vigilant,” said traffic expert and Janakrosh vice-president Ashok Karandikar. He, however, felt that with lower fine amount, motorists in Nagpur have no qualms about paying fine after being caught for violating traffic rules. Had the state government implemented the amended Central Motor Vehicles Act, which had hiked the fines considerably, the scenario could be different. “If the fine amount is higher, motorists will think twice before jumping red lights and so on. It will also bring down road accidents,” Karandikar said. With 800-odd cops, traffic police have a challenging task at hand. According to Karandikar, traffic police need to focus on recovering pending fines and should rope in a private agency for the recoveries. High court lawyer and traffic expert Anjan Chatterjee said traffic rule-breakers evidently have not been deterred by the recent, steep increases in fines. “It would be proper if the Motor Vehicles Act and Central Motor Vehicles Rules are amended to deal with serious traffic violations to compulsorily include IPC Section 299, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder,” he said. The most common violations are signal jumping, wrong-side driving, overspeeding, drunk driving. “If every such violation is booked, the aggregate will be three to four times the official figure,” Chatterjee said. Signal jumping is often due to non-synchronization of traffic signals along trunk routes, he said, adding that if there was proper synchronization, signal-jumping cases could come down, apart from precious fuel being saved and unnecessary pollution due to idling engines getting checked.

---||Lucknow||BJP’s discreet silence on Maya’sBrahmin outreach a ploy to dent SP?||Lucknow: A palpable silence of the BJP over Mayawati-led BSP’s aggressive Brahmin outreach has raised many eyebrows in the political circles of UP. Experts point out how top saffron ranks distanced themselves from unleashing political barbs at the BSP whose possible resurrection could thwart Samajwadi Party’s attempts to position itself as the principle opponent of the BJP and firm up a bi-polar electoral contest in the run up to the high stake UP assembly elections due next year. BJP sources confirmed that the party top leadership went discreetly silent and chose not to counter Mayawati’s attempt to go back to her tried and tested social engineering formula comprising Brahmin-Dalit consolidation that hoisted her to power with absolute majority for the first time in the 2007 assembly elections. Political experts interpret it as a calculated move of the BJP to finger SP and fuel the possibility of a triangular contest which could eventually benefit the saffron outfit electorally. The Election Commission data show that the BSP’s political advancement in 2007 had come at the cost of BJP while the vote share of SP has remained largely unaffected. Data show that while BJP’s vote share slipped from 20.08% in 2002 to 16.97% in 2007, the vote share of Mayawati’s party rose sharply from 23.06% in 2002 to 30.43% in 2007. The vote share of SP, however, remained unaffected at around 25% during the two assembly elections. Experts said that BSP and SP had turned into an alternative to each other after 2002 assembly elections when Mayawati formed the government with the help of BJP. When she resigned in August 2003, the then SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav took reins of the state with the support of BSP dissidents. In 2007, Mayawati returned to power after playing out the Brahmin-Dalit combo. This did not last in the 2012 assembly elections which saw SP returning to power after cornering 29.13% vote share and winning 224 seats. The vote share of both BSP and BJP shrunk to 25.91% and 15%, respectively. Mulayam’s son Akhilesh Yadav assumed power as the UP CM. Experts said that all through this, BJP found itself at the fringes, only to rise like a giant under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. And in 2017 assembly elections, the BJP wave swept through the state as the saffron party bagged 39.67% of total votes polled. This was way ahead of BSP’s 22.23% and SP’s 21.82% vote share. BJP sources said that the party has managed to ground itself as an infallible political force which is bound to be challenged by the region satraps by cobbling up alliances with various castes, including the Brahmins. “The rise of staunch nationalism and the coming of Ram Temple in Ayodhya have further unified the upper caste community steadfastly with the BJP,” said UP BJP spokesperson Hero Bajpai. Experts said that BJP’s political opponents have been making attempts to peddle an anti-Brahmin narrative vis-a-vis the ruling BJP headed by Yogi Adityanath, a Thakur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-discreet-silence-on-mayasbrahmin-outreach-a-ploy-to-dent-sp/articleshow/84743897.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Trichy||BDU to seek govt view on renaming distance edu centre||Trichy: The state government will decide on changing the name of the centre for distance education (CDE) of Bharathidasan University (BDU) to the centre for distance and online education (CDOE). BDU intended to change the name on the direction of UGC which had stated that dual mode higher education institution intending to offer programmes in open and distance learning (ODL) or online (OL) modes should have a centre for distance and online education (CDOE) for effective coordination among its departments. BDU launched 10 online programmes in January after UGC permitted higher educational institutions which figure among the top 100 institutions in the NIRF ranking for two years with NAAC score of over 3.26 to start full-fledged online programmes without prior approval. While CDE offers both ODL and OL programmes, the existing nomenclature of CDE will have to be changed to CDOE. A resolution was tabled at the syndicate meeting of BDU on Friday in this regard. While a few members opposed change in name, it was decided to seek opinion of the state government for the same. C Gunasekaran, one of the syndicate members who opposed the move, said they are concerned about the online programmes which will mostly be machine learning and lead to reduction of staff. Registrar in-charge G Gopinath told TOI that the name change has already been made and they will get the government’s nod for it. “We will have to change the nomenclature as the UGC directions are very clear about it. We will give proper justification for the change to the state government as per the request of the syndicate members,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bdu-to-seek-govt-view-on-renaming-distance-edu-centre/articleshow/84740817.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Nagpur||2 city psychiatrists leading nat’l initiative on suicide prevention||Nagpur: Suicide is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in young adults and adolescents. The number of people succumbing to suicides has increased significantly during the Covid times. Realizing the need for health professionals to deal with people suffering from suicidal tendencies, psychiatrists in the country have decided to start a unique training project online. Two senior psychiatrists from Nagpur, Dr Sudhir Bhave and Dr Abha Bang Soni, are leading this initiative being the co-chairpersons of the Suicide Prevention Committee of the Indian Association of Private Psychiatrists (IAPP). Dr Bhave said that compared to the lives lost due to suicide, the number of people attempting suicide is nearly three times higher. “Each of these can be prevented if help is offered and sought at the right time. But correct help for any mental health problem, including suicide, is very limited,” he said. The number of mental health professionals in India is very low. According to a recently concluded research, the number of psychiatrists in India varies from 0.05 in Madhya Pradesh to 1.2 in Kerala per lakh population. “There is a need to develop a workforce of trained professionals to act as first responders to prevent suicides. Initially, they will be doctors. Gradually, social workers, police and teachers will be involved,” said Dr Bhave. IAPP has collaborated with an NGO ‘Safe Space’ for this task. “Safe Space has done extensive work in suicide prevention. We have started ‘Suicide First Responder Training’ course along with them. This course has UK certification,” said Dr Bhave. IAPP president Dr Anukant Mittal told TOI that it’s a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country. “It’s a monthly course, held over two weekends. So far two batches of 16 participants each have been successfully trained. It includes training on prevention, intervention and post-vention of suicide,” he said. The next batch is scheduled for August and is already full. IAPP and Safe Space have planned to gradually expand the programme to involve other stakeholders like schools, colleges, police force etc. Dr Abha Bang Soni said that they hope to develop it as a ‘Train the Trainer’ programme to generate more trainers. “A wider educative opportunity has also been planned for those interested in mental health,” said the doctor. Nyana Sabharwal, director of Safe Space, is one of the trainers along with being the Convenor of the Suicide Prevention Committee. IAPP president Dr Mittal and secretary Dr Avinash D’Souza have been instrumental in designing and promoting this course.

---||Agra||3 young men, including 2 farmers, die of electrocution in Firozabad; six hurt||AGRA: Three residents of Dheerpura village under Nagla Singhi police station of Firozabad district died of electrocution on Sunday while five villagers got injured. According to locals, the group of men was trying to fix an 8.5m-long pole to lift the low-hanging power lines. In the process, the pole touched an 11,000 kV tension line passing over the field leaving three dead instantly. Six injured were sent to the trauma centre at the district hospital. According to police, the deceased were identified as Maharaj Singh (35) and Keshav Singh (22) – both of them farmers – and Rambraj (20) who used to work at a bangle manufacturing unit. Rambraj’s son Dharmveer alleged that the power department was informed about the low-hanging high-tension wires in the village, but they did nothing about it. Dheerpura gram pradhan Ajay Kumar said, “The electricity department is responsible for the death of three men. Maharaj Singh was the father of three minor daughters. Keshav was the father of a four-year-old girl. He was the eldest among his three brothers. Rambraj was also the eldest of his three brothers. He was unmarried and taking care of his younger brothers and an old mother. The incident has left the entire village in shock. Three families have lost their earning members.” Sub-divisional magistrate Bushra Bano said, “The bodies have been sent for postmortem examination. The six injured are getting treatment at the district hospital. They are out of danger. Power department officials have given a written assurance to the family of the deceased for monetary compensation.” Executive engineer of electricity distribution division (Tundla) Lokendra Bahadur Singh said, “No formal information was received for installation of an electricity pole in the village. The death of three men due to electrocution is an unfortunate incident. On the basis of the postmortem and investigation report by an electricity safety inspector, we are going to propose the headquarters for a Rs 5 lakh compensation to the families of the three deceased men.” Asked about the low-hanging wires in the village, Singh said, “We will ensure there are no low-hanging power supply cables in the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/3-young-men-including-2-farmers-die-of-electrocution-in-firozabad-six-hurt/articleshow/84738727.cms||---

During his five-hour stay in Ayodhya, the CM also held a marathon review meeting on progress of development projects, visited the ailing Ram temple Trust chairman, Nritya Gopal Das, before offering prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi. After inspecting medical facilities at Raja Dasrath Medical College and the recently installed oxygen plant, he said, “Preparations for the third wave are complete and even Ayodhya medical college is equipped to conduct 3,000 RTPCR tests daily." Medical colleges are key institutions to ensure specialised healthcare facilities, he said, “But in last 70 years, UP had only 12 medical colleges. We have built or sanctioned 32 medical colleges in just four-and-half years. We’re planning to set up medical colleges on PPP model before December,” he added. Emphasizing that rapid testing can curb virus transmission through early detection, isolation and contact tracing, the CM asserted the government was trying to expand facilities to enlarge testing capacity, which is currently 4 lakh tests a day. To firm up preventive measures to blunt the third wave, he asked the district administration to formulate a detailed action plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-fully-equipped-to-blunt-third-wave-says-yogi-in-ayodhya/articleshow/84743793.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Lucknow||Lucknow University student who uploaded porn on WhatsApp group arrested||LUCKNOW: The Lucknow University student who twice uploaded pornographic content on the Ancient Indian History and Archaeology department’s WhatsApp group was arrested on Sunday. The student had unabashedly christened himself ‘criminal’ in the SIM used for bombing obscenities in the WhatsApp group, which was formed to share presentations. Police identified the culprit as Aditya Singh, 20, a BA final year student, who hails from Pratapgarh. “During interrogation, he attributed his act to a growing frustration over his classmates’ unfriendly attitude. “They refused to talk or mix as I came from a small hamlet. I wanted to avenge this by uploading porn and drawing attention,” said Hasanganj SHO Yashkant Singh. Aditya was tracked down through cyber surveillance and phone details shared by women students, who earlier received similar messages in the department group. Singh has been booked for criminal intimidation, assault, use of criminal force against a woman and under the IT Act. On July 17, shock and anger swept LU after pornographic images were uploaded on a teaching WhatsApp group of Ancient Indian History and Archaeology (AIHA) department. The accused had also written lewd messages to some girl students and even a faculty member. AIHA students had requested the faculty to action, but when nothing happened, 40% students left the group in protest. Later a student, Abhinav Kumar Srivastava, took to Twitter to lodge a complaint with university officials after which department head Prof Piyush Bhargava lodged a complaint with the Proctor’s Office and an FIR was lodged at Hasanganj police station. Five days later, the accused again posted eight obscene images and targeted a student, Abhinav, who complained about the incident. Chief proctor Prof Dinesh Kumar said, “Police told us that a student of AIHA department has been arrested. We have called a meeting of the proctorial board on Monday to take disciplinary action against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-student-who-uploaded-porn-on-whatsapp-group-arrested/articleshow/84743838.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘Dutch dentist’ extracts Rs 1.38 lakh from Ahmedabad woman||AHMEDABAD: In another scam orchestrated on a matrimonial website, a Vastrapur woman has been duped of Rs 1.38 lakh by a man claiming to be a dentist from the Netherlands. Shraddha Shau, 28, who works with a private firm, filed the complaint on Saturday. She said that the man, identifying himself as Vihan Mehta, had contacted her on May 29. He told her that he had seen her profile on the matrimonial site. They began talking on WhatsApp calls. To gain Shau’s confidence, Mehta sent a picture of a document dressed up as his medical degree. He told her that he will seek a licence to open a clinic in India and sent her some documents, purportedly bearing the Indian Medical Association’s name. Shau said in her FIR that Mehta told her that he will send her some documents by courier, which were supposed to be dispatched to the medical association. On June 1, she got an email from a company called DCC Shipping. The mail said a parcel addressed to her had been received and she would have to pay Rs 32,700 to get it or it would be forwarded to a government authority. She sent the money using an UPI ID given in the email. Later, she received another email in which she was directed to pay Rs 1.05 lakh. The mail said foreign currency had been found in the parcel and she would get 70% of the amount at the time of delivery. When she asked Mehta about this, he told her that he was in another country and would not be able to pay at that time. But he assured her that he would repay her later. After she paid that amount, she received another email in which she was asked to deposit Rs 2.15 lakh as GST charge. Mehta again urged her to pay. By then, suspicion had set in and Shau did not make further payments. When she asked for the money she had paid earlier, Metha sent her a screenshot of a bank deposit. The FIR mentions ‘4,000 pounds’ as the amount that Mehta had claimed to send. Shau had received nothing at all from him. She eventually approached police and a complaint of cheating and breach of trust has been filed. The provisions of the IT Act have been invoked as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dutch-dentist-extracts-rs-1-38l-from-vastrapur-woman/articleshow/84740823.cms||---

He said that the two major unions, including the Kerala ration dealers’ association, will jointly protest the state’s decision. “If the state doesn’t backtrack on this announcement, we will look for legal help. The associations are stating that the government, which must pay around Rs 9 for every free kit distribution through ration shops, had promised to pay them Rs 5 per kit. While most ration dealers need to get Rs 25,000 dues from the government, there are shops with more ration card holders and thus have to get around Rs 60,000,” he said. “This payment is for the free kits distributed during the Covid times. We hope that the chief minister will look into the issue and the cabinet will find a solution as many of our members are facing severe financial crisis,” he added. It is the government’s duty to settle its dues. “They tell us that they have no money to pay us but food grains worth crores have found their way into the black market every month from the Supplyco godowns,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/non-payment-of-dues-ration-dealers-to-stage-dharna-today/articleshow/84740888.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He asked the ASI to take steps to preserve the commemorative arch erected near Valady in Trichy during the British regime for recognising the role of Indian soldiers in the allied powers’ victory in World War I.According to the stone tablets installed on the commemorative arch, it is said that the structure was installed in commemoration of the victory of the allied arms in which the Indian troops played a prominent role.Tiruchi Siva said that the monument is an arch bearing the inscription “Lest we forget,” a famous quote from Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘Recessional’. He said that he had made representations to former collectors of Trichy many times in vain. Saying that this sort of negligence defeats the very purpose of the construction of such monuments, he urged immediate steps to restore the monument.Responding to the letter, Maheswari said that she has requested the superintending archaeologist, ASI, Trichy circle, to take necessary action to conserve the war memorial known as Pachampettai Valaivu located between Mandurai and Keezha Valady on the Trichy-Lalgudi Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/asi-to-preserve-pachampettai-valaivu-heeding-mps-request/articleshow/84740793.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Varanasi||PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Siddharthnagar on July 30 deferred||GORAKHPUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s proposed visit to Siddharthnagar for the inauguration of medical college on July 30 has now been postponed and may be rescheduled in August. The change in itinerary follows a revision of plan as per which PM Modi will inaugurate the nine medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh after National Medical Commission (NMC) conducts their scheduled inspection and grants approval to them, said Siddharthnagar district magistrate Deepak Meena on Sunday. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath inspected the under construction medical college in Siddharthnagar on Sunday and told reporters that every district of the state will have a medical college before the completion of the five-year tenure of his government. “Before the completion of five years of our government, every district in the state will have a medical college. A medical college is required to have 300 beds and the district hospital which is associated with this medical college already has 320 beds, while 300 beds are being added in the new hospital. We will request PM Modi to inaugurate nine medical colleges in the state once NMC grants them approval,” said Yogi. Students will most likely get admission in the medical college from the coming session through NEET examination scheduled in September once it gets approval from NMC, which will also sanction the number of seats, the CM added. The medical college in Siddharthnagar will cater to the health needs of 30 lakh people of nearby districts as well as of Nepal, Yogi said. The CM added that eight other medical colleges are also ready and will be inaugurated after NMC’s approval. “The medical college in Deoria has been named after Devraha Baba, the medical college in Ghazipur is named after Maharshi Vishwamitra, Mirzapur medical college is named after Maa Vindhyavasini, Pratapgarh Medical College is named after Dr Sonelal Patel and Siddharthnagar Medical College is named after Madhav Prasad Tripathi,” the CM said. The chief minister academic sessions in eight medical colleges of the state started in 2020 and proved to be very useful during the pandemic. Covid is now under control in Uttar Pradesh and encephalitis deaths are at minimum level, he added. CM Yogi thanked PM Modi for setting up two AIIMS in the state in Gorakhpur and Rae Bareli. OPD services have already started at Gorakhpur AIIMS last year and 1,000-bed hospital most probably will be ready by the month of October and hopefully PM Modi will inaugurate it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-modis-visit-to-siddharthnagar-on-july-30-deferred/articleshow/84738839.cms||---
---||India||Amit Shah launches water supply in what was once ‘wettest place’||SHILLONG: Standing under an umbrella in pouring rain at what was once the world’s wettest place, Unionhome minister Amit Shah on Sunday reminisced about a childhood geography lesson that introduced him to Cherrapunji’s “ecological glory” — long before it bequeathed its crown to “another place” in Meghalaya. Shah, who was in Cherrapunji (Sohra) for the inauguration of a long-awaited mega water supply scheme, also launched the Green Sohra Afforestation Campaign with the promise of an all-out effort to restore the ecological uniqueness of one of the northeast’s more famous tourist destinations. Cherrapunji used to receive the highest average rainfall in the world before Mawsynrem wrested the title of “wettest place”. “Cherrapunji used to get rain throughout the year. But due to indiscriminate harvesting in the name of development, the situation has changed,” Shah said. He said the entire Sohra area would benefit from a massive plantation drive led by the Assam Rifles. “These plantations will be ready within three years.” Promising an end to the shortage of drinking water, he said the Rs 25-crore water project would provide drinking water to every household. The project was executed as part of the Prime Minister's Jal Jeevan Mission, and supported by the DoNER ministry and the Meghalaya government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amit-shah-launches-water-supply-in-what-was-once-wettest-place/articleshow/84745070.cms||Manosh Das
---||Varanasi||Environmentalist urges govt to find source of microplastics in Ganga||Varanasi: Noted environmental scientist and chairman of Mahamana Malaviya Research Centre for Ganga, River Development and Water Resource Management at Banaras Hindu University, Prof. B D Tripathi has urged the government to take immediate measures to find out the sources of microplastic pollution in the Ganga water, as claimed by a study conducted by Delhi-based NGO Toxics Link in collaboration with the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa. The study reportedly claims that the Ganga in Varanasi, Kanpur and Haridwar is polluted with multiple types of plastic. Highest concentration of single-use and secondary plastic products was found in the water at Varanasi. Microplastics are fragments of any type of plastic less than 5mm in length. “If it is true, it is a serious matter, and the government should take immediate action in this regard,” Tripathi told TOI on Sunday. “It is must to know how fragments of plastic, which is a non-degradable substance, are getting mixed with the Ganga water in Varanasi and other places,” he said, adding that the government should conduct a proper investigation, as it is a matter of serious concern of health as well as environment. Tripathi, however, added that he never came across such microplastic pollution in the Ganga in Varanasi. He has pioneered research on Ganga water pollution in Varanasi and studied different aspects of the pollution and suggested methods to control and manage the Ganga eco-system. “If the microplastic pollution is there in Ganga, it is a dangerous thing, which must be addressed immediately,” said Tripathi. However, the officials of UP Pollution Control Board denied any type of plastic pollution in Ganga in Varanasi. “There is regular monitoring on the use of single use plastics along the river. The people are also aware about it,” said regional officer of UPPCB Kalika Singh. According to the Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, the State Pollution Control Board and Pollution Control Committee in a Union territory shall be the authority for enforcement of the provisions of the rules relating to registration, manufacture of plastic products and multi-layered packaging, processing and disposal of plastic waste. “There are around 16-17 units engaged in producing plastic sheets for packaging of goods. They are not allowed to produce plastic sheets of less than 50 microns in thickness,” Singh told TOI, adding that these units use plastic bottles and other recyclable plastic materials collected by rag pickers. However, there is no data related to the generation of plastic waste from sachets of gutkha, paan masala, plastic wrappers and other consumable items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/environmentalist-urges-govt-to-find-source-of-microplastics-in-ganga/articleshow/84738810.cms||---

Apart from new entrants Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), now Mamata Banerjee’s party is also looking for a share of the spoils in the coming assembly election. A state body has been formed and a convener has been named for the party’s Gujarat unit. The party has decided to contest alone in the next assembly election. AITC Gujarat convener Jitendra Khadayta said the state body will soon be formed. “Trinamool Congress will contest the 2021 election with full force. It has been decided by the party high command that Trinamool Congress will contest as many seats as possible in the 2022 Gujarat assembly election. Our party will not have a tie-up with any other party,” newly appointed state AITC convener Jitendra Khadayta said. Mamata Banerjee’s July 21 speech was viewed by Khadayta and other AITC members at a hall in Isanpur area of the city.

---||Delhi||Home is where art was: Delhi flyovers’ makeover undone||NEW DELHI: Rajiv sells brooms in Lajpat Nagar’s Central Market. He came to Delhi from Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh with his wife and three children. They call the space under the flyover there their home. “I have heard that shelter homes are crowded and I cannot stay with my children there. I don’t earn much, so cannot afford to rent a room,” said Rajiv, whose two children were admitted to a nearby school this past week. The broom seller’s occupation of the public space is an example that the hard-fought battle to empty out and beautify the vacant spaces under the flyovers has received a setback after Covid-19 broke out. The boundary grilles at such spaces, erected during the beautification drive, now hold stacks of clothes and beddings. All around are sacks of household items and utensils, a sign that the homeless have reclaimed the flyover areas. The Public Works Department and the municipal corporations had started the exercise to rid these places of squatters in 2017-18, developing gardens and putting up art installations after clearing the accumulated malba and garbage. Over a dozen flyovers were beautified, with Rs 40-70 lakh spent on each of these beautification projects. The pandemic caused a lot of people to lose their income and their homes, forcing them back under the flyovers. At the flyover near Modi Mill in Okhla, south Delhi, nearly 100 people, mostly migrants from UP villages, have their temporary dwellings. When TOI visited the site last month, the occupiers had demarcated their separate spaces by hanging bedsheets or tarpaulin on the four sides, staying clear of the garbage heap nearby. While women were mostly cooking meals, a few men were making grinding stones (silbatta). Utensils and pots stored water and the people even were rearing chicken there. Shiva, a native of Uttar Pradesh’s Hardoi district, looked up from making a grinding stone and said, “Around five families from my village came here two months ago. We make and sell these silbatta. We were badly hit by the Covid pandemic and we thought we could make more money in Delhi than in Hardoi.” A similar scene played out at the Nehru Place flyover. Below the boards announcing the “beautification project”, beds and household items lay strewn around. Most of the denizens here are ragpickers, while the women and children augment the family by begging at the traffic intersection. At the Africa Avenue T-point near IIT-Delhi, the space under the flyover clearly showed habitation, with bags, clothes and mattresses in sight. There were small heaps of wood too, used by the squatters to cook. When TOI was at the spot, only some children were present. They were either playing or begging at the traffic junction. The condition under the Nizamuddin flyover was no different. Reshma, a mother of three children, said, “I like to live under this flyover because people give me free food. They also sometimes donate money and clothes.” At Munirka flyover, some women and children idled around. Bhuri and Rusali, who were making chapatis, said, “We live in the shanty opposite the flyover, but we spend our days under the flyover because we ask for alms at the traffic stop. We come here in the morning but we return to the shanty in the night to sleep.” The women added they have been living in this area for decades. A South Delhi Municipal Corporation horticulture department official said the population of flyover squatters was rising, but the civic body was helpless. “We have deployed guards and gardeners at several sites to protect the beautified space, but these families return some time after being evicted,” the official shrugged. “These families should be shifted to shelters, but these do not fall under our jurisdiction. DUSIB should take action,” Many of the affected flyovers were beautified by the PWD, one of whose officials said that when they received complaints about defacement, they sent their area engineers to the spot to get things fixed. However, the process is cumbersome, the official said, adding that once the beautification exercise was over, it wasn’t PWD’s responsibility to prevent the homeless from living under the flyovers. Bipin Rai, member, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), said, “When the flyovers were beautified on the order of the lieutenant governor, we provided shelter accommodation to the homeless, but many of them prefer to live off the food and donations they get on the street. We are trying to rehabilitate those still staying under the flyovers, but we cannot force them into our shelters.” Watch Delhi: Makeover undone, squatters make home under flyovers||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/home-is-where-art-was-flyovers-makeover-undone/articleshow/84739334.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Nagpur||Vaccination to resume today, more doses allotted to dist||Nagpur: After remaining affected on Sunday, Covid-19 vaccination will resume in the city but with limited slots on Monday. Apart from the stock received on Saturday, the district has been allotted more doses by state government on Sunday. Despite having received 27,000 doses of Covishield on Saturday and sufficient Covaxin doses in stock, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) did not conduct inoculation at its 153 centres across the city on Sunday. Vaccination has not happened on 20 of the last 33 days in the city since resumption of inoculation for 18-44 age group. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi urged people not to crowd centres as “only 100 slots will be available for 18-44 age group at Covishield centres on Monday because of low supply from the government”. There will be no such limit for 45-plus people. Covaxin doses will continue at five centres. On Sunday, 1,956 people took the jab at 17 private centres. Considering the cumulative and latest data, very less number of people are taking the jab in private centres as compared to NMC centres despite irregular availability of doses at the latter. If sufficient doses are available, around 30,000 people are taking the jab in a day at NMC centres. As per NMC’s data, 12,36,232 doses were administered in the city as on Saturday. Of total doses, 11,45,771 (92.68%) were administered in NMCs centres and remaining 90,461 (7.32%) in private centres. The demand for vaccination has increased manifold since resumption of inoculation for 18-44 age group on June 23. Since then, the supply at NMC centres has been irregular. All three vaccines — Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V — are available in private centres since May 31. In rural areas, 7,515 people took the jab on Sunday. Thus, 9,471 people were benefitted in the district on Sunday. The government has allotted fresh stock of 81,000 doses of Covishield for the district on Sunday. The doses are expected to arrive on Monday. This will help in continuation of vaccination on Tuesday in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccination-to-resume-today-more-doses-allotted-to-dist/articleshow/84753938.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Amid heavy deployment of police force, the district administration and police officials seized Phoolan’s statue, who is now a rallying point of Nishad outfits in the run-up to the UP Assembly polls. The event was part of a programme organized by the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), which had recently announced to install statues Phoolan’s statues in 18 districts (with sizeable population of Nishad community) across the state and observe her death anniversary on July 25. A programme to install and unveil a 20-ft tall statue of Phoolan Devi on the occasion of her 20th death anniversary (July 25) was proposed at the premises of a private school in Badli Purwa village of Bangarmau Kotwali police area. The event was to be attended by leaders of Vikassheel Insaan Party, who had to install and unveil the statue. As soon as the information spread, the district administration on late Saturday night swung into action and stopped the arrangements with regard to the unveiling of Phoolan’s statue slated for Sunday and deployed a heavy police force. Circle Officer (CO) Bangarmu, Ashutosh Kumar said that they had received information that the statue was to be unveiled at a private school in Badli Purwa village of the district. The police rushed to the spot and questioned the organizers in this regard. “The organizers had not taken permission from the district administration for organizing the function in the prevailing corona pandemic. We later took the statue into our custody and shifted it to Bangarmau police station. Further investigations are underway in this regard,” said CO further said. Sources informed that some villagers tried to protest causing tense moments but the police pacified them. Phoolan Devi, who belonged to the Nishad community, was elected MP on the Samajwadi Party ticket from Mirzapur. She was assassinated on July 25, 2001 outside her residence in Delhi. The Vikassheel Insaan Party, which is a partner in the ruling alliance with the Janata Dal (United) and the BJP in neighbouring Bihar, had announced to install statues of the late Phoolan Devi in 18 districts where the Nishads could play a major role in the UPs upcoming 2022 Assembly polls. To recall, on Friday, Varanasi police had seized statues of Phoolan Devi after locals made a complaint objecting to its installation in the Nishad-dominated locality. A total of 20 persons, including 17 Thakurs, one Muslim, one Dalit and one belonging to the OBC, were killed, while six others injured by Phoolan and her aides on February 14, 1981 in Behmai in Kanpur Dehat. The families of the victims are still waiting for justice that has eluded them even 40 years after the carnage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/district-administration-stalls-unveiling-of-phoolan-devis-statue-in-unnao/articleshow/84743338.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Ahmedabad||Adani, DP World may join Nargol port race||AHMEDABAD: The race for the greenfield port at Nargol in Gujarat has got hotter. Companies such as DP World, a Dubai-based logistics firm, Gautam Adani controlled Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), Essar Group, and JM Baxi Group have evinced interest in the project. The four companies participated in a pre-bid meeting held earlier this week, said sources aware of the developments. International Cargo Terminals and Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (ICTIPL), a JM Baxi Group company, and DP World participated online in the pre-bid meeting. Senior representatives of Adani Group and Ruias-controlled Essar Ports Ltd attended in person. The meeting was called by the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), the state maritime regulator, said a senior government official. The state government recently put the development of the proposed Nargol port on the fast-track after the GMB cancelled the contract given to Cargo Motors for the development of the port. This was done after the company missed several deadlines for project execution. The government has decided to start afresh by inviting global bids to develop Nargol port with an initial investment of Rs 3,800 crore. The state government’s move comes at a time when less than 50km away at Vadhavan in the neighbouring Maharashtra, the central government is working on a plan to develop a major port. The estimated investment for the project is pegged at Rs 65,000 crore. Officials of Adani Group and Essar Group confirmed that they were present at the pre-bid meeting. Testing the waters: The maritime board officials faced about 200 queries from the pre-bid meeting participants but the officials did not respond immediately. “Not a single query was answered. The GMB officials later assured us that they will post replies to all our queries online by the end of this month,” said one of the participants. “But then what was the point of calling a pre-bid meeting when all the participants had submitted their queries by mail?” The government may be serious about the implementation of the project, but there are a lot of areas of concern in the RFP (request for proposal) document, said an official working with a port developer. The official added that the government should come up with solutions, failing which developers may begin questioning the viability of the project. The bidding process for a greenfield port in Gujarat comes after about nine years. In the past, bidding was done by offering a floor limit of over 100% for waterfront royalty charges. In the case of Modhawa port, the base limit was as high as 127%. For Nargol port, for the first time perhaps, the GMB has offered a discount of 20% for the waterfront charges in line with its Schedule of Port Charges (SoPC). Also, the concession period under the state’s build-operate-own-transfer (BOOT) policy has been extended from 30 years to 50 years. “One of the major areas of concern for the developers is that after the completion of 50 years, the developers will have to transfer all the rights of the port to the government,” said an industry expert. “There will be no consideration for the book value or even the depreciated value of the assets. Under these circumstances, a port developer may stop making fresh investments after a couple of decades.” Another area of concern is that the work and expenditure on road and rail infrastructure is to be borne by the developer which is above and over the Rs 3,800 crore port development cost. “Any change in the lease rentals will affect the feasibility of the port and hence we request the GMB to ensure that the existing land lease policy will be applicable throughout the BOOT period,” DP World said in one of its queries. The Dubai-based infrastructure developer has submitted more than 100 queries to the GMB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/adani-dp-world-may-join-nargol-port-race/articleshow/84740882.cms||Maulik Pathak

And of late, many have formed teams battling it out under floodlights in football turfs that have cropped up in the city and suburbs. Catering to the growing number of sports buffs, a few turfs big enough to host a five a-side game have mushroomed in Trichy recently, drawing in the techies by droves. WHF techies and professionals, exhausted frontline professionals, and the common public vying to overcome the lockdown blues are sweating it out at the recreational facilities set up by a few startups. The artificial turfs with 20-30ft-tall metal fencing on all sides offer a mini version of football and cricket, an unconventional experience for the local people. Sprawling across 5,000 to 7,000sqft area, the futsal can engage a maximum of 12 players at a time. The participants will go up if indoor cricket was opted. Public using the facility were charged on an hourly basis ranging from Rs 800 to Rs 1,500. “Besides the WFH professionals, corporate firms are making bulk bookings on the weekends to rejuvenate their employees. Even families are visiting us for group relaxation after the easing of lockdown restrictions,” P Anandh, co-owner, Kalam football turf near KK Nagar, said. The startups were jointly run by a group of 4-5 young entrepreneurs who are employed in Chennai where they have become accustomed to the turf games. A sum of Rs 25-30 lakh was spent on setting up the entire infrastructure and they believe that the investment may yield returns despite the lockdown as Trichy is deprived of outdoor recreational zones. “Besides renting our turf, we plan to offer football coaching for kids and yoga training for adults with the help of professionals. We are running full on weekends which shows how desperate people are to step out,” D Jaikumar, managing partner of TN 45 turf, said. Families are also sending their wards to the turfs to engage them in physical activities as most of the kids are engrossed in smartphones and video gaming. Besides the football turf, the city has also seen floodlit tennis courts and badminton courts cropping up on the suburbs post the lockdown relaxation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/football-turfs-gaining-ground-in-trichy/articleshow/84740942.cms||Deepak Karthik

A few locals, who noticed four men and a woman -- all strangers -- doing something “suspicious” on the outskirts of Agra’s Jodhpura village, on the margins of once notorious Chambal ravines, had called police. By the time a police team arrived, the group had left the place in Pinhat area, leaving behind a dead and buried child, a pack of incense sticks, a knife, a spade and some other material used in offering prayers. Locals believe that the child was killed as part of a ritual on Guru Purnima night. Killing of children is not unheard of in the region, where superstition reigns and sorcery is used to please god and goddesses. While some believe it will bring good fortune, others think it will cure critical illness. The body of the child, with a red cloth on it, was sent for post-mortem examination. Local police have circulated his photo in its attempt to locate his family members. According to police, at times it is the family members who carry out the murder at the direction of occultist. Station house officer (SHO) of Pinhat, Pradeep Kumar Chaturvedi, said, “The body has been sent for post-mortem examination to ascertain the exact cause of death. The photo and other description of the child have been circulated in the neighbouring districts of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan in an attempt to find his family members and the accused. The matter is being investigated and further action will be taken after the post-mortem report comes.” A local, Girish, said that the four men and a woman came after the dark and left without the child. “They buried the child and left after some prayers. It appears that they performed some black magic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/toddlers-body-exhumed-in-agra-on-suspicion-of-human-sacrifice/articleshow/84738837.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The petition was filed by Vilasini Ramachandran of Ernakulam challenging her son’s detention. It was contended that preventive detention under Section 3 of Kaapa is in direct conflict with the one provided under Section 3 of NSA. Therefore, Kaapa is unconstitutional and violates Article 254, which stipulates that law passed by Parliament will prevail if there is any conflict with that passed by a state legislature. State government had contended that NSA deals with national security and Kaapa deals with maintenance of public order.  HC held that the legislation referred to are enacted by Parliament and the state legislature on two different aspects contained in Entry 3 of List III of 7th Schedule to the Constitution. There is no legislation by Parliament on matters dealt with in Kaapa. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-rejects-plea-challenging-kaapas-validity/articleshow/84740976.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Why they may not pass muster in foreign universities||NEW DELHI: Covid-19 continues to challenge students. Many students applying abroad require to submit pass certificates, but with the delay in examinations, applicants have to make do with provisional certificates. A few like IP University are taking time to issue even that, causing worry among students. A student at IP University said his exams had got over only in July and “it is unlikely that the university will issue our results and even a provisional certificate soon. But the university in the United Kingdom where I have applied requires documents by early August for finalising the admission”. Arnav Aggarwal, another IP University student, said his US university had been a bit lenient and had asked for his documents by late August. He hopes to get the results soon as he has to submit his provisional certificate or transcripts at University of California, San Diego in a month. “My classes begin from August 2 and my visa interview will take place in a few weeks. I am thinking of starting my classes online and get the visa once the results are out.” Delhi University has initiated the process of giving online provisional certificates, said dean of exams D S Rawat. “We get several requests and initiate the process of providing them provisional certificates. Many students haven’t cleared their college dues. But since it is not feasible for them to go to college now, they can clear the dues when they go to their respective colleges for the final certificate,” Rawat said. Abhyuday Singla, a Hindu College graduate who has got an online provisional certificate from DU, said his institute had given him the required documents, but his US university needed a provisional certificate. “I have now got a digital certificate from DU and my US university has given me a year to submit the original. But often DU takes two years to provide the original certificate. So, there could be some trouble later.” Raju Nair, the controller of examination at IP University, said that because of the Covid-19 restrictions, the department had initiated the process of issuing provisional certificates. The certificates will be sent to the colleges from where students can collect them soon.” Alok Bansal, a career counsellor and consultant for studies abroad, however, said students didn’t need to worry. “Many foreign universities would be ready to provide admissions if students submit an undertaking that they would submit their documents soon,” Bansal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-they-may-not-pass-muster-in-foreign-univs/articleshow/84739294.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Though the work was affected due to the Covid-19 second wave, five flags on around 100-feet-tall high-mast poles were expected to be installed by Independence Day. The “Deshbhakti Budget” was presented on March 12. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that the government was trying to inspire feelings of deshbhakti through the budget in the next one year. Sources in Delhi government said that national flags on around 100-feet-high poles would soon be installed at five locations before August 15. One flag would come up in the New Delhi assembly constituency and the rest at Patparganj, Dwarka, Kalkaji and Shakur Basti. During his budget speech, deputy CM and finance minister Manish Sisodia had said that high-mast flags, like the monumental flag at Connaught Place, would be installed in a way so that every 2km at least one was visible to Delhiites. He said people would not return to their homes without the sentiment of patriotism when they came out even for short distances. A budget of Rs 45 crore was set aside for installation of the 500 flags. The work was entrusted to the Public Works Department and a meeting was convened last week to ensure that at least five flags were installed before Independence Day. A survey was also carried out to finalise the locations, which included schools, large parks, residential and commercial complexes and other public places, to install the flags. During the presentation of the budget, Kejriwal had said that “whenever we see our flag, we are filled with patriotism to the brim” and people witnessing flags across Delhi every morning “will inspire feelings of nationalism in them”. Many other programmes and activities were also planned as part of 75 years of India’s Independence. During the budget session, it was also announced that the deshbhakti curriculum would be started in government schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/five-of-500-national-flags-planned-across-the-city-to-come-up-before-i-day/articleshow/84740968.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The 27-year old now waits for doctors to fix the permanent prosthetic which may bring back her looks and along with it normal life. It may take around three months for it to be finally ready. The doctors are working on making implants that would exactly match her earlier looks. An IT professional posted in Mumbai, she is now recovering at Chandrapur. In a way an archaeologist or anthropologist would use skeletal remains to create probable looks of a person died centuries ago, a 3-D image of Archana’s face will be generated on a computer programme. Based on it, bones of the same size that were removed due to mucormycosis will be made. It’s called a stereolithographic model of the face that would provide the exact dimensions to make the prosthetic, said doctors and added that Archana may look the same or very close to it. For Archana, the whole process cost Rs1.5 lakh and has been covered under insurance too. A known technology though it has not been a common procedure as such, doctors are now trying it for mucormycosis patients whose facial bones have been removed. “The procedure normally happens in cases of a severe injury or gunshot wounds,” said a doctor. With mucormycosis new to even doctors, it’s hoped that customized prosthetics may bring a ray of hope for a number of patients like Archana. Dr Vipin Dehane from Kingsway Hospital who is treating Archana said that in her case not only the maxilla (upper jaw bone) but even the palate bone (part touches the tongue from upper side) was removed leaving a hollow above. “Given her age, getting face restored was the first priority,” he said. He further said that a conventional teeth implant is fixed on the maxilla, which was removed in this case, leading to the need of creating new bones matching the original looks. Archana said that it initially left a psychological impact on her. “I was married in January and in April I got admitted due to Covid. I also felt a severe jaw pain at that time. After going to the dentist first, it was finally confirmed that it was mucormycosis,” she said. Able to speak clearly, she now puts a denture. “The face is not exactly the same. The disfigurement will go only after the permanent implant is put,” said Archana putting up a brave face. According to Dr Dehane, another 25-year-old patient form Madhya Pradesh will also be undergoing the same procedure. The procedure has been adopted for a number of other patients too. Dr Raman Bonde from Amravati said that he has operated as many as 50 patients of mucormycosis infection. “Now, the restoration procedure would begin,” he said. “Stereolithographic model is normally used for patients of severe injury or gun shots. It is expected to work on those operated for mucormycosis too. Only time will tell how successful the method has been in the long run,” he said. Dr Rahul Atara, an endodontist who was part of the team, said that the method is not very popular but conventional implant was not working on the patient. “After a bit of study this was found to be suitable for mucormycosis patients. It’s an established procedure but not tried much here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hit-with-mucor-soon-after-marriage-27-yr-old-awaits-facelift/articleshow/84753965.cms||Shishir Arya

I feel that Congress is a third-class C team of BJP. I suspect that Congress connived with BJP to sell its MLAs.” He also accused Congress of playing the communal card. “Congress has been wiped out and is now practising communalism. It has lost everything and therefore, it is now taking every issue on communal lines,” he said. The Delhi power minister said that both Congress and BJP are “scared” of AAP as they know it isn’t possible to purchase AAP MLAs. “In 2014, BJP needed just four MLAs to stake claim to form the government in Delhi.

A preliminary study carried out by the highways department was submitted to the state government, further a detailed project report for a new bridge likely to cost around Rs 80 crores will be prepared. The existing Cauvery bridge was commissioned in 1976 during the former chief minister M Karunanidhi’s rule as an alternative to the defunct British-era steel bridge that connected Srirangam and Thiruvanaikoil with the rest of the Trichy city. However, the 45-year-old bridge due to the lapses in periodical maintenance has developed multiple flaws with people complaining of difficulty in accessing the 540-metre-long link over the Cauvery river. Although the state highways department conducted a study in September 2020, the proposal did not materialise. Meanwhile, the municipal administration minister K N Nehru confirmed that a new bridge will be built across the Cauvery river. “The previous government damaged the existing bridge’s structure by conducting frequent maintenance work. DPR will be sought for a new bridge as an alternative,” said the minister. Earlier, the state highways department had planned to take up a major overhaul in the bridge at a cost of Rs 7 crores. Highways official sources said the existing bridge has a life for about 20 years, even if a new bridge was formed, the existing bridge can be strengthened to serve the public movement. Official sources said the new bridge is proposed on the upstream side (Kambarasampettai end) where there is viability for land acquisition to make approach roads. The new bridge is anticipated to cost around Rs 80 crores. State highways sources said a DPR will be prepared soon with the help of senior engineers. Meanwhile, the public had sought an alternative bridge in the upstream Cauvery river passing through Mutharasanallur, thereby linking the Melur village in Srirangam and further across a bridge over the Kollidam river to merge with Nochiyam near the Number one tollgate. “New bridge across Cauvery, away from the existing bridge can only decongest the city and suburbs,” P Aiyarappan, said Trichy-based road safety activist. Sources said that DPR for the new Cauvery bridge will be taken up with the financial year 2021-2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/new-four-lane-bridge-across-cauvery-on-cards/articleshow/84740933.cms||Deepak Karthik

Activists claim many of the admissions have taken place based on fake documents and it must be probed. Shahid Sharif, an RTE activist, said, “The issue of parents submitting fake address proof and income certificates has been a regular feature of the RTE admission process. What such fraudulent activity does is that it deprives a genuine student from taking admission in a school which is his or her right.” Recently Sharif traced an address submitted by a parent which led the verification team to an empty plot. Sharif said, “We conduct verification of documents in tandem with the education department and schools. This helps them scrutinize applications and ensure that only valid ones are processed. This time, we found that one of the addresses mentioned in an application was not even a house, but a vacant plot.” Sharif said such incidents are common, but still the shock value increases with one or the other case every year. He said, “These issues do not happen only with parents, but sometimes schools too. Once we had an issue with a school whose old address was reflected in the RTE online database. When we visited the school, we found it was a closed shop with a goat tied outside.” Though parents can be criminally prosecuted for forging documents, no cases actually reach the police. A school principal told TOI that pursuing the matter was not worth the time and effort. “If an FIR is filed, then it becomes a lengthy process and one of our staff will be engaged in it. There will be days or weeks when he will be seated outside the police station and will spend similar time when the matter goes to court. So, we simply warn the parent after the forgery has been detected and tell him/her to withdraw the application.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fakery-continues-to-dog-rte-admissions/articleshow/84753982.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

So far, the training was mostly held through digital platforms, but after the relaxations and the fall in the number of Covid-19 cases, people started visiting yoga centres for learning exercises better. “Clients are specifically asking for exercises to improve the functioning of lungs and dedicated training to improve immunity. Certain people prefer training for learning the nuances of each asana as there are practical difficulties in teaching online,” T Santhanakrishnan, yoga trainer in Srirangam, said. Pranayama practice, tadasana, ardha matsyendrasana and bhujangasana were taught in priority for those looking for breathing exercises. As the second wave of Covid-19 had impacted the functioning of lungs, medical practitioners have suggested breathing exercises leading to a surge in enquiries at the yoga training centres here. Even those who had recently recovered from Covid-19 are coming for mild training. Those who have completed their isolation are depending on digital platforms to learn the asanas. As it was mostly middle-aged and senior citizens who were keen on yoga training, yoga centres said that even youths are joining monthly coaching programmes after the second wave. The restrictions on gyms are impacting the enquiries at the gyms. “People want to indulge in workouts only in morning hours, but there are restrictions, and we have to limit the people inside the gym at a time as per the SoP. And those who recently recovered from Covid were advised not to pursue heavy workout,” Vignesh Ramanathan, a gym owner from Thillai Nagar, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/immunity-asanas-breathing-exercises-in-much-demand/articleshow/84740951.cms||Deepak Karthik

Taking a cue from last year’s Pettimudy disaster, the government relocated residents from the area. The Centre for Wireless Networks and Applications (CWNA), under the deemed university Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, has given a report to Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) that it has detected possibilities of landslides near Anthoniar Colony in Munnar. “First-level regional warning for landslides using global and site-specific rainfall thresholds have been crossed. So we request citizens to be alert and be watchful about the situation in Munnar region. The first-level alert indicates that there are possibilities of landslides in the landslide-prone areas surrounding our deployment site in Anthoniar Colony, Munnar,” said the analysis report by Maneesha V Ramesh, director of the centre and also the member of KSDMA’s landslide advisory committee. The report, prepared after analyzing the rainfall, says that at the specific location, thresholds have been crossed to reach the second level. “We could see the surfaces are slowly losing their strength since the pore pressure in the vulnerable layers have shown a steady increase of 27.95% in the last 24 days. This can lead to soil slips in and around the site. Hence if the rain continues at this rate or increases further, the probability of soil slips and landslides can be initiated in the nearby regions. Therefore, caution and constant vigilance is advised,” it said. On the basis of the report, Idukki district administration has already relocated residents in Anthoniar Colony and Ikka Nagar (another colony nearby) to safer locations. “We received the alert regarding this from the state emergency operations centre. We have already shifted 44 persons residing in the area to safe camps and another 114 persons have relocated to houses of their relatives in safer areas,” said Sheeba George, Idukki district collector. CWNA has developed and deployed a wireless sensor network for landslide detection consisting of more than 100 geological sensors and more than 10 wireless sensor nodes at six locations in Munnar area. This system, functional since 2009, monitors the deployment site, collecting and transmitting data round the clock. The landslide disaster of August 2020 at Pettimudy near Munnar had claimed 70 lives (66 confirmed dead and four bodies still missing). The district administration has also sought the services of a second team of National disaster response force (NDRF) in addition to the existing team stationed in the district. It is learnt that the government has sanctioned the second team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/landslides-very-likely-in-munnar-govt-warned/articleshow/84741036.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 4,000 families at risk as wall at Mulund hills incomplete||MUMBAI: Around 4,000 slum families are living with landslide risk at Mulund hills as the state government is yet to sanction the entire fund amount for a retaining wall along the slopes. BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha said in 2019, Mhada had proposed to build a 2km-long retaining wall along the slopes in Bhandup and Mulund for an estimated Rs 10.5 crore, but only Rs 1.3 crore was sanctioned and a small portion of the wall constructed. The slum pockets spread across the slopes that are at risk include Rahul Nagar, New Rahul Nagar, Shankar Tekdi, Amar Nagar, Hanuman Pada and Khindi Pada. “The 20,000 residents are at risk not just from landslides, but the old retaining wall itself. There is no wall at several locations, and the structure that exists in some areas is dilapidated and needs to be either rebuilt or re-strengthened,” Kotecha said. “We have been raising the issue before the district planning and development committee (DPDC), but funds have not been sanctioned for the wall yet.” The DPDC sanctioned funds, and the wall was constructed by Mhada-appointed contractors. Mumbai suburban guardian minister and DPDC chairperson Aaditya Thackeray said that construction of retaining walls is being taken up on priority. “For years, the demand for landslide protection walls has been raised, but it seems it was not met,” said Tha-ckeray. “Since December 2019, we have been giving priority to building retaining walls...For requests raised last year, all available funds were given. This year too I have asked the district planning officer to ensure funds are disbursed.” Thackeray added: “What is dangerous though and most of us ignore is that at the recent landslides at Peddar Road, Chembur and Bhandup even the strong protection walls were broken by the force of water and mud. In Vikhroli, the sludge came over the wall and engulfed huts.” A 2010 survey by Mhada’s Slum Improvement Board and the BMC had found that close to 1 lakh families lived on hill slopes of Mumbai of which around 22,483 were in dangerous or vulnerable zones. Currently, activists and experts estimate that around 1.5 lakh families live on slopes, and of these thousands of families are living in dangerous zones. Last week, 29 people died in two landslide incidents in Mahul and Vikhroli after heavy rainfall. In both the cases, the BMC claimed that they had issued warnings to the slumdwellers but they did not move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4000-families-at-risk-as-wall-at-mulund-hills-incomplete/articleshow/84743071.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The deceased has been identified as Kailash Nath. Police said that Nath stayed with his two sons who are unmarried. His wife had passed away six years ago. The incident happened when his sons had gone out for work and Nath was alone at home. Around 3.30pm, neighbours noticed smoke coming out of the house and alerted the fire and police department. They also tried to rescue Nath but failed. Two fire tenders were rushed to the spot that doused the blaze. Cops suspect that Nath could not escape from the fire as he was sleeping. He was found unconscious on his cot with burn injuries on his legs. The officials rushed him to hospital, but he was declared dead on arrival. The police handed over the body to his sons after an autopsy. An FIR was registered in connection with the incident and an inquiry is underway to ascertain the cause of fire, officials said. Cops are probing if a short circuit led to the blaze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/75-year-old-suffocates-to-death-in-house-fire/articleshow/84741012.cms||---

The northwest Delhi Police has also recovered Rs 30 lakh cash that was looted. According to DCP Usha Rangnani, five of the suspects were executors while four were involved in the conspiracy. The executors have been identified as Rajat, Santosh, Deepak, Parvez and Sameer, all in early twenties and residents of Kirari-Suleiman Nagar in northwest Delhi. The others have been identified as Jafar, Rakesh, Vikas and Sumit, all in their mid-twenties. On July 5, an FIR was registered on businessman Parveen Jain’s statement that he and his two staffers were present in the office when a group of men barged in around 2.30pm. They claimed to have come to check rice samples, but soon held the victims at gunpoint, took the money and fled. “In CCTV footage, five persons were seen coming on two motorcycles. They were wearing helmets and returned with two-three bags in their hands,” the DCP said. The footage analysis of almost 250-300 cameras revealed that they had come from Kirari-Suleiman Nagar side. The owners of the bikes said they had lent the two-wheelers for a share in the loot. Jafar and Rakesh, employees of Jain’s business associate, had tipped off the gang. After the heist, they fled to Jammu and subsequently to Lucknow and Nepal. They returned thinking the heat was off. A pistol, cartridges, knives and the bikes have also been seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nine-arrested-for-pitampura-dacoity-of-early-july-rs-30-lakh-recovered/articleshow/84741010.cms||---

---||Delhi||2022 target for multilevel parking at Chandni Chowk||New Delhi: Come 2022, the pedestrian-only Chandni Chowk will have a multilevel parking facility. As the proposal to pedestrianise the 1.3km road from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid between 9am and 9pm has already been notified, the company that is working on the multilevel parking-cum-commercial project is gearing up to make the facility available to lakhs of visitors coming to this heritage shopping, food and tourism destination by next year. “The construction is progressing at a great speed despite the multiple hindrances on account of the construction ban due to pollution in 2019 and the lockdowns because of the two waves of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021,” said Shravan Govil, CEO, Omaxe Heritage. An official said advanced technologies, such as a composite steel-frame structure to expedite construction and to grant strength to the structure, were being used for its construction. We are certain about the commencement of multilevel parking by next year, the official claimed. While the phase-I structure is ready, a majority of work under phase-II is also complete. The excavation work has also been done in phase-III. Chandni Chowk is one of Asia’s largest and busiest wholesale and retail hubs. The multilevel parking facility will accommodate over 2,100 cars and 81 tourist buses in five floors, including three underground ones. Three floors will be dedicated for retail spaces and a food court. The plan also proposes a direct entry from Chandni Chowk Metro Station. The facility is located in the heart of Chandni Chowk from where markets, religious and tourism destinations and Old Delhi Railway Station are at a walking distance. “The next-generation project will not only give a facelift to Chandni Chowk, but also herald modernisation of the region and provide convenience to shoppers and businessmen,” Govil added. With things seem to be coming back to normal after the second wave of Covid-19, North Delhi Municipal Corporation and other agencies are expecting huge crowds at the market again. Now that pedestrianisation is becoming the new normal, the parking facility will help both shoppers and traders, said a government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2022-target-for-multilevel-parking-at-chandni-chowk/articleshow/84741086.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

Known for some pioneering efforts in its battle against the pandemic, the civic administration has been ensuring aggressive Covid testing measures since the beginning which has resulted into high testing rate. While the municipal limits of Aurangabad were first in the state to carry out mandatory Covid testing of traders and vendors, such screenings also covered key government offices and city entry-points among other locations. Dr Neeta Padalkar, health officer with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said aggressive testing has helped in containing the spread of Covid-19 earlier as compared to other metros. “Both RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests have been used effectively to carry out Covid testing. Even if active cases have dropped considerably now, the tests are still being carried out at key points,” she said. As per official data, as many as 8,95,130 swab samples have been collected within the municipal limits of Aurangabad for Covid testing during the current pandemic. It includes 5,19,929 swabs samples for the purpose of performing antigen tests and 3,75,201 collected for RT-PCR testing. On Sunday, Aurangabad reported 1,349 Covid tests and positivity rate of 0.82% which also included results of tests conducted between Saturday and Sunday. Meanwhile, Aurangabad reported 11 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, taking the tally of active cases to 49. The city also registered one death due to Covid-19, which has increased the progressive count of casualties to 1,942.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-city-7-in-10-tested-for-covid/articleshow/84738898.cms||---

Flood and landslide deaths across the state rose to 149 while the missing numbered 64. CM Uddhav Thackeray visited some of the affected parts and learnt that the locals were still asking for food, water, medicines and fodder for animals. “There is massive shortage of food and water for the locals,” Rajendra Shinde, a Chiplun (Ratnagiri) resident, said. “Animals suffer from non-availability of fodder. Doctors are unavailable in the township but the administration is claiming arrival of medical teams. Even muddy roads have not been cleaned.” Amid the chaos, there was confusion over the number of missing too, as the Mantralaya control room figure of 64 was contradicted by the CM’s office, which counted 100 people as missing in the 72 hours till Sunday evening. The Mantralaya control room said 35 of the total 64 missing were from the worst-affected Raigad district, where 60 people died and 28 were injured. A landslide in Taliye village of Raigad following incessant rain on Thursday was the major killer, claiming 53 persons. The missing figure in Taliye was 31. With 45 houses destroyed, survivors were complaining about lack of food, water and medical help. Tribals of Taliye, which is in Mahad taluka, said an earthquake 14 years ago had resulted in a crack in a hillock, causing the latest landslide, but authorities did not confirm the claim. “No tremor related crack record is available in the administration records,” Raigad additional SP Sachin Gunjal said. An official said most of the missing would be cases of people buried in landslides or washed away in the flood waters. The official said chances of survival after four days were slim. Another official said the rescue operations had not stopped, with NDRF, SDRF, army, navy and coast guard teams still at work in affectd districts. A total of 2,29,074 people have been evacuated from their homes — 1,200 of these were from Ratnagiri, 1,000 from Raigad, 1,271 from Sindhudurg and 1,69,998 from Sangli. “A one-and-a-half-year-old male child is still missing at the Pedhegaon landslide site, Chiplun,” inspector Ram Yadav of the NDRF said. In the MMR, local train services on the Karjat-Khopoli section, shut for over three days, were restored on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/still-missing-in-konkan-50-people-besides-food-water-medicines-in-mumbai/articleshow/84743163.cms||Umesh K Parida

With the level nearing 136ft, the district collector has issued a prior intimation to authorities, including police and emergency response teams, to take all necessary precautions and to be prepared to shift people living on the river banks in the wake of heavy rains continuing in the district. In the case of the Mullaperiyar dam, the first intimation is issued when the water level touches 136ft and the first warning is issued when the level reaches 140ft. While the average inflow of water into the Mullaperiyar dam was 4,108cumec on Sunday, Tamil Nadu was drawing water at 900cumecs only. The Supreme Court has fixed the maximum permissible water limit in the dam at 142ft. The storage level in the main hydel dams in the state are all over 60%, said officials. The water level in Idukki reservoir touched 2,368.90ft on Sunday, which is 63% of the total storage. When the water level is at 2,372.58ft a blue alert will be issued and the shutters of the dam would be opened only if the level reaches the red alert level of 2,379ft. “We are closely monitoring the water levels in Idukki and Mullaperiyar dams. The district administration will ensure that the waters from Mullaperiyar dam are not released to Idukki reservoir suddenly without prior information,” said district collector Sheeba George. “A district disaster management committee meeting held in the presence of revenue principal secretary reviewed the situation at the dams in the district. In the present scenario, there is no need to worry about the water level in the reservoirs,” she said. The Central Water Commission has fixed the rule-curve level in Idukki reservoir at 2,380.58ft. Supriya S, KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP), said KSEB will strictly follow the rule-curve level issued by Central Water Commission. “We have received information about the formation of a new depression. Water will be released as per the direction from the district collector. At present, there is no threat of opening the shutters as the rains have subsided,” she said. “In the wake of changed rain pattern, we can’t make any prediction over the water levels or storage in the hydel dams. Idukki dam has a catchment area of 650sqkm and the actual amount of rainfall will be different in various locations,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mullaperiyar-water-level-rises-by-4ft-in-four-days/articleshow/84741111.cms||Sandeep Thomas

As per the survey some of the canals in the city has done a “vanishing act” along certain stretches while rampant encroachments are a common factor. The survey, which is said to be the first of its kind in the state, pinpoints the areas where silt has been accumulated in large quantity in each canal, the details of encroachments, the number of bridges across the canals which will have to be pulled down for ensuring smooth flow of water, etc. The irrigation department officials will conduct a detailed presentation on the project before the Kochi corporation council on Monday. “It is learnt that the state government has designed a big project for evicting encroachments on all these canals and desilting them so as to avoid waterlogging in the city. The project will be modelled on Operation Anantha which was conducted in Thiruvananthapuram for renovating canals and drains in the city after evicting the encroachments,” sources with the corporation said. One of the major decisions the irrigation department has taken is to take over the management of all the canals in the city from local bodies. Though the ownership of the major canals in each area rests on irrigation department, the civic bodies, which act as custodians, would carry out works like construction of the bridges and cleaning of silt. At the same time, they don’t take any measures to evict encroachments. Around 45 officials with the irrigation department, including executive engineers and assistant executive engineers, conducted the mapping using modern technologies and software. “The officials spilt into groups conducted the mapping on different canals. Some of the canals were not there in the Google Maps. They were either reclaimed or covered using concrete slabs. Such canals won’t be visible on the Google Maps. Many parts of the Puramboku Punchathodu connecting Kaniyampuzha and Chilavannoor backwaters have been encroached and reclaimed,” sources said. “Kochi corporation has reclaimed a portion of Pandarachira canal connecting backwaters in Eramalloor and Rameswaram in Fort Kochi. Around 400-metre stretch of the canal near Kazhuthumuttam at Thoppumpady has been completely reclaimed. Now, there is a market and offices of the corporation,” sources said. All such obstructions and encroachments will have to be cleared or evicted. “Chathyathu thodu connecting Thevara-Perandoor canal near high court has been completely reclaimed,” sources said. There are seven bridges, across Thevara-Perandoor canal, which are to be pulled down. More than 1,000 outlets of toilets from households and various establishments on either side of Thevara-Perandoor canal have been opened to the canal thereby polluting the waterbody. There are at least 10 locations where waste is accumulated on the canal. All such constructions and hindrances will have to be cleared, sources said. The renovation of Mullassery canal can be started only after evicting encroachments. The survey department has laid the boundary stones of the canal with an original width of six to eight metres a few days ago. Now, around 75 petty shops among other encroachments will have to be evicted for starting the renovation work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mapping-reveals-sorry-state-of-canals/articleshow/84741114.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Goa||Goa: Three test positive for Covid and dengue simultaneously, recover||PANAJI: Three people were recently detected with both Covid-19 and dengue simultaneously, and have been cured of both these ailments since then. “As instructed, we have informed the Central government about the cases. All three had tested positive for Covid-19 in the RTPCR test and for dengue in the MAC-ELISA,” chief medical officer-in-charge of the national vector borne disease control programme (NVBDCP) in Goa, Dr Kalpana Mahatme, said. Mahatme said that health centres have been instructed that for every case of fever reported, they have to rule out malaria and dengue. The three cases were detected in that process. One case each was detected in Porvorim, Calangute and South Goa. Meanwhile, the directorate of health services has strengthened its efforts to detect dengue cases. Goa sees an annual increase in dengue cases from June onwards, even as malaria cases have reduced drastically. “Over the last few years, we have been seeing more dengue cases between June and August. The trend so far has not been very different,” she said. So far this year, she said, they have found dengue cases in just one new area, under the jurisdiction of Casarvarnem. The area has two big ongoing infrastructure projects, one being the construction of an Ayush hospital. “The cases are being detected as reverse migration has started. After a couple labourers at the Ayush hospital site tested positive for dengue, we posted an inspector there to monitor the situation. Things are better now,” she said. Till June-end, 165 dengue cases were detected, of which 48 were reported last month. Goa reported a huge surge in dengue cases in 2019 with 726 infections. A large number of cases were reported from Vasco, Panaji and Candolim. In 2020, as many as 376 cases were detected. Mahatme said she expects the number to be somewhat similar as the trend has not changed. Since 2017, Goa has witnessed a huge drop in malaria infections. From 653 cases that year, it came down to 102 cases in 2020. The drop has been on account of the rigorous drive implemented for over a decade that saw a surge in malaria cases, majority of which were reported from construction sites employing migrant labourers. “Now that we have reached an elimination stage for malaria, we don’t want to waste the efforts put in to get the state to where it is today,” Mahatme said. She said their people should ensure that labourers coming from other states are screened for malaria and dengue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/three-test-positive-for-covid-and-dengue-simultaneously-recover/articleshow/84744641.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Delhi||New projects to create space for 7k vehicles at Sadar Bazar||New Delhi: To resolve parking woes in the Sadar Bazar area, work is in progress to implement multilevel car parking projects at three places — the old deputy commissioner office building, the old slaughterhouse (Idgah) and Qutub Road. The Qutub Road project on a 1,200-square-metre plot is to be completed by June 2022. “It will create space for 177 vehicles. The project got stuck just after digging started, otherwise it would have been completed earlier,” said area councillor Jai Prakash. At the old slaughterhouse complex, Delhi Metro is expected to issue tender for construction of two underground Metro stations in August and, a year later, it will invite bids for the parking project, said an official of North Delhi Municipal Corporation. “It will be able to accommodate 3,200 vehicles on a 26,200-square-metre plot. Its land use clause was changed after the corporation paid Rs 66 crore to Delhi Development Authority two years ago,” said the official. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation will construct four floors underground for two stations and the multilevel parking above in six floors. Three floors will be used for commercial purposes. There will be scope for extending the facility, the official added. For the 1,500-sq-metre open site at the old DC office building, the civic body will bring a proposal in the standing committee soon for constructing a multilevel parking lot. “The site is vacant after the deputy commissioner’s office shifted to Kashmere Gate,” said the official. This site can park 60 vehicles, but looking at the requirement, the corporation has decided to construct a multilevel parking to accommodate 240 vehicles, he added. The corporation also targets to complete its four other major multilevel parking projects by June 2022 at Gandhi Maidan in Chandni Chowk, Shiva Market, Nigam Bodh and Church Mission Road. These projects will create space for 3,138 vehicles. “Work had to stop due to Covid-19. As some of these projects were conceived a long time ago and locals have been waiting for parking facilities, completing them on time is our priority,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-projects-to-create-space-for-7k-vehicles-at-sadar-bazar/articleshow/84741179.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Admission worry for principals & VCs in season of high scores||KOLKATA: Vice-chancellors and college principals in Kolkata are already concerned over the high scores of students in board exams of higher secondary and ISC and the implications it might have on the admission process. West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination declared results of higher secondary examinations and ISC examinations last week. In HS, number of students, who have scored above 90%, is 9,013 and those between 80 and 89 is 49,370. Close to 27,000 students have cleared ISC this year and principals feel if they consider a conservative figure of 20% getting above 90% they already have 5, 400 students with 90%. To put the numbers in context there are only 700 seats in Presidency University at UG level across all streams. In JU, there are 981 seats in humanities and science put together. Ramkrishna Mission Vidyamandira has only a total of 220 seats in all the subjects put together. Bhawanipur Education Society College has 4,000 seats in all the three streams put together. Bethune College has 540 seats. Gokhale Memorial Girls’ College has close to 525 seats. VCs and principals feel that such high scores might apparently convey that they will help individuals secure seat in a good college or university but it neither helps the students nor the colleges and universities because in the absence of an admission test the seats might just get blocked and deserving candidates will have to settle for the second or even third best. Subiresh Bhattacharya, secretary of the West Bengal Vice Chancellors’ Council and president of the All Bengal Principals’ Council, said all colleges and state-owned universities will have to abide by the government order of admitting students on the basis of Class-XII marks. In 2020, when board exams remained incomplete due to the pandemic, boards awarded marks liberally. But the move proved counter productive with students even applying in subjects they were not interested to pursue. While such students blocked the seats those who actually wanted to study the subject had to book a slot in colleges which were not their first choice. Many colleges that were planning to conduct admission tests or online interviews have already cancelled after the government’s order. “Some departments had planned online admission tests and others online interviews having 30% weightage. But we cancelled this after the government’s order. Our only concern is that many high scorers will block the seats but never take admission. Though we will get more time to fill-up seats, but shall miss out on meritorious and interested students,” said Deepali Singhee, principal of J D Birla Institute. At Bhawanipur Education Society, students will be admitted only on the basis of Class-XII marks. Colleges like Lady Brabourne, Scottish, Ramakrishna MissionVidyamandira will take into account marks in Class X boards along with Class-XII marks to screen students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/admission-worry-for-principals-vcs-in-season-of-high-scores/articleshow/84741156.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Kochi||Kerala: Hundreds of dogs culled at Thrikkakara, says SPCA||KOCHI: The stray dogs that were killed by dog catchers in Thrikkakara were between four to seven years of age. Veterinary doctors who conducted the autopsy of 21 dogs said the dogs were very healthy when they were killed. The culling happened more than 10 days ago as the carcasses were badly decomposed and samples for toxicology and histopathology could be collected from only two dogs. “Only the skeleton and skin remained in the carcasses. Rest of the internal parts were decomposed badly,” said a veterinary official. The autopsy report will be submitted to the police in two days. While, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has come out with serious charge that carcasses of hundreds of stray dogs were buried in the waste dumping yard of Thrikkakara municipality at Kakkanad. A report comprising these details will be submitted to the amicus curiae. “The dogs were caught and killed brutally. Many local bodies are misusing the fund being allocated for Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme. Instead of sterilizing the stray dogs scientifically as per rules, many swindle the fund by falsely claiming that dogs were sterilized. As per rule, Rs 2,200 has been allocated for catching, sterilizing and treating each dog until it is released in the place from where it was caught. Instead of that, many local bodies hire dog catchers and give menial amount to kill the dogs. Rest of the amount goes to the personal account of those associated with the process,” said SPCA, Ernakulam, secretary T K Sajeev. He said the culling was done with the knowledge of councillors. “The dog catchers used catch poles instead of butterfly nets to catch the dogs at Thrikkakara. The loop, made of steel wire, at the end of the pole damages the nerves and muscles of the animal. The dog, caught in such a manner, will not live long,” said Sajeev. Meanwhile, people’s representatives in the municipality maintain that they were not aware of the incident and will initiate action against the official who is in charge of the community hall, where the dog catchers were staying allegedly without the knowledge of local body authorities. “The hall was handed over for conducting vaccination camps. The council will discuss the issue,” said municipality vice-chairman Ibrahim Kutty. There were rumours about mass killing of stray dogs in connivance with some authorities in Tripunithura municipality. It is suspected that around 64 stray dogs were allegedly killed around one-and-a-half years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hundreds-of-dogs-culled-at-thrikkakara-says-spca/articleshow/84741198.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Kochi||Local body shelves ABC programme for want of vet||Kochi: Sterilization of stray dogs under animal birth control (ABC) programme remains suspended by Kochi corporation for nearly three months. The ambitious ABC programme launched in 2015 with much fanfare was running uninterrupted all these years till April 23 when the lone veterinary doctor was relieved from her duty. Nearly 7,000 stray dogs were sterilized in the past five years. Meanwhile, around 30 stray dogs faced cruelty at the hands of corporation officials at ABC programme centre at Brahmapuram after the functioning of the centre was stopped. Around 22 stray dogs, remained in cages with only limited food for 59 days. Two of the dogs died of starvation, sources said. The dog catchers caught the stray dogs as per the directive of health standing committee authorities after they received complaints from public following the suspension of the sterilization programme. Animal rights activists said the local body does not want to continue with the ABC programme. “The corporation could have become the first rabies free local body if they continue with the ABC programme uninterrupted. But some people with vested interests do not want to carry it forward. If the programme is stopped and stray dog issue spirals, they could cull the animals citing the problem.” said Ambili Purackal of Daya animal welfare organization. The doctor who had been sterilizing stray dogs under the ABC programme put in her papers in December last year and requested the local body to post another doctor to avoid any interruption in the programme. But the local body has not taken any step in this regard.  Meanwhile, corporation health standing committee chairman T K Ashraf said the local body has invited applications from interested veterinary doctors to sterilize stray dogs under ABC programme. “Covid delayed the procedures. The interview for the doctors will be conducted soon. We have given a letter to district veterinary office to povide two doctors for technical support as part of the interview,” said Ashraf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/local-body-shelves-abc-programme-for-want-of-vet/articleshow/84741219.cms||---
---||India||Telangana’s Ramappa temple now Unesco heritage site||HYDERABAD: The historic Ramappa temple, an architectural fable in stone, on Sunday became Unesco's first world heritage site in Telangana. Located in Mulugu district, the iconic temple is now India’s 39th world heritage site. The online extended 44th session of the World Heritage Committee of the Unesco, which is currently underway at Fuzhou in China, voted in favour of Ramappa temple for inclusion in the world heritage sites' list. Altogether, 17 countries backed the resolution, which was strongly supported by Russia, while Norway opposed it. Earlier, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), in its report presented before the World Heritage Committee for the 44th session, favoured that the heritage tag be deferred. But, as most of the members attending the Fuzhou session backed the 13th century Kakatiyan temple, also called Rudreshwara temple, it got the prized heritage tag. The Charminar and the Qutub Shahi tombs, which were submitted to Unesco for the heritage tag, are at present in the tentative list. The temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, and other small temples within the complex were constructed by Kakatiya rulers Rudradeva and Recharla Rudra between the 12th and 13th centuries. Work on the main temple began in 1213 CE and completed 40 years later. Built with sandstone and a sandbox foundation, the temple has decorated beams and columns made of granite. The temple’s unique feature is its tower or Vimana, which is in the shape of a pyramid. The Vimana has been constructed using porous bricks, which are light in weight. These bricks, one of the features of the Kakatiya rulers, are popularly known as floating bricks. It represents the architectural and cultural beauty of the former rulers of Orugallu, modern day Warangal, with the kingdom expanding to many parts of modern Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The technical evaluation panel of the ICOMOS visited Ramappa temple from September 23 to 27, 2019. The panel accepted the report in 2020 and called for more information from the Telangana government. It has pinpointed as many as nine shortcomings that needed to be overcome. The undivided AP government sent the dossier to Unesco in 2014, just before the bifurcation of the state. “(It) partly illustrates Kakatiyan architectural, artistic, and technological traditions through its architectural structures within the walled temple compound and its wider setting. The walled temple complex is a single shrine temple comprising the central Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple and other secondary mandapas, shrines and temples. The sculptures, especially the bracket figures at the Rudreshwara Temple, are fine artistic representations of Kakatiya dance customs and cultural traditions. These features testify to Kakatiya customs and temple rituals as well as construction technology, materials and other sculptural elements illustrating artistic capacities in terms of workmanship,” the ICOMOS said in its 2021 report. It, however, maintained that while the conditions of authenticity are satisfactory, the conditions of integrity cannot be fully met in terms of completeness due to the missing features and attributes as well as a general vulnerability of the temple’s setting because of a lack of protection mechanism. The Telangana government in its dossier said: “Rudreshwara Temple is a singular testimony of the highest level of creative, artistic, and engineering expression of the Kakatiya period. It is also a testimony of a flourishing agriculture-based society on land devoid of perennial water sources in the 12th century. The sculptures of the temple, especially its bracket figures, are unique sculptures carved out of the hard dolerite stone and express dynamic movement in their forms. Neither humans nor animals appear static or sedentary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/telanganas-ramappa-temple-now-unesco-heritage-site/articleshow/84745196.cms||Syed Akbar

The officials claimed that many developers have not submitted their documents and some of them have deposited only one instalment with the civic body. Only individual plot-holders made the most of the regularisation policies, with as many as 40,000 plots getting regularised in these years. According to the officials of the MC building branch, since the first policy was rolled out in 2013, the civic officials received only 168 applications from developers for regularisation of colonies. Of these, only 31 were regularised and the rest are in the process. Even to bring these developers to submit an application, the civic officials had to recommend FIRs against them or carry out demolitions. An official said, “We tried to convince the developers, but they are not ready to submit their documents. In some of the colonies, they have left after selling the plots. It is because of this reason that the number of plot-holders applying for regularisation is higher.” MC joint commissioner Kulpreet Singh said, “As of now, a drive is on against mushrooming new illegal colonies and we will definitely reach a conclusion about those who have applied under regularisation policies.” In the MC general house meeting on July 14, the issue of illegal colonies and unauthorised constructions was raised and allegations were levelled against officials for being hand in glove. Residents will suffer While the civic officials are waiting for them to turn up for completion of formalities, the developers are busy selling the plots and even construction is on at most of the localities. Unless the developers get the colonies regularised, the civic body will not provide any basic amenities and the ultimate sufferers will be the residents who have invested their hard-earned money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/regularisation-of-colonies-in-limbo-mc-says-developers-not-cooperating/articleshow/84739089.cms||---

Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said Mhada will order the pre-fab homes and then send them to Taliye village in the next few weeks. Awhad said the homes will be built using the Pre-Engineered Building (PEB) technology and as many as 100 homes are expected to be ready in the next few weeks. “The entire cost will be borne by Mhada as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). They will be weather-proof homes,” he added. “Mhada will take up complete responsibility for rebuilding and resettlement of Taliye village in Mahad taluka of Raigad district. CM Uddhav Thackeray and NCP Chief Sharad Pawar have given this task to me. The prefab homes will be fitted with all the appliances and basic amenities. These homes will be able to tackle the rains too,” Awhad said. Officials said the homes will be manufactured in Bhuj and then transported to Raigad. Officials said PEB are engineered at a factory and assembled at site. Usually PEBs are steel structures. Built-up sections are fabricated at the factory to exact size, transported and assembled at site with bolted connections. This type of structural concept is generally used to build industrial buildings, Metro stations and warehouses. — Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mahad-flood-hit-to-get-prefab-homes-by-mhada-in-mumbai/articleshow/84743297.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The high court of Bombay at Goa has admitted the petition. The association has stated that this revised registration fee is unreasonable, excessive and not in consonance with the national policy of promotion of affordable housing. The association has submitted to the high court that the registration fee is excessive for agreements of sale without possession, more particularly for transactions falling within slabs ‘upto 50 lakh’ and ‘above 50 lakh upto 75 lakh’, during the pre-completion stage compelling the prospective purchaser to pay additional sums in the form of 5% GST, 2.9% stamp duty and 3% registration fee, totalling to 10.9% even before getting possession of the unit. “Such increase in the expenditure at the stage of entering into an agreement for sale, without possession, has the effect of imposing excessive and unreasonable financial burden at the very preliminary stage,” the association has stated. Imposing this fee at the stage of agreement of sale without possession will be “deterrent to all the low to middle income buyers in as much as the same shall be added to the initial cost in the unit thereby making it prohibitive and/ or onerous on the buyers which shall have a direct bearing on the fundamental right of shelter and/or constitutional right of owning property,” the association added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/credai-challenges-govt-notification-on-revised-fees/articleshow/84744664.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Due to waterlogging, it has become difficult for two-wheeler riders to gauge the depth of inundated potholes, making them vulnerable to road accidents,” said Kiran Narula, a resident of Inder Road locality. In several areas, pushta (retaining wall) collapsed due to the rain spell and water entered homes. “The pushta here got washed off in the rain. We are trying to fix the wall to avoid any untoward incident,” said a Govind Garh resident. The old city area was probably the worst affected where the officials of the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) and the Public Works Department (PWD) had to make arrangements for pulling out rainwater. After complaints of waterlogging, Dehradun district magistrate, R Rajesh Kumar, ordered the civic bodies to clear the water in Shivlok Colony, Johriwali Basti, and Smith Nagar. Anti-larvae spray was also sprayed in these areas to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes in waterlogged streets. Meanwhile, the DM also inspected the stretch between Survey Chowk and Chuna Bhatta where Smart City works are underway. During the inspection, he found debris plying abruptly and unpatched potholes. Subsequently, he instructed officials to get the work completed within 15 days. Following his visit, issues on some problem spots were fixed by a team from the Smart City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/intense-rain-spell-leaves-parts-of-doon-waterlogged/articleshow/84739093.cms||---

KSU on Sunday took out a march towards the college hostel protesting the attack. Police arrested and removed the activists following clashes. Niyas alleged that he was sleeping when the two came and took him outside and thrashed him. “It was around 1.30am. Then they asked me questions like whether there is ganja in my room and slapped me. Later, they kicked me and broke my nose,” said Niyas. He said that SFI unit secretary Akhil Pushpan and a student named Adarsh attacked him. Niyas, from Malappuram, is a final year BCom student. Central police said that they arrested the two persons late on Sunday. Meanwhile, Aloshious Xavier, KSU district secretary who led the protest march said that the SFI activists have been harassing KSU members at the college hostel. He said that several people from outside were illegally staying at the hostel. He added that if the police try to protect the SFI activists, the future protest marches would be to the police stations. “The hostel rooms of Maharaja’s are being converted into a den for torture. It is a very serious issue that SFI unit secretary Akhil led the attack on KSU unit secretary Niyas. It was the CM and the police that protected SFI activists when they burned the principal’s chair and when weapons were seized from the hostel rooms,” Xavier said at the protest march. However, central police said that the case was more of a clash between individuals than a political one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/two-held-for-assault-on-ksu-activist/articleshow/84741284.cms||---

While Lucknow moved up from the 13th spot to the second position, Varasnasi jumped to third from the ninth position. Gorakhpur division moved from the 11th place to the fourth spot. Ghaziabad health officials said they plan to vaccinate over 30,000 people across 70-odd centres on Monday, after it received 25,000 doses. Over the past four months, the district has been able to reduce vaccine wastage significantly. In fact, between July 3 and 17, the district has recorded a negative wastage figure for both Covishield and Covaxin (-4% for Covishield and -2% for Covaxin). For the same period, neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar saw -2% wastage for Covishield and 2% for Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/noida-bags-top-spot-in-up-for-vax-coverage-ghaziabad-4th/articleshow/84748849.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors wary of vaccine effect till third wave||KOLKATA: A section of Kolkata’s doctors and health workers who received their vaccines by February are worried about their immune status. With the third wave looming, they fear they may have run out of antibodies to ward off Covid. Experts say antibodies do not usually last beyond six months while the third wave is expected to peak in September-October, more than seven months after the first batch of frontline workers had been inoculated. However, vaccines, some pointed out, provide T-Cell immunity which can restrict the disease to a mild one. Vaccination had started for healthworkers on January 16 and was restricted to them and those above 60 years of age till April 1. Director of AIIMS Delhi Randeep Guleria has called for a ‘second-generation booster dose’ to resist the third wave. It could be necessary but healthworkers should adopt all the precautions that they did prior to vaccination, said Apollo Gleneagles Hospital consultant oncologist Subir Ganguly. “Most of us were inoculated by February-March so many of us might have suffered an antibody depletion. It may not be uniform for everyone but since we will be at the forefront yet again, let us assume that we are back to the pre-vaccination period. But whatever be our immune status, vaccination has managed to pull down the death rate so it will help to curb the intensity of the disease,” said Ganguly. Antibodies keep waning with time and it’s indeed a worry for doctors who got the shot early, according to Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. “It’s bound to be less effective for many of us now,” said Jain. Others like Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri, however, pointed out that T-Cell immunity will provide some resistance to those vaccinated. “Usually antibodies don’t last more than six months. Those who received their vaccines within February-March could be at risk during third wave. But their infections are likely to be mild due to T-Cell immunity which lasts long,” he said. There is, however, a huge unvaccinated population which is at risk of severe infection, added Chaudhuri. “We have been doing antibody tests randomly and a large number are yet to develop them which means they remain vulnerable,” said Chaudhuri. Antibodies, however, could last longer than a year for some, said Ganguly. “I got an antibody test done last month and it came positive. Since we know very little about Covid yet, antibodies could last longer than we are now assuming,” said Ganguly. The necessity of a third booster dose will depend on the severity of the third wave, felt Chaudhuri. “The vaccinated population should remain relatively safe. But for the rest, the intensity of the wave will depend on how well we stick to safety precautions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-wary-of-vaccine-effect-till-third-wave/articleshow/84741292.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Like him, his two sisters, aged 11 and 6, also quit studies last year as they could not afford a smartphone. Things got worse when their father died of cardiac arrest in March this year as their mother remains unwell. The family was unable to have a meal in a day and no relative or friend came forward to help. With no option left, Ranjot, a resident of Khajoor Chowk, Salem Tabri, set up a cart outside a liquor vend near Jalandhar Bypass to sell bhelpuri. Talking to the TOI, Ranjot said, “My father was an autorickshaw driver. Last year when lockdown was imposed, my sisters and I had to quit studies as we could not afford a smartphone. When our father died, I started working. I only know how to make bhelpuri, so I set up a cart near the liquor vend.” He pays Rs 20 per day rent for the handcart and on an average gets 20 to 25 customers. “I work from 9am to 10pm and earn Rs 200 to Rs 300 daily.” Ranjot’s mother Komal said, “I remain unwell and am not able to work. I feel sad that my son has to work at this age. After the death of my husband, none of our relatives came to help. I also approached a few politicians, but they too did not help as my husband’s death certificate is in the possession of my in-laws, who refused to give it to me. All I want for my children is education and a normal life. They were studying in a nearby private school, but had to drop out. I am scared when my son goes to work near the vend as drunk people often create nuisance there.” A video of Ranjot had gone viral on social media after which some city residents came forward to help him. Harsh Vardhan, a resident of Old City, said, “After watching the video I visited his house and gave ration to the family. I have also requested my friends to help them.” Komal said, “On Sunday, I received a call from an NRI who has assured to help with my children’s education.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/9-yr-old-boy-sells-bhelpuri-near-liquor-vend-to-make-ends-meet/articleshow/84739097.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Dehradun||Roads start caving in, developing cracks in Nainital after rains||NAINITAL: On Wednesday, a 10m stretch of the road leading to the governor's house in Nainital caved, damaging some shops underneath and forcing the administration to order cutting trees and halting traffic. Three days later, cracks appeared on the Nainital-Bhowali highway, which residents said were signs of a bigger disaster waiting to happen. While local residents blamed these incidents on monsoon rains, experts pointed to a trend. Roads caving in with the start of monsoon has become the norm in Nainital. In August 2018, a large chunk of Nainital’s Lower Mall Road fell into the Naini Lake. A year later, landslides occurred at Cheena Peak, a popular tourist spot, followed by cracks appearing at Tiffin Top, another tourist destination. Apart from these, several other roads in the Lake Town have also developed cracks over time. Geologists and researchers TOI spoke to blame this on rapid urbanization and relentless construction on steep slopes – with inclines between 40 to 60 degrees – and on geological fault lines. “Even without any human intervention, the Nainital area is highly unstable, it is prone to landslides and tectonic movements. However, when you have the sort of urbanization that Nainital has witnessed over the last few decades, the threat only exacerbates,” said geologist PC Tiwari, who is a professor at Kumaun University. A 2016 study done by Prof Tiwari had found that construction in locations where it is banned had increased by around 50% in 10 years (2005 to 2015). This was higher than the increase in construction in the rest of the town. “Nainital has a population of around 50,000. While other places like Almora are urbanizing faster than Nainital, it is the increase in construction to cater to tourists that is proving detrimental to the town. This type of construction has increased mostly in areas like Sher Ka Danda and the entire region below the ropeway, which are very sensitive. Recurring landslides in Nainital are highly worrying,” he said. In 1880, over 150 people had been killed in a landslide in Nainital. Harsh Vats, a researcher at ISRO’s Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), pointed out that 60% of the Nainital town area is unstable. “Several fault lines pass through the area, including the Nainital Lake fault, which is beneath the Naini Lake. Geologically, Nainital is considered very unstable, as the rock type in the area is also very weak. When all these factors, combined, are coupled with high population density in areas near the high court or the Nainital club, landslides become common during monsoons,” he said. Nainital sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Prateek Jain said that the administration has been monitoring the situation in and around the town and is prepared to deal with mishaps. “We take note whenever there are landslides in the area. Our PWD, forest and various other teams are dealing with this. As far as uncontrolled construction is concerned, we keep track of such illegal activities and either stop or demolish them,” the SDM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/roads-start-caving-in-developing-cracks-in-nainital-after-rains/articleshow/84739103.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Guest teachers meet education department officials to demand salaries for two months of summer break||DEHRADUN: A group of guest teachers of government-run schools in Uttarakhand met education department officials on Sunday to demand their remuneration for the summer vacation period. They have claimed that they were not given any money for the two months of summer break. “Most of the guest teachers conducted online classes during May and June. Also, many of them were deployed on Covid-related duties by the government. Therefore, we should get paid for our services. Not releasing our salaries for the two summer break months amounts to exploitation,” said a guest teacher of a state secondary school. Meanwhile, the education department officials have said that the decision on releasing salaries of guest teachers is taken according to the existing guidelines. The payments can only be released after the state government rolls out new rules, added the officials. More than 4,000 guest teachers are currently employed in different state government-run schools in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/guest-teachers-meet-edu-dept-officials-to-demand-salaries-for-two-months-of-summer-break/articleshow/84739099.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Kochi||Want a death cert online? Join the queue||Kochi: Obtaining a birth or death certificate online from any local body in Kerala is as simple as, say, getting a movie ticket on bookmyshow. Except that it's not the case in Kochi Corporation, where, as an NRK recently discovered, accessing something as elementary as a death certificate is “mission impossible”. In February 2021, a few days after his father passed away in Kochi, Renjit John, an entrepreneur and IT expert based in the US, began his online attempt to access the death certificate. “My online search led me to the Sevana website maintained by the state government. However, the first thing I noticed on the site was ‘service for Kochi Corporation is not available from February 2015’. It is learnt that Kochi corporation migrated to the service of TCS from the award-winning Sevana software,” John, a PhD holder in computer science, told TOI. “When I tried to enter the corporation’s site, there was a security warning, as the secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate of the local body’s website had expired in March 2020. Ignoring the security warning I went ahead with the search. Though I searched my father’s name, the response from the system was that there was no data regarding the matter. I was left with no option but to start offline efforts,” he recalled. The next day John went to the private hospital where his father had passed away. “I cross-checked the online application filed by the hospital officials. Then I went to the district court premises to buy eight (why eight!) Rs 50 stamp papers and four Rs 5 court fee stamps only to stand in a long queue to procure it. Then I went to the corporation office at around 1 pm and all the officials had gone for lunch. When the officials came back, it was found that they hadn't got the information from the hospital", he said. A frustrated John recounted the details: "Again, another trip to the hospital to check when they would send the information. Then, some days later a second trip to the corporation to submit the application and a third trip to get the certificate." A few days later, out of curiosity John once again logged into the corporation's site disregarding the security warning and searched for the death certificate. “Once I entered my father’s details, it pulled his record out with the correct information and a few days later, it did give me an option to download the death certificate. Was the trip to the district court and the corporation office, the hunt for parking, the waiting in queues, and the money that we had spent unnecessary? Were we just too hasty,” he asks. John's dilemma is not an isolated instance. Hundreds of Kochiites have faced the same problem and the Kochi corporation, despite much-publicised reminders, has done precious little to sort it out. All it has done so far is spend Rs 5 cr for a website whose 'bounce rate' (abysmal click-ability, for the uninitiated) might be it's most creditable feature!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/want-a-death-cert-online-join-the-queue/articleshow/84741313.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Meerut division that includes six districts has got the top spot in the category. According to official data, Ghaziabad has been able to stop vaccine wastage completely. The ranking system is based on figures released by the government till July 17. It mentions cumulative figures (from January 16 to July 17) and this month’s data, till July 17. According to the report, between July 3 and 17, Meerut division was at the top spot with the highest number of vaccinations being conducted in Gautam Budh Nagar. Within the division, Ghaziabad district was in the fifth place in the state between July 3 and 9 and it moved to the fourth spot between July 10 and 17. Except Baghpat, five districts within Meerut division have recorded improvement. While Bulandshahr moved from 25th spot to 16th, Hapur’s ranking improved to 57th from 60th in the second week of July. Baghpat was initially at the seventh spot, then it slipped to eighth. According to the report, till July 17, Gautam Budh Nagar has administered the first dose of vaccine to 97.5% of its target population in the 18-44 years category. Meerut is at 67%, the figure is 48% for Hapur and 38.4% for Ghaziabad.

---||Kolkata||Pregnant women rush for jabs to ensure babies’ safety in Kolkata||KOLKATA: To beat Covid-19, some pregnant women in the city have started getting themselves inoculated. Several pregnant women had got infected during the pandemic. While some were lucky to come back home after staying in hospitals, others had to endure the loss of their newborn. A few of them also succumbed to the infection. “I have seen how difficult it is to manage Covid-19 infected pregnant women. I am worried about myself and my unborn child, so I did not waste a day when my doctor Priya Ray told me to get the Covid shot,” said Khetrimayum Naobi, a nurse with AMRI Hospital Mukundapur. The seven-month pregnant Naobi took her first Covaxin jab a few days ago at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences where her husband works as a Cath lab technician. “With the threat of a third wave looming large, we could not take the risk. I am convinced about the benefits of the vaccine. I have taken the first jab at Peerless Hospital so that I don’t regret later,” said Tollygunge resident Priyanka Halder, who is six-and-half-a-week into conception. Her husband Somnath also took the jab with her on the same day to be around her. Topsia resident Shinjinee Roy had taken her first Covishield dose in July first week without knowing that she was pregnant. “My wife will be taking the second dose without fail as our doctor Basab Mukherjee has advised us about the benefits,” said husband Arijit Roy. The Union health ministry in the first week of July had approved the vaccination of pregnant women and a broad SOP was also formulated. Many are still in two minds about the matter. “Covid-19 infection might cause rapid deterioration in a pregnant woman and may also affect the foetus. A woman can take the vaccine at any trimester of the pregnancy,” said FOGSI (Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India) national president S Shantha Kumari. FOGSI has been instrumental in convincing the government to bring the expecting mothers into the realm of the inoculation programme. “There seems to be a vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women. But we are trying to convince them on the importance of getting the vaccine shot,” said FOGSI vice president and Kolkata-based gynaecologist Basab Mukherjee. Even as the state is expected to roll out a special vaccination drive for pregnant women, some have started trickling to private CVCs. “We are vaccinating pregnant women as per latest GOI directive after taking all precautions,” said Anupam Das, senior manager at Peerless Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pregnant-women-rush-for-jabs-to-ensure-babies-safety/articleshow/84741317.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Even as suspense ruled the day, BJP president JP Nadda, in Goa, said: “Yediyurappa has done good work and his government is functioning well. We don’t see any political crisis in Karnataka.”  “I have not received any message till now (6pm). It may come tonight or tomorrow morning,” the CM said after a survey of the flood-affected Belagavi district. No signal from BJP brass, the suspense continues“I’ll do as the party says: Will continue or resign (depending on the advice) and start working for the party,” the CM said after returning to Bengaluru from Belagavi. Yediyurappa, 78, said he would take a decision on his own if the party didn’t send any message even on Monday. Earlier in the day, the CM had said he was expecting a message from the party by 5pm Sunday on the road ahead. Whether he would meet governor Thaawarchand Gehlot on Monday afternoon after attending the second anniversary of his government, the CM said: “You will know about the ensuing developments.” Union minister for law and parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi, among the frontrunners to replace Yediyurappa, arrived in Bengaluru from Dharwad on Sunday and later cancelled his flight ticket to New Delhi. While this fuelled speculation of a likely change in leadership, mines and geology minister Murgush Nirani, another contender, landed in the national capital. BJP national general secretary CT Ravi, in the race for the CM’s post, said in Goa that the party had given Yediyurappa “all kinds of opportunities” and added that the party has many deserving candidates, suggesting a change was imminent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-waiting-for-signal-bjp-chief-says-no-crisis/articleshow/84745263.cms||---

The centre suspended its inoculation drive for Sunday and officials said they are expecting fresh stock to come in by Monday.As against 567 slots booked for Saturday, only 310 people could get the jabs.“There was a shortage at the hospital, despite making payment for the required number of doses 15 days in advance. Many people who had booked their slots through Co-WIN had to be turned away. Usually, we have more footfall during the weekends, which is 500-550 people, compared to about 300 people on a week day. On Saturday, 567 people had booked their slots and 310 were inoculated. We had to reschedule slots for the others on Tuesday,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, director, public relations, Sharda Hospital and University.“We suspended the vaccination drive for Sunday. New batch might come in on Monday,” Kumar added.Hospital officials said they have inoculated about 50,000 people so far.Usually, private hospitals make payments to vaccine manufacturers for the doses they need and the district health department facilitates transportation and storage, if needed.Asked about the crisis at Sharda, Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the district immunisation officer in-charge of Covid vaccination, said the health department is not responsible in this case.“Private hospitals can directly procure vaccines from the manufacturers, as per the latest government directive. We help them with storage if required. Even in that case, the stock is not held back at our end and we dispatch doses from storage units on time. The crisis at Sharda is probably due to a problem between them and the manufacturer. The health department or the state government has no role to play,” he said.Other private centres in the district, however, did not report shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sharda-short-on-doses-suspends-vax-drive-fresh-stocks-likely-today/articleshow/84744663.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The eight-member GAB was formed in April last year by CM Mamata Banerjee to to formulate its medical and economic response to Covid crisis. The GAB has been informally meeting every week, helping the Bengal government with feedback and suggestions. Banerjee had been in Kolkata in October 2019 as the city rejoiced his Nobel win. This will be his first visit to the city during the pandemic. According to sources, Banerjee, who is slated to arrive in Kolkata on August 5 morning, will attend the GAB meeting at 3.30 pm, which is likely to be chaired by CM Banerjee. He will stay with his mother at the family residence in Ballygunge. On August 6, he is likely to attend a function at the Sonarpur-based Indian Institute of Liver and Digestive Sciences to inaugurate a new office building and the installed Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) plant. He is also expected to lay the foundation stone for a nursing training institute at the facility by Liver Foundation West Bengal. He will leave Kolkata for New Delhi on August 8 and fly out of the country on August 12. The GAB has recommended several measures, including a gender reversal of Covid beds, where 60% of the beds will now be kept for women and 40% for men. It has also advised for scaling up of paediatric facilities state-wide, with paediatric doctors and nurses visiting and training all first responders in health facilities on paediatric emergency care. Another GAB suggestion, which the CM said the government is implementing, is categorisation of all mothers who have kids below 12 in the frontline vaccination group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/abhijit-banerjee-may-attend-cov-panels-aug-5-meet-on-3rd-wave/articleshow/84741344.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chandigarh||MC to purchase vehicle for mobile water testing||Deepak.Yadav@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: To increase frequency of potable water testing, the MC engineering department will purchase a vehicle for mobile testing of water throughout the city. The vehicle will cost around Rs 7 lakh and installation charges will be around Rs 3 to 4 lakh. As of now, there is only one stationary laboratory at Sector 39-based Water Works, where water samples have to be taken physically for quality check. Due to this, frequent checking of water in a single day is not possible. With the mobile testing laboratory, water will be tested instantly at the spot from where the sample is taken. Since there are multiple tests of water, their results vary based on the nature of the tests. “The result of chlorine quantity and purity test comes within a few minutes, but there are other tests which take 24 hours to four days based on their nature. In all such cases, this mobile laboratory would prove beneficial for the public,” sources said. An official said, “Finances for the vehicle have already been approved and soon after purchase, the process of installation will be done on priority basis, so that we can start this facility as soon as possible.” Sources in the civic body said though quality of water is quite good as it is tested before being released to the city on a daily basis, but in some areas, like slums and rehabilitation colonies, the mobile testing facility will help to check any problem with water quality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-purchase-vehicle-for-mobile-water-testing/articleshow/84741343.cms||---
---||Pune||22 fresh & over 400 online courses on Savitribai Phule Pune University platform||PUNE: Twenty-two new courses at the postgraduate, graduate, diploma and certificate levels have been lined up by Savitribai Phule Pune University at its affiliated colleges and departments in the academic year 2021-22. Beyond that, looking at the way the country has adopted online education, the university plans to offer over 400 certificate courses in collaboration with different agencies on its own platform called Degree Plus which will be online modules that are open to all students within and outside the university. What’s more, the university is also mapping these courses to learn which of them can be turned into a credit-transfer worthy course so that students can take credits from these platforms after completion of their course. These courses are meant to meet the industry-specific demands and make students acquire skills along with the required learning outcomes of the respective course, Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor of the university, said. The most number of courses, nine, are planned in the science and technology-engineering faculty with the focus on design, machine learning, Internet of Things at the bachelor level. At the masters level, robotics and automation, wireless communication technology and sensor systems are at the core. “Other than the new courses, our platform called Degree Plus will give out over 400 certificate courses. These are all skill courses which, to an extent, will help make the students’ job-ready. We have either created those courses or taken onboard courses given by various different agencies like Amazon or Coursera. A few would be without any charge. The certification will be given by the university. There will be mentoring. Perhaps this is the first state university offering such a platform,” Karmalkar said. The agencies and the courses have been chosen with care. “We then negotiated with these agencies on the price part of it so that students need not pay a lot. Certification can be both ways. If international certification is required, there will be different charges and if the student is OK with SPPU certification, then the charges will be lesser,” he added. Karmlkar said one of the reasons why students do not take up certificate courses, especially at the UG level, is because many of the courses have unnecessary modules. The student may be interested in only a small part of it. At the UG level, the students are bogged down by so many things that they do not want to take on more courses, he added. “We have analysed this and accordingly we have chosen very specifically, to the pick courses that students go for. We are working to see if a student can take some certificate courses and use the credits scored in them in his or her regular course too. Many nitty-gritties need to be worked out and we are working on a credit transfer system to check if the module and its duration are enough for a credit transfer. We will talk about it in the academic council and chalk out a plan and then decide about this. We are mapping everything prior to the academic council to understand which courses can go this way, which courses can only remain as a certificate course and not be used for credit transfer,” Karmalkar said. Many of these courses are made by agencies that need a skilled workforce. “They need students who are good at data analytics, machine learning etc but graduates passing out with these degrees only have theoretical knowledge. They need people who are good at the application aspect of it and hence they are offering such courses. Even the new courses introduced by us will focus on experiential learning,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/22-fresh-over-400-online-courses-on-sppu-platform/articleshow/84741347.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Ahmedabad||Budget for health spending: Gujarat not in top 10||AHMEDABAD: A data tabled in Rajya Sabha on July 20 gave a snapshot of the budget spending of states for health & family welfare from the central allocation of National Health Mission (NHM). The figures indicate that Gujarat’s health spending increased by 18% from 2017-18 to 2020-21 – from Rs 1,593 crore to Rs 1,894 crore. Comparing the figure with other states, in the same period Odisha increased the budget spending by 55%, Maharashtra 51%, Rajasthan 50% and Madhya Pradesh 47%. Among the major states, only Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were behind Gujarat. Year-on-year increase was just 1.6% from 2019-20 to 2020-21. The RS data further revealed that 93% of the funds in 2020-21 went to the rural areas (National Rural Health Mission) and remaining 7% to urban areas (National Urban Health Mission). The year was the most crucial for the health spending due to the pandemic that swept across the region and caused high mortality in several cities including Ahmedabad and Surat. “Analysis of the funds and its spending is important as the state’s own contribution for the department has remained low,” said a city-based public health expert. “Despite the Government of India’s directives of spending at least 8% of the total budget on health sector, our contribution hovers around 5%.” TOI had earlier reported that National Health Policy 2017 categorically instructed the states to increase health expenditure as a percentage of GDP from existing 1.15% to 2.5%. In case of Gujarat, the figure remained around 0.6% of the GDP. For the pandemic year and preparation of the possible third wave, the state government aims to fill up vacant positions, improve physical healthcare infrastructure, procure oxygen and medicines, and also invest in on-ground surveillance. Senior health department officials were not available to comment on how the current allocation matches the requirements. “In majority of the spots, the existing infrastructure was leveraged for the Covid treatment, or makeshift hospitals were made in cities like Ahmedabad. Is the preparation for the third wave going to be different from the first two?” asked an expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/budget-for-health-spending-gujarat-not-in-top-10/articleshow/84741502.cms||Parth Shastri

Ideally income from road restoration charges is seldom slated as potential revenue source and local body is supposed to generate revenue from the assets. However, it turned out that the corporation fetched Rs 15.26 crore from road restoration charges in 2019-20 which was in fact nearly 280% higher than what was anticipated in the budget estimates for the same fiscal. Usually corporation would gross Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore as income from road cutting charges. The money from road restoration ballooned in 2019-20 mainly because of the revenue corporation earned from private telecom companies. “Demand notices for pole rent and road cutting charges which had been pending in previous years due to lack of clarity were cleared in 2019-20. By initial estimates, around Rs 12 crore came from private telecom companies alone,” said a corporation official.The city corporation had received a flurry of complaints from residents owing to steep hike in road cutting charges for utility connections to households in 2019. The civic body started implementing revised road cutting charges in 2018 following an order issued by public works department which fixed the rates for road cutting based on Delhi schedule of rates 2016, including cost index and centage charges. The corporation mainly receives applications for road cutting under two heads — 20mm chipping carpet tar cutting and concrete road cutting. The old rates for 20mm chipping carpet tar cutting and concrete road cutting had been Rs 1,660.5 per sqm and Rs 1,712.4 per sqm respectively which were revised as Rs 4,680.65 per sqm and Rs 6,252.24 per sqm respectively in 2018. The hike which recorded nearly 3-4 times the original rates had led to a lot of complaints among residents belonging to economically weaker sections. The rates were further recalculated for various types of road surfaces by PWD in 2019. At present corporation charges Rs 3,179.04/sqm for 20mm open graded chipping carpet surface and Rs 5,473.44 per sqm for concrete road surface. The civic body’s collection in terms of revenue from civic amenities, rent from lease on land and income from stadium, town hall, etc. and rent from other corporation’s properties was only Rs 6.4 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/road-cutting-fetched-corp-surprise-revenue-in-2019-20/articleshow/84741342.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Since early May, violence has surged across several provinces including in Kandahar after the insurgents launched a sweeping offensive just days after the US-led foreign forces began their final withdrawal. The Taliban's deadly assault has seen the insurgents capture scores of districts, border crossings and encircle several provincial capitals. "The fighting has displaced 22,000 families in the past one month in Kandahar," Dost Mohammad Daryab, head of the provincial refugee department, told AFP. "They have all moved from the volatile districts of the city to safer areas." On Sunday, fighting continued on the outskirts of Kandahar city. "The negligence of some security forces, especially the police, has made way for the Taliban to come that close," Lalai Dastageeri, deputy governor of Kandahar province, told AFP. "We are now trying to organise our security forces." Local authorities had set up four camps for the displaced people who are estimated to be about 154,000. Kandahar resident Hafiz Mohammad Akbar said his house had been taken over by the Taliban after he fled. "They forced us to leave... I am now living with my 20-member family in a compound with no toilet," said Akbar. Residents expressed concerns the fighting might increase in days ahead. "If they really want to fight, they should go to a desert and fight, not destroy the city," said Khan Mohammad, who moved to a camp with his family. "Even if they win, they can't rule a ghost town." Kandahar, with its 650,000 inhabitants, is the second-largest city in Afghanistan after Kabul. The southern province was the epicentre of the Taliban's regime when they ruled Afghanistan between 1996 to 2001. Ousted from power in a US-led invasion in 2001 after the September 11 attacks, the Taliban have spearheaded a deadly insurgency that continues to this day. Their latest offensive launched in early May has seen the group take control of half of the country's about 400 districts. Earlier this week, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley said the Taliban appear to have "strategic momentum" on the battlefield. But global rights group Human Rights Watch said there were reports the Taliban were committing atrocities against civilians in areas they had captured, including in the town of Spin Boldak near the border with Pakistan they captured earlier this month. "Taliban leaders have denied responsibility for any abuses, but growing evidence of expulsions, arbitrary detentions, and killings in areas under their control are raising fears among the population," said Patricia Grossman, associate Asia director at HRW said in a statement. The authorities meanwhile announced they had arrested four men they said belonged to the Taliban, accusing them of carrying out this week's rocket attack on Kabul. "A Taliban commander, Momin, along with his three other men, have been arrested. They all belong to the Taliban group," ministry spokesman Mirwais Stanikzai told reporters in a video message. At least three rockets landed near the palace on Tuesday as President Ashraf Ghani and his top officials performed outdoor prayers to mark the start of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. The attack was however claimed by the jihadist Islamic State group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/thousands-of-afghan-families-flee-fighting-in-former-taliban-bastion/articleshow/84745200.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ushering in the space age||AHMEDABAD: The trio of billionaires – Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson – through their recent innovations have heated up the race to the privatized space exploration. The two back-to-back ‘space flights’ not only opened up new avenues but also brought space-tech under limelight. For India, the new space policy in 2020 opened gates for private entities for space exploration. Due to proximity to the ISRO headquarters, Bengaluru has remained a hub for the space-tech firms, but even in Ahmedabad, several startup incubators are now witnessing increasing number of engineer entrepreneurs willing to take the plunge. Chintan Antani, AVP (seed investment and portfolio) at CIIE.CO, IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A), said that they are supporting six space-tech firms – Bellatrix, Agnikul, ePlane, Astrogate, Manastu Space, and GalaxEye. “We had not seen much movement in space tech prior to 2017. But afterwards, there’s a lot of interest in the sector. We also see a lot of startups that build solutions around aerospace industry,” he said. “We have seen Bengaluru as a major hub, but we also have startups from Chennai and Delhi.” Experts feel that space technology, even though a highly unexplored territory has a tremendous growth potential. Sunil Parekh, chairman of TechXChange – India-UK Partnership for Start-Ups, said, “Space tech is a sector that is highly capital intensive and regulated. However, it is certainly a new and promising area that has potential for several breakthrough innovations.” Investors too feel that despite the risk element, it is one of the sunrise sectors in startups. “Earlier, we saw startups that were technology providers to larger organisations such as ISRO. However, we are witnessing a paradigm shift here with more start-ups going full throttle in developing various space technologies,” said Ravi Pathak, CEO, Tatvic Analytics, who is also an angel investor. Satya Ranjan Acharya, director of EDII-base Cradle, said that they have a venture aiming at making an indigenous multi-purpose rocket. “In time to come, we may see many more deep-tech startups for both core services and providing solutions in space sector,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ushering-in-the-space-age/articleshow/84741499.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Thiruvananthapuram||On lockdown day, these students take to the field||Thiruvananthapuram: While many students were stuck at homes, attending online classes, the students of the Government High School at Avanavanchery were busy planting paddy saplings (njaru nadal) on Saturday. The schools’ Student Police Cadet (SPC) team transplanted the saplings at the 35 cents of leased land at Kattayilkonnam padashekaram near Idakodu. It was six years ago that the school’s SPC unit had started paddy cultivation on a barren piece of land as part of the project, ‘Ente Maram’, a tree sapling planting initiative that aims at making students aware of the importance for agriculture. With the support of local farmers and Krishi Bhavan, the students are actively involved in all stages of farming from sowing seeds to reaping the harvest. “In fact, this is a good sign that the coming generation won’t abandon farming. Owing to the pandemic we couldn’t ensure the participation of all students. And they are quite unhappy about it,” said Sabu N, the SPC community police officer at the school. Besides paddy cultivation, they have also been cultivating different varieties of vegetables like snake gourd, bitter gourd and spinach. Often the yields are used to prepare dishes for the mid-day meal scheme at the school. But now with the school remaining shut, the vegetables are sold to nearby residents. “Usually on school reopening day, the students are given payasam with the rice obtained from the cultivation. The remaining paddy is bought by the teachers,” said Sabu. This time onwards, they are planning to introduce their own brand of organic rice in the markets. And they have used Uma, a high yielding seed variety for cultivation. According to PTA pesident Adv Madhusoodhanan, the venture was an eye-opener for the people. Once the school started cultivation, many locals also started farming on the other nearby barren land. “As my grandfather is a farmer and I too have a liking for farming. By joining the school’s agricultural activities, I have learned many aspects of paddy cultivation like sowing, transplanting and harvesting. The local farmers support us well throughout the process,” said Aswani, an SPC of the school. The njaru nadal held on Saturday was inaugurated by Mudakkal Panchayat president K Chandrababu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/on-lockdown-day-these-students-take-to-the-field/articleshow/84741395.cms||---

Shaken by visuals of submerged villages, NGOs began dispatching relief material, including raw food grains, household items, utensils, candles and items of sanitation to affected areas. On Saturday, donors heeded the call of the Juma Masjid Trust and Be Human Foundation, and dispatched five trucks of relief material. “The vehicles reached their destination after an arduous four-hour trip. More trucks will be sent soon,” said Shuaib Khatib, trust chairman. One vehicle was loaded with 160 bags of food grain donated by a certain Rafiqbhai. Each bag weighed 25 kg. Residents of Dongri, Nagpada and Mohammed Ali Road have been mobilising support for Raigad-Chiplun. Many locals have roots in Konkan. “We are happy that even amid the Covid pandemic, Mumbaikars are donating generously. We have arranged 750 litres of milk, 2,000 litres of potable water, food grains, clothes, medicine and utensils. Two tempos with relief material have already reached Chiplun,” journalist Amir Khan from Dongri said. The team includes social workers Tabassum Dhorarjiwala, Usmaan Tambe and Naeem Nakhwa. Khaana Chahiye, a fledgling NGO that took root during the lockdown, has set up collection centres for relief citywide. The Catholic Church is stepping up to the plate in Mahad. On Tuesday Fr Nigel Barrett, spokesman for the Catholic Church in Mumbai, will send a truckload of food grains and household items to Mahad from Rosary Church, Mazgaon, where he is parish priest. “Fr Pravin of Mahad sent an SOS to say the area was submerged under 15-20 ft of water. He is setting up a kitchen to provide meals to people and basic rations. We have invited people and parishes to contribute food essential and candles,” Fr Nigel said. The RSS organised a collection drive for food items in Dahisar under Nidhi Thakur and in Thane as well. Thane city opened its heart with residents inundating community and political groups with relief material within minutes of Sunday's appeal. Thinking out of the box, the Samast Mahajan Sanstha dispatched 10 men along with raw material to cook hot khichdi for stranded residents. The All Thane Malayali Association also appealed to members to pitch in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-trusts-ngos-open-purses-for-flood-hit-konkan-residents/articleshow/84743370.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Pune||Pune: Notices sent to colleges offering first-year junior college admissions before CET||PUNE: Even before the common entrance test (CET) for first-year junior college (FYJC) is conducted, many colleges in the city have reportedly started admitting students to Class XI. Following complaints from activists and parents, secondary and higher secondary director Dinkar Temkar issued a notice to all the colleges in the city, warning that strict action would be taken against those illegally giving admissions to students. After the SSC board examinations were cancelled, it was decided that evaluation would be done based on Class X internal marks and Class IX final examination results. The state education department decided to conduct FYJC admissions based on the CET, scheduled to be held offline on August 21. Education activist Kuldeep Ambekar of Students Helping Hand said, “The day SSC results were announced, several colleges in the city started to send admission-related messages to students. This is wrong.” Chairman of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Dinkar Patil said students must refrain from taking FYJC admission before the CET. “No junior college in the state has permission to conduct admissions. Admissions will begin only after CET is held and based on the merit list through a centralised process. No student should fall for any claims made by colleges,” Patil said. Vani Mhetre, a student who scored 92.23 % in the SSC results announced last week, said, “On the one hand, we are trying to fill up the form for CET and on the other, we were getting messages from some institutions to confirm admissions. We were confused and thought they had permission to admit students.” Due to technical glitches, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has deactivated the form-filling link for CET. The link would be revived once the problems are resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/notices-sent-to-colleges-offering-fyjc-admissions-before-cet/articleshow/84741381.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The civic education department said the schools denied admissions after not receiving their dues for the RTE enrolments from the state government. Parag Mundhe, education officer, PCMC, told TOI that they sent the recommendation to the deputy director of education office Pune on July 23. “There are 180 private schools are eligible for 25% admission quota to the underprivileged students under the RTE Act. These 22 schools, however, denied admissions to more than 150 students. We had served them showcause notices in the past few months, but they are not ready to buzz,” he said. On the students denied admissions, Mundhe said they would be ‘adjusted’ in the nearby schools, where the RTE quota seats were vacant. “We will ensure no academic loss happens to any student,” he said. Mundhe said the lottery for the admissions under the RTE quota was announced in March when around 3,400 admissions were allotted. After Covid-19 restrictions were relaxed, the admission process continued till June 30 and was later extended in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/derecognise-22-pvt-schools-recommends-pcmc-dept/articleshow/84741435.cms||---

There are only two facilties, PGI and GMCH 32, which have been consistently conducting the RTPCR test. “The Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), which was roped in at the start of the pandemic, stopped testing Chandigarh’s samples due to problems in transportation of samples,” said an official of the UT health department. PGI has trained many health care workers for setting up RTPCR laboratory in places as far as Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir. “We have time now and can spare time for training,” said Prof Mini P Singh of the department of virology, PGI. Sources said that the UT health department did not approach PGI after initial talks of training staff to start RTCPR. “We have even trained pathologists from remote reaches of Ladakh in a few days and now they are self-reliant in testing,” said Prof Singh. Public health experts underline the need to enhance testing before a surge to prevent spread of the disease and manage transmission despite variants. “It has been seen that in states where testing has been aggressive, there has been regulation of transmission of the virus. UT health department had roped in three private laboratories for RTCPR testing and had fixed the rates on the pattern of Haryana. “This was done when there was a load of samples and only PGI and GMCH were catering to demand. Government Multispeciality hospital 16 is a district hospital which does not have this facility. However, in Haryana all district hospitals are equipped with the tests,” said Prof Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-drags-feet-on-rtpcr-test-training-from-pgi/articleshow/84741433.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Even though autos are ferrying four passengers and not two as advised by the government, auto operators claimed that they had been struggling to make up the losses they suffered in the past three months, so reducing the fare was difficult for them. The operators claimed that many of them have incurred debts and could not pay EMIs. Autos offer the last mile connectivity for commuters in the city at a time when buses have become irregular, particularly during the evening peak hours. “The demand for autos always exceeds the supply, leaving hardly any option for a downward fare revision, even if the fuel prices drop. The fare they increased on the pretext of ferrying two passengers remains unaltered, even though autos started operating to full capacity week after resuming operation,” said Anirban Dasgupta, a transport economist. The auto LPG prices, on the contrary, dropped to Rs 51.65 in May from Rs 52.93 in March and further to Rs 50.57 in July. The drop in auto LPG prices led to a significant reduction in the cost of operation. However, the reduction in LPG prices did not lead to any reduction of fare. “Auto is the only passenger carrier, which can determine its fare on its own. The transport department does not interfere much,” said an official. “The auto fare from Behala tram depot to Rashbehari Avenue crossing used to be Rs 16 before the restriction was imposed. From July 1, the fare was raised to Rs 25 as the auto operators claimed that they were ferrying two passengers, instead of four. But within a few days, they started picking four passengers, but the fare remained the same,” said Jayati Sinha, a private insurance employee. “Autos were stopped from May 15. We ran into debts. Meanwhile, operating costs rose because of a hike in the prices of parts and insurance fees,” said Manas Ghosh, an INTTUC-affiliated auto union leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/auto-lpg-price-drops-but-fare-remains-high/articleshow/84741430.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Now at a time when the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) has announced a special scheme for Class 10 and Class 12 students who will take two term-end exams with a rationalised syllabus for each term, the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) may be forced to revisit its decision and reconsider it for near future. “Gujarat government has decided to follow CBSE rules after there were a series of flip-flops earlier this year where GSHSEB had to ultimately follow the Centre. A case in point was the decision to cancel Class 12 board exams last month,” said a source in the education department. In the past one and half decades, the state education department has announced several initiatives that it had to roll back due to implementation issues. Most of these measures were not time-tested and the government had rolled them out for the masses before their success could be tested on a pilot scale.

Two persons were arrested. The woman lodged an FIR with Bidhannagar cyber cell last week, alleging she was cheated and also blackmailed by a woman and her associate, who had promised to get her a role in a web series. According to police, the woman met a make-up artist, Jayosree Mitra (35), on a social networking site who allegedly offered to groom her for a better career on OTT platforms. The woman was allegedly asked to participate in a shoot at Salt Lake Central Park in March. For this, she even had to pay Rs 3,000.

Fuelling domestic travel, businessmen and corporate professionals have been making visits to and fro from the city, while leisure travel has also started. “Also, immigrants are coming back to Hyderabad, Bengaluru and other big cities. For immigrants and citizens of other countries, it is easy to enter India and even go return. So, they are travelling. Only now Qatar and Saudi Arabia have opened up with the precondition of travellers having taken two doses. This is also fuelling travel in addition to some heading to Dubai,” said Abdul Majid Faheem, chairman, Telangana and AP chapter of Tour Agents’ Federation of India. Within the country, citizens have been travelling largely to the north for leisure. “I have had bookings for Manali, Dalhousie and Goa even when the 18 plus age group was not vaccinated. In fact, majority of the people wanting to travel for leisure are spending higher amounts as they want the holiday to be perfect. Many say that since they have waited a lot for the holiday, they want a completely pre-planned travel schedule,” said Mohd Kazeem, an independent tour operator. As compared to Rs 30,000-40,000 per person, people are now willing to spend even double the amount for a three-day trip. For visitors to Hyderabad, the lesser number of Covid-19 cases have helped them make a travel decision. “I was to visit an aunt in Hyderabad for a long time and finally did it after I got the first dose. My parents have already been vaccinated, so we finally made the visit in July first week. Also, the fact that Hyderabad is a safe zone compared to other places helped,” Serina David, a professional from Pune, said. In fact, a survey by a bus booking app, Abhibus, has shown a 60% surge in demand in June and Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Visakhapatnam, Jaipur and Chennai among others have been the most preferred travel destinations. “Nearly 55% of travellers (in June) reported to be completely vaccinated and an additional 32% have received the first dose of vaccine. After Bengaluru, Hyderabad is the most preferred destination.

Cops suspect that the boy was trying to make a small explosive to kill wild boars. The explosion at tenant farmer B Yadaiah’s house around 10 am created panic in the SC Colony as it occurred in the middle of a residential area. Locals who reached the house found Yadaiah’s son Venkatesh withering in pain. The boy was alone at home when the incident happened, police said. Venkatesh was rushed to a local hospital initially and from there to Osmania General Hospital. “Venkatesh was sitting on the tiles in front of his house when the blast occurred. We do not know exactly what he was holding and what he was trying to do. He lost fingers of both his hands. He suffered injuries to his palms and face. He is not in a condition to talk. Forensic team has collected samples for lab analysis,” said Vikarabad SP M Narayana. The explosion caused a hole in the stone tile on which Venkatesh was sitting. “There was about 2kg of ammonia-based fertiliser in a sack nearby. At the site of explosion, black gel like chemical was found. We suspect that Venkatesh was trying to make a small explosive using locally available chemicals to target wild boars,” a Peddemul cop said. A case was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mystery-blast-shepherd-loses-all-fingers-at-home/articleshow/84739202.cms||---

---||Goa||Submit study backing decision to declare wild boar as vermin: Amicus curiae||Panaji: The amicus curiae in the petition challenging the government’s decision to declare wild boar as vermin has sought details of ground-level assessment, including studies, consultation, expert opinion and surveys, based on which the decision has been taken. Information on areas where the human-wildlife conflict has been reported from and the steps taken to manage it, was also sought. Amicus curiae Anamika Gode also asked whether any human-wildlife conflict management plans directed by the Union environment ministry have been prepared in Goa. She also asked whether the wild boar population in adjacent forests has been assessed and whether the government has implemented any alternative methods to alleviate farmers’ concerns and found that these were inadequate. “There are several known alternatives already being used in the country for scientific management of human-animal conflicts, including fencing, noise makers that repel animals naturally from farms, providing watering holes deep inside forests and creating sources of food to pre-empt wild animals from foraying into areas of human habitation, especially during summer,” Gode submitted to the high court. She also suggested that the government contemplate a special crop insurance scheme designed for vulnerable areas, to cover the damage to crops and property destroyed by wild boar. Expert committees as well as the Union environment ministry now advocate the use of alternative methods to deal with the issue of human-wildlife conflict and, most recently, the standing committee of the National Board of Wildlife in its 60th meeting held on January 5 has approved the advisory for management of human-wildlife conflict in the country, she stated. The petition challenging the government’s decision to declare wild boar as vermin was filed by Surendra Gajanan Samant, who stated that this will facilitate the hunting of wild animals. He alleged that it will facilitate many politicians to kill these wild animals for meat trade with five star hotels and illegal export to foreign countries. He alleged that the politicians want to make money for the election. He suggested that the state adopt the latest technology, like ultra sound system or stringent smell to repel wild boar, so that the agricultural farmers and farms are protected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/submit-study-backing-decision-to-declare-wild-boar-as-vermin-amicus-curiae/articleshow/84744691.cms||---

She also had to undergo a surgery for a swelling on the right side of her nose earlier this year when pre-operative check-ups revealed a lump near her heart.She was brought to the city for further probe when it was revealed that the tumor was mediastinal parathyroid adenoma. Dr Nitin Singhal, an onco-surgeon with Apollo Hospital, said that in general parlance, it was a tumor in which excessive parathyroid hormone is produced. That leads to the weakening of normal bones and the formation of abnormal bony swellings in the body and the formation of kidney stones due to excessive calcium deposits.“Thus, the root cause of her issues was the tumor. Generally, it’s found in the neck cavity, but in this patient, it was near her heart,” said Dr Singhal. “After the diagnosis by Dr Shirish Alurkar, consultant oncologist, the patient came for surgery.”Dr Singhal added: “We were surprised to see the size of the tumor in the scans. But the bigger surprise awaited us at the operation table.” The tumor was of 110gm while the gland usually weighs 2gm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mystery-fractures-jumbo-tumor-removed/articleshow/84741539.cms||---

---||World||French President Macron calls Israeli PM Bennett on allegations of snooping||JERUSALEM: French President Emmanuel Macron has spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on reports that Morocco's security forces may have used the Pegasus spyware to snoop on his cellphones, according to a media report. A global media consortium last week reported that 50,000 cellphone numbers were being spied on using the Pegasus malware, which has been developed by Israeli cybersecurity company NSO Group. The mobile phones of French President Macron and 15 members of his government may have been among potential targets, according to a member of the media consortium. Macron telephoned Bennett on Thursday and asked him to ensure that "the issue was being taken seriously", Israel's Channel 12 reported on Saturday evening. The Israeli prime minister said that the allegations are from a period when he had not assumed office but assured that the required conclusions on the matter will be reached upon. Macron had called an urgent national security meeting on Thursday to discuss the Pegasus spyware after reports about its misuse in France emerged. The Moroccan government has denied reports that the country's security forces used the spyware to eavesdrop on the French president. Similarly, the NSO Group has denied that the French President was targeted. We can "specifically come out and say for sure that the President of France, Macron, was not a target," Chaim Gelfand, Chief Compliance Officer at NSO Group, told Israeli television network i24news on Wednesday. A source close to Macron played down the risks, saying that the French leader had several phones which were “regularly changed, updated and secured”. Israel on Thursday established a committee to review the allegations of misuse of the NSO group's surveillance software and hinted at a possible "review of the whole matter of giving licences". “The defence establishment appointed a review committee made up of a number of bodies," lawmaker Ram Ben-Barak, the head of Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, told Army Radio on Thursday. “When they finish their review, we'll demand to see the results and assess whether we need to make corrections," Ben-Barak, who earlier served as deputy head of Israel's Mossad spy agency, added. Israel's priority was "to review this whole matter of giving licenses", he stressed. NSO's chief executive, Shalev Hulio, welcomed the move, telling Army Radio that he would "be very pleased if there were an investigation so that we'd be able to clear our name". Hulio claimed that there was an effort “to smear the whole Israeli cyber industry". Ben-Barak noted that Pegasus had helped "expose many terror cells", but "if it was misused or sold to irresponsible bodies, this is something we need to check". The NSO head also told the Radio that his company could not disclose the details of its contracts due to "issues of confidentiality," but said "he would offer full transparency to any government seeking more details". "Let any state entity come along — any official from any state — and I'll be prepared to open everything up to them, for them to enter, to dig around from top to bottom," Hulio asserted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/french-president-macron-calls-israeli-pm-bennett-on-allegations-of-snooping/articleshow/84745403.cms||---

MGICCC will develop the garden in collaboration with the forest and wildlife department. Forest officials will develop artificial ponds and other facilities to lure peafowls into the garden, where they will not be kept in captivity. A large number of peacocks move freely in the MGICCC campus and neighbouring farmhouses in the area. A five-acre green area on the campus will be developed as the garden. “The garden will not be like a zoo, but birds will not remain in captivity. We will create a perfect habitat for them,” said a forest official. Saplings of plants consumed by peacocks will also be planted in the garden. Vipul Pandey, director, MGICCC, said, “The garden will be developed on the lines of the one in Chandigarh. The idea is to educate visitors about the national bird of India and ensure conservation of the avian species. We are aiming to create a nature walk for visitors.” Pandey said there will be no direct feeling of peafowls. “We will create a perfect shelter with food and water that will lure the birds into the garden. Breeding of the birds may also happen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-peacock-garden-will-add-another-feather-to-delhis-cap/articleshow/84741523.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The incident happened in Silla-Bahman village, Jakholi tehsil, Rudraprayag district. On the demand of villagers, the leopard has been declared a maneater. A forest team has been combing the area since the toddler went missing but to no avail. “The search operation has been underway since Saturday night. We have found bloodstains. The forest team is also combing the area. We are not even hopeful of finding her as she was a toddler. How would she survive the tough conditions of terrain and weather,” said Prem Lal, Rishika's father. Meanwhile, JS Suhag, the chief wildlife warden of the forest department, has given the nod to either trap or eliminate the big cat with the help of shooters. Two shooters - Joy Hukki and Zahir Baksh -- were deployed for the task. "There is no coincidence here. The leopard went into the house and left with the child. So, villagers are worried as it could happen to other children too. So, we requested it to be trapped or killed," said Vaibhav Singh, Rudraprayag DFO. In the past seven months, Uttarakhand has already lost 18 human lives to leopard attacks. Chief wildlife warden JS Suhag said, “Leopards usually target dogs but during rains, they all move indoors. So the felines snatch away vulnerable humans.” Since July 15, the state has lost four lives to leopard attacks - two in Tehri and one each in Pithoragarh and Rudraprayag. And 18 individuals lost their lives to the human-leopard conflict, so far, this year. Seven leopards have been declared "man-eater and six have been killed. The forest authorities have claimed that probably leopards have become aggressive due to excessive rainfall. Uttarakhand has recorded a 10% rain surplus in the first 50 days of the monsoon season, which started on June 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/toddler-snatched-away-by-leopard-from-front-yard-search-on-forest-dept-says-leopards-attacking-on-humans-as-dogs-move-indoors-during-rains/articleshow/84739287.cms||Shivani Azad

A large number of people took part in the celebrations and offered Bonam to Goddess Mahankali. As per the tradition, minister for animal husbandry Talasani Srinivas Yadav offered the first Bangaru Bonam.

It was also observed that a few VIPs at the temple were not wearing masks.“I am visiting the temple after a year and have been fully vaccinated. Therefore, I am not worried about the third wave,” said a devotee.

---||Hyderabad||LIC told to pay Rs 15.5 lakh to kin of policyholder in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here on Sunday directed Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to pay Rs 15.5 lakh to the complainant who filed a case on behalf of his minor granddaughters for repudiating their claims citing non-disclosure of information. K Ramulu, the complainant, who is the grandfather and legal guardian of his two minor granddaughters, submitted that his son obtained two insurance policies for a sum of Rs 5 lakh insurance coverage under Jeevan Anand and Rs 10 lakh insurance coverage under New Bima Gold. Post his demise, Ramulu said that they submitted insurance claim on July 6, 2012, but the same was repudiated stating ‘the deceased had withheld correct information regarding his health and failed to disclose one of his previous policies while taking the current policy.’ While denying the allegations, LIC contended that the complainant’s claims are rightly repudiated on the grounds of non-disclosure of previous policy and also for suppressing material facts in the proposal form. The bench noticed that the complainant’s deceased son has declared six of his policies and missed out on declaring only one of his previous policies. On suppression of chronic liver disease in the proposal form, the bench noticed that as per the discharge summary dated June 13, 2012, the insured was suffering from chronic disease for the past six months, whereas the policy was taken on July 27, 2011. “There is nothing on record showing that the complainant deliberately suppressed facts,” the bench said, and directed LIC to pay insurance amount along with 9% interest. Apart from compensation, Rs 5,000 was awarded towards the cost of the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lic-told-to-pay-rs-15-5l-to-kin-of-policyholder/articleshow/84739250.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Dehradun||One CM makes a law, other withdraws it; BJP has made a mockery of system: Ganesh Godiyal||DEHRADUN: After a go-ahead from Congress top brass, Ganesh Godiyal was given the coveted post of party's Uttarakhand chief last week. He is tasked with bringing the party leaders together and ensuring a much-needed win for Congress in the forthcoming state assembly polls. In an exclusive interaction with TOI's Kautilya Singh, Godiyal spoke extensively on the election agenda, challenges before Congress, and entry of the Aam Aadmi Party in Uttarakhand politics, among others. Excerpts: With just a few months left for the 2022 polls, what are the biggest challenges before you? Yes, we are close to the polls but the Uttarakhand Congress, under the leadership of my predecessor, has been working on the ground and raising people-centric issues. We have been making people aware of the failures of the incumbent government for the last four years. As the party's state chief, I aim to reach out to the people in remote hills. Congress was reduced to 11 seats in 2017. How do you plan to pull off a turnaround in 2022? State residents are well aware of the lacklustre performance of the BJP in the last four and a half years. They have transformed Uttarakhand into a factory of experiments at the cost of people and development. Even after getting 57 out of the 70 assembly seats, they failed to give a single full-term CM to the state. One CM makes a law and the other withdraws it. This is a complete mockery of the system. There are reports of differences among senior Congress leaders over the new poll team. There may be some differences of opinion but no one has approached me with such an issue so far. The party has constituted a big team dedicated to the polls which comprises senior leaders and young functionaries. We are confident of reaching out to all areas of the state with our development vision. What is your main agenda for the election? The first and the foremost is unemployment. The BJP government has been making false promises of employment opportunities to the youths. The migrant workers, who returned to the state during the Covid phase, have been reduced to daily wagers. Besides, poor health and education infrastructure in the hills will also be our focus. AAP aims to provide the state residents with an alternative to the BJP and Congress. Is the Kejriwal-led party a threat to Congress? They are raising the same issues which we have already highlighted. Their biggest poll promise — free electricity — is also inspired by our announcement. Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Harish Rawat had already promised 100 units of free power in the first year and 200 units of free power from the second year if the Congress is voted to office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/one-cm-makes-a-law-other-withdraws-it-bjp-has-made-a-mockery-of-system-ganesh-godiyal/articleshow/84739343.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||World||UK minister apologises for urging people not to 'cower from' Covid||LONDON: British health minister Sajid Javid apologised for and deleted a tweet urging people to take a Covid-19 vaccine and not to "cower" from the virus, saying on Sunday he had made "a poor choice of word". Javid, who replaced Matt Hancock as health minister last month after his predecessor stepped down for breaking Covid rules by kissing an aide in his office, had been criticised for using the word "cower" when tens of thousands in Britain have died from the virus and many are trying to keep safe. Britain, which has one of the highest official Covid death tolls, has shifted its strategy to fight coronavirus from using restrictions to limit its spread to opening up society in the hope vaccines will protect most people from serious illness. Cases are high, but so is uptake of Covid-19 vaccines, and officials argue the shift is needed to help businesses in sectors such as hospitality and the night-time economy. Writing on Twitter, Javid said on Sunday he had "deleted a tweet which used the word 'cower'." "I was expressing gratitude that the vaccines help us fight back as a society, but it was a poor choice of word and I sincerely apologise. Like many, I have lost loved ones to this awful virus and would never minimise its impact." On Saturday, he had written that he had recovered after testing positive for Covid, after suffering mild symptoms. "Please - if you haven't yet - get your jab, as we learn to live with, rather than cower from, this virus." Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour Party, was one of several lawmakers from opposition parties and people who had lost family members to the pandemic to criticise his use of the phrase "cower from". "127,000 people have died from this virus, tens of thousands of whom would still be here if it wasn't for the catastrophic failures of your government," she said on Twitter. "So how dare you denigrate people for trying to keep themselves and their families safe."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-minister-apologises-for-urging-people-not-to-cower-from-covid/articleshow/84745454.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Teen raises funds for transpersons’ jab drive||At least 100 members of the transgender (TG) community — which often finds itself excluded from the social safety net — got t heir jab on Saturday at a special inoculation drive in Malad organised by teenager Sia Sehgal who raised Rs 1.75 lakh to provide for their vaccines and ration kits. When the wired world was abuzz with frantic searches for vaccine slots, what struck the 16-year-old was this vulnerable group living without smartphones or the Internet and grappling with several other hurdles — lack of documentation to social stigma — that prevented them from getting jabbed. “Inclusion is a right, not a privilege and their exclusion of it really bothered me,” said Sia, who had read reports of the trans community's exclusion from jab drives. In an attempt to learn more about the challenges faced by the transsexual community, she sought out In Harmony, a diversion and inclusion consultancy, joined forces with Mumbai District AIDS Control Society and managed to reach out to TG members. “I had long conversations with them and realised that apart from lack of proper government ID and fear of being driven away by medical centres, some were scared to take the vaccine. It took some persuasion to make them understand its necessity and agree to register,” said Sia as she took the lead and with help from parents, roped in several corporates to raise funds. The first to arrive at the vaccination camp on Saturday morning, the class XI student of Hill Spring International School will have to wait till she’s eligible for her shot but the teenager made sure that her new friends from the trans community got their shield against the virus. “After this camp, I’m hopeful that many more will come forward,” said the budding slam poet who set up a platform on Instagram during the pandemic called ‘Something Unsaid’ to use spoken word poetry to advocate for social justice. “Whenever I see a person or a community being isolated or targeted — be it at a family gathering or in the news — it triggers me. I believe youngsters like me have a responsibility to open up pathways for communities that have suffered prejudice from our previous generations. This is my way of trying to impact and improve lives, especially during these trying times,” says Sia whose first crusade was for pregnant women in the tribal district of Nashik hit by severe anaemia last year. “We raised Rs 50,000 and provided food packets, vitamins and medication. My aim was to safeguard these vulnerable women and prevent the fatality of their unborn child.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-teen-raises-funds-for-transpersons-jab-drive/articleshow/84744717.cms||Mohua Das

The civic body has given 5,000 bottles which were lying in the godown of the municipality office, the first batch, to an NGO that is dispatching Ganga water to people in Haryana. “We had around 20,000 seized plastic cans which were seized from Har ki Pauri lying around, as selling of plastic products is prohibited in Haridwar. An NGO approached us for the cans to send Ganga jal to other states and we agreed. If any other organization approaches us, we will give them the rest of the cans,” Haridwar municipal commissioner Jai Bharat Singh told TOI. These plastic cans, hazardous for the health of the Ganga river and the environment, are destroyed scientifically by the corporation after being seized. The HMC’s move to transport Ganga water in these has raised eyebrows. Haridwar mayor Anita Sharma said she was not consulted by the commissioner before the move was taken. “It is very unfortunate that these plastic cans, seized as per law, are being handed over to an NGO for reuse. It is completely against the law. The municipal commissioner did not take any permission from my office and I have requested him to work according to rules.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cans-seized-from-haridwar-a-plastic-free-zone-now-used-to-transport-gangajal/articleshow/84739366.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s Ramappa temple, a fable in stone, now world heritage site||HYDERABAD: The historic Ramappa temple, an architectural fable in stone, on Sunday became Unesco's first world heritage site in Telangana. Located in Mulugu district, the iconic temple is now India’s 39th world heritage site. The online extended 44th session of the World Heritage Committee of the Unesco, which is currently underway at Fuzhou in China, voted in favour of Ramappa temple for inclusion in the world heritage sites' list. Altogether, 17 countries backed the resolution, which was strongly supported by Russia, while Norway opposed it. Earlier, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), in its report presented before the World Heritage Committee for the 44th session, favoured that the heritage tag be deferred. But, as most of the members attending the Fuzhou session backed the 13th century Kakatiyan temple, also called Rudreshwara temple, it got the prized heritage tag. The Charminar and the Qutub Shahi tombs, which were submitted to Unesco for the heritage tag, are at present in the tentative list. The temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, and other small temples within the complex were constructed by Kakatiya rulers Rudradeva and Recharla Rudra between the 12th and 13th centuries. Work on the main temple began in 1213 CE and completed 40 years later. Built with sandstone and a sandbox foundation, the temple has decorated beams and columns made of granite. The temple’s unique feature is its tower or Vimana, which is in the shape of a pyramid. The Vimana has been constructed using porous bricks, which are light in weight. These bricks, one of the features of the Kakatiya rulers, are popularly known as floating bricks. It represents the architectural and cultural beauty of the former rulers of Orugallu, modern day Warangal, with the kingdom expanding to many parts of modern Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The technical evaluation panel of the ICOMOS visited Ramappa temple from September 23 to 27, 2019. The panel accepted the report in 2020 and called for more information from the Telangana government. It has pinpointed as many as nine shortcomings that needed to be overcome. The undivided AP government sent the dossier to Unesco in 2014, just before the bifurcation of the state. “(It) partly illustrates Kakatiyan architectural, artistic, and technological traditions through its architectural structures within the walled temple compound and its wider setting. The walled temple complex is a single shrine temple comprising the central Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple and other secondary mandapas, shrines and temples. The sculptures, especially the bracket figures at the Rudreshwara Temple, are fine artistic representations of Kakatiya dance customs and cultural traditions. These features testify to Kakatiya customs and temple rituals as well as construction technology, materials and other sculptural elements illustrating artistic capacities in terms of workmanship,” the ICOMOS said in its 2021 report. It, however, maintained that while the conditions of authenticity are satisfactory, the conditions of integrity cannot be fully met in terms of completeness due to the missing features and attributes as well as a general vulnerability of the temple’s setting because of a lack of protection mechanism. The Telangana government in its dossier said: “Rudreshwara Temple is a singular testimony of the highest level of creative, artistic, and engineering expression of the Kakatiya period. It is also a testimony of a flourishing agriculture-based society on land devoid of perennial water sources in the 12th century. The sculptures of the temple, especially its bracket figures, are unique sculptures carved out of the hard dolerite stone and express dynamic movement in their forms. Neither humans nor animals appear static or sedentary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-ramappa-temple-a-fable-in-stone-now-world-heritage-site/articleshow/84744719.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Madurai||Plea in HC to allow use of forest land||Madurai: Madras high court has directed the authorities to consider and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law on the representations submitted by forest dwellers who sought permission to use the land which comes under forest area in Theni district. The court was hearing the petition filed by 33 forest dwellers from Andipatti taluk. They stated that they have been residing in the area for the past 80 years cultivating cotton, coconut, cashew and lime. Their livelihood entirely depends on agricultural and allied animal husbandry activities. They are paying house tax, electricity tax and have ration cards as well as voter identity cards. There is also a temple, grazing fields, roads, pathway, crematorium and cemetery earmarked by the government for the use of village forest dwellers. However, in 1988, these land parcels came under the forest area. The petitioners stated that they have submitted representations seeking recognition of their fundamental and statutory right under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 for using the land. Subsequently, the block development officer convened a grama sabha meeting at which certain resolutions were passed with regard to recognition of land used by the petitioners. The petitioners stated that their rights have to be recognized at the earliest by implementing the resolution passed in the grama sabha meeting as they are being time and again harassed by the forest officials. Taking into account the limited scope of the prayer sought for and without going into the merits of the case, Justice J Nisha Banu directed the authorities to consider the representation of the petitioners based on the grama sabha meeting in accordance with the Act and pass appropriate orders within 12 weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-in-hc-to-allow-use-of-forest-land/articleshow/84739413.cms||---

The five-member CWC for North Goa is headed by Esther Torres as chairperson while its other members are Snehal Salgaonkar, Andrea Pereira, Chandan Gajanan Naik, and Smita Patil. Amruta Kamat has been appointed as the chairperson of South Goa CWC. Its other members are Roselle Solomon, Rejitha Rajan, Sanjiwani Dessai and Viren Bhende. An official of the women and child development said though the CWCs are appointed by the government, they are independent functionaries with powers to decide on cases of children that are heard by them. A former member of the CWC speaking on the condition of anonymity said, she hopes to see unanimity among members of the CWC, as ego clashes and constant disagreements among the members could delay the finalisation of important cases. “The CWCs are appointed to protect the interest of children, and I know, even previous members had the children’s interest at heart but thanks to the inflexibility of one or two members, sometimes the larger objective was derailed,” the former member said. She expects that new CWCs will handle cases of transfer of children into the custody of CWC of the respective state or to a parent - a child is transferred to his native state if found to be not from Goa – with sensitivity and avoid possible delays. The cases of children caught begging on the streets are dealt with seriousness, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/child-welfare-committees-constituted/articleshow/84744718.cms||---

The woman approached the police on Sunday and alleged that she was raped by the teacher. Her family alleged that the accused, Bhagirath Chaudhary, raped her after getting her unconscious. Subsequently, police lodged an FIR against the teacher. However, the teacher also alleged that the woman's family extorted Rs 13 lakh from him, threatening to leak their intimate video online. He also produced his bank records to support the accusation. Hence, a cross FIR was registered against the woman and her family members as well. “We called both the parties to understand the case in depth. While the accused teacher showed the records that proved that he paid Rs 13 lakh to the woman’s family. The woman too showed an intimate video, claiming the man had raped her,” said station house officer of the Vikas Nagar police station. Police have booked the teacher under rape charge and the woman’s family has been booked under section 389 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code. According to police, the accused teacher had taught the victim's elder sister and helped her pursue higher education in the past. Further probe is underway and the credibility of the video is also being established.

The association submitted that the senate being the supreme governing body in terms of the Act was the one empowered to revise affiliation fees applicable to the affiliated colleges.Justice V Parthiban observed that there is no dispute regarding the legal proposition that the university has the power to revise the rates of affiliation fee periodically. Several revisions had taken place in the past and had been implemented by MKU. However, the controversy herein is whether the university has followed the procedure contemplated in the Act while revising the affiliation fee.As per Section 31 (4)(b) of the Act, there is a clear embargo placed upon the syndicate among others that it shall not propose the draft of any statute or of amendment of the statute affecting the conditions of affiliation. The judge observed that in the case on hand the proposal of the syndicate on the revision of affiliation fee was approved by the senate which is not in terms as per the Act. That apart, the order of revision of the affiliation fee has not received the assent of the chancellor. Hence, the judge allowed the petition and set aside the order passed for fixing the renewal of affiliation fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-sets-aside-mku-order-for-fixing-renewal-of-affiliation-fee/articleshow/84739395.cms||---

A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi said there appeared to be some other motive in the litigation. The court is of the view that being a member of Indian Red Cross Society, established by an Act of central legislation in 1920, may add value to the institution or department where the concerned person is serving. The petitioner’s grievance is that teachers and government servants holding executive posts are carrying on activities of Indian Red Cross Society in the district during working hours, for which they are receiving salary from the government. If that is so, it is for the concerned employer or management of the school/ government servant to take action for dereliction of duty. “If permission has been granted by the employer, then we cannot direct the authorities to take action against those members,” the court said. The judges observed that though the petitioner has expressed grievance with regard to Ramanathapuram district, he has not named anyone who according to him are performing dual function. Hence, the judges dismissed the petition filed by J Ramesh Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cant-stop-govt-staff-from-holding-red-cross-society-posts-says-hc/articleshow/84739452.cms||---
---||Pune||Doctors see uptick in a serious bowel infection during Covid||PUNE: Repeated disregard for warnings against antibiotic overuse has led to rise in cases of serious bowel infection triggered by Clostridium difficile, often referred to as C. diff. It's a bacterium that can cause symptoms that range from diarrhoea to life-threatening inflammation of the colon. Illness from C. diff most commonly affects older adults in hospitals or those in long-term care facilities. An initial sign of C. diff is watery greenish coloured stool, around 12-14 times per day, with low-grade fever. But more than 15 months into the Covid-19 pandemic, doctors are seeing quite a few cases of C. diff infection in those who are traditionally not considered susceptible, such as young individuals, due to irrational use of antibiotics. Doctors said this may be because the tendency to self-medicate with antibiotics has risen to worrying levels after March 2020. Specialists emphasized that only those patients who have a secondary bacterial infection, in addition to Covid, actually need antibiotics. Also, hand sanitisers, including alcohol-based sprays and gels that have become synonymous with infection prevention during Covid, are of no use when it comes to getting rid of the C. diff germs. Alcohol does not kill C. diff spores. "Before Covid, I used to see around two to three cases of C diff a month. Now, cases have almost doubled. This rise in cases may still be an under-estimation, due to low screening rates for C diff-linked diarrhoea," said Pune-based physician and internal medicine expert Abhijit Lodha. Rampant use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in Covid-19 patients may have also increased the number of cases of C. diff diarrhoea. "If not halted in time, C. diff could become a major public health problem as it is resistant to multiple drugs and can cause a lot of morbidity and mortality," Lodha said. Infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag said, "The problem with C. diff is that it is under-diagnosed in India. We don't look for it as much as we should. In the US, it can even be a community-acquired infection. At bigger setups, like Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, we are also seeing around four to five cases of C diff every month." The rise in C diff cases is consistent across the globe. "Globally, antimicrobial resistance, and to some extent C diff infections, are menacing problems occurring concurrently with the Covid pandemic," said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the national Covid-19 task force. He added that it is important to establish and strengthen antimicrobial stewardship programmes at all levels of healthcare to mitigate the impact of these infections. The diagnosis is a two-step process. "It includes a test for the presence of C. diff bacteria. The second step involves looking for the presence of the specific toxin. C. diff produces two types of toxins - toxin A and toxin B. Toxin B is associated with more severe disease. Testing results are typically available within the same day," Prayag said. Once the patient is diagnosed with C. diff, doctors treat the initial infection with an antibiotic that specifically targets the C. difficile organism. Antibiotics used for the treatment of this infection include metronidazole, vancomycin and fidaxomicin. "Fidaxomicin, used in the West, is not available in India," Prayag said. In 30% of treated individuals, the infection returns within a few days or weeks after the antibiotic course. Doctors may choose to treat this first recurrence with another round of antibiotic therapy. But in those individuals who continue to have recurrent C. difficile-linked bowel infections, faecal transplantation or stool transplant is the last resort. "C. diff can also be transmitted from person to person by spores. These spores are not destroyed by hand sanitisers and need hand-washing (with soap) to be destroyed," Prayag said. In addition to hand-washing, eating natural food - fruits, vegetables, curds and healthy meat - and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics are key to preventing C. diff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/docs-see-uptick-in-a-serious-bowel-infection-during-covid/articleshow/84741683.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Startups are now exempted from paying earnest money deposit (EMD), prior turnover and experience besides waiver of tender cost to registered startups for public procurements below Rs 20 lakh. TCCI president Dr N Jegatheesan said the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector is a major contributor to the socio economic development of the country. Many startups struggle in the initial stages thanks to lack of market for their products. It was to ease the entry barriers to establish themselves that the concessions have been announced. The procurement entities include government departments, PSUs, statutory boards formed by the government, local bodies, co-operative institutions, universities and government societies. The government is a major purchaser in the economy and patronage by it could solve the marketing problems of startups to a great extent. This would help startups to scale rapidly, the TCCI president said. Tamil Nadu Startup and Innovation Mission or StartupTN has launched the first edition of Tamil Nadu Startup Seed Grant Fund 2021 (TANSEED) during January-February and has supported 10 promising startups with a seed grant of Rs 10 lakh each. Its second edition during July-September will support up to 20 startups with similar seed grants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tn-chamber-hails-govt-for-concessions-for-startups/articleshow/84739456.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Ramappa temple: ‘Exceptional testimony’ to Kakatiya era got heritage tag||HYDERABAD: The Ramappa temple’s ‘exceptional testimony’ to the cultural tradition of the Kakatiyas has helped it get UNESCO’s world heritage site tag. UNESCO rules call for meeting of at least one of the listed 10 criteria for any monument or site to qualify for a world heritage tag. The Telangana government sent three criteria in support of its demand for inclusion of the 13th century Ramappa temple complex in Mulugu district in the list. The three criteria included representing a masterpiece of human creative genius; exhibiting an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town planning or landscape design; and bearing a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), an expert panel of the UNESCO, discussed the three criteria on Ramappa and rejected the first two. But it agreed, though partially, that Ramappa temple met the third criteria of it being an ‘exceptional testimony’. The ICOMOS in its report submitted to the online extended 44th session of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO happening in Fuzhou in China said the third criteria was justified “on the grounds that Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple is the best surviving example of Kakatiya traditions of art, architecture and technology”. “The efforts of Kakatiya craftsmen to interpret and integrate motifs of regional dance customs and Kakatiya cultural traditions into sculptural and textual representations stands out as an exceptional testimony of popular cultural art forms in Kakatiya times,” the ICOMOS said, adding that the temple was created as a harmonious ensemble of the natural environment, architecture, sculpture, ritual and dance — five elements which complemented each other in defining the temple’s ritual space. ICOMOS considered that criterion 3 demonstrated strong potential to be met once the related attributes are fully included in the property (Ramappa temple), while criterion 2 had not been met and criterion 1 would require further comparative support to demonstrate its potential. While it indeed reflected Kakatiya cultural traditions, such as the detailed sculptures representing both ritual dances and local customs as well as having an architectural function, thereby connecting the different elements, the integration of the temple into its environmental surroundings preserved a unique Kakatiya temple setting and hence it required that Ramappa temple was approached within this larger context, the report suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/exceptional-testimony-to-kakatiya-era-got-heritage-tag/articleshow/84744721.cms||Syed Akbar
---||World||PoK elections are marred by irregularities, violence; 2 dead||ISLAMABAD: Voters in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir cast their ballots on Sunday to elect the region’s legislative assembly, in an election marred by allegations of irregularities and violence that killed at least two workers of PM Imran Khan’s party. The gates of polling booths were closed to new voters at 5pm. Counting will start after the voting ends. India has previously slammed Pakistan for its decision to hold elections in Gilgit-Baltistan and said any action to alter the status of the militarily occupied region has no legal basis. The assembly has a total of 53 members but only 45 are directly elected, while five seats are reserved for women and three are meant for the technocrats. A tough triangular competition involving the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) is expected. At a polling station in Kotli district, at least two PTI workers were killed in clashes with PPP activists, Dawn reported. In another incident, five police constables were injured after Jamaat-e-Islami activists attacked them at a booth in Jhelum valley district. Voting in some booths of other constituencies was also temporarily suspended due to clashes. Meanwhile, PPP has alleged that workers of the ruling PTI were using force to influence the voting process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pok-elections-are-marred-by-irregularities-violence-2-dead/articleshow/84745504.cms||---

Four women, who were hired for dance performance at the party, were among the five booked in the case. The fifth booked person, a medical practitioner from Katraj-Ambegaon who had organised the event, managed to give the raiding police party the slip. “In all 25 persons were found dancing to Hindi and Marathi songs, using LED flashlights . They were under the influence of liquor,” inspector Padmakar Ghanwat of the Pune rural police’s local crime branch told TOI on Sunday. “This was in defiance of the prevailing state orders relating to Covid norms,” he said, adding that resorts and hotels are not allowed to function as per an order issued by the district collector. Ghanwat and his team were patrolling the area late in the night when they were tipped off about the illegal party. Since May, the Pune rural and the Pune city police have busted seven such dance parties _ two in Lonavla and one each in Bhor, Kudje, Khanapur, Donje and now Golewadi near Sinhagad foothills. Ghanwat said, “A medical practitioner from Katraj-Ambegaon had booked the resort and invited his friends from Warje, Hadapsar, and Sinhagad road areas for the party. The women dancers were hired from Mumbai. When we raided the establishment, we found people dancing and the resort staff serving food and liquor to them. They were not wearing masks and all of them were drunk. The medical practitioner too was there but he managed to escape.” A case against the medical practitioner, the arrested six men and the women dancers has been registered with the Haveli police under Sections 269, 270 and 188 of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-held-doc-among-5-others-booked-for-partying-during-covid/articleshow/84741703.cms||---

After incessant rain in Nanded and Parbhani districts on July 21, no major rainfall has been recorded in the region with many parts receiving only intermittent spells of drizzle amid an occasional spell of heavy rain, producing conducive conditions for the kharif season. The region, comprising eight districts, has recorded an average of 462 mm rainfall so far since June 1, which accounts for 163% of the normally expected showers and 68% of the season’s total rainfall, as per official data. Tukaram Mote, Aurangabad district agricultural superintendent, on Sunday said the overall weather condition has been beneficial for kharif crops, which is in the growth stage at present. “The soil moisture and overall water requirement are well with the need of crops. The next flowering stage of crops if also receives favourable condition, kharif season will be successful unless any natural calamity occurs,” he said. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has a forecast of cloudy skies with chances of moderate rain in Aurangabad and some other parts of the region for the next 48 hours at least. Different major, medium and minor irrigation projects were filled with collective 86 TMC live storage by Sunday, as against the desired live storage capacity of 260 TMC, show official data. While the reservoirs were showing slightly better live storage (92 TMC) during the corresponding period last year, the existing storage is considered satisfactory by authorities as more rainfall is expected during the remaining portion of the rainy season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwada-region-sees-subdued-but-conducive-monsoon/articleshow/84737453.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||TRS MP Banda Prakash booked for college fund embezzlement||HYDERABAD: A day after Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Lok Sabha MP Malothu Kavitha was convicted for bribing voters, the ruling party suffered another jolt on Sunday, with one more sitting MP being booked by police for ‘cheating and misappropriation’ of funds of Alluri Trust in Hanamkonda, Warangal. Cases were booked against TRS general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Banda Prakash, a resident of Warangal, on charges of misappropriation of Rs 12.22 lakh funds of Alluri Trust, which runs Alluri Institute of Management Science (AIMS) in Hanamkonda. The institute is presently offering MBA and over 200 students are enrolled in the course. The cases were booked under relevant sections of IPC and CrPC against Prakash and two chartered accountants — Attaluri Satyanarayana and Attaluri Vamseedhar — on the directions of the court of VI additional judicial first-class magistrate at Warangal. Though the cases were booked on July 23, the whole issue came to light on Sunday. Police inspector Raghavender said complainant J Bhaskar Reddy has alleged that Prakash, who is the secretary of the Alluri Trust and correspondent of AIMS, was involved in misappropriation of funds in the institution along with the two chartered accountants. In his complaint, Bhaskar said Prakash had filed false income tax returns in collusion with the chartered accountants in 2016-17 and 2017-18 and committed a fraud of Rs 12,21,912, and misappropriated the funds. After Bhaskar approached VI additional judicial first-class magistrate court for justice, the court ordered police to register cases against Prakash and the other two. “We have registered cases under Section 409 (Criminal Breach of Trust), Section 417 (cheating) and Section 120b (a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence). We are investigating the cases, based on which action against the TRS MP and two others would be taken,” inspector Raghavender said. Banda Prakash who is in Delhi to attend the monsoon session of the Parliament, told TOI over phone: “It’s a baseless allegation. The case was filed with ulterior motives. He (complainant Bhaskar) wants a position in the Trust. I have not even received any notice. I was totally unaware that the case was filed in the court. Even the police did not inform me as courtesy, that cases have been booked against me. My lawyer will file a counter soon.” Banda Prakash is also the president of Telangana Mudiraj Sangham and TRS incharge for Mahbubnagar parliamentary constituency. “I am the secretary of the Alluri Trust. The father of the complainant Bhaskar Reddy was a member of the trust. We have genuine reasons to reject the demand of Bhaskar to be on the Trust,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-mp-prakash-booked-for-college-fund-embezzlement/articleshow/84744727.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Hyderabad||Crest jewel in Telangana’s crown||According to local legend, the temple is named after Ramappa, the sculptor who built it and is the only temple in India to be named after a Silpin. An inscription found on a pillar in the temple dates it to the year 1213 AD which records that it was built by Recherla Rudra Reddy of the Kakatiya Emperor Ganapati Deva. Rudreshwara Temple, built as part of the triple T-concept of the Kakatiyas as highlighted by Professor Pandurangarao of the Kakatiya Heritage Trust, is a masterpiece of Kakatiyan architecture with the use of light weight floating bricks for the superstructure (Vimana Sikhara), sand-box foundations and creativity in stone sculpture representing the dance styles of the region. It fulfilled the criteria of the World Heritage Centre to be qualified to be inscribed on the list of World Heritage Monuments. The temple at Palampet is a splendid example of the Kakatiya architecture. An exquisite vimana form, this temple is raised over a high jagati (plinth) and comprises a rangamandapa (the dancing hall), an antarala and a garbhagrha (sanctum sanctorum). The former has triple porches and the garbhagrha is of pancharatha (five bay category) class. In the base the karnika (moulding) and gajathara (frieze of elephants in a row) are employed. The garbhagriha wall in its bhadra (projection on the wall) section has a storeyed vimana (superstructure on the roof) model while the karna (miniature temple), anuratha (supplementary shrine motif with pilasters) and salilantara (recess) sections have vimana panjaras (an architectural motif with a rectangular hall) and kumbhalatas. The tall and slender pilasters lend grace to the walls. The shrine models, mostly of phamsana(storied pyramidal) type are highly abbreviated. The highly projected cave cornice is decorated with intricate patterns of rafters and buds. The four-storied vimana with its schematized and faceted kuta, salas and panjara elements have a distinct character. The square sikhara and sukanasa (parrot snout shaped structure) in front are other members. The rangamandapa exterior has highly ornamented kakshasanas (stone benches on the basement) and the brackets showing alasakanyas (bracket figures of ladies), Salabanjikas (ladies holding creepers and branches of trees) nagini (a lady holding snake), vyala (a mythical animal), among others provide contrast. These are carved as mythical animals or female dancers or musicians, and are the masterpieces of Kakatiya art, notable for their delicate carving, sensuous postures and elongated bodies and heads. The superstructure of the temple is built with bricks, which are so light that they are able to float on water. There are two small Siva shrines on either side of the main temple. No doubt that the Ramappa temple , now a world heritage monument draws huge tourist influx both domestic and international. (The author is an archaeologist , CEO of Pleach India Foundation, Hyd.

---||Hyderabad||Ramappa temple: Kakatiyas built temple to withstand earthquakes||HYDERABAD: Apart from its historical, cultural, religious and architectural significance, Ramappa temple has a special technological feature – sand-box foundation — that has helped the temple stand tall for centuries. Like their successors Qutub Shahis, who mastered the art of seismic-proof structures, the Kakatiyas built Ramappa temple to withstand the onslaughts of earthquakes. Though not unique to Ramappa temple, the sand-box foundation stands testimony to the engineering ingenuity of the former rulers of Telangana.Kakatiyas are credited with the invention of floating bricks (light porous bricks) that bring down the load of the roof on the foundation and columns supporting it. Sand-box foundation is a type of foundation involving digging of the earth at least three metres deep and later filled up with sand. It is reinforced by gravel and other material. Later, huge structures are built on the sand foundation. The sand acts as a cushion or shock-absorber when earthquakes occur. Thus, it prevents vibrations in the main structure and protects it from falling. The state government presented sand-box foundation as a unique technology before the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS). However, the ICOMOS, in its report did not agree with the state government’s contention. “ICOMOS considers that lightweight bricks and sand-box foundations are not unique to Rudreshwara Temple and that the exceptional character of these in terms of their characteristics or state of conservation has not been supported by a comprehensive comparative analysis,” the ICOMOS report said. The state government now needs to take up conservation of the monument so that the foundation is not affected by heavy rains. The ICOMOS report, however, said the temple cannot be said to be as inventive or as complex as its Kalyana Chalukya predecessors for which the staggered, five-projection, four-storey composition was essentially standard by the end of the 11th century CE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kakatiyas-built-temple-to-withstand-quakes/articleshow/84743950.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||Ramappa temple’s first renovation effort was taken up in 1914||HYDERABAD: It was the Hyderabad state archaeology department, under the supervision of eminent archaeologist-conservationist Ghulam Yazdani, that first took up renovation of the historic Ramappa temple in 1914. Yazdani, who conserved the Ajanta and Ellora cave paintings for posterity, renovated the dilapidated Ramappa temple and it is his conservation efforts that have now fetched the world heritage tag to the Kakatiyan temple of the 13th century. Yazdani was one of the founders of the archaeology department in the erstwhile Nizam state. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) in its report to the online extended 44th session of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO, which is currently on at Fuzhou in China, specifically makes a reference to the conservation of the temple complex by the Nizam government to state that the condition of the temple is now in a satisfactory state. “The main temple of the complex, the Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple, is considered to be in a satisfactory state of conservation and has been frequently conserved and maintained since 1914 by the ASI (Hyderabad archaeology department of the Nizam) and with the guidance of the Kakatiya Heritage Trust. Prior to these conservation initiatives the temple was overgrown with vegetation and damaged by growing roots, which were removed,” it said. The temple never collapsed even though local differential settlement caused misalignments to some elements. During the first large conservation campaign in 1931 by the Nizam government, decorations and ornaments that had fallen off but were traceable were reattached in their original positions. “ICOMOS considers that the contemporary state of conservation is a product of continuous conservation activities since the early 20th century, during which all elements of the temple complex, apart from the Kameshwara Temple, have been conserved to different degrees,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ramappa-was-first-renovated-in-1914/articleshow/84744142.cms||Syed Akbar

In spite of the pandemic and lockdowns, the number of startups being recognised by DPIIT and the jobs they generated showed an increase compared to the previous years.Startup India initiative was launched by the Centre in 2016 aiming to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and startups that would result in employment generation and sustained economic growth. The minister said that ‘Fund of Funds for Startups’ (FFS) was established by DPIIT in 2016 with a corpus of Rs 10,000 crore to give a boost to the startup ecosystem.Besides financial assistance, DPIIT recognised startups are provided benefits like income tax exemption for three years, self-certification of of compliance of labour and environmental laws and fast tracking of patent applications. The minister also said that DPIIT has created Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) with an outlay of Rs 945 crore to provide financial assistance to startups for prototype development, product trials, market entry and commercialization. This would enable startups to graduate to a level where they will be able to raise investments from angel investors or venture capitalists or seek loans from commercial banks or financial institutions, he said. “The scheme will support an estimated 3,600 entrepreneurs through 300 incubators in the next 4 years,” he said.The Tamil Nadu government, on its part, has been providing support to startups through Tamil Nadu Startup and Innovation Mission (TANSIM). In a latest initiative, the state government has decided to accord preference during government procurement to startups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/startups-provided-jobs-to-26327-people-in-tn-in-last-three-years/articleshow/84741796.cms||---

They have been quarantined at the state's Prem Nagar ashram facility.Two locals caught selling items to kanwarias have also been booked. Circle officer (CO) city Abhay Singh told TOI, “Kanwar yatra has been suspended this year by the government because of the pandemic. Police have been deployed at various borders, including Chidiyapur and Narsan, to stop kanwarias. However, some managed to sneak in, dressed as regular pilgrims and reached Har ki Pauri to collect Ganga water. We have detained and booked them under section 188 of the IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and relevant sections of the Disaster Management act. All 14 belong to Sonipat district.” The month of ‘Shravan’ started on Saturday, and would have marked the beginning of kanwar yatra, which has been called off by the Uttarakhand for the second year to prevent a Covid-19 outbreak. Neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, which initially planned to hold the yatra on a limited scale, also cancelled it after the Supreme Court intervention. The Har-Ki-Pauri ghat in Haridwar, from where the kanwarias collect holy water every year, has been "sealed for the pilgrims" with barricades to remain till August 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/14-kanwarias-from-sonipat-sneak-into-har-ki-pauri-detained-quarantined/articleshow/84739550.cms||MS Nawaz

The minister went on to describe the temple as an architectural marvel. “The Ramappa Temple is a testament to the sculptural, artistic, and technical prowess of the Kakatiyas,” Goud said and added that the temple should have got recognition long back. “Many miracles that did not happen in united Andhra Pradesh are happening now. Telangana is going to become a wonderful tourist destination soon,” Goud said and added that Telangana’s history and culture were neglected in erstwhile AP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unesco-tag-will-help-attract-tourism-min/articleshow/84743972.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

A consumer court in Surat recently told the jeweller to return an amount of Rs 20,000 along with 7% interest to complainant Darshana Patel as currency notes were banned by the central government. It also ordered Rs 5,000 to be paid to her as compensation. Upholding Patel’s arguments that she could not pay the remaining amount of Rs 1.37 lakh due to the government policy, the court stated that demonetization was a policy decision taken by the government over which Patel had no control and that she be returned her advance amount. Patel stated that she had placed an order for gold jewellery weighing 45 grams on October 27 in 2016. She had then paid Rs 20,000 in advance, promising to pay the remaining amount at the time of delivery after Diwali. However, soon after Diwali on November 8, demonetization was announced, said Patel, making her unable to take delivery of the ornaments as she had run out of liquid cash and asked the jeweller to return the money which she had paid in advance. But, the jeweller refused to return the money. Patel then approached the consumer forum seeking help in getting her money back along with compensation. During the hearing of the case, the jewellery showroom argued that Patel wanted to make the remaining payment through demonetized notes to convert her black money into white. But as they were strictly following the government’s guidelines, they refused the banned notes and instead suffered making charges of Rs 29,250 on her behalf. Jeweller further stated that Patel was even asked to make the remaining payment through cheque or demand draft, which she did not. Patel, however, refused the allegations in an affidavit. The court too did not accept the arguments as the showroom did not have any evidence to support their claims that they suffered making charges. It held that the showroom is responsible for returning the advance payment and it illegally held back the money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/jeweller-ordered-to-refund-rs-20000-advance-woman-paid-four-years-ago/articleshow/84739595.cms||Jay Pachchigar

With old patrons staying away due to restricted timings, and many not renewing their memberships, those in the fitness industry are in dire straits. Many are considering selling off their gyms in desperation. Nilesh Kale, president, Pune Fitness Club Association, told TOI that the situation has become very difficult for those involved in the fitness business. “I am desperately trying to sell my gym. There were around 3,500 gyms in both the corporation areas and around 1,000 of them had permanently shut down after the lockdown since last year. Close to another 1,000 are on the verge of shut down,” Kale said. After the second wave, permission was given to the gyms and fitness clubs to reopen from June 10, with caveats such as prior appointment before coming, vaccination and closure at 4pm. “The restricted timings have become a bane for us, and we are hardly able to get new patrons. Most gyms have announced lucrative discounts and are offering admissions on half or even less than the stipulated fee, but in vain. Most people are working from home and they want flexible timings. The morning time is not suitable for most of our patrons and gyms are closed in the evening. Most gyms function from rented spaces and with little or no income, paying the rent as well as staff salaries have become an impossible task for many of us,” Kale added. “We had six branches in Pune and presently while five of them are closed, the last one is temporarily shut for two months. We have had hardly any patrons since one-and-a- half years,” said Madhukar Talwalkar of Talwalkars. The owner of a Kondhwa-based gym said, “The patrons who are coming are mainly old members who had paid their membership fees in early 2020 before the pandemic but couldn’t use the facility as gyms were closed. Moreover, around 60% of our old patrons are not turning up. They have bought some basic equipment like treadmills, cross trainers and weights and are using them at home,” he said. “Sales of small equipment is booming. People are buying weights, iron rods, curl rods, dumbbells for muscles,” a representative of Arun Sports in Shivajinagar said. In fact, with gyms shut, many have taken to cycling. “Each month, we sell around 30 to 40 cycles. The sales increased right after the first lockdown and have remained the same almost,” an official of Bikes and Bikes, Pimple Gurav, said. “The demand of high-end bikes has also increased,” Bakshish Singh Talwar, owner, Surender Cycle Store, Karve Road Suraj Joshi, a working professional and a fitness enthusiast, said he does not find the timing of the gym suitable. “I have to attend the morning meeting from 9am till 10:30am after which I have to catch up on work. Before the pandemic, I used to be back from work by 5pm and then hit the gym for an hour. Now, it is not possible due to restricted timings. So, I bought an exercise bicycle and a few weights at home and take the help of YouTube to follow the instructions and diet,” Joshi said. Kale said that they would approach deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar for relief. “The state government must help us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1000-gyms-in-pune-and-pimpri-chinchwad-on-verge-of-shutdown/articleshow/84741812.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Hyderabad||Ramappa temple: Heritage tag done, conservation plan next||Now that Ramappa temple is a world heritage site, the state government needs to fulfil its commitments on a comprehensive conservation and management project by December-end to protect the historic temple. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), a UNESCO body that oversees world heritage tags, has in its report, presented to the online extended 44th session of World Heritage Committee, recommended that Telangana should complete by December 2021 the revised comprehensive conservation and management plan committed by it. Telangana should also establish a clear timeframe and methodology for the completion of the conservation of Ramappa temple. “ICOMOS considers that the integrated management plan, announced for December 2021, should be finalized and integrate a programmed conservation plan for the property (Ramappa) in its wider context and geographical extension as well as dedicated sections for risk preparedness and disaster response and visitor management,” the report said. Several of the smaller Kakatiya temples, located in the buffer zone, seem at risk of collapsing, the ICOMOS report said adding that the state of conservation of the important elements not currently included in the boundaries have also not been considered. ICOMOS recommended that during further documentation regarding the boundary extension, these and other essential elements in the enlarged property should be included in the revised conservation plan. “(Ramappa temple) is also affected by inappropriate visitor behaviour (including vandalism and theft) and seasonal festive overcrowding. In the integrated conservation and management plan submitted in February 2020, the State Party (Telangana) describes in more detail the festivals which occur in Rudreshwara Temple as well as its strategies for management of visitor flows. Both these aspects need to be further monitored and results as well as future strategies need to be considered,” the report said. The UNESCO body has also called upon Telangana to get a risk preparedness plan for all potential natural and anthropogenic disasters and risks which might occur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/submit-master-plan-on-ramappa-protection-by-december-end-icomos/articleshow/84743932.cms||Syed Akbar

In 2019, the priest had reported to the officials about Vastu flaws in the centuries-old temple. Shankar said that devotees and tourists were entering the temple from the western gate when they are supposed to enter from the eastern side. “Devotees used to walk from behind the Sivalinga in sanctum sanctorum even though the entry should be from the east as per the shastra. For past five decades, people have been walking in from the western gate. Soma Sutra Pradakshinam is a way of Sivalinga. People were crossing Soma Sutra from behind while entering the temple. This was rectified a year ago,” he said. “International recognition has come now as vastu dosha has been rectified. Most of the people now walk from 80 feet road connecting the main road to the temple,” the priest said, adding that the main deity in the temple is Lord Shiva in the form of Rudreswara also known as Ramalingeswar Swamy. “There are other deities like Mahisasura Mardhini (Durga), Ganapati and Nandi. Most of the sculptures are damaged,” Shankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vastu-rectification-helped-earn-heritage-tag/articleshow/84744112.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Bodel helped him get some work in his ceramic unit. “Manoj lived adjacent to Bodel and his family and would often play with their daughter. On July 18, the accused took the child with him but did not return home till late in the night, following which Asha lodged a complaint of kidnapping with the Morbi police. “Police teams’ search in various towns of Saurashtra and GIDCs went in vain.

The college’s 12-member anti-ragging committee on Sunday held a meeting based on a formal complaint received from second-year students of MBBS who were made to do 100 sit-ups by their seniors.  According to the complaint, around 60 second-year students were woken up at around 4am on Saturday morning by their seniors, made to stand in a line and asked to do sit-ups.  The first-ever ragging incident has rocked the medical college as one of the second-year student had started vomiting, collapsed and had to be rushed to casualty ward for treatment.  “The student who has undergone check-up at orthopaedic department is stable. All his reports are normal. But he was already taking psychiatric treatment and the incident has left him traumatised,” said college dean Dr Varsha Godbole.  “We have terminated two junior residents who were with the orthopaedic and surgery departments. The third one who is said to have accompanied the duo is a former student but not working with us in any capacity. We will be approaching the police on Monday and will take a collective decision regarding him as well,” she said.  Godbole confirmed that a couple of third-year students who have also been named by second year students will also face action after a proper probe.  On Sunday, the third-year students claimed before the panel that they were pressured by the trio including two junior residents and their friend to rag the second-year students as they were not showing “respect” to their seniors.  But the panel has also received statements from some second year students who said that the seniors were liberal with those who could not do sit-ups.  “We have given assurance to all the students that we will take strict action against all found guilty so that such incident does not get repeated at our college,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-junior-resident-doctors-terminated-for-ragging/articleshow/84739560.cms||---

No one can control AIADMK,” he said.“DMK came to power by giving false promises. DMK struggled a lot, but AIADMK functionaries worked hard and snatched victory.

Business owners had been looking forward to extension of timings and the Federation of Trade Association Pune had written letters to the state authorities requesting the same ever since the 4pm deadline was imposed. Rakesh Choudhary, a grocery shopowner from Undri, said, “There is shortage of vegetables. Supply for other items has also been stalled because of transportation issues because of heavy rain and flooding. On one hand, the decision to keep the shop open till 7pm would be welcome, on the other, we have to deal with the shortage of stock.” Lokesh Pandey, who runs a grocery store in Wagholi, said, “Apart from vegetables, there is shortage in supply of packaged snacks, biscuits, sauces, spreads and other items.” Sachin Nivangune, president of Pune District Retailers Association, said, “We will be happy if the permission to remain open till 7pm is granted. The current timing till 4pm did not do us any good, as not many customers visited from 2pm to 4pm. Customers can take advantage of the extention and visit non-essential shops in the evenings.” He added that non-essential shops were facing shortage in supply as well. “Supply from Konkan and Vidarbha areas is stagnated. But, the extension in the deadline will enable shopkeepers to earn enough to pay the bills and salaries and keep afloat, even if it is not possible to make profits right away,” he said. The shortage of vegetables was a major concern for restaurants as they seeked an extension of the deadline. Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association, said, “We have not received any intimation yet. We will get the information for relaxations from the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations on Monday. We are looking forward to extension of timings for restaurants till 10.30pm. There has been shortage of raw materials since last week because of heavy rains. There has been no supply from Kolhapur and Sangli for the last four days. Due to the shortage, the cost of vegetables has gone up by 20%. But, we have taken this into consideration and will not transfer the rise in raw materials on to our customers by accepting lower profit margins for now.” Vaibhav Paliwal, the owner of Nukkad Cafe in Vimannagar, said, “Cafes and eateries like ours do not use vegetables at a large volume, so we can reach out to local suppliers who have stock. But, we have to take into account the increase in the rates because of the present shortage. We generally use tomatoes, onions and capsicum, the prices of which have doubled. We cannot transfer this to our customers, so we burn our own pocket. If prices continue to increase, we will make changes to the menu accordingly and cancel the items that require raw materials that are too expensive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biz-owners-look-forward-to-relaxations-supply-shortage-a-concern/articleshow/84741840.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Hundreds of government job aspirants would be relieved by the decision as they throng the main building premises every day to prepare for competitive examinations. A large number of residents, who visit the main building for various reasons, would also be relieved as they can park their vehicles for free. J Ravishankar, a job aspirant, said that the corporation main building campus is a favorite spot for them as it is surrounded by trees, providing a cool ambiance. A large number of aspirants gather there to share knowledge. “Suspension of parking fee would encourage more people to visit the place. Earlier, we used to pay for parking. Many would park their vehicles at some other places and walk to the premises,” he said. Residents have welcomed the decision not to collect parking fees at Eco Park. Mohammed Rafi, a resident of Bibikulam, said that it was odd to collect parking fees from people who park vehicles on the roadsides. “The corporation also stopped collecting parking fees at Thamukkam Road in front of the children’s park from last year onwards. Now parking has been banned there. Earlier, it would create bottle neck during busy times,” he said. Similarly, the corporation has removed the Mahal Road and Roadside in front of the Pandikovil from the parking list. The authorities of Thirumalai Nayak Mahal have not given permission for using the space for parking. Pandikovil parking was causing hindrance to vehicular movement, an official from revenue section, said. The civic body will not lease out the place next to the Thiruparankundram market for parking, he said. The corporation is in the process of leasing out various facilities and space available in the city for the financial year. The processes are expected to be completed in a few days, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-parking-fee-in-select-city-locations-says-madurai-corpn/articleshow/84739566.cms||---

The two Telugu states together have 3.1% of the population using sedatives. While AP has 1.79% for a total of 6.74 lakh sedative users, Telangana has 1.31% (3.48 lakh) such addicts. The mammoth survey, done on 18-75 years age group, found that about 1.21% of India’s population was addicted to sedatives. Punjab has the highest percentage of population addicted to sedatives at 4.61%, followed by Haryana at 3.05% and Delhi at 3.19%. Among southern states, the use was less than Telangana and AP with Tamil Nadu at 0.32%, Karnataka at 0.51% and Kerala 0.53%. While sedatives are mostly used for medical purposes, sleeping tablets can become an addiction, say doctors. “In psychiatric problems, mostly sedatives are given to calm the patients. Some might indulge in using sleep sedatives excessively, while those in medical field also use other medical sedatives. Availability of some of these sedatives are made difficult due to there misuse,” Dr Kiran Madala, head of department of anaesthesia, government general hospital (GGH), Nizamabad, told TOI. Excessive usage of sedative leads to liver and kidney damage in some people, he warned. Experts also warn of drug addiction disturbing family and personal life. “Most people turn to different types of drug consumption for anxiety and stress for different reasons. If this problem is taken care of either by counselling or proper medical help, anyone can come out of it,” Dr C Veerender, a psychologist, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/t-ap-high-on-sedative-abuse-in-south/articleshow/84747008.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

From 30 feet on Friday, the water level rose to 33 feet on Saturday and continued to rise on Sunday too.Though there was no rain in the city, there were sporadic showers in the catchment areas of the Western Ghats, which is expected to intensify in the coming days resulting in a further rise in water levels.Aliyar dam in Pollachi registered a sharp rise of 14 feet in a week and touched the 100 feet level.Over the past week, the dam received a high inflow accounting for about 2,000 cusecs which rose to 3,000 cusecs since Saturday.Aliyar dam is the most important reservoir in Parambikulam–Aliyar Project which not only supplies water for drinking but also irrigation.As water inflow into the Sholayar dam in Valparai shoots up, surplus water was being released to Kerala.The dam touched its full reservoir level of 160ft on Friday last week. However, showers continued in the catchments areas and inflow kept rising steadily. Subsequently, 1,800 cusecs of water were being released to Kerala from Sholayar’s main dam while 5,600 cusecs were released from Sholayar saddle dam.Constant rain in Munnar, Marayur and Gandhalur areas in Kerala has resulted in a spike in the water flow to Amaravathy dam near Udumalpet in Tirupur district.The dam has almost neared its full reservoir level of 90 feet forcing the officials to release 3,000 cusecs of water in the Amaravathy river.The inflow however continues to be higher than the outflow at 3,894 cusecs. As the dam was brimming, scores of tourists thronged the dam on Sunday.The officials are also keeping a constant watch on the inflow into the reservoirs and are planning to enhance the outflow accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/heavy-showers-fill-up-reservoirs/articleshow/84741820.cms||---

The two Telugu states together have 3.1% of the population using sedatives. While AP has 1.79% for a total of 6.74 lakh sedative users, Telangana has 1.31% (3.48 lakh) such addicts. The mammoth survey, done on 18-75 years age group, found that about 1.21% of India’s population was addicted to sedatives. Punjab has the highest percentage of population addicted to sedatives at 4.61%, followed by Haryana at 3.05% and Delhi at 3.19%. Among southern states, the use was less than Telangana and AP with Tamil Nadu at 0.32%, Karnataka at 0.51% and Kerala 0.53%. While sedatives are mostly used for medical purposes, sleeping tablets can become an addiction, say doctors. “In psychiatric problems, mostly sedatives are given to calm the patients. Some might indulge in using sleep sedatives excessively, while those in medical field also use other medical sedatives. Availability of some of these sedatives are made difficult due to there misuse,” Dr Kiran Madala, head of department of anaesthesia, government general hospital (GGH), Nizamabad, told TOI. Excessive usage of sedative leads to liver and kidney damage in some people, he warned. Experts also warn of drug addiction disturbing family and personal life. “Most people turn to different types of drug consumption for anxiety and stress for different reasons. If this problem is taken care of either by counselling or proper medical help, anyone can come out of it,” Dr C Veerender, a psychologist, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ap-high-on-sedative-abuse-in-south/articleshow/84744749.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Similar talks are slated for weavers in Tirupur on July 29. Weavers hope to reach an agreement for better wage hike during the talks to be held by the labour department officials.The job working powerloom weavers take orders from master weavers and deliver to the requirements of the latter. The job working weavers had submitted a petition to district administrations several times and did so once again last week.The weavers said that the wages were revised for them last time in 2014. Though the job working weavers and master weavers revise the agreements every three years, the wages were not revised since 2014. On the contrary, the wages were reduced over time citing various issues including the pandemic situation. Meanwhile, the input costs and maintenance expenditure have risen manifold during the intervening period.President of Coimbatore and Tirupur Job Working Powerloom Owner Association C Palaniswamy said that they have sought for a 60% hike from the wages fixed in 2014.The talks are set to be held at the labour department office in Coimbatore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wage-revision-talks-for-weavers-today/articleshow/84741802.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune Metropolitan Region reports steep drop in post-Covid mucormycosis cases||PUNE: From 42 new cases the week before to just 16 last week (July 15-July 21), the detection rate of mucormycosis among Covid-recovered patients has seen a sharp drop across the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). The 16 new cases takes the total number of Covid-associated mucormycosis (CAM) cases to 1,271 over the last three-and-a-half months. Experts said cases have been steadily dropping since the start of July. "The fall in fresh cases of post-Covid mucormycosis is certainly heartening. Ample stock of key drugs such as amphotericin B is also helping patients recover faster," said district health officer Bhagwan Pawar. In May, PMR had recorded 421 CAM cases. In June, it had 426. In July so far, only 69 people have been diagnosed with the invasive fungal infection, which mainly affects the sinuses. Of the total 1,271 patients, 789 have recovered. Currently, 299 patients are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the PMR. Although fresh cases have gone down drastically, disease recurrence is an emerging concern. "Patients needing revision surgeries are coming up in sizeable numbers as quite a few of them (20%) are confronting disease recurrence days or months after recovery," said Sassoon hospital's ENT surgeon Samir Joshi. What is more worrisome is the fact that a substantial number of these patients need repeat surgical clearance (debridement) even in areas like frontal sinuses, where recurrences should not happen. This indicates incomplete clearance of the damaged tissue during the first surgery, experts said. The use of drug therapy, including amphotericin B injections, is also key to preventing recurrence. "To prevent a recurrence, disease control has to be properly achieved before changing amphotericin B to step-down therapy with oral posaconazole. Apart from incomplete debridement, breakthrough mucor can occur if optimal drug levels in the blood are not achieved," said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the national Covid task force. Posaconazole levels should be achieved in the blood and should be measured three to five days after initiating treatment, Pujari advised. A total of 172 of 1,271 patients have succumbed to CAM-associated complications in the district so far, accounting for a 14% mortality rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmr-reports-steep-drop-in-post-covid-mucor-cases/articleshow/84741872.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The objective is to check whether herd immunity has developed among the city residents. NMC has plans to conduct sero survey of around 4,500 to 5,000 residents randomly. NMC officials said a private firm has agreed to provide the funds to conduct the survey under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), but they are yet to get its consent in writing. “The sero survey is estimated to cost Rs 15 lakh and a private firm is ready to provide funds under the CSR. After the official formalities, the private firm is expected to provide funds for the survey by this week,” said NMC officials. “We have plans to conduct the survey from the first week of August. We have already formed teams to conduct the survey. The same teams had conducted the sero survey in January this year,” said NMC officials adding that it will take around five days to complete the survey. In January, NMC had conducted the sero survey with technical support and guidance from the Government Medical College & Hospital (GMCH), Aurangabad. Blood samples of 2,355 city residents above the age of 18 years were taken during the survey. As per the findings of the survey, antibodies were found among 39.5% of the population. The experts have already projected the third wave of Covid in the coming few months. The reports of the proposed fresh sero survey will help NMC to make plans for the third wave. The NMC has already started planning to create medical infrastructure to provide better treatment to the people during the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-conduct-sero-survey-in-first-week-of-august/articleshow/84739576.cms||Tushar Pawar

The full or partial closure of roads towards the Konkan region and Kolhapur alone has resulted in over 13,000 Pune transport vehicles getting stuck at various places. Baba Shinde, the president of the Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pritinidhi Sanghatna, told TOI that the vehicles were mainly stranded near toll plazas and highway eateries. “In over 13,000 trucks from Kolhapur and some regions in Konkan, large consignments of milk, grocery items and sugar reach Pune each day. And a similar number of trucks from Pune ply to Kolhapur, the Konkan region and beyond. Truck transportation to these areas has come to a grinding halt since three days now,” he said. MSRTC officials had on Friday said bus traffic from areas like Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur to Konkan had been stopped. “When it comes to Pune, no buses are plying to and from Konkan even now. For Kolhapur, buses are plying only till Karad,” an official with the Pune division of the MSRTC said. When it comes to the railway connectivity, around 13 trains like the Deccan Express, which were suspended for four to five days due to the heavy rainfall, have resumed their services, a rail official said. “The intensity of rainfall in and around Pune has reduced since Saturday. Hence, the train services have been restored. However, Indrayani Express remains suspended as some work on the Lonavla ghat section is still being done. Having said that, Deccan Queen and Deccan Express have resumed their services,” the official said. Some of the other trains like the Dadar-Sawantwadi special, CSMT-Mangaluru special, CSMT-Madgaon special, CSMT-Kolhapur special have also resumed their services. A rail official said up line in the Bhor ghat section, which runs from Lonavla to Karjat, was expected to be restored fully by Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-26k-goods-trucks-stuck-on-highways/articleshow/84741550.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolhapur||Pune-Bengaluru highway stretch shut, review on Monday||Kolhapur: The Pune-Bengaluru National Highway remained shut for vehicular movement on even Sunday as the water receded slowly along the stretch between Sangli phata and Tawde hotel in the Kolhapur area. Thousands of trucks and private vehicles have been stranded here since Friday evening. The authorities will review the highway's condition on Monday morning and then take a call on opening it for vehicular traffic. On Sunday, two reviews were done to check the feasibility of reopening the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway for trucks carrying essential supplies. In the evening, Shailesh Balkawade, the Kolhapur superintendent of police, said: “We had to check the depth of the floodwater on the highway. We sent a Pokland, an earth-moving vehicle, to see if the vehicle could pass through the flooded stretch. The attempts were made at 1 pm and again at 6.30 pm on Sunday. Both attempts were unsuccessful as the vehicle couldn’t move ahead due to the heavy flow of water. We will review again on Monday morning. The floodwater on the National Highway near the Kini toll plaza has receded. Therefore, the Shiroli to Pune route has been reopened for traffic movement. The Kolhapur stretch, however, is still inundated.” Samadhan Patil, deputy engineer, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation Limited, said “This time, the level of the floodwater and the strength of the water currents are more than in 2019. Soon, when we carry out the six-laning work of the national highway, we will consider this flooded section and construct the road accordingly. The bearings of the bridge above the Panchaganga river at Shiroli was under water. Traffic movement on the highway can be restarted only after a visual inspection of the bearings and the pavement.” Dairy supply affected With the highway stretch still inundated, milk supply was adversely affected in the region. Gokul Dairy’s chairman Vishwas Patil said, “Gokul’s daily collection is normally 13 lakh litre. However, only 8 lakh litre was collected. The daily collection has come down by 5 lakh litre. The supply to Mumbai and Pune has been affected by 50%. Milk from Baramati and other rural areas is now being collected by Gokul.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pune-bengaluru-highway-stretch-shut-review-on-monday/articleshow/84737580.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Delhi Metro: Grey Line to stretch further, missing link of Pink Line all set to open this week||NEW DELHI: This week is likely to see the opening of two important stretches of Delhi Metro — the extension of Grey Line (Dwarka-Najafgarh) to Dhansa Bus Stand and the opening of the “missing link” between Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 stations of Pink Line (Majlis Park). “The approximately 1km-long Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand corridor is ready for operations after receiving the mandatory approval from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety. The exact date of opening shall be intimated shortly,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communication), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. With the opening of this extension, Delhi Metro network would become 390km long with 286 stations. The Dwarka-Najafgarh section of the 5.4km-long Grey Line opened in 2019 with three stations — Dwarka, Nangli and Najafgarh. Only the 1.2km-long extension to Dhansa Bus Stand remained to be opened. The “missing link” at Trilokpuri on Pink Line, Delhi Metro’s longest corridor, which led to the line functioning as two separate corridors, is likely to open to the public this week. Two and a half years after the line first opened, DMRC managed to bridge the gap between Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 stations last month. The 58.6km-long Pink Line is one of the most ambitious corridors built by DMRC and also called the “Ring Corridor” as it functions as an arc, connecting all the existing corridors. However, unavailability of land at Trilokpuri had meant that DMRC couldn’t construct the crucial stretch. As a result, while one section of the corridor operated from Majlis Park to Mayur Vihar Pocket-1, with trains reversing from there, trains coming from Shiv Vihar returned from Trilokpuri. Once operational, this section would connect the two ends of Pink Line and provide seamless connectivity to various localities and connect important transport hubs, such as Nizamuddin Railway Station, Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, Anand Vihar ISBT and railway station, Delhi Cantonment Station, and prominent markets like Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and INA. Dayal said that Dhansa Bus Stand station had been adorned with attractive artworks and photographs, displaying the rich heritage, culture, flora and fauna of the suburban locality. “The Najafgarh-Dhansa region of southwest Delhi has deep cultural roots. It is rich in historical content and also home to a marshy ecosystem that encourages the visit of migratory birds and flourishing of local wildlife. The artworks and photographic displays have tried to capture these unique characteristics of this area,” said Dayal, adding that photographs on printed glass panels at the station also showcase the rich biodiversity, which is themed “Migratory Birds”. A hand-painted artwork shows residents coming together to honour the essence of their values and it is themed “Fringes of rural-urban progression”. “Agriculture and animal husbandry are the main sources of income for the locals, but real estate projects and event venues contribute significantly to economic progression. The colour palette of the station has been kept earthy and bold to show the amalgamation of rural and urban values,” Dayal said. He added that the station’s decoration had been done in line with DMRC’s efforts to utilise its premises “as a platform to showcase the rich heritage and culture of the nation”. A number of other stations on the DMRC network have also been decorated with eye-catching artworks and displays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/grey-line-to-stretch-further-missing-link-of-pink-line-all-set-to-open-this-week/articleshow/84739589.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Earlier, rapid-antigen tests were conducted at 15 centres only. According to an NMC official, it is a part of measures to curb spread of Covid infection. Earlier, the NMC had opened only 35 vaccination centres across the city till June 30 and rapid antigen tests were conducted at 15 centres with the help of an NGO .  But after the demand from corporators and city residents, mayor Satish Kulkarni directed the civic administration to open at least four vaccination centres in each of 31 wards of Nashik. Accordingly, the NMC administration increased the number of vaccination centres from 35 to 123 centres during the last 25 days. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, NMC medical superintendent, said, “With rise in number of vaccination centres in the city, we have also increased the antigen tests of the beneficiaries.

The minister promised to do the best for them in future during the ceremony.Subburam, a resident, said that the water level in their areas including Parasurampatti, Surveyor Colony, Pandi Nagar, Senthilkumar Nagar, Santhi Nagar and GR Nagar, had gone below 700 feet four years ago. The groundwater level, which had been less than 50 feet, had attracted many residents to this area 20 years ago.However, due to the lack of maintenance of its supply channels and encroachments, the Parasurampatti tank, which had been their main water source, became dry. “The bore wells also ran dry and people started moving out to places where there was water availability in the city,” said K Thangaraj, another resident.“It was our MLA, who strived to rejuvenate this tank, in the past four years and even obtained funds for the work under the Kudimaramathu scheme of the former government. Following this, the tank was desilted at cost of Rs 34 lakh,” said K Karuppasamy, president of the Parasurampatti Tank water users’ association.Moorthy also created a park around the tank to ensure that it was not encroached again, and street lights were erected in the area, which help the residents take their evening walks here, residents added.“This area has become one of the well-maintained areas with a park and ample ground water as the bore wells now have water at a depth of 30 feet, so many people like me, who had rented their houses in the area, have started returning,” said Kameswari, who had moved out of Surveyor Colony six years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-east-block-residents-felicitate-their-mla-p-moorthy/articleshow/84739582.cms||---
---||Delhi||Grounded: Crooks who offered airline jobs||NEW DELHI: Two college dropouts and 10 others have been arrested for running a fake call centre and duping people on the pretext of giving them jobs in leading airlines. They used to pose as human resource department personnel of the airlines and call aspirants for conducting fake interviews after collecting their details from job portals. The prime accused have been identified as Surjeet (24) from Firozabad and Sundaram Gupta (25) from Ghaziabad. “Sixteen mobile phones, SIM cards, a laptop, six desktop computers, routers, ATM cards and Rs 26,000 in cash has been seized from them,” said DCP (East) Priyanka Kashyap. The cyber cell of East district started tracking the suspects after receiving a complaint from IndiGo alleging that some people were cheating job-seekers in the name of providing employment at various airports. The cheaters had also forged appointment letters and other documents of the airline. “An FIR was registered and a team led by ACP Ved Prakash and inspector Manish Kumar started investigation. The information provided by the airline was processed and the local intelligence network was also activated,” said the DCP. The fake call centre was located through technical surveillance and a raid was conducted on the third floor of a building in Ghazipur. Surjeet and Sundaram, along with 10 employees, including 8 women, were subsequently nabbed. “Probe confirmed that the accused cheated a number of people on the pretext of getting them a job in IndiGo. They used to mainly target people from south India, Bihar, UP and Uttarakhand,” said Kashyap. The fraudsters are suspected to have cheated over 500 people of over Rs 10 lakh. The duo told police that they hired the employees on a monthly salary ranging from Rs 6,000 to Rs 9,000. These young girls and boys would make calls to jobseekers and lure them in their trap. The accused even posted ads on job portals inviting applications from jobseekers for different airlines. The victims applied on the portal by giving their contact number, email ID, address, etc following which they were contacted. The targets were lured into paying “processing fees” ranging from Rs 1,500 to Rs 30,000, depending upon their financial condition and job profile sought by them. They were then issued fake interview and appointment letters. Policemen have taken the accused on remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/grounded-crooks-who-offered-airline-jobs/articleshow/84739600.cms||---

Medical teams have started distributing doxycycline to prevent leptospirosis among those who have waded through muddy waters. At Chiplun, which is Ratnagiri’s worst-affected city, over 25,000 tablets of doxycycline and a similar number of paracetamols have been dispatched. A similar exercise has been started in districts of Raigad, where several villages continue to be inundated. “People are willing to take doxycycline and have even been asking for it,” said Ratnagiri civil surgeon Dr Sanghmitra Phule.  In villages of Raigad, the distribution of doxycycline started from Saturday. “The next seven to eight days will be crucial and we will keep distributing the medicine to whoever has symptoms such as fever,” said Dr Sudhakar More, district health officer of Raigad. Minister for public health Rajesh Tope also held an online meeting on Sunday with health officials of flood and landslide affected districts and asked them to chlorinate all wells once flood water recedes and to organise health camps in flood-affected residential colonies.

The division received the fresh stock for all five districts, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Nandurbar. Out of the 58,000 doses of Covishield, Nashik district received the maximum 24,000 doses followed by Ahmednagar (14,000) Jalgaon (9,000), Dhule (7,000) and Nandubar (4,000). Meanwhile, at 14,720 Ahmednagar district received the maximum doses of Covaxin followed by Nashik (11,840), Dhule (8,800), Jalgaon (5,760) and Nandurbar (3,840). Across the division, so far, 46.38 lakh people have been vaccinated against Covid with single or both the doses. In Nashik district 15.63 lakh beneficiaries have been vaccinated, while in Ahmednagar the number stands at 11.28 lakh. The process of vaccination is being carried out by private as well as the public sector hospitals. But on one hand there is shortage of vaccines in the public sector hospitals, while on the other doses are available with private hospitals where the beneficiaries are charged for the same. Also, vaccines are still lying unused in several parts of the division, especially in the tribal-dominated areas.

As many as 37 people in the district have lost their lives and seven are still missing. The search operations are continuing. The Krishna river level rose to 54.6 feet at 2pm on Sunday before it receding slightly. By 6pm, it was flowing 54.5 feet — still above the danger level of 45 feet — at Irwin bridge in Sangli. Currently, the Krishna level is rising at the rate of 1 inch per hour, the authorities said. Rescue operations in the flood-affected villages of Sangli district and in Sangli city too are continuing. “The number of deaths following the heavy rainfall and landslide incidents reported from Wai, Mahabaleshwar and Patan areas in Satara district over the past four days has risen to 37. Of them, 26 were killed in landslides, one died due to a house collapse, two others died after debris fell on them. Eight people have been swept away in floodwaters. Five people in Patan and two in Wai are still missing and the NDRF teams are carrying out the search operations,” Satara collector Shekhar Singh said. “The rainfall intensity in the district has reduced significantly over the past 36 hours, but the heavy inflow of water from the catchment areas of various dams, besides small tributaries and canals, has ensured that the Krishna water level remained above the danger mark. We expect the situation to stabilize soon. People in areas where the water level is still increasing should immediately evacuate” said, Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary. The Koyna dam, one of the biggest irrigation projects on the Krishna river in Satara district, was 84% full and water was being discharged at the rate of 30,864 cusec. The inflow from the river’s catchment areas upstream was 65,106 cusec at 7pm on Sunday. Waters discharged from the Koyna dam in Satara and from the Panchaganga in Kolhapur meet at a confluence point at Nrusinhawadi in Sangli, from where the water flows downstream to neighbouring Karnataka. The authorities said the discharge from the Almatti dam in Karnataka was at 3.50 lakh cusec on Sunday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satara-death-toll-rises-to-37-krishna-above-danger-mark/articleshow/84737660.cms||---

In a letter issued by additional chief secretary (public health department) Dr Pradeep Vyas, it has been pointed out that during the third wave the number of active cases could go up to 150% of the highest number of active cases registered during the second wave. The district had witnessed 52,954 — the highest number of active cases — on April 29, and as per the prediction the number of patients during the third wave could go beyond 79,431. Hence, the health department has asked the health department and district administration to prepare the infrastructure in order to meet the eventuality. As per estimates of the health department, a total of 27,801 patients of the total active cases during the peak period could require hospitalization and out of these around 50% (around 13,900) could seek treatment in public hospitals that are run by the state health machinery and the two corporations in Nashik and Malegaon districts. Coming to the government infrastructure, the health department can expect 556 patients requiring ICU facility and another 556 requiring ventilators beds. This is in proportion to 8% of the hospitalised people requiring critical care. District civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said, “Based on the projections of the state government, the administration is working hard to put the health infrastructure in place before the third wave. The plan would be in place soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/health-dept-28k-in-nashik-may-need-hospitalisation-during-3rd-wave-peak/articleshow/84739601.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The project will cover the new areas in Pathardi, Makhmalabad, Mhasrul, Adgaon and other places on the outskirts of the city. NMC has sought financial assistance from the government for the project. The civic body has prepared the Godavari rejuvenation project, totally worth Rs 1,800 crore. This project also includes developing a sewer network in the new developing areas on the outskirts of the city. S Vanjari, the executive engineer (environment and Godavari conservation), said the city currently has 1,750km length of underground sewer lines. Construction of another 70km length of new lines is in progress and the project is expected to be completed by March next year. “We still need 200km length of sewer lines in various developing areas on the outskirts of the city and we will need around Rs 100 crore to create the sewer network. We have already sought funds from the government,” said Vanjari. Earlier, both sewer and stormwater lines were the same. But the civic body has now started separating them in the city. There are many houses that have connected their sewage outlets to the stormwater lines instead of designated sewer lines. Therefore, stormwater lines are flooded during the heavy rainfall in the monsoon. Now, the Nashik Municipal Corporation has appealed to such residents to connect their sewage outlets to the sewer lines instead of the stormwater lines. Around 3.5 lakh properties have connected their sewage outlets to the sewer lines so far. Apart from the sewer lines, NMC has stormwater lines of 360km in length.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-spend-rs-100cr-on-sewer-lines-in-new-areas-of-nashik-city/articleshow/84739663.cms||Tushar Pawar

The highway police said Mumbai Agra highway has developed potholes in various places, which needs immediate attention by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). The condition of the road was very bad near Kasara due to the incessant rain, said the police. While driving vehicles on the potholes ridden highway were difficult for drivers of four-wheelers, it was a nightmare for two-wheeler riders. Police inspector Samadhan Nagare of the Igatpuri police station said many potholes had developed in the Pimpri Phata area on the highway. However, the work of filling the potholes has been taken up. The NHAI should be vigilant about the potholes as they could lead to an accident, he said. Police inspector Vishawajit Jadhav of the Wadivarhe police station said potholes had developed at various places on the highway due to the continuous rains. Motorists said the potholes leads to accidents. When a motorist takes a sudden turn to avoid the potholes, it can lead to an accident. Senior officials of the NHAI said they have given standing instructions to the toll company, which is responsible for the maintenance, to ensure the potholes are filled as soon as they develop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rain-creates-potholes-on-highways-in-nashik/articleshow/84737696.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Delhi||West Delhi fire: NGT slams govt for ‘lack of concern for lives’||New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal has rapped the AAP government over a fire incident in a west Delhi factory, saying the administration has shown utter lack of concern for human lives and that no steps have been taken to compensate the family of victims. A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel expressed surprise that despite death of six persons, the offence registered is for “attempt to cause homicide”. “The DM has informed that ex-gratia compensation of only Rs 50,000 per deceased has been announced, but not paid. These startling facts show utter lack of concern for the loss of human lives by authorities concerned. “It is further surprising that inspite of notice, Director Industrial Safety and the unit in question have not even cared to put in an appearance. DPCC has merely paid lip service by showing inability to provide any information on the subject,” the bench said. The green panel said there is prima facie violation of environmental laws and victims are required to be compensated under section 15 of the NGT Act. However, before passing a final order in the matter, it is necessary to have authentic information about the factual position of the nature of activity and nature of violation of law, the bench said. The NGT constituted a committee comprising officials of the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, District Magistrate of West Delhi, director, Industrial Safety and Health and DCP, Outer Delhi to ascertain the cause of the incident. “The Committee may particularly ascertain whether any hazardous inflammable material was stored in the premises,“ the tribunal said.

People also visited the river bank areas in the city to see the swollen river The police put up bandobast in various areas in cases there is an untoward incident caused by the heavy rain and also to ensure there is no overcrowding, which can lead to Covid spread. The city police as well as the Igatpurti and Trimbakeshwar police said police personnel were deployed in different areas to keep a check on overcrowding. Police inspector Samadhan Nagare of the Igatpuri police station said, “People have started coming to see the Bhavali dam from Sunday morning so we have set up bandobast at three different points.” Meanwhile, police inspector Sandeep Randive of the Trimbakeshwar police station said tourists are coming towards Dugarwadi, Pengalwadi, Bramhagiri hill to see the rain, greenery and the rainwater cascading from the mountains and waterfalls. “There are strict orders in place by the district administration about the weekend restrictions and there should be no rush at tourists spots. However, people are neglecting the Covid norms. We are taking action against people, wherever possible,” said Randive. Sham Warule, a tourist near the Someshwar temple said, “Police are not allowing people to see the waterfall following, which we had to return. Nonetheless, I wanted to take my wife and two children for a drive somewhere out of the city to see the greenery. It is good that the police are not allowing people to go near the waterfall as it would not only spread the infection, but an accident can take place due to the slippery area on the river banks.” Another tourist stopped by the Igatpuri police near Bhavali dam said he and his family did not intend to stop near the dam area and wanted to enjoy the view from their vehicle. Another tourist, preferring anonymity, said since everything is closed during the weekend restrictions, going for a long drive with family was the only activity they could do.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-residents-flock-to-igatpuri-trimbakeshwar/articleshow/84737717.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two swept downhill, live; 3 escape, leaving 1 behind||Gritty accounts of survival are emerging from the devastation wrought by floods and landslides in the Konkan. At a tribal hamlet off the Mumbai-Goa Highway, an elderly couple had a harrowing time battling a torrent of sludge and rainwater: they were swept half a kilometre away from their home, but lived to tell the tale. At Mahad, Raigad, where the worst of the landslides occurred, killing dozens, a family had to take a tough call on who to rescue first, a decision that now haunts them. Landslide hit Kumbharwadi, set on a hill at Pedhegaon off the Mumbai-Goa Highway, in the early hours of Thursday while villagers were deep in sleep. The landslide started 100 feet upslope, and a few villagers were woken by the rumble of rocks tumbling down. Before anyone could react, the slurry had inundated the village, uprooting trees and smashing houses. While their neighbours got buried in the wake, 60-year-old Shashikant Mandavkar and his wife found themselves riding a wave of sludge. “The two had come out of their home just in time not to be buried under it when it crashed. They rolled 500 metres downhill with the current, and got stuck in the foothills. Hours later, they were rescued by locals,” said the village’s sarpanch, Pravin Pakhale, about the elderly couple’s ordeal. At the tribal Kondalkar Wadi in Taliye village, Mahad, a family had been discussing relocating to a safer place as rainfall continued unabated. The problem was, they were four, but their motorcycle could take only three. “I, along with my seven-year-old son and my husband, left on the bike for safety. My father-in-law, advising us to go first, stayed behind,” said Archana Pol (28), narrating her experience. “After dropping us at Barasgaon, my husband went back to pick up my father-in-law. But by the time he reached there, everything had been washed away by a landslide. There was nothing where our house stood. There was no one. My husband kept looking for hours, but he simple couldn’t find his father. We are still waiting for him…”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-swept-downhill-live-3-escape-leaving-1-behind/articleshow/84743913.cms||Umesh K Parida

They have also found tiger pugmarks in the vicinity. The forest department is currently monitoring camera traps in the Tillari, Chandgad and Amboli regions. Clement Ben, the chief conservator of forests for the Kolhapur territory, said, “The cattle kill was found in the Chandgad conservation reserve. The hunting style — from the rear of the prey — is typical of tigers. The cattle might have been hunted around July 20. We have even found pugmarks of a tiger and are closely monitoring the corridor towards Ajara, Bhudargad and Vishalgad forest region. Camera traps are already in place and we expect to get some images of the tiger. Increasing prey base and now the tiger pugmarks signify the importance of the conservation reserves in the Kolhapur region. The increased forest cover is allowing them a safe corridor to move around freely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/forest-dept-finds-tiger-pugmarks-in-chandgad-reserve/articleshow/84739673.cms||---

Nashik city recorded 4mm rain between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm on the day. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued a warning for moderate to heavy rainfall in isolated parts of the three districts. The IMD now has a forecast for light rain with cloudy conditions for the next four days. Though by and large, the rainfall was moderate, some places did have heavy rain. In Dhule district, Shirpur and Sindkheda talukas received heavy showers for over two hours on Sunday. “Prior to this, the rainfall was inadequate. As we had completed our kharif sowing, we wanted at least one spell of good rain. Finally, that has happened,” said Deva Patil, a local farmer. In Nandurbar, there was a spell of heavy rain for just a few minutes. The district, however, is yet to get adequate rain for the kharif crops. The rural parts of Nashik district too are awaiting a good spell of heavy rainfall. “The rainfall has not been adequate in the north Maharashtra districts even though we have reached July-end. In Nashik district, only Trimbakeshwar, Igatpuri and Ghoti areas have received good rain. The other 13 talukas are still waiting,” said Bharat Dighole, the president of Maharashtra onion growers’ association. Kuber Jadhav, a farmer in the Baglan taluka of the district, said the moderate rain over the past few days has benefitted the crops sown three weeks ago. But there is still a need for a good spell of rain in the district as the water has still not percolated deep into the soil. Nivrutti Nyaharkar, another farmer, said the rain started after two days on Sunday. “There have been light showers throughout the day that will help the kharif crops survive, but we are yet to get adequate rainfall,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/moderate-rain-in-nashik-dhule-nandurbar-dists/articleshow/84737753.cms||Tushar Pawar

He used to narrate different incidents from his own schooldays to keep my spirit up. His memories will always inspire me to undertake the future academic journey,” said Pushkaraj, who scored a perfect 100 in two subjects. Looking to pursue the Commerce stream, the teenager, who studied in a Pune-based school, said he will strive hard to make the family proud. His mother, Pradnya, said Pushkaraj had his prelim examinations in February, just before Satav contracted Covid. “Pushkaraj did well in the internal examinations. That formed the basis for the ICSE evaluation as the board examination could not take place due to the pandemic. Referring to my qualifications, my husband always told our children that they have the best tutor at home. Going by his wish, I will ensure that both my children excel in the fields of their choice,” said Pradnya, an MBBS graduate, who also has a daughter studying in Class VI. NCP leader Supriya Sule was among those in the political circle to congratulate Pushkaraj. She tweeted: “Rajeev would have been very proud of him.

The Gangapur dam complex, comprising Gangapur, Gautami-Godavari and Kashyapi dams, now has 51% of its total storage capacity. The complex is primarily responsible for providing drinking water to Nashik city even as some water is drawn from Mukne dam. With 5,630 million cubic feet (mcft) storage capacity, the Gangapur dam is the biggest in the complex and two others have a collective storage capacity of about 1850 mcft. The Gangapur dam now has 3,442 mcft (61%) of water while the Gautami-Godavari has 665 mcft (36%) and Kashyapi has 616 mcft (33%) storage. The collective storage of the three dams is 4,723 (51%) mcft. The water in the dams stood at 2782 (29%) on July 21 after which heavy rains propelled the storage. Last year during the same time the storage stood at 41%. It should be noted that the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had announced weekly water cuts since rains failed in Nashik district and had warned of alternate day water cut if the storage remained less than 51% by the beginning of August. Since the water storage has crossed 51%-mark chances of alternate day water cut now appear to be weaning. But NMC authorities said a decision regarding the same would be taken on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gangapur-complex-storage-reaches-51/articleshow/84737795.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Both the water reservoirs, over the last six days, recorded water levels at the brim due to incessant rains. But on July 24 night, the officials of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) observed that inflows are steadily decreasing in the reservoirs. After inflows into twin reservoirs, Osmansagar and Himayatsagar reservoirs, declined, HMWS&SB decided to close two floodgates each on Sunday. According to an official release of HMWS&SB, recorded water level at Osmansagar stood at 1785.8 feet and it was 1762.15 feet at Himayatsagar on Sunday at 4 pm. The inflows were 300 cusecs and outflows were nil at Osmansagar while officials were discharging 1,715 cusecs of surplus water at Himayatsagar. The recorded inflows into Himayatsagar was 1,200 cusecs. A total of nine floodgates of twin reservoirs (seven of the 17 floodgates of Himayatsagar and two of the 15 floodgates of Osmansagar) were opened between July 20 and 24, in view of the water levels at reservoirs due to bountiful rains. Currently, five floodgates of Himayathsagar will continue to remain open for a few more days and based on the inflows, a decision to close them would be taken, an HMWS&SB official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-floodgates-at-each-of-citys-twin-reservoirs-closed/articleshow/84743934.cms||---

The landslide hit in front of my eyes and swept the family away. Somehow I survived the nightmare." At the Posare Khurd tribal village in Khed, Ratnagiri, two successive landslides hit, amid which a man had a narrow escape. “The first landslide struck at 3 pm on Thursday, but without any impact. Nothing came downhill towards the human settlement. The second landslide hit around 10.30 pm, when most people were within their houses. Seven houses were crushed,” said Ajay Mohite. “Somehow, the place I was, escaped the fury of the tumbling rocks. I’m alive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-raigad-family-of-5-perishes-under-the-weight-of-tradition/articleshow/84744014.cms||Umesh K Parida

The virtual learning modules by B S Reddy and R S Jain — from the mathematics department of the university — have been picked up by the Central authorities after gauging them on different parameters. “In the early stages of the pandemic, when activities in the education sector had almost halted, virtual learning methods were projected as a solution to overcome the odds. It is a proud achievement for all of us that the virtual learning content by our two faculty members have been selected at the national level,” university vice-chancellor Udhav V Bhosle said. In an official release, the SRTMU said that it is the first institution of higher learning from Marathwada from which content has been selected for the Vidya-Mitra. “We hope that the work and achievements of both the faculty members will serve as an inspiration to teachers to create virtual learning tools for students during the current pandemic situation,” Bhosle said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/vidya-mitra-picks-content-of-2-nanded-university-teachers/articleshow/84739695.cms||---

The case involves a couple living in Chandkheda area. They got married in June 2015. The husband filed divorce petition in the court of senior civil judge at Gandhinagar in 2017, alleging cruelty on part of his wife. The grievance against the wife was that she was not ready to adjust with her in-laws and used to quarrel with her husband’s aged parents. She was also accused of insisting on abortion when she got pregnant in 2016. The wife also accused the in-laws of pressurizing her to get her pregnancy terminated. The court rejected the husband’s claims of behavioural issues on part of his wife saying that he could not furnish any evidence to this effect. However, the husband had also expressed grievance that his wife kept on filing litigations in order to harass his family and to cause him financial loss. He cited a police complaint that his wife had filed with Chandkheda police station in 2017. He also submitted that his wife had first approached Ahmedabad family court and filed an application. Besides, the woman had filed a complaint under the Domestic Violence Act with a magisterial court in Gandhinagar, which ordered him to pay her maintenance. Later, the wife filed another application seeking recovery of the maintenance amount. After hearing the case, the court rejected the divorce petition saying, “Merely filing of domestic violence application and maintenance application (which she is legally entitled to do) and in which she has succeeded to prove her case cannot be termed as cruelty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/litigations-by-wife-not-a-ground-for-divorce-court/articleshow/84739732.cms||---

Noting that the study mainly focused on people who send messages and suggestions, Modi said, “I view this as a very good indicator. ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is a medium which has positivity, sensitivity. In ‘Mann Ki Baat’, we talk about positive things. Its character is collective.” Appealing to listeners to keep on sending their ideas and suggestions, he said, “Suggestions received from you are the real strength of ‘Mann Ki Baat’. We’re not able to discus all of them, but I do send many of them to related departments so that further work can be done on them.” The PM shared some of the innovations and works of individuals in different states. He also appealed to people to focus on conserving rain water. “Saving every drop of water and preventing any kind of wastage of water should become a natural part of our lifestyle. Such habits should be followed in our families,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suggestions-of-our-young-guns-steering-mann-ki-baat-pm-modi/articleshow/84745559.cms||---

Nineteen per cent of the state’s population consume liquor (50.40 lakh to be precise) , according to a survey on alcohol consumption available with the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment. However, the number of tipplers in the state is more that the national average, 17.3%. In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, over 65 lakh (65,09,000) people, 17.3% of the total population, consume alcohol. No wonder the liquor sales graph never sees a downward trend in the two Telugu states. The survey revealed that 17.3% of the country’s population consume alcohol. In other words, there were about 15.5 crore tipplers in the country. Only a handful of big states have logged more than the country’s average. Apart from AP and Telangana, Chhattisgarh (43.5%), Uttar Pradesh (29.5%), Punjab (25.2%), Delhi (25%) Uttarakhand (23.2%) , Goa (28%), Madhya Pradesh (21.4%), Odisha (18.9%), West Bengal (18.2%) recorded above the country’s liquor consumption average. Among the big states, Bihar had the lowest alcohol consumption rates with only 1% population consuming alcohol. Other than the two Telugu states, remaining southern states have less number of liquor consumers. Tamil Nadu’s 15.5% population drinks, while Kerala (13.5%) and Karnataka (7. 2%) were less than the national average. The survey had taken people in the age group of 18-75 years into consideration. Interestingly, the latest National Family Health Survey–5 shows that men in Telangana drink more alcohol than their counterparts in any other state in the country. About 43.3% men in Telangana above 15 years drink alcohol, while the northeastern state of Sikkim stood at second place with 41.1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-men-top-the-tipplers-chart-in-country/articleshow/84743982.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Crime branch officers said that Desai and Jadeja were booked under the charges of murder and abetment by police after Desai confessed to having killed his live-in partner by strangling her to death. Their Covid-19 test was conducted, and they will be produced before the court on Monday. Police officers said after killing Patel, Desai told Jadeja that he wanted to dispose of his sister’s body, whom he had killed as she got pregnant with her boyfriend before marriage. Jadeja was hesitant in the beginning, but as Desai pursued him, he agreed to give his hotel space in Atali village near Dahej to save himself from Desai’s wrath. Desai took Patel’s body wrapped in blankets, put it in the boot of his car and burnt it in an open space near the hotel. Later, he told Patel’s family members that she had gone missing. Vadodara district police began searching for her and ultimately handed over the case to Ahmedabad city crime branch and ATS. ACP D P Chudasama was handed over the probe on Tuesday and the accused PI confessed his crime on Saturday. Gujarat DGP Ashish Bhatia, who was in Vadodara to inaugurate a creche for kids of women cops, said, “He as a cop is supposed to protect citizens. Instead he turned into a ‘bhakshak’. We will gather all evidence and submit it in the court. The ATS and Ahmedabad crime branch did good work and Vadodara police too was on the right track initially.” Bhatia added that departmental action will also follow against Ajay Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/desai-aide-jadeja-due-in-court-today/articleshow/84739807.cms||---

Over the past few days, Gowda’s residence has been abuzz with local farmers who are helping the young officer cultivate paddy in a scientific way. Gowda, taking out time from his hectic schedule, has been making beds to grow the saplings, waterlogging the farming area, and finally transplanting the paddy saplings. Speaking to TOI, Gowda said, “Before venturing out to cultivate paddy, I asked myself whether this was possible or not. I wanted to understand the efforts put in by the farmers to produce food. They are the backbone of our country. As an IAS officer, I will be dealing with their issues and to ensure that I have first-hand knowledge, I decided to take up farming at a small scale on the one-and-a-half guntha vacant plot.” Though Gowda belongs to an agricultural family himself, he has had little experience in actual farming. He has seen his parents toil on their farm in Karnataka’s Mandya all his life. “When I first told my wife and two children about my idea to cultivate paddy, they wholeheartedly supported me. They also worked along with me. I hail from Mandya, which is frequently in news over farmers’ distress. Hopefully, my small-scale farming venture would help me address the farmers’ issues better,” added Gowda. Gowda says the major work on the farm is now done. The real test lies in caring for the saplings and ensuring that they become healthy plants with shiny and tasty grain. Interestingly, the premises of the ZP CEO’s residence has always found ways to encourage farm-loving IAS officers in pursuing their passion. The premises has many fruit trees that had been grown and maintained by former officers. Gowda is happy to take forward the legacy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satara-zp-ceo-grows-paddy-to-understand-farmers-issues/articleshow/84739735.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Most Covid cases are coming from high-rises and not slums in Mumbai||MUMBAI: A majority of Covid cases in the city are coming from high-rises at four to five wards where residents have been out for social gatherings or have travelled to local tourist destinations, the BMC has found. On Sunday, the city reported 364 cases, taking the overall Covid tally to 7,34,118. Mumbai’s daily detection has gone under 500 for the past ten days. Civic authorities have found that slums or other densely populated areas are hardly contributing to new cases. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that wards like K-West (Andheri-West, Vile Parle, Juhu), H-West (Bandra, Khar), S (Vikhroli, Bhandup) and R-Central (Borivli) are the leading contributors. “During contact tracing, we find that people have either been at a social function or travelled to destinations such as Lonavla,” he said. "However, Mumbai’s cases have plateaued for more than a month now." While there is increasing demand to open the city, civic authorities are awaiting the state’s decision. Mumbai’s active cases are below 8,000. On Sunday, the city had 7,681 people under active Covid care; 550 are currently critical.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Migrants from tribal areas return home to reap a harvest of despair||NAVI MUMBAI: Almost all the tribal areas hit by landslides in Konkan have one thing in common—they all do step farming in the kharif season on the hill slopes and plains. Several migrant workers had returned home for the sowing season, but the landslides in Raigad and Ratnagiri districts have wiped out their homes and destroyed farmland. “More than 100 migrant workers are employed in hotels, snack shops, etc in Pune. All of us go back home at the onset of monsoon to start farming. Paddy is the main crop at this time,” said Ganesh Shirvale, a resident of Kondalkarwadi in Taliye village, the site of the worst landslide that occurred on Thursday. Shirvale, who had come from Pune last month to help his family with farming activities, is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy that has struck them. “I lost my parents in the landslide. Our paddy fields have been completely damaged and three acres of our land with standing crop has been destroyed,” he says. Elsewhere too, it is the same story. “Eighteen of our relatives were staying in the tribal hamlet, but most of them are missing. Neither their houses nor their crops are visible. Everywhere there is debris and earth due to the landslide,” says Geeta Salunkhe. Pravin Pakale, a village sarpanch, said the landslide has washed away farmlands in Pedhegaon, Chiplun, hitting the livelihood of tribals. “Paddy is cultivated here during the rains, while pulses are grown during the winter. Farmlands are mostly on plains, and step farming is done on the hill slopes. But the rains have wiped out every thing,” said Pakale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-migrants-from-tribal-areas-return-home-to-reap-a-harvest-of-despair/articleshow/84744111.cms||Umesh K Parida

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they have held talks with 2-3 private hospitals who said they had adequate doses and expressed willingness to vaccinate slum-dwellers. “We are still working out the modalities. We might gather information about those waiting to get vaccinated from ward offices and share it with those hospitals, or private hospitals could operate centres in the vicinity of slums,” said Kakani. He said even private hospitals don’t have a lot of doses, but some have a few thousand additional doses which they are willing to share under the CSR initiative.  The civic body could not hold drives for at least five days this month, while it had to cut it short on several other days due to shortage of doses. The list of people who have become eligible for a second dose, but are unable to get it is growing longer. The city has administered 67.25lakh doses so far, but only 16lakh people have been fully vaccinated. The city has an estimated adult population of 93lakh that is eligible for vaccination. On Saturday too, less than 70 of the city’s 309 centres could carry out vaccination. Kakani said that they have received 48,000 doses which will help resume the drive on Monday. On Sunday, only private hospitals carried out vaccination, where 13,077 people received the jab. Across Maharashtra less than 1.12lakh people took the vaccine on Sunday. Some of the flood-hit districts like Ratnagiri didn’t see any vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaipvt-hosps-to-help-bmc-widen-vax-coverage-in-slums/articleshow/84744805.cms||---
---||Patna||Monsoon session of Bihar legislature to begin today||PATNA: The five-day monsoon session of the state legislature beginning on Monday is expected to witness stormy scenes from Tuesday onwards, as the opposition parties have already lined themselves up to raise a host of issues on the floor of the House. The issues include the fallout of the Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) Bill, 2021, that was passed by the assembly in the budget session on March 23, despite unprecedented violence involving police and the opposition MLAs. Two separate committees – one Aachaar Samiti of the assembly to look into the behaviour of the MLAs and another comprising senior bureaucrats to probe the violence indulged in by the police – were constituted by assembly Speaker Vjay Kumar Sinha the same day. The other issues that the opposition parties will raise are the rise in the prices of petrol-diesel, cooking gas, edible oils and fertilizers, as well as the earlier unanimous plea of the House for caste Census in the country. “Two days have been allotted by the Speaker for the passage of half a dozen Bills. They are related to the empowerment of the advisory committees set up at the level of panchayats, panchayat samitis and zila parishads that was otherwise granted by the government through the ordinance last month,” parliamentary affairs minister Shrawan Kumar said, adding that the three other Bills to be passed include the one related to the engineering, medical and sports universities whose chancellor will be the chief minister. “Further, one day each has been allotted for the passage of the first supplementary budget for 2021-22 and private member’s non-government resolutions. The opening day of the session is expected to be relatively easygoing, as it will see the House making obituary reference,” the minister said. “To take on the opposition, the treasury benches comprising BJP, JD(U), HAM(S) and VIP will have their strategy meeting on Monday evening,” he said, adding that the meeting would be addressed by CM Nitish Kumar, deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, Jitan Ram Manjhi, minister Mukesh Sahani and parliamentary affairs minister, besides the MLAs concerned. In the meantime, to make the opposition’s intentions clear with regard to the fallout of the passage of the BSAP Bill, 2021 amid unprecedented violence on March 23, leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, has already sent a letter to the Speaker saying the opposition members were “afraid of entering the House”. He maintained that no concrete action had yet been taken against the police personnel who beat up the opposition MLAs on the assembly premises on March 23. However, two days back, the Speaker said the high-level committee comprising the then additional chief secretary of the home department and state DGP had recommended action against two constables for attacking the opposition MLAs, and they had already been suspended. But the opposition parties have not been impressed by the suspension order. On Sunday, Tejashwi held an interactive meeting of the legislator party leaders of the grand alliance partners to decide the combined strategy to be adopted on the floor of the House. Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajeet Sharma said all the 19 party MLAs had their own separate meeting on Sunday evening, while Bhai Birendra said the RJD legislature party will have its strategy meeting on Monday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monsoon-session-of-state-legislature-to-begin-today/articleshow/84740042.cms||Abhay Singh

The labour department has assured the court of preparing the draft for the same and submitting it to the state government. Department secretary Neeraj K Pawan was also present in the online hearing. The department will also take private stakeholders into confidence before finalising the draft. Commissioner for specially abled persons Samit Sharma directed labor and employment departments that appropriate policy decisions should be taken in the interest of PwDs while preparing the draft. Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahansangh had filed a petition in this regard in the court for specially-abled persons. “When 5% reservation can be given to PwDs in private sector jobs in Bihar, then why not in Rajasthan? There are very limited opportunities in government jobs. Also, PwDs face a lot of difficulties in finding a government job,” argued Goyal. “In Rajasthan, 5% reservation has already been given to disabled persons in the training schemes of skill development and Rajeevika. Hence, 5% reservation in private jobs should also be ensured for PwDs in the state.” Meanwhile, the court for specially-abled persons has directed the energy department to ensure providing agricultural power connections to PwD farmers on par with the benefits given to SC/ST farmers.

AAP stated that it is actively telling people about the alleged graft in the BJP-ruled corporations and the people also want to oust BJP from office and hand over the corporations to the party. Reacting to the allegations, Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that people of Delhi are fed up with AAP’s “negative propaganda politics” and now realize that the city’s growth has stalled in the last six years.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt apathy prevents relocation of ‘dangerous’ tiger to bigger area||JAIPUR: The bureaucratic indecisiveness is impending the relocation of young tiger T-104 to a bigger area. The big cat is caged in an enclosure measuring approximately 2 hectare in the core area of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) for nearly two years after it was declared ‘dangerous to human life’ because it killed three people. The demand to shift the tiger from the core area was pending for a long time as captivation of the aggressive male had confronted with other big cats moving in the territory. However, forest department is caught in a catch-22 situation. A source in the forest department said, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had asked the state forest department to take decision on this matter. A committee comprising CCF (Jaipur), DFO Udaipur and DFO Ranthambore was formed. The committee had recommended to shift the tiger in the 24-hectare enclosure at Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR). The decision, however, cannot see the light of the day till the time tigress MT-2 in Mukundra is shifted outside the enclosure. Source added, there are two enclosures in MHTR measuring 24 hectare and 82 hectare. To shift T-104 in the 24-hectare enclosure, it is necessary to release tigress MT-2 (inhabiting in 24 hectare) in bigger enclosure and pair up with another tiger. “The NTCA is neither in a mood to release the tigress in existing 82 square kilometre enclosure in the forest nor give permission to relocate a male tiger to pair up with the tigress,” he said Experts believe captivation of the aggressive male tiger will lead to conflicts with other big cats moving in the territory. Moreover, enclosure is constructed at a faulty location as it is situated between the natural corridor of Kailadevi Wildlife Sanctuary and Ranthambore. It is considered as junction of many tiger territories. “There were cases of wild tigers, including tiger T-66 sparring with the caged T-104. Both external and caged tigers show aggression. In the process, they could have got injured because of cage’s iron bars,” said a source. Since rescued tiger cannot be put on display as per norms, the department also discussed the proposal to relocate the tiger to Sajjangarh or Aamli in Tonk district. “As tiger was young, it was decided it should be released in 24 hectare in Mukundra enclosure, where it could move freely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-apathy-hits-relocation-of-dangerous-tiger-to-bigger-area/articleshow/84742307.cms||---

With more than 1 lakh students sitting for the examination, students are demanding to speed up the vaccination process and organise special camps for them. In RU, three vaccination camps were organised, but they don’t seem to be enough for the students as many of them are residing outside Jaipur. People stand in a long queue outside a vaccination centre in Walled City area.A student Shelly Sharma said that it is dangerous to think of attending the examination without being vaccinated. “I really want all the students to get vaccinated at least one dose so that it will not be a trouble or they will not be at risk of getting infected,” said Sharma. Another student Rohit Thamet, who will be sitting in the examination on July 29, said that his parents are worried about sending him to a place with hundreds of other students present. NSUI state spokesperson Ramesh Bhati said, “NSUI organised three vaccination camps in the university campus, but they are not enough. It will become dangerous to be present in the same examination centre with hundreds of other students. That will become a place of infection. We request the government to start special vaccination camps for students and have 100% students vaccinated before the examination.” RU registrar K M Duriya said that they have organised camps for students to get vaccinated and have written to district administration as well for the same. “We have organised camps and have asked to get vaccinated for safety. In other parts of the state, vaccination is going on, but if necessary we will have more camps for students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-days-left-for-ru-exam-but-40-yet-to-get-jabs/articleshow/84742328.cms||---

Since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020 when all of us were trying to adjust to the difficult times, we have sought ways to keep ourselves safe, within our homes and communities that are home to people from different walks of life. Residents across Hyderabad and Secunderabad have endeavored to do their bit by looking out for each other — acting as communities to ensure safety protocols are followed by everyone. For instance, even as the prolonged impact of pandemic-related restrictions have made working from home a usual setting for many of us and additionally brought mental health concerns of different grades, many conscientious citizens have not stepped back from distributing food or arranging medical help for those in need. Millions of people have stayed united by staying at home, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks to keep not just themselves but also others safe. Team efforts like this are inspiring and this is what #MySocietyPride, a TOI initiative intends to do. Tell us about the welfare measures your society has implemented during the lockdown, and we will feature the best ones in The Times of India. Scan the QR code or visit www.toi.in/mysocietypride to share details. We would all be thrilled to welcome back the Hyderabad and Secunderabad that we know, but it looks as if we’ll have to treat this journey as a test match rather than a Twenty20 game. Societies can draw on the lessons of these last few months and prepare for a future that can be as happy and eventful as our past. May the team spirit prevail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/toi-initiative-to-highlight-societies-efforts-to-fight-covid/articleshow/84744148.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The authorities told TOI that currently patch works were being done to restore vehicular movements sans any hurdles in the streets and later on, new roads would be laid in the identified areas where the people are facing difficulties due to the potholes. “We have taken note of the pathetic condition of the roads in the localities and time being patch works being taken up to respite people from hurdles. Afterward, will come up with estimates and proposals for the new roads in the localities, where people have to face problems due to the pathetic condition of the roads,’’ Assistant Engineer Pratap, told TOI. Locals and commuters notified that the poor condition of the roads had been a cause of concern in rains and minor accidents have been routine in the areas. They thanked TOI for bringing the issue to officials’ notice. “The officials concerned came to the locality with equipment to carry out patch work and we were assured that a new road will be laid in the localities soon,” a resident, Younous, told TOI. The roads in some streets of Marthanda Nagar, Prem Nagar and others are in bad condition. Certain busy roads in the area are dotted with potholes, hampering smooth vehicular movement and sometimes, heavy vehicles cause immense trouble for the residents. The roads connecting scores of localities with Hi-tec city and Hitex, Miyapur need immediate attention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/authorities-take-up-road-works-in-new-hafeezpet/articleshow/84744179.cms||---

Jaisamand hotel is one of the four properties of the corporation that was leased out to the Epitome Destinations at Rs 10,000 fees a month. Besides being located on the banks of the lake, the area of the Jai Samand Hotel comes under the forest area. The construction of a swimming pool in the hotel by the lessee in violation of norms have drawn the ire of various departments concerned and the district administration. Udaipur district collector, water resources department, divisional commissioner of Udaipur and forest department have written to the managing director of RTDC to explain on what basis the construction of the swimming pool going on. As per the MoU, the lesse cannot alter the basic structure of the hotel with new construction. IT can only make repairs. Recently, after RTDC managing director Ngikya Gohain failed to turn up for a meeting to discuss the MoU violations, principal secretary tourism Gayatri Rathore served him a showcase notice last Thursday. In the letter Rathore said, “You were specifically asked to discuss the issue on the same day in Paryatan Bhawan. But showing utter disrespect and also dereliction to duty, you left Paryatan Bhawan while the meeting with the tourism officials was still on. This shows that you have willfully disobeyed the instructions and have acted in an irresponsible behavior.” TOI’s text messages and phone calls to both principal secretary tourism and RTDC managing director on what basis the properties were given at such a cheaper rate did not elicit any response. The four properties were first leased out to the same company in 2006 at a cumulative monthly lease money of Rs 36,514. But a dispute arose over the non-payment of the lease money. RTDC took back the possession of the properties and they remained closed awaiting a court judgement. As per a court order, an arbitrator was appointed which said that the both the RTDC and Epitome Destinations can reenter a leasing agreement. But the rationale behind Rs 10,000 per month lease money is still baffling, said some officials in the corporations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/rtdc-leases-out-heritage-hotel-at-rs-10k-fee-lessee-makes-swimming-pool/articleshow/84745933.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Pune||Nearly 3 lakh vehicles flout Pune-Mumbai expressway speed limit in 1 year||PUNE: A little over a year since closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras were installed to monitor speed a long stretch of the Pune-Mumbai expressway, nearly three lakh vehicles were found flouting norms on the high-speed corridor. The Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) said it caught 2.98 lakh motorists speeding on the stretch from Kiwale to the spot of the erstwhile Amrutanjan bridge and collected Rs Rs29.85 crore in fines. The errant vehicles included cars, trucks, and buses, HSP officers said. Light motor vehicles (LMVs) and heavy vehicles are required to maintain a speed of less than 100kmph and 80kmph, respectively, on the high-speed corridor. Any violation of these speed norms attracts a fine of Rs 1,000. Speeding has been singularly identified as the most common cause of serious — often fatal — accidents on the 95km high-speed corridor. From July 2020 to this month, 36 people lost their lives in 34 accidents on this stretch, authorities said. Last July, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which controls the expressway, and the non-governmental organization Save Life Foundation installed 11 speed-monitoring cameras at vantage points, such as overbridges, on this 52km-long stretch. These cameras are linked to the HSP’s central control room in Urse — responsible for sending online challans to offending vehicles. “These cameras have the facility to record and analyse the speed of moving vehicles,” Sanjay Jadhav, superintendent of police, HSP Pune, said. “Each spot has six cameras covering all the six lanes on both the Pune and the Mumbai corridors,” Jadhav said, adding, “It has been observed that speeding by drivers of the LMVs and heavy vehicles is one of the major reasons for accidents on the expressway.” Jadhav said LMVs generally drive at a high speed and tend to overtake heavy vehicles, moving slowly on the expressway, over the service lanes. “The shoulder lanes are meant for parking vehicles in case of an emergency, and these speeding vehicles collide with stationary vehicles. Most of the deceased persons were in such vehicles,” Jadhav said. “It is our aim to avert the accidents caused by speeding,” he said. Apart from these CCTV cameras, police also use highway interceptor vehicles to catch and fine vehicles that constantly change lanes and overspeed. These vehicles have high-speed laser guns to assess the speed of the vehicles. A senior MSRDC officer said, “On a daily basis, about 38,000 to 48,000 vehicles traverse on the expressway in both directions. However, the number has decreased in the past 18 months owing to the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nearly-3-lakh-vehicles-flout-eway-speed-limit-in-one-yr/articleshow/84740012.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Pratap Nagar, Jawahar Circle among top places for vehicle thieves in Jaipur||JAIPUR: If you hurriedly park in your vehicle at any spot, chances are a vehicle lifting gang has already set their eyes on your vehicle. An examination of all major hotspots of areas where vehicle lifting is most rampant has revealed that gangs prowl for vehicles especially in unauthorized parking spaces where security is lax. According to police, Pratap Nagar and Jawahar Circle areas lead the city in maximum vehicle lifting cases. This year, Pratap Nagar police station reported 109 cases of two-wheeler and five cases of car thefts from January to June. Jawahar Circle police station, on the other hand, reported 88 cases of two-wheeler thefts and six cases of car thefts in the same period. Police officials said unorganised parking and proximity to connecting highways have made the two police station areas favorite destinations for carjacking gangs. Police said CCTVs at major locations are being installed along with the cops in plain dress to keep a close watch at parking spots. “Many places in these areas have very multiple unauthorized and haphazard parking places. The gangs mostly prey in such areas,” the official said. Similarly, Ramganj and Manak Chowk police stations in Jaipur north have witnessed rampant cases of vehicle thefts. The two areas have narrow pathways and parking alongside the road has little security. Police said they have studied these areas to check what blindspots in the security that make some places more vulnerable to criminal gangs. In the southern stretch of the city, Muhana with 92 and Sanganer Sadar police station with 55 cases have the highest reported incidents of vehicle thefts. In Jaipur west, Chitrakoot and Kardhani had major cases of vehicle thefts. Police said a little alertness could avert vehicle thefts. “We have insisted that all commercial establishments should have CCTVs and people should take note of the shaddy parking spaces where there is hardly any security,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pratap-nagar-jawahar-circle-among-top-places-for-vehicle-thieves/articleshow/84742356.cms||---

The man jumped into the quarry to save his two sons on realising that they were drowning a short while after they had entered the water for a swim, police said. The Pune Rural police said the deceased, Piraji Sule, had taken his sons Sainath and Sachin to enjoy waterfalls in the hilly terrain near Kusgaon. “There is a quarry at the foothills, which is now filled with water due to the rain,” an officer from the Kamshet police told TOI. He said Sule’s two sons had entered the quarry. When they started drowning, Sule jumped in to save them. However, he too started drowning. “A local man, who had brought his cattle for grazing, raised an alarm,” the officer said. He said the locals ran towards the quarry and brought the trio out of the water. “They were sent to a hospital and were pronounced dead,” the officer said.

---||Delhi||Director of IL&FS arm arrested in Rs 100-crore fraud case||NEW DELHI: The managing director of IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd has been arrested in an alleged case of cheating and forgery of around Rs 100 crore, which was amassed on the pretext of investment and stake in the company’s Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for Gurugram Rapid Metro project. The directors of the firm allegedly duped the director of another firm, Enso Infrastructures, by offering a 15% stake in the project in lieu of investment of around Rs 170 crore. However, the funds were allegedly siphoned off through bogus bills and invoices to inflate expenses and the stake was never delivered, said additional commissioner (EOW) RK Singh. The accused, Ramchand Karunakaran, was arrested based on an FIR lodged in 2018 under IPC sections of criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery. The complainant, Ashish Begwani of Enso Infrastructures, had alleged that he was approached by officials of IL&FS, including Karunakaran, for investment in August 2010. “Enso Infrastructures agreed to invest Rs 170 crore for a 15% stake in IL&FS Rail Ltd, the SPV for Gurugram Rapid Metro project. However, over a period of time, the complainant observed that the company was not profitable and funds were being misused,” Singh said. It was further alleged that bogus contract orders worth Rs 21.9 crore were issued to Silverpoint Infratech Ltd, but no work was executed by this company. “The invoices raised by Silverpoint were fabricated. IL&FS Rail Ltd did it to inflate its expenditure and show less profit in its books. The complainant claimed that the directors of IL&FS and other officials siphoned off over Rs 70 crore, thereby causing a loss to his company,” said a senior officer. During investigation, a team led by ACP Virender Sejwan found that the accused had made payments to several companies without any work being executed by them. “The accused could not give a satisfactory reply about the contracts awarded to such companies. No estimate was taken, no name and address of any contractor was kept on record and there was no explanation for the end use of the money. Money was routed through several shell companies,” said Singh. Karunakaran had applied for anticipatory bail, which was cancelled in December last year. He was tracked down in Mumbai, produced before a court and taken on transit remand and interrogation. He told police that he joined IL&FS as vice-president in 1994 and was appointed managing director in 2008. He was also one the directors in IL&FS Rail Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/director-of-ilfs-arm-arrested-in-rs-100cr-fraud-case/articleshow/84742357.cms||---

Edubridge International School, run by Chankya Gyan Kendra trust, replied to HC’s July 9 direction “to make a statement whether it is agreeable to grant admission” to the boy as directed by the deputy director of education and education inspector (south). The petitioner, Gamdevi resident Ashish Patel, said in April 2019, his son was allotted Edubridge International School in an online RTE admission process. When he approached the school with the allotment letter, the admission was rejected without specifying any reason. The Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, in October 2019, directed the deputy director of education and education inspector (south) to take necessary action in the matter, but there was no response. Thereafter, due to the pandemic, Patel could not take the matter further and his son remained without admission. Patel urged the HC for directions to admit his son—now aged 7—to class I for the 2021-22 academic year. In its reply, the school said it has been a minority institution since inception although its minority status was certified by the state in February 2020. It referred to the Supreme Court’s two judgments that RTE provisions do not apply to minority institutions as they violate Article 30 (Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions) and the Act must yield to rights of minorities as protected by the Constitution. On July 22, before a bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla, the school’s advocate Pradeep Bakhru said as it is exempt from provisions of the RTE Act “therefore the directions (to admit) do not apply to us”. Patel’s advocates, C R Sadasivan and Anup Dhannawat, countered that in 2019, the school was not a minority institution and its name was on the state’s RTE portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cant-admit-boy-under-rte-minority-ib-school-tells-hc/articleshow/84744254.cms||Rosy Sequeira

According to the Centre, the number of all the beneficiaries who are required to be vaccinated against Covid-19 are 5.14 crore in the state, out of those more than 57 lakh have been vaccinated with both the doses, which means that more than 11% of the state’s population is now fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Besides, the state had vaccinated 2,32,95,731 first doses till July 20, which is the result of the state government’s aggressive strategy of inoculating beneficiaries with the first dose since the drive launched on January 16. It is at the third place in the list of states vaccinating highest first doses. UP is leading in first dose vaccination, which is more populated than Rajasthan, had provided 3.4 crore first doses to beneficiaries, while Maharashtra provided 3 crore and Rajasthan had given 2.3 crore jabs of first doses of Covid-19 vaccines, contributing 7.1% of the total first dose vaccination done in the country. After Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, Rajasthan is at the fourth spot in receiving highest number of vaccine doses from the Centre. The state has received 2,49,42,230 doses till July 20. In terms of preventing wastage of vaccine doses, the state has done well. The state has not wasted any dose, rather it has extracted extra vaccine doses for the beneficiaries, says the Centre’s report. A vial contains 11 doses, but officially it is counted as 10 doses. The health department used that one extra dose in each vial, which is given as compensation, in case of wastage of one dose per vial.

---||Patna||Patna HC acquits man on death row, says cops didn’t visit crime spot||PATNA: The Patna high court has acquitted a person, who was sentenced to death for allegedly raping and killing a 16-year-old girl under Barhara police station area in Bhojpur district. The court also acquitted two others, who were awarded life imprisonment in the same case. The final hearing on their appeal took place on Friday and detailed judgement was uploaded on Saturday evening. The division bench of Justices Ashwani Kumar Singh and Arvind Srivastava observed that police had not bothered to visit the crime spot and submitted that the girl’s body had been recovered on the confessional statement of death sentence convict Balwant Singh, though the body was recovered much earlier even before he was arrested. Additional public prosecutor (high court) Abhimanyu Sharma said the bench set aside the Pocso court order awarding capital punishment to Balwant on September 6, 2019. “It also set aside the life imprisonment order to the two other convicts, Chotu Singh and Anand Pandey,” he said. The bench observed that the prosecution miserably failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellants. The girl’s father had lodged an FIR with Barhara police station against Balwant, Chotu and another unknown person (non-FIR accused Anand) on February 5, 2018, alleging that her daughter had been gang-raped and killed by the accused. Police filed first chargesheet against Balwant on May 3, 2018 and a supplementary chargesheet against the other two on September 20, 2018. The high court ordered immediate release of Balwant from jail, if he is not involved in any other case. The bench also found contradictions in the statements of the victim’s father, the investigating officer of the case and the witnesses. It observed that the kidnapping took place on January 31 night and body was recovered on February 5 after which an FIR was lodged. But there was no reasonable explanation about the delay. The court found that the trial court admitted Balwant’s confessional statement as evidence though it was recorded by the police after taking him on remand on February 18, 2018 while the body had been recovered 13 days earlier. Balwant had said he, along with Anand, Om Rai, Ajai Rai and Chotu, kept the girl at a marriage hall and gang-raped her before strangulating her to death. He said they threw her body in a mustard field. The bench observed that confessional statement to police in custody can’t be proved against the accused until recorded before a magistrate as per the Indian Evidence Act. The bench also found many another loopholes in the prosecution case. The bench also observed that the postmortem report of vaginal swab taken from the body was not on record and neither there is anything in the postmortem report that the girl had been raped. “In the absence of any witness to the rape and corroborative medical evidence, by no stretch of imagination it can be said that the prosecution has been able to prove the charge under Section 376D of the IPC beyond shadow of reasonable doubt,” the court observed. Senior advocate Kanhaiya Prasad Singh, Ashok Kumar Singh, Arun Kumar Pandey and Rajesh Kumar represented the appellants while Amis Kumar was the amicus curiae and APP Satya Narayan Prasad with Sharma represented the state in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-acquits-man-on-death-row-two-others-in-rape-murder-case/articleshow/84740109.cms||Debashish Karmakar

After PSPCL had imposed huge penalties, businessmen had claimed that they had only run overload for few days but department had sent them notices to pay penalties for one year power usage. PSPCL ignored the demand of businessmen to charge them penalties only for the period they used overload for, industrialists started series of protest against the department after which PSPCL top brass agreed to their demand. Confirming the development, Jaswinder Singh Thukral, president of Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JSMA), said, “According to the assurance given to us by director distribution of PSPCL in the meeting held 10 days ago, aggrieved factory owners who were being asked to pay penalty equivalent to one year have started receiving letters from PSPCL in which they are being informed that they need not pay anything or only the penalty amount for the duration they used the overload for. Till now, more than a dozen businessmen have received these letters in which penalties more than Rs 10 lakh have been waived off. More letters are about to be despatched and within next week’s time all the cases will be settled. This development is outcome of the month long agitation led by us against the injustice being done to the business community by the PSPC.” Hailing the development, businessman Svinder Singh Hunjan, said, “In our area alone, five consumers — Pritam Singh, Nirmal Singh, Sukhwinder Singh, Jaswant Kaur and Jarnail Singh have got the relief letter and they have heaved a sigh of relief after getting the waiver. We all are thankful to the JSMA president Jaswinder Singh Thukral who turned this agitation against PSPCL into a movement and got justice delivered to us. This win of ours in the fight with PSPCL has set an example in front of other department who now would think twice before doing anything wrong with the business community.” According to another businessman Inderjit Singh, “The final order of assessments of the consumers that have been received from PSPCL were handed over formally to all of them by JSMA and assurance was also given to them that in case they face any further problem they can contact the association.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bizmen-affected-by-pspcl-penalties-start-receiving-waiver-letters/articleshow/84740227.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Nagpur||Cardiac check-up of dengue positive must: Doctor||NAGPUR: Citing his 2013 research, a city cardiologist has advised that echocardiography — a high-end medical investigation of heart — of all dengue patients must be done to ensure the vector-borne disease has not affected its functioning. The reminder comes amid a spike in dengue cases after a gap of couple of years. This month alone, the city has recorded over 100 cases, while three patients have died between May and June. Against this backdrop, cardiologist Dr Shantanu Sengupta said, “Every dengue patient should undergo cardiac assessment too.” “Generally, it is assumed that dengue deaths occur due to low platelet count, which is not the case as per our study. During the study on 80 patients, mostly from Hingna and Wadi areas, we found 10% to 20% had developed heart ailments. The complication could be prevented in rest of the patients due to timely intervention,” said the CMD of Sengupta Hospital, where the study was done during the 2013 outbreak. The study titled ‘Left ventricular myocardial performance in patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever and thrombocytopenia as assessed by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography,’ was authored by Sengupta and three others. Dr Abhijeet Nugurwar, Dr Kunda Mungulmare (both from Nagpur) and Dr Bijoy Khanderia (USA) were the other researchers. Dr Sengupta said dengue fever treatment must start at early stage. “We identified the heart issues not only by ECG but also through echocardiography, which is strain imaging. It helps in identifying sub-clinical heart involvement. If it is done properly and picked up early, fatality can be prevented. Sixteen dengue patients who were part of the study had heart involvement and one died. Mortality was less than 1%. After this research, doctors have started using strain imaging on dengue patients,” Dr Sengupta claimed. Senior consultant physician Dr Vimmi Goel said, “Cardiac involvement in dengue fever is a common occurrence. This can be easily monitored with readily available tests such as ECG, 2D echocardiogram and cardiac enzymes. Damage to heart muscles can cause heart failure-like symptoms, which can be easily picked up by bedside echocardiogram. Apart from this, various types of disturbances in heart rhythm can also be due to dengue infection.” Consultant cardiologist Dr Shoeb Nadeem felt cardiac assessment is not necessary for all dengue patients. “But for patients with myocarditis — inflammation of the heart — or tachycardia, it is required. Screening is also needed for patients with low heart rate, breathless or drastic fall in BP,” he added. TESTING TIMES Over 100 dengue cases have been detected in July alone this year A study in 2013 on 80 dengue patients revealed 10% to 20% had developed heart ailments Echocardiography helps in identifying sub-clinical heart involvement Damage to heart muscles can cause heart failure-like symptoms Early detection can prevent fatality Cardiac assessment necessary for dengue patients with myocarditis or tachycardia||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cardiac-check-up-of-dengue-ve-must-doc/articleshow/84740253.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Kolkata||Catholic Association of Bengal reaches out to old-age home residents on Grandparents’ Day||KOLKATA: It was Grandparents’ Day, but parishioners aged over 60 were advised not to attend church. So, members of Catholic Association of Bengal (CAB) decided to reach out to the elderly and the infirm in old-age homes and help all these grandparents, who couldn’t have their grandchildren coming over to meet them, celebrate the special day. As instructed by Pope Francis, Grandparents’ Day is supposed to be celebrated on the last Sunday of July as the feast of St Anne and St Joachim, parents of Mother Mary. So the halls of St Catherine’s Home at Ekbalpore reverberated with music and laughter on Sunday to usher in Grandparents’ Day and add a welcome relief to the gloom and despair of the pandemic. “It was one of my most gratifying Sundays ever. Grandparents lavish their grandchildren with endless supply of love, gifts, and candies. We should look for opportunities to return the favour and show gratitude to our grandparents for their strength, kindness and wisdom,” said CAB president Angelina Mantosh Jasnani. Echoed CAB member Colin Fitzgerald, who led the prayers: “It was an opportunity to thank the elderly for giving our lives.” And those like Lynette Datter, 80-plus benefactor member of CAB, who has helmed the organization’s activity at one time and is now in homes, were overjoyed. “These past 16 months have been especially difficult for the elderly, in old-age homes, and in their own homes. We are just praying that this deadly virus will go away and things will return to normal soon. We try to remain confined indoors, because that’s the only way we can stay safe. The monotony is too much. And today, we felt a little more alive,” said Datter. “It’s so thoughtful of these youngsters to remember us in this Covid situation and visit us,” said 90-year-old Blanch Smith. “I loved my goodie bag the most. Wonderful to receive gifts of love, especially when they come as surprises. Nice to see the younger generation taking care of their elders and making us feel loved and important,” quipped nonagenarian Stella Cohelo. Earlier this month, TOI reported Archbishop Thomas D’Souza issuing a notice and instructing churches under the Archdiocese of Kolkata to organize gifting, offering financial help to the elderly and initiate a “monthly pension scheme” for those in need. The notice also mentioned holding a special mass on Grandparents’ Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/catholic-association-reaches-out-to-old-age-home-residents-on-grandparents-day/articleshow/84740291.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

On July 18, the fraudster, who identified himself as Subedar Major Zora Singh, contacted the 66-year-old retired company executive and said he was interested in the flat and agreed to pay Rs 2 lakh deposit and Rs 35,000 monthly rent. “Singh told me to transfer Rs 50,000 to activate his ‘Army Merchant Card Account’ so that he could make the transactions. I believed him and did as told. But he called me again and said he has not received the money. He asked me to transfer another Rs 49,000, which I did. Later, he called me and said he has transferred Rs 4 lakh into my account.” When the money was not credited into his account, the victim called Singh, but his phone was switched off. He then filed a co-mplaint. “We have sought details of the fraudster’s account and asked the bank to freeze the transactions. We are trying to trace him through call data rec-ords,” said a cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-army-man-seeking-to-rent-flat-dupes-sr-citizen-of-rs-4l/articleshow/84744349.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Nagpur||After 21 years, Nagpur Municipal Corporation eyes more billboard revenue||NAGPUR: After forgoing potential revenue from advertisers for 21 long years, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is all set to unearth illegal hoardings, identify new sites for installing billboards and revise the offset value. For this, the civic body is in the final stages of appointing a private agency to conduct a survey. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and deputy commissioner Milind Meshram have prepared a plan to increase revenue from advertisements, which has been meagre for the last few years. Despite advertisement hoardings gaining prominence of late, NMC’s revenue is on the decline. As per NMC’s data, the revenue was Rs5.76 crore in 2011-12 and increased to Rs5.98 crore in 2011-12 and further to Rs7.12 crore in 2013-14. It, however, started to decline and was Rs6.52 crore in 2014-15 followed by Rs5.22 crore in 2015-16, Rs5.08 crore in 2016-17, Rs6.49 crore in 2017-18, Rs5.12 crore in 2018-19 and Rs4.85 crore in 2019-20. The NMC had conducted last survey in 2000. A lot has changed since then and such advertisement methods have gained popularity, but the civic body ignored the mode of revenue generation for the reasons known to the officials causing severe financial loss. Meshram told TOI, “Process of expression of interest (EOI) has been completed and a private agency has been shortlisted. Request for proposal (RFP) has also been floated. The agency has to complete the survey within four months of getting the work order.” Meshram added, “The private agency will be given list of existing hoardings of the NMC and private parties. The agency will study the possibility of expanding the existing hoardings apart from identifying new sites and also suggest what needs to be done to increase revenue from them.” The agency will also work out offset and tender value of all the hoardings, he said. Under this plan, NMC will bring all works of advertisements on online platform, he said, adding, “The agency will give dimensions, angles of the hoardings apart from geotagging them. With this, the civic body will be able to get all information about every hoarding with just one click.” Highlight of the project will be revision in offset value. The NMC has been issuing tenders for hoardings for the last 11 years based on the offset value worked out in 2000. Though the city is spread in 222 sq.km area, the NMC has only 151 advertisement hoardings at traffic junctions, along main roads, 2,786 kiosks on street light poles and 550 banner stands. The revenue from these is less than Rs5 crore per annum, which is considered very less. Radhakrishnan said NMC revenue will increase from this project. Under the same project, the civic body is also planning to end long-pending legal battles with a few private agencies. This is also likely to help it increase the revenue. IN A NUTSHELL *NMC identified sites for hoardings and worked out offset value in 2000 *Civic body is renting out hoardings for last 11 years as per value decided in 2000 *All these years, the number of hoardings was not increased *NMC has now started process to appoint agency for conducting fresh survey *Agency will explore options to increase revenue from existing hoardings, identify new sites, work out revised offset value and find out illegal hoardings *NMC also plans to end long-pending legal battles with a few private agencies *All these steps are likely to increase revenue from advertisements||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-21-years-nmc-eyes-more-billboard-revenue/articleshow/84740300.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Bareilly||UP: Tigress that killed 2 bikers in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve returns to haunt locals||BAREILLY: Locals near Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) are living in fear after a tigress which had killed two bikers and nearly mauled the third one who was "saved due to his helmet" has reappeared after two weeks. Camera traps picked up the lurking big cat on Saturday night. The tigress was alone, looked calm and was inspecting the territory, according to the deputy director of PTR. “We are all scared. We are unable to go out. Many of us are dependent on forest produce," a villager told TOI on Sunday. Another villager said locals are returning home early and their work is getting affected. Forest officials have intensified surveillance to avoid any man-animal conflict. The tigress with a sub-adult cub had crossed the Khannaut river, which flows near the forest, after the attack and was never picked up on camera traps earlier, Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of PTR, told TOI. "Pug marks confirmed that the same big cat was behind the attack. However, we have no evidence to suggest that the tigress is a man-eater. It did not attack any other human," Khandelwal said. The attack on the three men on bike two weeks ago was possibly due to its role of a protective mother trying to save the sub-adult cub from outsiders, he added. On July 11, Vikas Kumar was returning home with his friends Sonu and Kandhai Lal. They took a shorter route through the forest and were attacked by the tigress after they entered its territory and went near the cub. Vikas spent the night on a tree and later said that he was "saved due to his helmet". The tigress has maintained a safe distance from the place since and returned alone to its territory on Saturday, may be, for a recce, the PTR official said. Preventive measures are in place. "We are trying to ensure that locals do not go to the area to collect forest produce. The roads will remain shut at night,” Khandelwal added. Before the recent attack, the tigress was also sighted in Pilibhit forest in 2018 and it has been in the territory since.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tigress-that-killed-2-bikers-in-ptr-returns-to-haunt-locals/articleshow/84735753.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Even in the recent scrappage policy, there are no specific steps for commercial vehicles. I am hopeful that as vaccinations increase and people go back to work, the sector will recover. I do praise the state and central governments for their electric vehicles policy, which will help the sector,” Graffi said. Graffi was speaking on the sidelines of the launch of Piaggio’s 300cc engine, named Ape HT, which it has rolled out in the petrol and CNG variants in cargo and passenger auto-rickshaw spaces.

The civic body, as a part of monsoon action plan, is serving notices to the owners of the buildings before they demolish structures and also to those who are reluctant to repair or vacate them within a stipulated time. So far, the monsoon action team of GHMC has demolished close to 180 structures and ensured repairs for over 85 structurally unfit buildings to avoid untoward incidents during rains. “The area engineers of every circle have been asked to send notices to residents who are living in dilapidated structures. In some cases, people are asking for time because they do not have an alternate place to stay, while some of them are reluctant to vacate despite serving notices,” said K Mallikarjuna Rao, deputy city planner, GHMC. The civic body identified 610 buildings that are structurally unfit and initiated measures to avoid loss of life and property. Evacuation of residents, sealing of buildings, barricading around the structure and displaying notices cautioning the public not to move around the structure are some of the measures initiated by GHMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-appeals-public-to-cooperate-in-demolishing-of-dilapidated-structures/articleshow/84744341.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Deceased Dhadu Bhoyar (65) is the 28th victim of predator attack in Chandrapur this year. Forest department sources said the incident took place when the victim had taken his cattle deep into the forest for grazing on Saturday. The cattle promptly returned to the village in the evening, but Bhoyar was missing. Around 150 villagers went into the jungle in search of Bhoyar, but failed to trace him as it had become dark. Villagers then informed the forest department and a fresh search was launched on Sunday morning with the help of local foresters. In no time, the mutilated body of Bhoyar was found in compartment No. 305. Forest officials removed the body after completing the necessary inquest formalities. An ex-gratia of Rs 25,000 was given to the kin of the deceased. Villagers have been warned against venturing into the forest due to the presence of tigers. This is 28th incident of human kill in predator attack in the district this year. In all, 24 people have been killed in tiger attacks, three were killed by leopards and one died in an elephant attack. Predators had claimed 31 lives last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-kills-shepherd/articleshow/84740328.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Kolkata||2,000 motorists charged in 12 days for excessive honking||KOLKATA: The city traffic police have been prosecuting over 200 motorists daily for excessive honking. Earlier it used to be around 40 prosecutions daily. In the past 12 days, over 2,664 motorists have been charged for excessive honking. The maximum number of violations have been reported by Sealdah traffic guard — a total of 245 cases — that covers hospitals like NRS and the BR Singh Hospital, a portion of Medical College and the R Ahmed Dental College. “The anti-honking drive is a year long drive. But we had not required it during the enhanced restrictions. However, when the public transport gradually normalised, we found motorists having a less patience. The honking outside hospitals has also been reported. This prompted the special anti-honking drives,” said an officer from a traffic unit that prosecuted 545 motorists in the past 12 days. Action is being taken under the West Bengal Motor Vehicle Rules and Motor Vehicles Act. “We are trying to tell drivers not to honk without reason. In Kolkata, people are prone to blow horns but rarely use them at the crossings,” added an official. DCP (traffic) Arijit Sinha said the drive is aimed at instilling traffic discipline. “The roads are still not so crowded that needs honking. There are places where honking is not allowed. That is a basic traffic rule that we want all motorists to follow. We will continue such raids,” said Sinha. Among the honking prone zones in the city — besides Sealdah-Amherst Street-College Street-MG Road — were the Hastings area with 176 cases and the Taratala-Majerhat area with 122 cases, both of which witness heavy truck movement. Shyambazar, with 165 cases, and the Park Street-Park Circus zones, with 98 cases, also reported a large number of violations. Areas in and around EM Bypass, like Regent Park and Purba Jadavpur (Mukunapur, Ajoy Nagar), have witnessed the least number of violations, with 37 and 43 cases respectively. A few sergeants have been asked to take action against modified silencers. These sergeants have been compounding the cases and fining bikers anything between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 for using such silencers. Jadavpur traffic guard sergeant Raja Roy fined a biker Rs 5,000 for using a modified silencer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2k-motorists-charged-in-12-days-for-excessive-honking/articleshow/84740329.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

It has also created electric charging infrastructure at Backbay, Worli, Malvani and Shivaji Nagar depots to ensure uninterrupted travel for e-buses on any route. BEST plans to procure 115 more e-buses within the next two months to increase its electric vehicle fleet. It started with six electric buses in 2017. “Our mission is to get maximum electric buses on the road and replace the polluting diesel vehicles with CNG or electric,” said BEST general manager Lokesh Kumar. The new buses will have zero emission and good suspension, CCTV cams for passenger safety, charging points for mobiles, wide entry and exit passages with a record 20 people able to stand once the government allows standees in the bus. The new buses ensure fatigue free driving experience without clutch and gear shifting and have space for ferrying the physically challenged. The full-electric buses come with Intelligent Transport System (ITS) with vehicle location trackers, route/ destination display electronic board inside the bus. All such buses will come with regenerative braking systems for passenger safety, an official said. It has a seat layout of 2x2 with plastic moulded seats, 2 doors provided with door closures. Recently while unveiling new Electric Vehicle Policy for Maharashtra, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said his ministry was pushing for more e-buses in BEST as well as state-owned MSRTC. “I had launched the initial six electric buses in BEST a few years back and now numbers have gone above 200 and will soon cross 300 buses,” he said. Meanwhile, BEST has already floated tenders for 100 brand new double deckers with two staircases and the city awaits these new double deckers in a couple of months.

However, the Travancore devaswom board (TDB) is of the view that the existing system in Sabarimala follows the tradition of Brahmins doing pujas and hence any change should be considered only after having a detailed discussion. Even though the BDJS has been actively raising this demand for a long time, the BJP has not supported this demand. The TDB would not take any decision on its own in this due to the sensitivity of the issue. The board is at present following the high court-approved system of appointing Brahmins as the priest in the temple. TDB president N Vasu has promised to consider it through proper discussions. “If all sections of the society do not object, we can take a decision after proper consideration. A decision in this regard would not happen soon,” said Vasu. In 2017, the CPM-led government took the decision to appoint non-Brahmin priests in the temples under TDB and appointed 36 non-Brahmins, including six dalits, as priests. The LDF was of the view that reservation was not the prime consideration for selection of non-Brahmins and those who have knowledge in rituals were appointed as the priests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tdb-responds-cautiously-to-bdjss-demand-on-sabarimala/articleshow/84740372.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Muslim organizations float samrakshana samithi||KOZHIKODE: Stepping up their opposition to the state government’s decision to rejig the minority scholarship ratio, a meeting of Muslim organizations convened by IUML here on Sunday to discuss the issue has decided to constitute a Sachar Samrakshana Samithi (SSS) and to launch a joint agitation. A secretariat dharna will be held on August 3 under the aegis of SSS, which will be attended by leaders of Muslim organizations. They will also meet the chief minister and submit a memorandum on the day. The meeting noted that while other states in the country implemented the recommendations of Rajinder Sachar committee, which was constituted to look into the backwardness of the Muslim community, and come up with suggestions to alleviate that, the LDF government has taken a stand of denying the benefits recommended by the committee. The meeting unanimously demanded that the recommendations of the Sachar committee should be implemented solely for Muslims by drawing up a special scheme and other welfare schemes for minorities should be implemented on the basis of population. The meeting decided that it would give full support to implement the recommendations of various commissions constituted to look into other communities. The meeting also expressed protest against the stand by the LDF government to complicate an issue which could have been solved easily and which created a notion that the Muslim community has been illegally securing benefits. SSS has IUML leader Syed Sadikkali Shihab Thangal as chairman and will have representatives from all Muslim organizations. Thangal said that steps would be taken to create awareness against the moves to communally disparage the demands raised by the Muslim community. Meanwhile, Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar held talks with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the issue. Kanthapuram said that the chief minister has assured that if there were any concerns over the rejig, it would be resolved through creative steps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/muslim-organizations-float-samrakshana-samithi/articleshow/84740466.cms||---

The pythons were later released at a safe forested area with the help of range forest officials. “Three of the four rescued pythons were found inside a container yard near Jasai, while the fourth Indian rock python was entangled in a fisherman's net nearby. The natural habitats of these reptiles had become flooded in the heavy rains, which is why they had to take refuge inside the container yard and other places,” said activist Anand Madhvi of Vanyajeev Nisarg Savrakshan Sanstha (VNSS).

Both AAP and BJP are “family members of RSS” and the debate is an attempt at diversion from the main issues faced by the Goans, Chodankar told reporters during his visit to Dhaddem-Sanvordem to meet flood-affected families along with the leader of the opposition Digamber Kamat on Saturday. “Goans aren’t interested in their power tariff debate as nobody asked for it. Goans want debate on three destructive linear projects, on coal issues, unemployment, rising prices and Coastal Zone Management Plan. This government sold our Mhadei river, finished tourism, stopped mining, but they don’t want to debate these issues,” he said. He said that Congress will give 70 to 80% tickets to new and young faces for the forthcoming assembly elections. He assured that after coming to office, the Congress government will give water and electricity at the rate fixed in 2012 by the then Congress government, benefits of which will “far exceed” 300 free units promised by AAP. On the flood situation, Chodankar demanded an inquiry into the causes of the flood “in so many places in a span of a few hours”. “The government has undertaken various environmentally destructive projects without studying their environmental impact. In Sanvordem, they may have removed mud after digging and dumped it in an unorganised way by blocking the free flow of water and that could be one of the reasons for flooding as the work of railway double tracking is going on in the area,” he said. He demanded that the government give immediate relief to the affected people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/power-debate-is-drama-to-fool-people-cong/articleshow/84744464.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fourth FIR likely against Param Bir Singh in bookie’s extortion complaint||MUMBAI: A fourth FIR is likely to be registered against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh based on a state CID probe that found substance in a bookie’s allegation that Singh and other police officers had extorted money from him. The state CID has submitted its report to director general of police Sanjay Pandey on Friday, sources said. Sources said that state CID head Praveen Salunkhe submitted the report to Pandey stating that prima facie, the allegations levelled by bookie Sonu Jalan appear to be true and recommended registration of an FIR. Sources said Pandey is likely to submit the report to the state home department and file an FIR against Singh and inspectors Pradeep Sharma and Raj Kumar Kothmire, who have been named by Jalan in his complaint. Pandey declined to comment. The CID was conducting an inquiry into Jalan’s complaints against Singh, Sharma and Kothmire of Thane anti-extortion cell. In 2018, Thane police claimed that Jalan took the help of gangster Ravi Pujari in recovering betting money from one Ritesh Shah and arrested him, Ketan Tanna and other bookies. In his complaint, Jalan said he was framed in a false case and these officers extorted Rs 5 crore from him and others. Last week, two FIRs were registered against Singh on separate allegations of developer Shyam Sunder Agarwal and his nephew Sharad of extorting money from them. In March, inspector Bhimrao Ghadge of Kalyan police lodged an FIR against Singh and 32 other officers alleging that while he was probing a cheating case pertaining to KDMC officials, Singh misused his official position and submitted a closure report despite there being strong documentary evidence. Early this month, the anti-corruption bureau started an open inquiry against Singh based on the complaint of inspector An-up Dange, who was suspended by him. In his complaint to the home department, Dange had alleged that Singh’s relative had demanded Rs 2 crore to reinstate him in the force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4th-fir-likely-against-param-bir-in-bookies-extortion-complaint/articleshow/84742652.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Rs 46.7 crore donated for kid’s SMA treatment||KOZHIKODE: The benevolence showed by Malayalis for the treatment of Mohammed, the one-and-half-year-old kid from Kannur suffering from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), has surpassed all expectations. Instead of the Rs 18 crore the family had hoped to collect through crowd funding for the gene therapy treatment of Mohammed, as much as Rs 46.7 crore has been credited as donation to the bank accounts opened for crowdfunding. The committee formed to raise funds for Mohammed’s treatment as well as his family intend to hand over the excess amount to the treatment of other SMA-affected children. The committee said in a news conference on Sunday that as many as 7.7 lakh people had sent money to the two accounts opened by the committee for the purpose of raising funds for the import of the medicine, Zolgensma, billed as the most expensive medicine in the world. “When we took the statements from both banks, the contributions received for the child’s treatment have reached Rs 46.7 crore. While the highest single amount received was Rs 5 lakh, the lowest amount was Re1,” said MLA M Vijin, who headed the treatment committee. As many as 42 persons had made contributions exceeding Rs 1 lakh. “We hope to provide the excess amount to other SMA-affected children and will take a decision after holding talks with chief minister and health minister. We will make the funds available to the deserving in a transparent manner,” he added. Apart from the amount needed for the treatment of Mohammed, the fund will also be used for the treatment of his sister Afrah, 15, who is also suffering from SMA, as per the advice of the medical board. The committee received the required amount of Rs 18 crore by July 5 and it had asked people to stop sending money, but the funds continued to pour in even after that. Also, Rs 9.19 lakh was received at the office of the committee and house of Mohammed. While the bank account in the Matool branch Kerala Gramin Bank received Rs 19.9 crore, the account in the Federal Bank got donations of Rs 26.7 crore. The steps for the import of the drug Zolgensma are progressing and they hope to receive the medicine in the first week of August itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/rs-46-7cr-donated-for-kids-sma-treatment/articleshow/84740588.cms||---

Three of the four accused have been arrested while one is on the run. The children’s parents were out for a family event in another village and the kids were asleep in the house. Around midnight, the complaint by the girl’s father said, a neighbour jumped on to the roof, entered the room in which they were asleep, gun in his hand, and pointed it at the girl. He then opened the door to let his three friends in — they were also armed with country-made pistols, the complaint added. “The moment they entered, they held my son at gunpoint, threatening to kill him if he raised an alarm.” The girl was then forcefully disrobed, the complaint said, and raped by the four of them in front of her brother, who was warned against making a sound or “he would be killed”. They shot a video of the gangrape, telling the girl that they would “make it go viral” if she complained, her father told the police. “She was unconscious by the time they left.” Her brother called up their parents, who rushed back and were told what had happened. When they confronted the parents of the four boys, an altercation ensued, the complaint said, and the girl’s parents were told they would be killed if they escalated the case. On Saturday, the girl’s father filed a complaint with the police. “An FIR was registered on the basis of the complaint. The girl’s medical examination was done. Five teams have been formed for investigation,” Muzaffarnagar additional SP (rural) Atul Kumar Srivastava said in a video statement on Twitter. The medical report confirmed rape.

Under pressure from the High Court, various government agencies have initiated the process of notifying over 1,450 hectares of mangroves as reserve forests in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). To begin with, Cidco will hand over 219 hectares of mangrove stretches in Kamothe and Panvel to the revenue department to be transferred to the forest department for conservation. Virendra Tiwari, additional chief principal conservator of forests, announced this mangrove transfer at an online discussion organized by NGO NatConnect Foundation. MMRDA has also agreed to transfer 300 hectares of mangroves, Tiwari said. Speaking at the session, Tiwari said JNPT has also agreed in principle to handover the mangroves under it after ascertaining through a high-resolution mapping by Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre (MRSAC). The port has already confirmed in an RTI response to NatConnect that it has over 913 hectares of mangroves under its jurisdiction. The secretary level meeting of revenue, forest and environment departments, attended by two the urban development secretaries, has met on July 13 to review the mangrove transfer status. In a related development, Cidco vice-chairman and managing director Dr Sanjay Mukherjee has asked his teams to quickly transfer mangroves to the forest department without any further delay. The mangrove stretches at Kharghar, Uran, Ulwe and other planes will be handed over in quick stages. Delivering the keynote address, BNHS Director Dr Bivash Pandav appreciated the activists’ pressure on the officials to keep them on their toes. “Otherwise, the system tends to relax,” he observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1450-ha-of-mangroves-in-mmr-to-be-turned-into-reserved-forest/articleshow/84744502.cms||Vijay Singh

While the move comes at a time when several Indian states are putting in place norms to allow home delivery of alcohol, Diageo which invested Rs 27 crore in HipBar through its domestic entity USL for a 26% stake in 2018, is selling back the entire stake to the startup’s promoter Prasanna Natarajan for Rs 52 lakh. Industry insiders attributed Diageo’s hasty retreat to regulatory hurdles and a strong pushback from local liquor retailers that are against online aggregators. When contacted, a Diageo spokesperson said, “While home delivery has opened up in several states since 2020; as is the case in every sector where e-commerce has grown to >1% in India, it will take some years to mature as a model. In addition, the alcobev model is likely to develop quite differently in India to regular e-commerce due to the nature of regulation of this industry.” India’s spirits market, pegged at around $27 billion by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, has recently witnessed e-commerce majors, including Amazon, Flipkart and Swiggy as well as independent platforms such as Tiplur, contemplating making bold inroads into online delivery of alcohol, especially as the Covid-19 pandemic has kept consumers away from markets and shops. “Post investment, the business faced some push back from some pockets of the trade and the state excise department of Karnataka and this matter is still sub-judice,” HipBar founder Prasanna Natarajan told TOI. “HipBar, being an early and solo mover, had to face many regulatory hurdles and challenges to open up home delivery, which it eventually did with states of West Bengal and Odisha. Post Covid, the market dynamics have changed and the more established players are also entering this niche space.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/diageos-home-delivery-plans-hit-exits-hipbar-at-98-loss/articleshow/84745598.cms||John Sarkar

His comment comes against the backdrop of speculations that there could be a change of leadership in the southern state. Yeddiyurappa is “managing the administration well. We don’t see any political crisis in Karnataka,” Nadda said. A few days ago, the Karnataka chief minister, who had strongly denied reports that he would resign, said for the first time that he isn’t sure if he would continue as CM after July 26, the day his government completes two years in office. Nadda also said the allegations pertaining to the Pegasus “snoopgate” are “baseless and issueless”. “As I said, the opposition led by Congress has no issues related to the people, and because of this they are raising such issues,” he said on Sunday, concluding his two-day visit to Goa. He also slammed the opposition for disrupting Parliament. “We are ready for all types of discussion and we are going for it, but Congress, along with other opposition parties, have become so disappointed that they have become issueless, and they don’t understand what they want to do.” He said the opposition parties “don’t have guts for discussions”. Nadda also claimed that the public knows that even after the opposition’s disruptions, Parliament’s productivity has crossed all records under PM Narendra Modi’s “dynamic leadership”. “We will continue working while the opposition follows its own path without issues,” Nadda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-political-crisis-in-karnataka-bsy-govt-functioning-well-says-bjp-prez/articleshow/84744581.cms||Murari Shetye

The body of Sukhram Singh was found in a car on Saturday night on the outskirts of Meerut near Lala Mohammadpur road. Police said that his son, Rohit Singh, took him on a ride before shooting him dead. Passers-by informed police about the car, in which the body was lying, covered in a blanket and a pillow. Police said that Sukhram was also hit in the head before being shot. A forensic team collected the required samples from the car and the body was sent for post-mortem examination on Sunday. “Sukhram’s younger son had died a few years ago. Since then, he has been living with his wife Kusum, daughter Rita and son-in-law Mohit in the city's Kankarkhera area. His elder son Rohit used to think that his father will give away all his property to his daughter,” said SHO of Kankerkhera, Tapeshwar Pal. According to the family of the deceased, Rohit’s “bad habits and poor temperament” had forced his parents to live with their daughter. But on Saturday, Rohit went to meet his father after a long time. Seeing a change in his behaviour, his parents thought that Rohit had changed for the better, a family member said. “Then he urged his father to accompany him to meet his other sister. Sukhram agreed. But it turned out to be his last ride,” a police officer said. “An FIR of murder was filed against Rohit, who is also a father of two children. Another relative, Devendra, has also been named in the FIR. Raids are being made to nab the two accused who are on the run,” said the SHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-takes-father-65-on-a-ride-shoots-him-dead-on-way-in-meerut/articleshow/84738623.cms||Ishita Mishra

Gupta had said that the state government was conducting a death audit of Covid-19 victims but has made no headway as the districts are yet to collect the data. Launching an all-out attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gupta on Friday held the Prime Minister responsible for the deaths of Covid patients for want of oxygen. “PM is solely responsible but former Union health minister Harsh Vardhan was made a scapegoat. The public will not accept this as most of the deaths happened due to shortage of oxygen,” Gupta said. According to the state health department, an order was issued by missoion director (MD), National Health Mission (NHM), to all the districts on June 5 this year to conduct an audit of all Covid deaths reported between April 1 and May 21. However, the district officials are yet to contact the family members of the deceased, let alone submit any report. According to the letter issued by the then MD NHM Ravishankar Shukla, the deputy commissioners of all districts were directed to submit a report after conducting the death audit in their respective districts within seven days. According to the letter, a five-member committee was formed to conduct the audit which is headed by the district reproductive and child health officer (DRCHO) with district surveillance officer, a doctor from medicine department of medical college, district epidemiological officer and district programme manager as its member. This committee was responsible to conduct the audit and send it to the state health department by June 13 according to the order. However, when contacted, Ranchi DRCHO Dr Shashi Bhushan Khalko said, “The members of the committee are preparing the list of Covid deaths from our district and once we finalise it, we will be contacting the patient’s kin too.” Asked about the tentative time for the completion of audit, he expressed his inability to provide a timeframe. Notably, state capital Ranchi has reported the maximum Covid deaths as 1,221 people succumbed to the virus between April 1 and May 21. The total number of deaths due to Covid during that period in the state is 3,646. On being contacted, current MD NHM Umashankar Singh said, “We are yet to receive the reports from a few districts and we have instructed them to complete the exercise at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/jharkhand-cov-death-audit-hits-zero-data-wall/articleshow/84754815.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand heading towards herd immunity: Experts||RANCHI: If the findings of the national sero survey are to be believed, Jharkhand might develop herd immunity ahead of a possible third wave. As per the fourth national sero survey for SARS-Cov-2 released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the general population in the state showed IgG positivity (anti S1-RBD antibodies) to the tune of 55.3% while it touched 80.43% among health workers. As per the document released by ICMR, a total of 1,231 persons were tested for antibodies across three districts from the general population, of which 680 showed the presence of antibodies. While among health workers, 302 persons were tested and 243 had antibodies. The three districts that were selected for the survey are Pakur, Latehar and Simdega. In the general population category, Simdega topped the chart with 65.3% of those surveyed having antibodies while Latehar reported 56.6% and Pakur 44%. In the health worker category, 85% in Latehar have developed antibodies followed by Simdega with 81%, while Pakur reported 77%. Talking to TOI, the director of state TB cell, Dr A Mitra, said: “The findings of the recent sero survey are encouraging as they reflect that the presence of antibodies among the general population as well as the health workers in the state has increased substantially. This will help us to fight the virus.” Dr Mitra further said: “Apart from the national sero surveys, we have also conducted two surveys since the outbreak of the pandemic. During our first sero survey, which was conducted a couple of months after the first case was reported in the state, only 2.15% of the total population had antibodies. During the second survey, which was conducted after the beginning of the second wave, antibodies were found in 35% of the population.” In view of the recent findings, healthcare experts said that Jharkhand have already developed herd immunity. They added that the reasons behind the development of antibodies in a large chunk of population were mass infection during second wave and the ongoing vaccination drive. Talking to TOI, public health expert and professor of preventive and social medicine at Rims Dr Dewesh Kumar said: “We are already headed towards herd immunity and it is a good sign for us as it will help in reducing mortality among patients in the next wave. The severity of the disease, too, will be less in comparison to the earlier waves as a large segment has been infected and has developed antibodies.” On being asked about the possibility of a third wave, Dr Dewesh said: “We cannot comment on the arrival of a third wave. Having said that, it seems that the severity of the infection has gone down due to the development of antibodies among the population,” Dewesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-heading-towards-herd-immunity-experts/articleshow/84741118.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand objects to rail line inside Palamu Tiger Reserve||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government has objected to the Indian Railways’ proposal to lay an 18-km rail line through the core area of Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR) stating that it will adversely affect the ecosystem of the sanctuary and the habitat of its animals. On February 18 this year, the railways had submitted a proposal to the state department of forests, environment and wildlife, seeking wildlife clearance for the laying a stretch of the third broad gauge line inside PTR. The new line, which is 291-km long, will connect Patratu in Ramgarh district of Jharkhand with Sonnnagar station in Aurangabad district in Bihar. Of the total length, an 18-km stretch will cross through the PTR’s core area. Notified in 1973, the PTR is Jharkhand’s only tiger haven. However, the tiger population in the reserve has been dwindling for over a decade. Surveyors did not find the presence of any tiger during the last national tiger census in 2018. On April 16, principal chief conservator of forests, Wildlife, (PCCF-WL) Rajiv Ranjan had objected to the proposal stating that the third broad gauge line will have an adverse effect on the fragile ecological landscape of the PTR and negatively impact the recovery and persistence of various endangered animal species, including tigers. In his remarks, Ranjan also pointed out that there were scopes for the Indian Railways to explore an alternative route for its new track that would not fall in the core area. Subsequently, chief secretary Sukhdev Singh wrote a letter to the Railway Board Chairman on April 29 and recommended that the railways and the state forests department may jointly undertake an exercise to explore an alternative route bypassing the PTR’s core area. While the government formally made its stand clear to the Railway Board, it is all set to turn down the wildlife clearance petition by the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) in the state wildlife board meeting, scheduled to take place early next month. The state board is headed by the chief minister and consists of forest officials and wildlife experts. “There are already two railway lines passing through the PTR’s core area. Then there are human settlements, the presence of Left-wing extremists and security personnel. All these have badly affected the habitat of animals, including tigers. The railway lines are busy and regularly cause animal accidents. They have also fragmented the habitat, which in turn is hindering the movement of the animals and dwindled the prey base. A new wall will further worsen the scenario,” Ranjan told TOI. Besides tigers, the PTR is home to Indian gaur, leopards, cheetal, sambhar, wild bear, elephants and other endangered species. Besides the railway line, the state board also aims to deviate an 8-km stretch of the 80-km long state highway (SH-09) connecting Kutmu-Garu and Mahuadarn in the Latehar district from the PTR’s core area. Of the 80 km road, nearly 36 km will pass through the PTR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-objects-to-rail-line-inside-ptr/articleshow/84741199.cms||Dhritiman Ray

But many in the state unit, which is going through a turbulent phase owing to infighting, has blamed the central leadership for allowing many motor-mouthed MLAs to bypass state leadership and constantly speak ill about the ruling regime in public, violating party discipline. Notably, about a half a dozen MLAs of the Congress, including some first-timers, have long been openly speaking against the state leadership and goverment. In the recent weeks, many had even headed to Delhi to meet central leadership to lobby for various demands. A top party office bearer on anonymity said, “Infighting within the party is natural but the onus of controlling it lies with the central leadership. Going by the way things have panned out in recent weeks, most importantly the way a few MLAs are openly attempting to derail the party here, the central leadership must be questioned on their silence. Controlling it immediately is imperative in the interest of the government.” Another leader cited how the party faced serious problems in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan among others in recent years. “In MP, party infighting drove us out of power despite winning the elections. Today, the BJP managed to form the government. In Rajasthan too, the Congress government came under serious threat. Look at the way things panned out in Punjab,” he said, adding that while an MLA or party worker cannot be banned from meeting the high command or air their grievances, often going public is what has become a serious problem in Jharkhand now. Party president Rameshwar Oraon, who is also the state finance minister, speaking to TOI, however, said their coalition government is strong enough to tide over any adverse situation. “As far as our MLA strength is concerned, we are intact. Yes, some may have a few issues or ambitions but those are natural for any individual. Whenever anyone approaches state or central leadership with their problems, the party always works towards sorting them out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/high-command-should-stop-infighting-in-state-party-unit/articleshow/84741013.cms||ASRP Mukesh

As you look back, what has been the biggest learning from it?Operation Vijay was a blend of determined political, military and diplomatic action, which enabled us to transform an adverse situation into an emphatic military and diplomatic victory. Pakistan failed in its aims with considerable political and military costs. The Indian military, on account of poor intelligence and inadequate surveillance, took some time to reorganise and take appropriate counter action. But with military successes on the battlefield and a successful politico-military strategy, India was able to achieve its political aim and enhance its international image as a responsible, democratic nation, determined and capable of defending its territorial integrity. Read AlsoKargil Vijay Diwas: Father of Kargil hero recalls India's triumph of 'toughest war'LUCKNOW: As India celebrates Kargil Vijay Diwas on Monday, Gopichand Pandey, father of late Captain Manoj Pandey said that the Kargil War was one of the toughest wars in the world where the enemy has an advantage of the altitude, but Indian Army fought hard and reclaimed our peaks. Speaking to ANI,It was a lesson to see that an irregular or proxy war could escalate into a limited conventional war. Although possession of nuclear weapons has made an all-out war on the subcontinent less likely, so long as we have border and territorial disputes, Kargil-type military conflicts cannot be ruled out. The Kargil war also highlighted several weaknesses in the Higher Defence Control Organisation (HDCO), our state of intelligence and surveillance, weapons and equipment. These were noted by the Kargil Review Committee and the Group of Ministers report. Read AlsoKargil war veteran became India’s first Blade RunnerOn July 15 this year, I completed 22 years of my loaned life and cut the customary cake that reads: “Happy Death anniversary and rebirth day”. It was on this day in 1999 when, as part of Operation Vijay, I was commanding a protective post on the LOC in Kargil's Akhnoor sector and a mortar bomb fellHow did Kargil change India's outlook towards Pakistan?It was a major turning point in Indo-Pak security relations. There was near total breakdown of trust and a realisation in India that Pakistan can easily resile from any agreement, like the Lahore Declaration which it had signed only two months earlier. It was a big shock to Prime Minister Vajpayee (and the cabinet) who took quite some time to believe that the intruders were not Pakistani irregulars but Pakistan regular army personnel. Vajpayee told Nawaz Sharif: ‘Aapne pith men chhura ghonp diya’ (You have stabbed me in the back).

On the 22nd anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas, TOI talks to them about those final missives. Last letter and body arrive home togetherWith the benefit of hindsight what do you think India could have done differently?When the war began, we were reacting to a total ‘surprise situation’ created by Pakistan. Due to intelligence and surveillance failure, there was considerable confusion about the identity of the intruders within the government. Our frontline formation had failed to detect intrusion and had no clues on their location. Therefore, getting adequate information, stabilising the situation and then regaining the initiative became essential. After some time when the Indian armed forces were confident of military success in Kargil, they should have been allowed to capture some Pakistani territory across the LoC before agreeing to the ceasefire. Read Also‘His words Yeh Dil Maange More still reverberate’It was in 1992 that my elder brother Vikram (he was the elder twin by 14 minutes) and I got admission into DAV College, Sector 10, Chandigarh. We were excited about experiencing hostel life. Even before coming to Chandigarh, we were in awe of the men in military uniform as our school was inside theSince there was an element of surprise, there was a lot of jugaad required. What were some of these on-the-spur-of-the moment innovations?Some years before Kargil, we had been starved of funds. As a result, we were functioning on 70% of our authorised budget. In the Kargil sector, we did not have clothing or shoes that were required for high altitude. We did not have surveillance devices or radars. In order to see what is going on the other side, our helicopters would go to 20,000 ft altitude to be able to see for themselves. Today, you have satellite photography and UAVs for that. One of the artillery commanders even decided to take the Bofors gun uphill in three pieces, one by one and place them on a height so that soldiers could take direct shots at the enemy. This is how we tried to overcome whatever shortages that we had. If there was another 26/11 kind of attack, do you think India’s response would be different in view of the Uri and Balakot strikes?I had retired when 26/11 took place but even then I was of the opinion that India needs to retaliate. If Pakistan creates such a situation again, we should retaliate. And we should retaliate strongly. It would be a deterrent and I think Pakistan requires deterrence from time to time. What kind and what type of retaliation that is for the military and politicians to decide on. Do you think in such a situation where Pakistan continues to show duplicity that we should continue talking to them?They are neighbours and they will remain so. I don't believe that you should have a permanent policy of not talking to them. You have to be flexible in your policies. There should be no appeasement at all. And our talks should progress on the basis of ground realities. Any good memories from that time?While my main work was to strategise in Delhi, I would visit the frontline every sixth day. It was always very heartening to speak to the men and the officers. They always said ‘don't worry, sir, we will do it.’ Nobody ever said that this is a difficult task, or that we have some major problems. In contrast I would encounter long faces among politicians and my own colleagues in Delhi. So to raise my own morale I would go to the front, to be with the boys.

Board, in its circular dated July 15, 2021, advised all the tea producers’ bodies and planters in the country to comply strictly with the order or face action. Although the Tea Board claims that this circular would help “make the auction system robust and bring stability in the price realisation process”, producers are not very happy about the move. Azam Monem, wholetime director of bulk tea producer McLeod Russel, told TOI that producers are fetching better prices outside auctions and this cash-strapped lot will naturally be more interested to take that route. “After all, it is a buyers’ market as they demand more customised and quality tea through private sales. Large producers are already under pressure owing to the auction market crash, high wages, weak retail sales in lockdown and drought. This new order might make life more difficult for them,” he added. The Tea Board, in this regard, has conducted a detailed analysis of the auction participation for the last two years and noticed that the manufacturers are not sending at least 50% of their tea through public auctions. “In case of non-compliance with the above stated order, action will be initiated by the Tea Board as per the provision of the Tea (Marketing) Control Order (TMCO), 2003,” says the circular signed by Tea Board secretary Rishikesh Rai. Notably, after the order was issued for the first time on October 1, 2015, under section 30 of the Tea Act, 1953, almost the entire industry, including producers and buyers, had voiced their opposition, and the Board had kept its plan on a dormant mode. Now, the planters are at a loss trying to figure out what prompted the Board to revive the order amid inadequate output and price fall. Indian Tea Association (ITA) secretary Sujit Patra said: “Producers have put in efforts and spent money to ensure their products get directly sold at a remunerative price and cash flows quickly, which the present auction system does not facilitate. If it is an experiment, it is detrimental for the tea industry. It doesn’t offer any protection against continuous price fall. Tea board should rather implement and ensure a minimum floor price above cost of production to arrest free fall for all teas.” A tea garden owner who doesn’t want to be named said: “This is discriminatory. If there is no stipulation on the buyers then there should be no such mandatory stipulation on the sellers.” However, the umbrella organisation of the small tea growers’ body Cista has welcomed the new order of the Tea Board. “This order will enhance the transparency of price realisation,” said Bijoy Gopal Chakraborty, president, Cista.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/big-planters-flay-tea-boards-50-auction-order/articleshow/84741000.cms||Sovon Manna
---||Business||Reforms help banks recover Rs 5.5 lakh crore of bad debt: Govt||NEW DELHI: The steps taken by the government over the last few years — from enacting Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC)and strengthening other laws to administrative measures — have helped banks recover around Rs 5.5 lakh crore of bad debt, including close to Rs 1 lakh crore from accounts that had been technically written off, top officials said. And, with indications that the build-up of non-performing assets (NPAs) is lower than anticipated, especially among large companies, the government believes that state-run lenders are well poised to meet the credit requirements, given that they are adequately capitalised. Besides, government sources argued that with provision coverage ratio of 83.7%, public sector banks were adequately protected against any potential hit. “Overall, despite the pandemic, the turnaround is remarkable for public sector banks. The recent reforms and the proposed asset reconstruction company will help clean up their balance sheets further and make fresh capital available from the sale of bad assets, which will again push credit growth,” a senior finance ministry officer said.While there has been discussion around “write off” of over Rs 8 lakh crore during the last seven years, the government believes that these are technical in nature and are actually meant to bring about transparency in bank balance sheets. “This is done in accordance with the provisioning norms fixed by RBI that the potential losses are recognised in the books. Even if a loan has been written off, banks make every attempt to recover it,” the high-ranking officer said. The source added that these efforts have resulted in Rs 99,996 crore being recovered from such written off loan accounts, which included some major recoveries through the IBC process in case of Bhushan Steel, Bhushan Power & Steel, Essar Steel, among others. Separately, banks have managed to recover money from other write-off cases such as Kingfisher. Since March, 2018, the government-owned lenders have recovered Rs 3.1 lakh crore. Sources said that banks have used multiple sources — internal accruals, fund raising from the market and capital infusion by the government — to comply with the regulatory requirements. “Internal accruals and market raising account for as much as 70% of the provisioning done during the last few years,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/reforms-help-banks-recover-rs-5-5-lakh-crore-of-bad-debt-govt/articleshow/84745709.cms||Sidhartha

This will enable low and middle-income borrowers improved access to finance while supporting the country’s climate goals. According to Renu Sud Karnad, Managing Director – HDFC the loan will help deepen HDFC’s footprint in financing more affordable smart and green homes. “This partnership with IFC covering both themes Affordable & Green housing, we hope, will materially further our outreach," she said. IFC has invested $920mn in housing finance companies. According to its estimates, there is a $1.25 trillion opportunity in green residential housing up to the year 2020. “With most banks and housing finance companies in India still at the stage of evolving their business models to lend to lower-income people, this investment should send a clear demonstration that green affordable housing is viable and needed, especially as India moves on the road to recovery from the impacts of COVID-19,” said Hector Gomez Ang, Regional Director for South Asia at IFC. HDFC has earmarked at least 25% of this financing for green affordable housing which reduces energy consumption and has a smaller carbon footprint. A joint statement said that the transaction is aimed at changing the positioning of green housing as a concept for the luxury market to include affordable housing. IFC has estimated that 275 million people – or 22 per cent of India’s population – don’t have access to adequate housing, spurred by rapid urbanization and the lack of affordable housing finance. “Recent estimates suggest the urban housing shortage was 29 million units in 2018, increasing by over 54 per cent since 2012. The rural housing shortage is estimated to be twice that of urban areas,” a statement from the two partners said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ifc-extends-250-million-to-hdfc-for-green-affordable-housing/articleshow/84745690.cms||---

---||Noida||Two enter Noida sump well to fetch cricket ball, die||NOIDA: Two youths chasing a cricket ball that had fallen into a sump well in Sector 6 died allegedly after inhaling poisonous gas coming out of it on Sunday morning. An e-rickshaw driver and a friend of the two youths, who, too, climbed down the well to save them, are battling for life in Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital. Police said the youths were playing cricket in a park adjacent to the compound of the sump well, managed by the Noida Authority. When a ball hit by the batsman cleared the park’s boundary wall and fell into the well, Sandeep (22), a labourer in Sector 11 area, entered the compound and climbed down the ladder into the pit. He fell unconscious soon after. Vishal (27), a supervisor at a private company in Sector 8, also climbed down the well to rescue Sandeep. But he also fell unconscious. When the two youths did not come out after a few minutes, Haider, an e-rickshaw driver waiting for passengers, entered the well. Rakesh, a member of the cricket team, went behind him. Munish Chauhan, the SHO of Sector 20 police station, said they got a call around 6.30am. “A police team rushed to the spot along with fire department personnel. It took us 30 minutes to bring out the four youths. They were rushed to the District Hospital, where Sandeep and Vishal were declared dead on arrival. The two others were referred to Safdarjung hospital,” he added. Sources said Sandeep, who was fielding near the boundary wall, chased the ball as it entered the compound of the sump well. He scaled the boundary wall and climbed down the ladder into the well, a portion of which was uncovered.  “Vishal went behind him. When Sandeep shouted for help, Vishal descended into the well to see what had happened. But, Both of them fell unconscious,” said Durgesh, a witness to the incident. Jeevach Shanti, Sandeep’s brother-in-law, said the Noida Authority should keep its sump wells fully covered, pointing out that poisonous gases often come out of the waste lying inside. RP Singh, an engineer in the Noida Authority, ruled out any fault on their part. He said the youths had scaled a 9ft wall to enter the compound and the pump operator had warned them against going near the pit. “But they ignored his warning and descended into the well. It was Balram Singh, the pump operator, who pulled them out with help from the police and the fire department personnel,” he added. Neha Sharma, additional CEO of the Authority, inspected the place later in the day and directed officials to increase the height of the wall and the iron fence around the well. Additional DCP Ranvijay Singh said both the bodies had been sent for autopsy and the reports were awaited. Police suspect the youths may have drowned in the waste water after inhaling the poisonous gas and losing consciousness. So far, none of the families has come forward to lodge any complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2-enter-sump-well-to-fetch-cricket-ball-die/articleshow/84744695.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Business||‘Government needs to act if consumption slows’||MUMBAI: After two waves of the pandemic and currently tackling cost headwinds, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has said quite assertively it will navigate the third wave as well. Armed with a portfolio of brands straddling the price and pack pyramid, the one game HUL knows how to play is managing the price-value equation to retain consumers in its franchise. The FMCG major’s CMD Sanjiv Mehta maintains that the focus of the company is volume-led growth. He also wants HUL to deliver a modest improvement on margins__a balancing act indeed__even as an untiring Mehta continues to 're-imagine' HUL from his home office, visiting factories and engaging with multiple stakeholders `virtually’. What Mehta, however, misses is the energy of the marketplace and the buzz of the office. While he admits there will continue to be a good balance on how organisations would work in the future, he warns against writing the obituary of the office. Excerpts: Q: Do you miss the office? What’s the way forward?A:Innovations need Collaboration. You need people to physically sit around, discuss, debate and brainstorm. The future of work is not going to be either or. There will be a good balance. Not all the people will be required to come to work every day. And the crazy travel of the past will also reduce. But don't write the obituary of the office and physical interactions. It would be a fatal mistake. One is now looking forward to physical meetings. I still do my factory visits virtually but it’s not the same. We do consumer engagements, but it’s still not a substitute for going to consumer homes. We would visit their kitchens and bathrooms and you can't do all that now! It was also about being with your sales teams, working the markets, and then having a nice meal in the evening, where they would let their hair down and express themselves. All that one misses Q: Has the resilience of rural markets surprised you? Why is the urban market taking time to recover? A:We should applaud the government for the intervention they did in rural India. Two-thirds of Indians live in rural India, which also has a large section of poor. The interventions in terms of MNREGA outlay, direct transfer of subsidy and free supply of food grains have been the right steps. These are some of the prime reasons why rural growth has remained resilient. Also, the first wave did not impact rural, the monsoons were decent, and the harvest was good. The per capita consumption of FMCG products in rural areas is 1/3 that of urban. Given the low base, the growth rates in rural should consistently remain higher than urban. If it slows down, then it becomes a big concern, because that would mean we are not lifting the poor. Growth in FMCG is in many ways reflective of the state of the economy. However, for the urban poor, there have been no interventions like direct transfer of money or free supply of food grains. The government should use technology and be able to identify the urban poor. And if economic hardships come in, they should be in a position to intervene. The more pointed and direct the intervention, the more beneficial will be the effect. Q: Do you expect the government to come up with further incentives, given that the festive season is also around the corner? A:On the supply side the government has taken series of steps including ensuring liquidity in the economy and providing support through guarantees. What remains to be done is on the demand side. Demand-side government hesitation could also stem from the thinking that if you put money directly in the hands of people, will they consume or will they save? With the rural poor, since their propensity to save is so little that whatever you give them, they are likely to spend it all. This should also be applicable to the urban poor. FICCI had given a very good suggestion to the government about using consumption vouchers and that's something which has been used in the past in other parts of the world. And importantly consumption would also lead to more taxes. So, the net cost to the government would be less than the benefit provided to the people to spur consumption. These are some kinds of novel things the government could experiment with if consumption comes under strain. The September quarter of this year will be very important. We've just come out of the second wave and are moving towards normalcy. If consumption remains robust, then the government will not have to intervene more. But if consumption remains tepid, then the government will have to do some serious thinking about what further interventions are required to spur consumption. Q: What are the shifts in consumption patterns that you're seeing today? A:In the initial period of the pandemic, we had seen a move towards small packs and had also noticed that there were more frequent shopping trips by the poor whereas the higher income people were moving towards larger packs. We must also appreciate that in ecommerce, higher value density provides better unit economics. After that, we have not seen a very discernible change. But where the restricted mobility has impacted us, is in what we call as discretionary and out-of-home (OOH) categories - skincare, deos, color cosmetics, ice cream and our food solutions business. To give you a picture, if in the June quarter of 2019, the sales of these businesses put together, which are of reasonable size for us, were 100, it came down to 50% in June quarter 2020 and in June quarter of 2021, it has moved up to 75%. It has not fully recovered yet, as it is directly linked to mobility of people. Q: You have defended discretionary categories for their attractiveness. But does it worry you that consumers may be getting habituated to not consuming these products?A:No, it doesn’t worry me. It does take a knocking when mobility of people comes down but as the mobility starts to improve, we see a quick bounce back. One of the parameters we look at is penetration. Take for example skincare - I'm very happy with the improvement in penetration. These are categories which remain structurally very attractive, and we have leading positions in them. Q: You’ve spoken about a focus on volume led growth, but with community cost pressures, would you keep a tight leash on price increases to ensure volume growth?A:What is the game we play as HUL? These are unprecedented times, and it will require playing the different levers of business smartly. But we play the game for the long term, and the three imperatives are – we don't want to lose the consumers or market share, we want to keep the price value equation and we want to maintain the sanctity of our business model. That’s how we are going to play. Q: Is naturals still a trend?A:Naturals is a secular trend. Our Indulekha brand both in terms of Oils and Shampoos is doing extremely well. On Ayush, we are focusing primarily on the southern markets. To strengthen our position in the naturals we have launched Simple and last year we had launched Nature Protect in the Home Care categories. The Naturals trend is not something which is going to go away. Q: Patanjali has said that in five years it will overtake HUL..A:Someone had said this five year back that by 2020, they will become bigger than HUL. Well, they did not and will not beat HUL, certainly not in my time and under my watch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-needs-to-act-if-consumption-slows/articleshow/84745759.cms||Namrata Singh

The country recorded over 2.7 lakh new cases in the week at a daily average of around 38,000, marginally less than the 38,548 recorded during July 12-18. In the previous two weeks, Covid cases had seen a fall of 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively. The main factor behind the plateauing of positive cases in the country was the accelerating numbers being reported from Kerala, and to a lesser degree, from the northeast. Kerala recorded 1,10,593 fresh cases in the last seven days, registering a sharp 15.7% surge over the previous week. This was also the first time in seven weeks that any state in the country had reported over 1 lakh fresh cases in a week ending Sunday. Kerala accounted for over 41% of all cases in the country in the current week. Meanwhile, there was finally some positive news coming from Maharashtra, where cases had been falling at a snail’s pace for the past four weeks. This week, the state recorded its sharpest drop in infections in five weeks, with cases falling by 10%. The country recorded 6,848 deaths during the wee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/just-1-2-dip-in-weekly-covid-cases-as-kerala-numbers-surge/articleshow/84745840.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

---||India||For Kargil kin, memories are made of faded inland letters||A few hurried lines scrawled on an inland are among the most treasured possessions for families of soldiers who were martyred in the Kargil war. On the 22nd anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas, TOI talks to them about those final missives. Last letter and body arrive home togetherLance Naik Ranbir SinghMartyred June 16, 1999 Regiment 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles The thrill of impending fatherhood pours out from Lance Naik Ranbir Singh’s last letter to his family living in Alama village in Punjab’s Gurdaspur district. The 33-year-old had promised to throw a lavish party when his wife Savita had their son. Singh’s letter reassures his mother, “Mataji meri fikar nahin karna, bas apni sehat ka khayal rakhna. Hum sab theek thak hai. Hamari pariksha ka time hai (Mother, do not worry about me, just take care of your health. It is a test for us).” In a tragic coincidence, martyr Ranbir Singh’s body and his last letter arrived at his village on June 19, 1999. “His colleagues told us that he had written this letter around 9 am on June 16, and three hours later he died,” Savita said. She has displayed the letter on the living room wall. “My husband had made preparations to celebrate his son’s birth, but instead he left us forever.” ‘My daughter would have forgotten me’Sepoy Buta SinghMartyred May 28, 1999 Regiment 14 Sikh For Amritpal Kaur, who was barely 21 when she was widowed, the last two letters from Sepoy Buta Singh are what have helped her get through some difficult times. One starts with the romantic ‘I love you’ for his wife of just over three years. The soldier, from the 14 Sikh regiment, was emotional at missing milestones in his baby daughter, Komal Preet’s life. “Komal tan hun poora boldi hovegi, mainu bhul gei hovegi, Komal da poora khayal rakhna. Komal nu laad naal padhana (Komal might be speaking properly now, she might have forgotten me. Please take care of her. Get her educated),” he wrote on May 4. Buta, 26, was part of the advance party sent to Kargil. His letters reached the family in Danewala village in Punjab’s Mansa, 10 days before his martyrdom. Son fulfils Havildar’s last wishHavildar Mahavir Singh Martyred July 5 Regiment 17 Jat Havildar Mahavir Singh hesitantly broached the topic of marriage in his last letter to his son, Karan Singh Boora, who was undergoing military training in Bareilly, UP. Mahavir, a havildar in 17 Jat regiment, wrote on April 16: “If you don’t mind, I wanted to share with you that I have finalised a girl for your marriage. But don’t worry, we will not marry you till you complete your Class XII.” Unfortunately, the 40-year-old soldier attained martyrdom even before his son could complete his military training. His unit, which moved to Kargil's Mushkoh valley a few days after the letter, was assigned the task to push the enemy out from Pimple complex (Point 4875). In the fierce battle, Mahavir had lost his life on July 5. He was awarded the Sena Medal. Karan took his father’s words as his last wish. Two years later he married the girl Mahavir had picked for him. Wife’s letter stayed unreadMajor Rajesh Singh Adhikari Martyred May 30 Regiment attachment with 18 Grenadiers The Major kept his wife’s last letter unopened in his uniform’s breast pocket to focus on recapturing the Tololing feature in Kargil. The 28-year-old eventually sacrificed his life in the operation. The unread letter was handed over to his family along with his body on June 14, 1999. “After winning the Battle of Tololing, when the Indian Army recovered his body 13 days later, the unopened letter was found. Adhikari had decided to read the letter in peace, but was not destined to do so,” said Brigadier Khushal Thakur (retd), who was the commanding officer of 18 Grenadiers. On the fateful day Adhikari was 50 metres short of Tololing Top when he was hit by machine gun fire and injured. He crawled up and lobbed a hand grenade inside the bunker, killing four Pakistani soldiers. In the ensuing firefight, a bullet hit him on the chest, and he died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-kargil-kin-memories-are-made-of-faded-inland-letters/articleshow/84745835.cms||---
---||Goa||El Nino disrupts monsoon cycle more than La Nina: NIO scientists||PANAJI: While climate change is producing catastrophically heavier rainfall in fewer hours, scientists at the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) have found that break spells in India during unfavourable El Nino conditions are longer and more frequent than in La Nina years. In a phenomenon called El Nino, warming of sea surface temperatures in eastern equatorial Pacific, near the Peru coast — or the cooling effect in the same region called La Nina — affects the Indian southwest monsoon negatively or positively. The study by Shivananda Pai, Lata Sridhar and M R Ramesh Kumar on ‘Active and break events of Indian summer monsoon during 1901-2014’ was published in Climate Dynamics some years ago. Recently, it has been updated till 2020. The scientists have crunched figures to stretch the study related to peak season conditions and dry spells every July and August to 120 years. In all, there were 28 El Nino years and 24 La Nina years during the last 120 years. “The active and break spells of various durations during these years (both phenomena) show similar distribution with spells of short durations being more frequent than those of long durations. However, break spells of long duration are more frequent during El Nino years than the La Nina years,” the study states. During El Nino years, there were 297 break days as against 172 during La Nina years, 193 active days, as compared to 183 during La Nina. “This works out to an average of 10.6 El Nino break days and 7.17 La Nina break days and 6.9 El Nino and 7.63 La Nina active days per season respectively,” Kumar, a meteorologist stated. The recent wet spell in Goa has yielded more than 700mm — about 70% of the July rainfall — in less than ten days, after a weak monsoon produced 350mm in 20 days. In Germany, it was reported that, in a rare episode, rainfall that would occur in two months fell in just a few hours, as rivers burst their banks in many places. In an earlier study, Kumar meteorologist had found that analysis of daily rainfall data over India during 1951-2007 revealed “an increased propensity in the occurrence of monsoon-breaks of more than one week over the subcontinent”. “The increasing trend is seen both in the duration and frequency of monsoon-breaks over the subcontinent,” his paper stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/el-nino-disrupts-monsoon-cycle-more-than-la-nina-nio-scientists/articleshow/84742479.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Broken butterfly clamp caused ceiling to collapse’||MARGAO: A day after two persons sustained injuries in the false ceiling collapse incident at the South Goa district hospital, Margao, Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC), the government agency that undertook the execution of the hospital project, engaged its contractors to repair the damaged portion of the false ceiling. The repair work was completed by Sunday afternoon. General manager of GSIDC , Jude Carvalho told TOI that one of the butterfly clamps of the false ceiling had given way, which led to the collapse on Saturday evening. “Butterfly clamps are used to hold the panels of the false ceiling in alignment. When even a single clamp fails, the panels lose their alignment leading to their collapse. The fault was detected and rectified and the false ceiling restored. All other butterfly clamps were checked and found to be okay,” Carvalho said, adding that corrosion of the clamp largely led to its failure. Sources said that rain water leakage through the roof possibly led to its corrosion. A lady patient and a multi-task staff (MTS) member were injured after a portion of the false ceiling of the hospital’s Covid ward came crashing down Saturday evening. The false ceiling hit the patient’s hand as it collapsed, owing to which she suffered a blunt impact, and the MTS worker also sustained minor injuries on her elbow. The few other patients in the Covid ward had a providential escape, as the panel that gave way spanned across four beds of the ward. Following the incident the Covid ward was shifted to the lower floor of the hospital complex. Carvalho said that though there wasn’t any threat to the false ceiling any more, the contractor has been asked to inspect the roof for any water leakages and submit a report to the GSIDC within 15 days. Pointing out that polycarbonate roofing sheets were used in some areas of the hospital roof by the earlier contractor with a view to providing natural lighting, Carvalho said that such sheets were, however, found to be unsuitable for Goa’s climate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/broken-butterfly-clamp-caused-ceiling-to-collapse/articleshow/84742472.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Two key masterminds in Kaushalya Nagar murder cases were on ‘good behaviour’ bond||NAGPUR: Shivam Gurudev alias Shaktiman and Nishant Ghodeshwar, key perpetrators in the Swayam Nagrale murder case at Kaushalya Nagar last week, were on a ‘good behaviour bond’ after preventive action was initiated against them in 2020 due to their crime record. Shaktiman is fighting for his life after a counter attack by Nagrale’s friend while Nishant has been granted police custody remand till July 28 by the court on Sunday. The court premises turned into a fortress when the goons were being produced amid heavy police protection. Police have also arrested six people, most having criminal records, for having assaulted Shaktiman a day after Nagrale’s murder. They too were granted custody remand till July 28 after being produced before the court on Sunday. Pritam Kamble, who was behind assaulting Shaktiman, had a murder case against him in the past. Another accused, Sunil Wankhede, too had assault cases against him. Suresh Kamble, also arrested for attacking Shaktiman, had a kidnapping case against him. Police said the three others, Abhijeet Ghodeshwar, Birju Shinde and Akash Manohar, did not have any crime record. “Preventive action was initiated against all those persons who had criminal records in both the cases. No commoner was behind the attack. The perpetrators either had criminal records or an anti-social mindset,” said senior inspector Vinod Choudhuri of Ajni police station. Choudhari also denied any gambling activities being the reason behind the murder. “We are not denying gambling activities but they were among some senior citizens who are basically idle and resort to such activities to kill time. The murder took place due to heated arguments among the youngsters trying to dominating each other under the influence of liquor,” said the PI. Sources had earlier stated that Nagrale was against gambling activities encouraged by Shaktiman which had led to the dispute. Zonal DCP Akshay Shinde said combing operations were conducted in Kaushalya Nagar. “We prepared a list of criminals residing in Kaushalya Nagar and their houses were searched thoroughly. Foot patrolling was carried out and police pickets were set up at different places,” he said. “Not only Kaushalya Nagar but even the slums of the adjoining localities have been brought under the radar and surveillance of the police,” said the DCP. “No weapons were found during the night long drives but some raids on illegal activities had taken place,” said Shinde. “We have decided to keep the police bandobast in place at Kaushalya Nagar for some more days until we decide otherwise. There would be a watch on the movement and activities in these areas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-key-masterminds-in-kaushalya-nagar-murder-cases-were-on-good-behaviour-bond/articleshow/84740170.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Sun shines over Goa after nearly fortnight of rain||PANAJI: People received some respite from the dreary weather as the sun shone on Sunday after nearly a fortnight of furious rain. The low pressure area weather system has shifted to Madhya Pradesh owing to which there is going to be no significant impact over Goa, the India meteorological department (IMD) said. “Though there were occasional spells of rain, it was still sunnier and the temperature was two to three degrees higher than what it was in the last week’s overcast conditions. This weather will continue for a few days,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. There is, however, an offshore trough running from Karnataka to Kerala, which could extend up to the Maharashtra-Goa coast. This may bring some isolated heavy rainfall over Goa. There is a low pressure area expected to form over the North Bay of Bengal by July 28. “The location of this low pressure area is going to determine how the rainfall activity is going to increase after July 28,” Rahul said. There are initial indications that this weather system may not have as significant an impact as the previous low pressure area, he said. So far, the wettest day as per the state average rainfall was July 18, with 132.9mm of rainfall received within 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sun-shines-over-goa-after-nearly-fortnight-of-rain/articleshow/84742524.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Goa||Goa: Mangrove loss could trigger coastal flooding, say experts||PANAJI: Goa’s hinterland has been left battered by the worst floods the state has seen in forty years. As July 26 is observed as World Mangrove Day, experts warn that the state’s coast could also face similar flooding if encroachments on mangrove forest patches are not prevented. At present, Goa does not even have a correct assessment of its mangrove cover. And though legislations call for compensatory reforestation of mangrove patches cleared for constructions, replantation of mangroves does not get as much importance as forest trees. “When Canacona taluka had to face the 2009 floods, people living in the coastal areas of Mashem and Galgibaga fully understood the importance of mangroves in their locality. It is seen that because there is not much awareness about mangroves, people exploit them. Many cut them for firewood and others are just ignorant about their existence,” said Chandralekha Damodar Mestri, member of the Mangrove Society of India, which has its base in Goa with professors, scientists and laymen as members spread across the country. Goa houses 16 mangrove species and is considered to have among the best mangrove forests in the country. The patches found in Chorao Island have most of the species found in Goa, Mestri said. Yet, awareness about the importance of the mangrove ecosystem is not among the best in the country. “The roots of mangrove trees are a dense tangle and act like netting, which traps sediments and arrests soil erosion. It roots allow the trees to handle the daily rise and fall of tides. The roots also slow the movement of tidal waters. Together, this mechanism help minimise the effects of flooding,” said Vinod Dhargalkar, executive member of Mangrove Society of India. The mangrove ecosystem is also believed to help mitigate the effects of global warming. “Mangroves help stabilize the coast and beaches. They protect land from tidal surges and cyclonic storms,” said Mestri. The society believes it is time local bodies take up preservation of mangroves with seriousness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mangrove-loss-could-trigger-coastal-flooding-say-experts/articleshow/84742559.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Goa||Goa: Livestock hit, animals drown, get washed away||PANAJI: The devastating floods Goans experienced because of torrential rain and opening of dam gates, not only displaced the people of rural Goa, but also caused great loss of livestock. A Valpoi-based cattle shelter has lost 50 animals after they drowned in the floods, while medicine, dry fodder and other equipment worth lakhs of rupees has been lost. Several other animals are missing and the search to find them is ongoing. The gaushala was sheltering 495 animals. “The estimated value of the cattle we have lost is 14 lakh in addition to which fodder worth Rs 4 lakh is lost. There was also damage to our refrigerator and milk products,” said Hanumant Parab. While the animals are usually kept tied to the shed, Parab said that they were released by 3am after water started entering the shed. However, the water levels increased so much that they were flooded with almost two metres of water. “Gaushala workers and some villagers came to help rescue the animals, but they couldn’t. We mostly lost bulls and a few cows. The buffaloes are safe. Many of the bovines are injured due to the flood, but we have not noticed any infection, so far. The live cattle have been washed away to as far as 2km and we are tracking them and bringing them back to the shelter,” Parab said. Majority of the animals housed in the gaushala were stray cattle and animals rescued after road accidents. A team of veterinary doctors is carrying out verification to make an inventory of the lost animals. The fire services control room also received a few calls for animal rescue on July 23. However, not all were calls for flood rescue. A calf fallen into a nullah in Vasco, a cow fallen into a trench in Curchorem and two animals hit in an accident on the highway in Canacona were rescued by the officers that day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/livestock-hit-animals-drown-get-washed-away/articleshow/84742590.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Goa||Some parts of Tiswadi get water supply||Ponda: Though the Opa water works had begun work on war footing to restore supply, delay in receiving motors has hit restoration. Motors were expected to be received by early Sunday morning and water supply was expected to be resumed the same evening. PWD minister Deepak Pauskar, who visited the plant to take stock of the situation, said that the loss is estimated at Rs 70 lakh. Due to submersion in flood waters, pumps, motors, and their spare parts had to be replaced. Additionally, after submersion, motors need to be heated up for around 10 to 12 hours before they can be made operational. Since such a facility is not available in Ponda, the plant’s four motors were sent to Vasco for heating up. Officials of the water division were expecting that they would receive the motors by early Sunday morning. However, PWD managed to restore water supply to parts of Madkai and parts of Priol constituencies by Sunday evening, with the help of two low capacity — 8MLD and 12 MLD — plants. Supply to Ponda and parts of Shiroda constituencies was restored by late night  Entire Opa water works complex was shut on Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/some-parts-of-tiswadi-get-water-supply/articleshow/84742625.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

They had swiftly applied the emergency brakes and brought the train to a stop. However, despite immediate braking, the engine and a coach next to it had got derailed due to the soil-mixed boulders on the track. “Ranjeet Kumar, the loco pilot of the leading engine observed that the mud was slipping ahead on the track from the side walls of the hill besides the track. Sensing danger, he immediately applied emergency brakes and brought the train to a stop,” a press note by SWR said. Upon noticing emergency brake being applied, the guard of the train Shailender Kumar applied hand brakes to the brake van situated at the rear-most end of the train and then proceeded towards the engine. “Ranjeet and Shailender noticed that slush and mud were also falling on the coaches next to the engine. They shifted the passengers from the first 3 coaches to the rear coaches, and uncoupled these coaches from the rest of the train. Displaying alertness, and presence of mind, the crew took instruction from their senior officers in Hubballi Divisional Control Office and utilised the rear (banking) engine to pull the train with 345 passengers back to Kulem station,” the note added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/swrs-loco-pilots-guard-get-cash-award-for-quick-action/articleshow/84742650.cms||---

Currently, the bridge is in a bad condition and has become dangerous to use. Sources said that repairs will be taken up immediately. The bridge was also destroyed during the floods in 2019. Farmers from Mayem, Sal, Advalpal, Amona, Pilgao, Pale and other villages from Bicholim are looking at massive losses, the exact figures of which will be ascertained after the panchanama, said officials from the zonal agricultural office (ZAO). Flood waters also damaged many farmlands and bandharas and are in need of urgent repair. Meanwhile, officials from the ZAO have begun inspecting destroyed farmlands and plantations across villages in Bicholim to assess the losses. On Saturday the team headed by Bicholim ZAO Neelima Gawas along with the other officials inspected areas like Sal, Menkurem, Dhumacem and Mayem. “The department of agriculture will provide financial assistance to the victims and all farmers are requested to apply for this,” Gawas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-bicholim-flood-assessment-begins/articleshow/84742685.cms||---

A delegation of the party’s women’s wing went to the flood hit areas of Sattari and distributed provisions to the locals. “It is very pathetic,” said Naik. “The government should immediately compensate them for their losses and rehabilitate them. The government should come up with proper planning and take some measures or steps.” A day earlier, opposition leader Digambar Kamat had demanded that the state government should release cash compensation and one month quota of essential commodities to those displaced by the floods. Goa Pradesh Mahila Congress president Beena Naik visited houses in flood hit areas like Khadegao, Sonale and Dabas. The women collected funds and distributed basic consumable items to the flood hit families. Party president Girish Chodankar said that sudden release of water from the Kalsa Bhandura Project and from the dams resulted in flash floods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-demands-compensation-groceries-for-flood-affected/articleshow/84742714.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The report submitted by the Dharbandora sub divisional officer (SDO) Kedar Naik stated that the devastating flood affected 500 people and displaced around 150 more. A total of 90 houses suffered damages due to water logging and, of them, 12 were submerged in the flood water. The village consists of 130-odd houses and has a population of 950. The floods caused extensive damage to houses, roads, power and water supply, communications networks among other infrastructure, and washed away crops and livestock, the report stated. Around 200 people had sought shelter in the government primary school and the Shree Jalmi temple. Fire Services rescued 50-odd people by deploying inflatable boats. Those sheltering in the school were provided snacks, tea and drinking water. Since access to the temple was difficult, food packets were air dropped by the Coast Guard. Water levels started receding around 4pm and some parts of the village became accessible. Beside damages to residential structure, all electric appliances, groceries and furniture were destroyed. Utensils and clothes were washed away along with livestock, cattle feed and stored agricultural produce like rice, paddy and vegetables, the report stated. Horticulture plantations and crops were severely damaged. Village wells were contaminated leaving the water unsuitable for consumption. Vehicles, including four wheelers and two wheelers, were also submerged, thereby causing severe loss, the report said. In an unprecedented situation, all villages along the western ghats experience flooding on Friday after the water from the ghat areas flowed down into several villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dharbandoras-dhavankond-suffers-loss-worth-5cr/articleshow/84742739.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Kolkata||Why an entire West Bengal village was glued to TV (It’s not cricket)||KOLKATA: Almost everyone from the small village of Chak Krishnadas in West Midnapore’s Pingla had their eyes glued to their TV on Sunday morning, keenly watching the Olympics telecast from the Ariaka Gymnastics Centre in Tokyo. They were cheering local girl Pranati Nayak as she debuted at the world’s loftiest sporting event. Pranati, 26, the daughter of a bus driver who lost his job during the lockdown, bowed out early, but no one was complaining. She, paddler Sutirtha Mukherjee and archer Atanu Das make up the trio from Bengal who represent India at the Olympics. Sutirtha’s family in Naihati continues to dream after she won her first table tennis match on Saturday, having come back from a suspension over alleged age-related fraud. And, as for Atanu, it’s his second Olympics, but his parents are still feeling the pressure of the colossal platform. There were no expectations, Pranati had told TOI before leaving for Tokyo. Just a dream. To be fair, a few months ago, no one had exp-ected her to be there. When Pranati made the cut, she had to carry the weight of Dipa Karmakar’s legacy. She lived out her dream on Sunday, as did her village. “I will be quite happy if I achieve my personal best,” she had told TOI before leaving for Tokyo. “I will give it my best shot, but I don’t know if it would be enough.” Pranati’s parents, Srikanta and Pratima, had tried not to project their expectations on her. “Last evening, when she called, I told her not to worry about anything, but focus on her sport. It is not about medals, but about being there,” Srikanta said. Yet, his heart skipped a beat when Pranati started off well. “I felt she would not return empty-handed.” Like Pranati, Sutirtha, too, wasn’t expected to be there. Having served a suspension due to alleged age-fraud, Sutirtha’s comeback has been a story of grit and gumption. “It wasn’t easy to deal with the suspension,” she had told TOI a few days back. “Thanks to my family, I overcame it.” The family has now changed the timings of their daily chores, so that they can be free to see her in action. “Olympics is a huge stage and there are those usual apprehensions, but Sutirtha is trying to enjoy the occasion more,” said mother Nita. She had been staying at a rented house in Kolkata, so that Sutirtha could train with her coach Soumyadeep Roy and mentor Poulami Ghatak. Nita went through agony and ecstasy during Sutirtha’s victory over Sweden’s Linda Bergstroem on Saturday. “It was a very up-and-down match,” Nita said. “I had my heart in my mouth.” For Amit and Aditi Das, however, it’s a bit of déjà vu. Their son, archer Atanu, is competing in his second Olympics. “It’s difficult to express our feelings while watching him shoot,” Amit told TOI on Sunday. “We pray for his good result, but try not to tell him anything.” This time, they have a daughter-in-law, too, to fret about. Deepika Kumari, the more celebrated archer of the duo, does seek advice from Amit and Aditi. “Our tension is double this time,” Amit laughed. It will be so on Monday, when Atanu takes aim again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/why-an-entire-bengal-village-was-glued-to-tv-its-not-cricket/articleshow/84742449.cms||Sujoy Khanra

---||India||‘His words Yeh Dil Maange More still reverberate’||It was in 1992 that my elder brother Vikram (he was the elder twin by 14 minutes) and I got admission into DAV College, Sector 10, Chandigarh. We were excited about experiencing hostel life. Even before coming to Chandigarh, we were in awe of the men in military uniform as our school was inside the military area in the hill station of Palampur in Himachal Pradesh In our first year itself, we made a lot of friends from the defence background. Just like the two of us, they had a dream of donning the uniform. For them, it was more about carrying forward the legacy of their fathers or grandfathers, but for us it meant a new world, a new way of life and a desire to become like the legendary warriors we had seen in the TV serial titled ‘Param Veer Chakra’ every Sunday on Doordarshan while growing up. Of course, none of us thought that Vikram would become one of the 21 recipients of the Param Veer Chakra, India's highest gallantry award in a battlefield. The very first step that Vikram took towards fulfilling his military dream was joining the National Cadet Corps (NCC), Air Wing at DAV College. It meant imbibing the basics like discipline, professionalism, courage, fearlessness, camaraderie, building a secular outlook and leadership traits. He attended camps like DCAT-1 and DCAT-2 and excelled, thus booking his berth for the most prestigious Republic Day Parade on January 26, 1994 at Raj-path. NCC also decorated him with the prestigious ‘C’ certificate. The next step involved serious studies to clear the combined defence services (CDS) examination. In January 1996, news came that both of us had cleared the written test. It was celebration time but Service Selection Board (SSB) was to follow and there was not a minute to waste. We joined a coaching academy near Chandigarh for preparation and also took sessions from a retired Army officer in Hisar of Haryana. On March 12, 1996, Vikram reported at 19-SSB Allahabad and I reported on March 14 at 18-SSB Allahabad. Four days later, there was a real celebration became he was one among the four cadets selected from a batch of 32 aspirants. In fact, when the final merit list came, he was ranked among the top 50. We didn’t know then that Vikram’s name would be written into the history of Indian Army in golden letters and the whole nation would remember him by his call sign — Sher Shah. His famous words ‘Yeh Dil Maange More’ at a treacherous height of 17,000 feet still reverberate when I think about him. The writer is the twin brother of Kargil war hero Captain Vikram Batra, PVC, 13 JAK RIFLE||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/his-words-yeh-dil-maange-more-still-reverberate/articleshow/84745936.cms||Vishal Batra

---||Chandigarh||We should have been allowed to capture Pakistan territory: VP Malik||General VP Malik, who was Indian Army chief when the Kargil conflict broke out in the summer of 1999, tells Himanshi Dhawan how the conflict changed the rules of combat and India’s relationship with Pakistan It’s been 22 years since the war. As you look back, what has been the biggest learning from it?Operation Vijay was a blend of determined political, military and diplomatic action, which enabled us to transform an adverse situation into an emphatic military and diplomatic victory. Pakistan failed in its aims with considerable political and military costs. The Indian military, on account of poor intelligence and inadequate surveillance, took some time to reorganise and take appropriate counter action. But with military successes on the battlefield and a successful politico-military strategy, India was able to achieve its political aim and enhance its international image as a responsible, democratic nation, determined and capable of defending its territorial integrity. It was a lesson to see that an irregular or proxy war could escalate into a limited conventional war. Although possession of nuclear weapons has made an all-out war on the subcontinent less likely, so long as we have border and territorial disputes, Kargil-type military conflicts cannot be ruled out. The Kargil war also highlighted several weaknesses in the Higher Defence Control Organisation (HDCO), our state of intelligence and surveillance, weapons and equipment. These were noted by the Kargil Review Committee and the Group of Ministers report. How did Kargil change India's outlook towards Pakistan?It was a major turning point in Indo-Pak security relations. There was near total breakdown of trust and a realisation in India that Pakistan can easily resile from any agreement, like the Lahore Declaration which it had signed only two months earlier. It was a big shock to PM Vajpayee (and the cabinet) who took quite some time to believe that the intruders were not Pakistani irregulars but Pakistan regular army personnel. Vajpayee told told Nawaz Sharif: ‘Aapne pith men chhura ghonp diya’ (You have stabbed me in the back). With the benefit of hindsight what do you think India could have done differently?When the war began, we were reacting to a total ‘surprise situation’ created by Pakistan. Due to intelligence and surveillance failure, there was considerable confusion about the identity of the intruders within the government. Our frontline formation had failed to detect intrusion and had no clues on their location. Therefore, getting adequate information, stabilising the situation and then regaining the initiative became essential. After some time when the Indian armed forces were confident of military success in Kargil, they should have been allowed to capture some Pakistani territory across the LoC before agreeing to the ceasefire. Since there was an element of surprise, there was a lot of jugaad required. What were some of these on-the-spur-of-the moment innovations?Some years before Kargil, we had been starved of funds. As a result, we were functioning on 70% of our authorised budget. In the Kargil sector, we did not have clothing or shoes that were required for high altitude. We did not have surveillance devices or radars. In order to see what is going on the other side, our helicopters would go to 20,000 ft altitude to be able to see for themselves. Today, you have satellite photography and UAVs for that. One of the artillery commanders even decided to take the Bofors gun uphill in three pieces, one by one and place them on a height so that soldiers could take direct shots at the enemy. This is how we tried to overcome whatever shortages that we had. If there was another 26/11 kind of terror attack, do you think India’s response would be different in view of how we responded with the Uri and Balakot strikes? I had retired when 26/11 took place but even then I was of the opinion that India needs to retaliate. If Pakistan creates such a situation again, we should retaliate. And we should retaliate strongly. It would be a deterrent and I think Pakistan requires deterrence from time to time. What kind and what type of retaliation that is for the military and politicians to decide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/we-should-have-been-allowed-to-capture-pak-territory-vp-malik/articleshow/84744625.cms||Himanshi Dhawan
---||Amritsar||‘Get copies of 160 Bhagat Singh files from Pak’: Historian to Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh||BATHINDA: After a law professor of London got access to 160 Bhagat Singh case files at Lahore in Pakistan for his book, the demand has been raised from Punjab to see those papers of historical importance. Former Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Chaman Lal, who is honorary adviser to Delhi’s Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre, has written to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, requesting them to take up the matter with their Pakistani Punjab counterparts. Lal claims that the Punjab Archives in Lahore’s Anarkali Tomb has many files relating to the court cases of Bhagat Singh and its numbers were mentioned from page 135 to 165 in the London professor’s book. The visiting scholars had limited access to these files but Lal said the situation had changed. On March 23, 2018, the Lahore archives had its first month-long exhibition of more than 200 items from the Bhagat Singh files. Lal asked for getting the copies and digitalising those thousands of pages, besides photographs and other material. Lal told TOI: “When journalist-parliamentarian Kuldip Nayar was alive, he shared with me his plans to reach out to the-then West Punjab chief minister, Shahbaz Sharif, for these files. He suggested that I went to Lahore to see those files. But our relations with Pakistan worsened over time.” He said: “A few years ago, when Rana Bhagwan Das was acting chief justice of the Pakistan Supreme Court and on a personal visit to India, he gifted the Punjab and Haryana high court in Chandigarh a copy of the Bhagat Singh record from the Punjab high court in Lahore. But that was just court record of the verdict mainly, while the police investigation files were excluded.” In a book, The Execution of Bhagat Singh, barrister Satvinder Singh Juss who teaches law at London’s Kings College, produced 160 Bhagat Singh case files for the first time. Juss got that access as a British scholar, and made liberal use of the resources. Lal said: “It is Indian Punjab’s moral duty to acquire copies of these files, digital and photo prints, if not original. Now when Pakistani Punjab has also acknowledged Bhagat Singh as a freedom fighter and allowed even foreign scholars to study him, it is appropriate that after 74 years of Partition and nine decades of Bhagat Singh’s execution, the case records are kept in Indian Punjab, in some university or state archives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/get-copies-of-160-bhagat-singh-files-from-pak-historian-to-cm/articleshow/84744626.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chandigarh||Haryana readies to relieve DGP, UPSC returns panel of 7||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana home department is in the process of relieving director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava on July 31, as Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) had returned the panel of seven names sent by state for want of details of vacancy’s day and time. The panel was sent to UPSC in the first week. After the objection, the home department has sent this communication to the chief minister’s office (CMO) for approval. State home minister Anil Vij said: "The UPSC has expressed its inability to proceed further till it knows the date of vacancy. We have written to it that Yadava will be relived on or by July 31. Rest the CMO will decide." Of these seven DGP-level officers in Haryana, the most senior are S S Deswal (1984-batch IPS), deputed as director general of the ITBP, and K K Sindhu (1986-batch IPS). Both are due to retire in August. The other five are director general of state vigilance bureau Prashanta K Aggarwal (1988 batch IPS), DGP (crime) Muhammad Akil (1989-batch IPS), Haryana Police Housing Corporation MD R C Mishra (1989 batch), ACS transport and director general of prisons Shatujit Singh Kapoor (1990-batch IPS), and IRB-Bhondsi head Desh Raj (1990-batch IPS). Two more names, S K Jain and Alok Rai, were added to the list sent to the UPSC. The final call is of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. On June 22, DGP Manoj Yadava had expressed his desire to return to his intelligence bureau cadre because of career pursuits and family issues. He had requested the government to relieve him as soon as possible. Yadava, a 1988-batch IPS officer, was a handpicked for the post by the CM. He had joined Haryana on a two-year deputation in February 2019 and his tenure had ended this February. Amidst strong opposition from home minister Anil Vij who wanted a new appointment, the CM gave Yadava an extension till further orders. Later, the home ministry also had approved his extension for one year. Yadava had been convincing the CM to relieve him but the CMO wanted him to stay, so Yadava cited family issues and career growth as reasons. The CMO ruled it out outrightly, as the development was linked remotely to inspector general Y Puran Kumar’s complaint to the ACS against Yadava, which had been in the news for long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-readies-to-relieve-dgp-upsc-returns-panel-of-7/articleshow/84744627.cms||Manvir Saini

Addressing the gathering at state-level Van Mahotsav held through video conferencing here, Khattar said protecting the environment has always remained the utmost priority of his government and several steps have been taken to make Haryana green. “This year we have set a target of planting 3 crore saplings. I would urge each one of you to become a part of the state government’s plantation campaign to ensure the betterment of Mother Earth’s health,” he said. Cooperation minister Dr Banwari Lal also attended the function from Chandigarh, while forest minister Kanwar Pal attended the function from Jagadhri along with other political and administrative dignitaries from their respective districts through video conferencing. Besides this, several children also listened to chief minister’s address through the edu-sat application. The chief minister said the forest area of Haryana state should be 20% of the total geographical area because Haryana is a plain state. Being a plain and agricultural state, the notified forest area in Haryana is only 3.52% and the total tree covered area is 3.62%. “Thus our total forest and tree covered area is around 7%. To increase it to 20%, it is very important to plant more and more trees. This is a collective responsibility and keeping this in mind, special schemes are being implemented by the forest and education department in Haryana,” said Khattar. e-Paudhshala app launched The chief minister also launched citizen-centric e-Paudhshala mobile application for free distribution of plants from government nurseries. The chief minister said all the saplings to be distributed to the panchayats under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan launched by the Prime Minister and the saplings to be distributed under our Paudhgiri Yojana will be distributed through this mobile application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/take-green-pledge-to-plant-at-least-one-tree-khattar-urges-people/articleshow/84744629.cms||---
---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh: Don’t harm sanctity of holy Chandratal lake, tourists urged||MANALI: After Manali youth drowned in Chandratal (moon lake), the Spiti administration has warned visitors not to bath in the holy lake and harm its sanctity. At an altitude of 14,000ft, Chandratal used to get only a few hundred tourists until a decade back, The number has risen to thousands gradually. The lake is part of Chandratal wildlife sanctuary, a habitat of many rare animals, including snow leopards. Surrounded by peaks and glaciers, the blue water lake in remote region is a natural wonder. Spiti sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Mahender Pratap Singh said not just bathing in Chandratal was risky but also harmed the religious sentiments of local residents. “Visitors are taking the lake lightly but they should know that it’s very dangerous. The glacier-fed lake water is extremely cold and close to freezing point. It’s very difficult to swim in such cold water. And it’s very deep. Warning signages have been installed in the area but visitors are ignoring them,” he said. The SDM said tourists had been asked not to go too close to rivers, nullahs and water sources in monsoon season but they were ignoring the warnings. He personally warned away many tourists lounging too near many rivers and nullahs. He said a person from Manali was swimming in Chandratal and drowned. A similar incident had happened a few months back. “Strict action will be taken against tourists for flouting rules. Swimming in the lake is banned. Visitors are littering the area by throwing plastic garbage. They should be responsible and respect the religious sentiments of locals. The holy lake has religious importance for many people,” he added. While residents have made the Save Chandratal Society long back to protect the holy lake from being polluted, Lahaul-Spiti administration is also not allowing people to go to the region without online registration. The tourists are now required to get themselves registered at www.eaagman.hp.gov.in to get e-pass. They need to fill their personal details, vehicle number, travel date, source, and destination. A police post has been set up near the lake, while forest department has also become proactive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/dont-harm-sanctity-of-holy-chandratal-lake-tourists-urged/articleshow/84744636.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Meet the man who digs up dirt to set right system||Appearing before the Chennai police commissioner has become routine for social activist and convenor of anti-corruption NGO Arappor Iyakkam Jayaram Venkatesan. Most of these turned out to be false cases. After two jail visits, exposing corruption by top ministers and bureaucrats, the 40-year-old says he has learned to take it all in his stride, except for an inquiry by a woman police personnel of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) in 2019. The policewoman asked Jayaram which school his child went to. Though the interrogator was apologetic, Jayaram says he was livid as it was an attempt to silence him with a veiled threat to his family.  "You are also a parent. Do you know what that question means," Jayaram recalls asking the cop. It was obvious she was asking the question at the behest of her superiors who were under pressure from ministers," says Jayaram. Given Arappor and Jayaram’s track record, it might not be implausible. Throughout the second term of AIADMK government (2016-2021), all top ministers such as chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, deputy chief minister O Pannerselvam and S P Velumani, who many referred to as the most powerful minister in the cabinet, had to answer questions on alleged corruption in their departments raked up by Arappor. In some cases, their denial appeared feeble as Jayaram released documents supplied by whistleblowers or those collected through the RTI Act. This meant frequent police visits to Arappor’s erstwhile office in Egmore, denial of permission for peaceful demonstrations, multitude of cases and stormy exchanges with IPS and IAS officials. People who know Jayaram vouch for his commitment "He has sacrificed a lot. I have not met anybody in activism like him. He is very hardworking and will put up a fight till the end," says V Sandhya, an advocate who has worked with Jayaram in the Aam Admi Party (AAP). Rewind 19 years to the summer of 2002, Jayaram was a quintessential 21-year-old electrical engineer from Chennai who harboured dreams of making it big in the Silicon Valley. By 2007, Jayaram decided to return home to work in the education and agriculture sector. Tamil Nadu’s corrupt bureaucrats would have breathed a lot easier, if not for the Bhopal gas tragedy and a man called Karthik. In early 2003, Karthik, Jayaram’s roommate in the US, was part of a community service group organising lectures from Indian social activists. He managed to coax a studious Jayaram, with an offer of free dinner, to one such meeting by Rashida B and Champadevi where they spoke about the suffering of the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy. "That evening changed my life. I was shocked about my ignorance of the issues affecting people, and this triggered a guilt which made me question my priorities. I decided that I could make a difference either by sending money home or returning to work in that sector," says Jayaram. He immersed himself in the works of P Sainath, Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz to get a better understanding of the ground realities. Jayaram returned to India and worked with government schoolchildren in Krishnagiri, took up farming on a piece of land in Kancheepuram and taught math to slum children. He also connected with other activists across India through his travels to Sewagram. In 2012, his report on farm suicides in TN got chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s attention. "I wasn’t this confrontational and was surprised by the impact," he says. Right from the start, Jayaram has been clear about his decision to not contest elections. "I focus on the outcomes of government schemes. At the grassroots I could see how corruption affected this," he says. This influenced his decision to join the AAP in 2014 and he even went to jail a year later with 49 others as they marched into chief minister O Pannerselvam’s house on the issue of agriculture officer Muthukumaraswamy’s suicide, which was linked to a cash-for-posts scam. "Jail was fun due to the interactions. Also I lost 3-4kg," Jayaram says. After the AAP’s ideological shift, Jayaram quit and formed Arappor with a few like-minded colleagues. With a focus on urban issues like water logging in 2015 floods, encroachment of water bodies and the banner culture, Arappor was able to capture the imagination of the middle and upper-middle class in Chennai. Multitude of exposes, campaigns and public jousts over urban issues later, Jayaram got the government’s goat around 18 months after Jayalalithaa’s death. Whistleblowers began to release information on massive tender-fixing in Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and Coimbatore Corporation. These were pre-fixed so that only a cartel of contractors linked to Velumani won, Arappor alleged. Later, similar exposes in the electricity ministry and civil supplies were released. Along with ministerial denials, came defamation cases and ‘foisted’ police cases, with the NGO’s treasurer being arrested at 4am. Tangedco and GCC officials made a ‘routine’ check at Jayaram’s residence on a complaint alleging irregularities. Nothing came of it, but the message was clear: Shut up or face trouble. This led to allegations from the AIADMK supporters on social media labelling Jayaram a ‘DMK stooge’. But when Kanimozhi and A Raja were acquitted in the 2G spectrum case, Jayaram spoke about how evidence had been ignored by the court. "I have also spoken about the BSNL case where DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran was accused," he says. After the DMK took the over state’s reins this May, GCC has cancelled tenders worth several hundred crores of rupees alleging irregularities. This has vindicated Jayaram’s stand and his submission to the GCC on transparency and other reforms were accepted. When quizzed, Jayaram says his ideological commitment is to the Constitution of India.  "TN has a poor movement-based approach. Awareness among people is low. We want to create a vibrant civil society," says Jayaram, who believes a citizen’s movement is more effective in bringing change as compared to an opposition MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/meet-the-man-who-digs-up-dirt-to-set-right-system/articleshow/84746110.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

A pedestrian was also injured in another landslide in Kinnaur district.  The tourists and the driver of the Force Traveller van were coming from Chitkul, considered the last inhabited village near the border with China in Kinnaur, to Sangla, when the landslide hit the Sangla-Chitkul road. Huge rocks and boulders fell on the road and led to collapse of a bridge over Bapsa river that connects Batseri village with the rest of Kinnaur. A family of three from Rajasthan’s Sikar district — Maya Devi Biyani (55), her son Anurag Biyani (31) and daughter Richa Biyani (25) — was among those killed in the accident. The remaining six people who were killed were identified as Pratiksha Sunil Patil (27) from Nagpur in Maharashtra; Deepa Sharma (34) from Jaipur; Amogh Bapat (27) and Satish Katakbar (34) from Chhattisgarh; driver of the vehicle Umrab Singh (42) of Tagore Garden in Delhi and Kumar Ulhas Vedpathak (37). The injured include Shiril Obroy (39) from West Delhi; Naveen Bhardwaj (37) from Kharar in Mohali and Ranjeet Singh (45), a local from Batseri village in Sangla. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences for the deaths and announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the next of kin of those killed in the mishap and Rs 50,000 as financial aid for the injured. Condoling the deaths, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said necessary instructions have been issued to the Kinnaur administration to provide all possible aid to those affected in the incident. Kinnaur MLA Jagat Singh Negi said big boulders had fallen at the same spot, where the bridge was damaged, on Saturday and had damaged a car. A cloudburst in Lara nullah of Spiti blocked the Sumdo-Kaza highway at 1am on Sunday, breaking the high-altitude valley’s link with Shimla and Kinnaur. The upper reaches of Spiti experienced incessant rain from Saturday midnight that triggered a flash flood and brought tonnes of debris along with it and blocked the highway. Dozens of vehicles were stranded on either side of Lara nullah for nearly 12 hours. Border Roads Organisation (BRO) restored traffic only by late Sunday afternoon. Spiti SDM Mahender Pratap Singh said, “No casualty has been reported.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/himachal-pradesh-landslide-kills-9-tourists-in-kinnaur-3-others-injured/articleshow/84746106.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab government way behind in installing solar water pumps||CHANDIGARH: Despite the fact that Punjab has witnessed the worst of power crisis this paddy season and the state government’s burden on account of free power being provided to farmers for operating water pump sets or tubewells has touched Rs 6,735 crore this year, the state hasn’t fallen back on solar-powered water pumps too much, which would have otherwise helped tide over the crisis to a great extent. Punjab is way behind its neighbour Haryana in the installation of solar water pumps. Against a total of 14,254 solar water pumps installed in Haryana, Punjab has got hardly 2,925 till date. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme of the Union ministry of new and renewable energy, 121 such solar water pumps have also been installed in the neighbouring state of Himachal Pradesh. Providing this information during the ongoing monsoon session of the Parliament, minister for new and renewable energy and power R K Singh said to install these solar power pumps, the Central government has released Rs 62 crore financial support to the Haryana government, Rs 20 crore to the Punjab government and nearly Rs 3 crore to the Himachal Pradesh government. In all, a total number of 47,726 solar power pumps have been installed in 13 states till June 30 for which the central assistance of Rs 308 crore has been provided. Rajasthan has installed the highest number of 15,549 solar power pumps followed by 14,254 by Haryana and 7,234 by Madhya Pradesh. As per the agriculture census 2015, nearly 10.92 lakh farmers were operating over 13.51 lakh tubewells across Punjab. As the southwest monsoon got delayed this year when the paddy sowing season was in full swing, farmers also faced power shortage for their tubewells because of the increase in power demand for domestic consumers amid continued heat spell. Since the Punjab government was compelled to divert the electricity to the agriculture sector for eight hours earlier this month, it had to impose power cuts on the industry as well as the domestic consumers besides cutting short of the working hours in the government offices. At the same time, the state’s ground water level is depleting every year and the Central Ground Water Board has already warned that at least 103 out of the total 138 blocks in the state are over-exploited. Under this scheme, the central government provides as subsidy 30% of benchmark cost or cost discovered through tender, whichever is lower. In addition to central financial support, at least 30% of the cost of the solar pump is provided by the respective state government. In case of north-eastern states including Sikkim, hilly states of Himachal and Uttarakhand, UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Andaman and Nicobar Island and Lakshadweep, higher central financial support of 50% of benchmark cost or cost discovered through tender, whichever is lower is provided. The Central government has a target of creating 30.8 GW solar power capacity by 2022 with central financial support of Rs 34,035 crore. The PM-KUSUM scheme was launched on March 8, 2019, with an aim of solarisation of 15 lakh existing grid-connected agriculture water pumps, installation of 20 lakh standalone off-grid solar water pumps and installation of 10,000 megawatt aggregated capacity small solar power plants each of capacity up to 2 megawatt on the barren or fallow land of the farmers. The Union minister also told the Lok Sabha that a provision of sale of the surplus power through solarisation of individual grid–connected pumps has been made under this scheme. “As solarisation of pumps has recently started on ground, billing of surplus power sold by farmers is yet to be reported by the state implementing agencies,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-government-way-behind-in-installing-solar-water-pumps/articleshow/84746154.cms||Sanjeev Verma

The morcha has already announced a national-level “kisan mahapanchayat” in Muzzafarnagar on September 5. SKM leaders Yudhvir Singh, Yogendra Yadav, Darshan Pal, Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Ashish Mittal are going to Lucknow to hold a meeting. Though farm leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan was asked to accompany them, he had personal work and might not reach, Ugrahan told TOI. He, however, would reach Udham Singh Nagar district of Uttarakhand on July 31 on the eve of the 81st martyrdom day of freedom fighter Udham Singh to pay tributes to him and campaign against BJP. SKM held a meeting at Singhu border on Sunday and decided to go ahead with its much awaited ‘Mission UP’ to unseat BJP from power. The months-long process would be put in motion on Monday, when farm leaders would outline features of the mission at Lucknow. Farmers will hold meetings in districts from August 1 to 25 to prepare ground for the September 5 panchayat at Muzzafarnagar, where farm leaders from across states will assemble to sound the bugle of opposition against BJP. In October and November, divisional-level mahapanchayats will be organised in 17 divisions of UP and two divisions of Uttarakhand. UP will go to assembly polls early next year. In panchayat elections earlier this year, farmers damaged the BJP’s chances on many seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/unseat-bjp-campaign-to-start-in-lucknow-today/articleshow/84746216.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Kochi||Kerala: Police file case against CPM leaders for manhandling medical officer||KOTTAYAM: The Nedumudy police have registered a case against CPM leaders, including the president of Kainakary grama panchayat, on Sunday after a medical officer in Alappuzha was allegedly manhandled following a dispute over the Covid-19 vaccine distribution on Saturday. Dr Sharath Chandra Bose was allegedly manhandled while he was on duty at the vaccination centre in Kainakary. Police have charged a case against panchayat president M C Prasad, CPM local secretary Raghuvaran and party worker Visakah Vijayan in connection with the incident. According to police, a dispute over the vaccines that remained after the day’s vaccination drive lead to the alleged manhandling. The panchayat president gave a list of 10 persons and asked the doctor to administer the vaccine on them also. According to the doctor, he had kept the vaccines for the palliative patients in the panchayat. However, the president and his men threatened the doctor, saying that he won’t be allowed to leave the centre unless he administers the vaccines to the people on the list and tried to manhandle him. The doctor escaped and ran into a room, and locked himself inside. The doctor and other health workers in the centre were stopped from going out for over two hours. They could leave the centre only after the police came. The doctor was taken to Nedumudy police station, where he gave his statement. Based on that, a case was filed. Meanwhile, the panchayat president said that the complaint was fake and he had only protested the act by the doctor. However, police have charged a case against him and others for preventing the doctor from discharging his duty and manhandling him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-police-file-case-against-cpm-leaders/articleshow/84746290.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Indian National League splits as warring factions come to blows||KOCHI: The Indian National League (INL), a constituent of the ruling LDF, split on Sunday after supporters of the two warring factions clashed on the sidelines of the party state secretariat meeting in Kochi. Party state president A P Abdul Wahab expelled general secretary Kasim Irikkur from the party while national president Prof Mohammed Sulaiman removed Wahab from his post and expelled seven state secretariat members belonging to the rival group. Irikkoor announced working president B Hamsa Haji as the party's new state president and claimed that his faction enjoyed support of the INL national leadership. Both factions had held parallel meetings of their supporters in Aluva and Fort Kochi before announcing their decisions. “After completing the secretariat meeting in Kochi, we went to Aluva to conduct the working committee meeting. We completed the procedures of the working committee by 5pm,” Irikkur said. The Wahab faction, meanwhile, alleged that Irikkur was acting as an IUML agent and he wanted to create trouble for the LDF government. Police use force to disperse workersThe CPM had asked the INL leaders to settle issues in the party a few days ago. Earlier, the clashes occurred in the presence of ports minister Ahamed Devarkovil and police had to escort him out of the hotel where the meeting took place. They also had to use force to disperse the clashing workers besides taking a few of them into custody. Irikkur said the party working committee meeting in Kozhikode on July 2 had decided to take disciplinary action against two secretariat members for anti-party activities and Sunday’s issues began after the meeting took up the matter. He said the official faction was not part of the violence. Sources said minor clashes had begun in the hall of the hotel soon after the leaders’ meeting began. The faction opposed to Wahab did not heed to his announcement that the meeting was over and strong arguments ensued, which later turned into a full-blown scuffle. Police have registered cases under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance for violation of Covid protocols and under IPC for rioting. They have so far recorded the arrest of five persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-inl-splits-as-warring-factions-come-to-blows/articleshow/84746357.cms||---

A separate notification will be released for reopening of classes 9 and 10 from August 5, say sources. Students of Class 11 will come to school on Tuesdays and Fridays, and Class 12 on Mondays and Thursdays. No more than 50% of students will be allowed each day. Government schools in both cities are reopening, but there was no clarity till late Sunday night if private schools would. Very few CBSE schools in Indore will open their gates on Monday. In Bhopal, private schools, even those affiliated to the state board, weren’t sure. Not all teachers are fully vaccinated, either. The school education department has warned government teachers to get themselves vaccinated on Monday or lose the next month’s salary. It has set up 10 vaccination centres where teachers will get priority. Around 100 teachers have not taken even the first dose, said Bhopal district education officer Nitin Saxena. “We have issued notices to such teachers and asked them to explain why they haven’t got vaccinated. The majority of them have agreed to take it on Monday. If anyone doesn’t, we will have to take extreme steps, including withholding their salaries,” Saxena told TOI. “We have made it clear to them that they can enter the school only if they get themselves vaccinated,” said Saxena. Vaccination is a concern for parents, too. Not many are confident of sending their children to school when a vaccine for kids is some way off. Parents in the two cities were taken by surprise by the reopening order as Bhopal and Indore are still reporting fresh Covid cases daily. Bhopal had four new cases on Sunday, and Indore two – 50% of MP’s daily tally of 12. Order on eve of reopening leaves parents in a fixChief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said a week earlier that schools can be reopened in districts that have no Covid case. “The order was issued today, how can we send our children to school tomorrow, asked several parents. Also, parents have noted with concern that the order issued by the Bhopal administration on Sunday and the SOPs released by the education department on July 23 makes no mention of the format of consent forms. Parents’ consent is mandatory for a child to attend school, but they demand that a ‘no’ option be given in the form. The government is silent on that. In Indore, only a few CBSE schools are starting with conventional classes from Monday, chairman of Indore Sahodaya School Complex, U K Jha told TOI. However, the vice-president of Madhya Pradesh Private State board School Owners Association, Gopal Soni told TOI: “Majority of parents of all private state board schools have given their nod for the conventional mode of classes and we will be conducting sessions from Monday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/madhya-pradesh-schools-to-reopen-today-no-vaccine-no-pay-for-govt-teachers/articleshow/84746413.cms||Ramendra Singh

The man died the same day and his wife died on Sunday. In her dying declaration, she said her ‘guru bhai’ Dhansingh Dhurvey alias Motinath Baba, 36, had set them on fire because he was angry over her second marriage. The accused, who is now in custody, claims the couple — Ramrao Dhurvey, 34, and his wife Ram Bai, 33 — hadn’t returned Rs 11,000 they had taken from him. The incident took place in Salidhana village of Sarni area, 50km from Betul and around 180km from Bhopal, on July 18. Accused held from Harra Dhana junglesNeighbours woke up to their screams in the dead of night and ran into their house to find them engulfed in flames. The couple was taken to hospital where Ramrao died within hours. Rambai died in Padhar hospital on Sunday morning. Police investigated the crime scene and found the couple had been doused with petrol and set on fire. A wooden stick was found, which was later found to belong to Dhansingh, who claims to be a tantrik. On the basis of Ram Bai’s statement, police arrested Dhansingh from the jungles of Harra Dhana, about 50km away. Sarni subdivisional police officer Mahendra Singh Chauhan said Ram Bai and the accused tantrik were “guru bhai and guru behan”. “In her dying declaration, she said that the tantrik committed the crime because he was angry with her for marrying a second time. The accused, however, claims he had given some money to the couple but they refused to return it, and even misbehaved with him, which made him furious,” Chauhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-tantrik-held-for-setting-fire-to-couple-both-die/articleshow/84746312.cms||---
---||Bhopal||35% Madhya Pradesh MLAs have more than 2 children; 11 of them have 6-9 kids||BHOPAL: God’s wish… Times were different… More children means more soldiers to fight for the country… These are the arguments put forth by Madhya Pradesh MLAs who have more than half a dozen children, and who are now enthusiastically supporting population control laws. As many as 82 MLAs -- over a third of the House strength of 230 -- have more than two children. Eleven of them have between six and nine kids. Two of them are ministers. Education doesn’t seem to be a determining factor here, social strata or political ideology. Five of the eight are graduates or postgraduates (two with law degrees). The other three either managed to reach higher secondary or dropped out earlier. Forty-nine BJP lawmakers have more than two children, while 39 are from Congress. Most of them now support a law for population control, but realise the irony of talking to people about it. Ramlallu Bais, BJP MLA from Singrauli, who explains his nine children as a “wish of God” strongly advocates population control. “But the law should apply to everyone, regardless of religion,” he argues. Now, MLAs bat for population control lawAsked how he would approach people to promote such a law when he has nine children, he said he does run into such questions. “I have had no child since 1990. It has been over 30 years and I have one wife,” he explained. In a viral video earlier this week, he was heard saying: “I am 78 years old. When God wishes, it happens. It is only as per the wish of God that it happened, nothing is in our hands. If a population control Act comes into force today, it will be applicable to everyone.” Another father of nine, Congress MLA from Petlawad Wal Singh Meda, takes a different line. “ There is no need for any such law as people are now educated and understand such things. Times have changed. Everyone now knows that they should not increase population; people want only two children now. This talk of forceful population control Act is just meant to spread hate and fear. I am against such things.” More kids means more soldiers, is the argument of MP’s social justice minister Prem Singh Patel, who has six children. “There are areas where people have a lot of children. If there are more children, then there would be more personnel to fight. But there should be a law to control population now, because if population continues to increase there will be no land or jobs in the future,” Patel told TOI.

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan expressed grief at the incident and offered his condolences. The mangled car and (inset) Hitesh, Aditya and TuheenThose killed were identified as Hitesh (25), who was employed with a firm in Bengaluru, Aditya (23),a BA-LLB student, and Awadhpuri residents Tuheen (29) Lokesh (22).

---||Indore||Madhya Pradesh: ‘Suspicious youth’ detained at Mahakal temple taking photos of security recce||UJJAIN/INDORE: Intelligence officials from Delhi and Lucknow, who were visiting Mahakaleswar temple, found a youngster acting suspiciously and detained him last Friday. The 25-year-old was found to have clicked pictures and videos of the officers on their recce. He was questioned and police found ID cards and an MPPSC exam admit card on him. He was allowed to go, but they did find several photos and videos of the intelligence officers carrying out their inspection of the temple and its perimeter, say sources. Security has been increased in the temple after the incident. Intelligence teams and police carry out inspections ahead of Saawan every year. On July 23, during their usual rounds, intelligence officials spotted a youth taking rather too much interest in their activities. The collector was then carrying out checks inside the temple. The officers from Delhi and Lucknow took the youth aside and questioned him. Not satisfied with his answers, they handed him over to police for investigation. The cops checked his phone and found several videos of the officials along with their pictures at different areas of the temple. Ujjain hotbed of SIMI activities; cops cautiousUjjain SP Satyendra Shukla said a proper investigation was conducted and the youth was allowed to leave only after everything he said were verified. “His Aadhaar card had an address of Badnagar (about 50 kilometres from Ujjain). He said he had come to Ujjain to take the Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission prelims examination that was scheduled on Sunday across the state. He is an engineer from Badnagar. He was also carrying an admit card and his address was found to be correct,” SP Shukla said. The Madhya Pradesh government had sounded an alert recently following the arrest of two terrorists of an al-Qaida-supported outfit on the outskirts of Lucknow. Home minister Narottam Mishra directed authorities to keep a close watch on those suspected to be or identified as having links with SIMI. Since Ujjain has always been a base of SIMI activities, police and intelligence agencies are taking no chances and are extra cautious about the security of the Mahakal temple.

Sushil Kumar from Chakkarpur had contracted the H5N1 avian influenza and died at Delhi’s AIIMS on July 11. He had succumbed to acute myeloid leukaemia and associated complications. “Our team observed that six people in the area have common flu-like symptoms and three have sore throats. Our teams are constantly monitoring the health condition of the boy’s family members. Our team and NIHSAD members have collected samples from butcher knives, tabletops, cages, etc. Also, blood samples of the family members and neighbours of the boy were collected to check for antibodies in these people. The result will determine if they were earlier infected with the virus or not,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. Members of the NIHSAD, along with the Gurugram health department, collected samples from birds and people at the market to assess the presence of the avian flu (H5N1) virus. The team collected 20 swabs of birds and 18 human blood samples. A total of 70 teams of the health department surveyed a 10km area. As many as 3,811 houses were surveyed in a 3km area. Between 3km to 10 km area, 68,537 people were surveyed. The department’s deputy director, Dr Punita Gahlawat said poultry has been found to be healthy in Gurugram as of now. “A team from Bhopal and a health department team collected samples and their results will come after two or three weeks. After getting the reports, we can plan a further course of action. As of now, we are carrying out intensive screenings in the area.” “This sample collection process is important to determine if anyone was infected in the area or not. As the boy was infected, it is crucial to identify from where he got the virus. So far, we have not witnessed any unusual death and symptoms in birds,” she added. Meanwhile, she also pointed out that 28 teams of the animal husbandry department have been formed to carry out inspections at 18 poultry farms across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/avian-flu-6-show-symptoms-of-cold-team-scans-market/articleshow/84741389.cms||Ipsita Pati

In the notice, the department has directed the builder to furnish a reply within seven days, failing which action will be taken against him. Launched in October 2016, the project spread across 7.5 acres in Gurgaon’s Sector 109 has over 1,000 units — each in the range of Rs 14 to 26 lakh. The developer had initially promised possession in May 2021 but the construction stopped around 18 months back. In the notice, the department observed that the builder failed to complete the internal development work and construction of community buildings within four years and the pace of construction is not in accordance with the norms. According to the homebuyers, since the project’s launch in 2016, only 50% of the work has been completed. The units were initially supposed to be ready by May this year, but the deadline was extended to November 2021 and further extended to June 2022. Recently, representatives of the developer met around 150 homebuyers of the project at the construction site but irked them by further extending the deadline. As per the notice, the builder failed to complete the internal development work within 4 years of the grant of license. It also failed to construct all community buildings within the time specified by the DTCP from the date of grant of license. The notice also pulled up the developer for the slow pace of construction, which failed the sale agreement done with the buyers of the flat. “The builder also failed to abide by the parameters of the departmental policy for affordable housing. The license was valid up to June 2021 and the developer has not applied/ obtained the occupation certificate nor got the license renewed,” said the district town planner (enforcement) RS Batth. He further said that as per Section 10(1) of Act No. 8 of 1975, “any person who contravenes any of the provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder or any of the conditions of a licence granted under Section 3 shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine”. A homebuyer said “It’s been almost four years but hardly 40-50% work has been completed. The developer has taken 90-100% payment from all buyers. We are paying rent as well as instalments for our home loans.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/project-delayed-dtcp-asks-for-builders-reply-in-a-week/articleshow/84741481.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

Residents said that the drain is filled with stagnant water, plastic and other waste and commuting on the stretch daily becomes difficult even after a light spell of rain. The stink becomes unbearable, they added. They alleged that several complaints have been made to the authorities concerned to fix the issue, but they have gone unheard. Pradeep Singh, a resident of Sector 81, said, “The drain along the Rampura flyover and NH-8 is completely clogged with waste, mud and stagnant water. Every time when it rains, the water accumulates as a result the commuters face a lot of inconvenience.” They added that the junction is critical as people use this stretch for travelling to Sector 81, 82, 83, 85, 89, 90, 91, 92, which further connects to Pataudi Road. The residents also suspected that there are illegal sewer connections in the storm water drain from the nearby village. Rao Dharamveer Singh, a resident of Sector 82, said that there is frequent overflowing of dirty water from the blocked drain and there is hardly any cleaning. “The accumulated water is also damaging the road and creating potholes. We have raised the issue with the concerned authorities for the past one year, but no permanent solution has been provided to us so far.” When contacted, Ajay Kumar Arya, project director of NHAI, said that there was a culvert which drained out the water but it had been covered by the locals as a result the drain had been blocked leading to water stagnation. “Although we have made a temporary arrangement and the water has been pumped out. We cannot initiate any work beyond our right of way. If the local civic authorities construct the drain then we can connect the drain line for the outlet,” Arya said. Elaborating on the complaint regarding the illegal sewer connection in the storm drain, he said, “We have received several complaints on the matter about the illegal sewer connections by the residential colonies in the stormwater drain. We have asked the concessionaire to conduct a survey to ascertain the complaints, and action will be taken accordingly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/drain-below-flyover-clogged-with-waste/articleshow/84741561.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Help would be sought from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to increase the number of ICU beds and doctors for children at government hospitals, officials said. The newly-appointed chief medical officer, Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, said he is working on the plan. “A patient who needs oxygen supply will be taken to the local community health centre (CHC) or primary health centre (PHC) first. This will reduce load on the main Covid hospitals and in case, a patient’s condition deteriorates, the person would be immediately to a hospital. Each patient will be monitored continuously through the control room,” he said. Shankhdhar added that all CHCs and PHCs across the district are being developed as primary centres for Covid treatment and they have been given beds and oxygen facilities. Apart from this, oxygen concentrators have been set up at rural PHCs. Arrangements have been made to provide critical care to children if required. Beds for children have also been reserved at all CHCs and PHCs. Apart from that, paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) have been readied in three major Covid hospitals of the district. Currently, there are about 100 PICU beds in Ghaziabad. With help from the IMA, specialist doctors would be called in to treat children at government hospitals, as and when required. The CMO said currently, there is no shortage of Covid medicines in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gzb-plans-covid-care-closer-home-more-beds-for-kids/articleshow/84744706.cms||Aditya Dev

Environmentalists, who backed the move, said this was the fourth time in the past decade that consolidation of small patches of land in the area had been stopped. Under the Consolidation Act, the Haryana government pools small patches of common land and then allocates them to villagers for farming. However, it has often been seen that the villagers sell off these plots to private builders, who develop farmhouses in the forested area. The government’s latest proposal to consolidate the Kot village land was in February 2019. The revenue department agreed that had the land falling under the “gair mumkin pahar” category been allotted to villagers, it could “wrongly benefit certain influential outsider-purchasers”. “The aim of the Consolidation Act is to pool land for the betterment of agriculture and common purposes of the villagers. The objective of this Act would be defeated in case land under ‘gair mumkin pahan’ is included in the scheme. So, the plan has been withdrawn,” said Amna Tasneem, director, consolidation of holdings. Environmentalists pointed out that the hilly area of Kot village fell in the buffer zone of Mangar Bani, a protected area. “This is the fourth time that the consolidation process in Kot village has been stopped on the grounds that the move could be misused. Let’s hope this is the final time,” said Chetan Agarwal, a forest analyst. Sarvadaman Oberoi, an environmentalist, listed a few instances. “The consolidation scheme has been misused in Aravali villages such as Mangar, Bandhwari, Ankhir and Mewla Maharajpur to create private plots inside forests. It must be rolled back.” Not just environmentalists, villagers too backed the government move to withdraw the plan. “The government is planning to eventually privatise all the common land in villages,” said Kesar Singh, the husband of Kot sarpanch Mundresh Devi. The villagers, he added, had approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and written to the chief minister and the Centre against the move to consolidate common land. According to the activists, this was the fourth attempt since 2011 to consolidate common village land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-junks-plan-to-allot-aravali-land-to-villagers-for-agriculture/articleshow/84741639.cms||Ipsita Pati
