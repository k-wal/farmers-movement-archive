Yediyurappa made the request during a virtual meeting between Modi and chief ministers of some states. The meeting was held to review the pandemic situation in these states. “Till now, 2.6 crore doses have been administered. We need at least five lakh doses a day,” Yediyurappa had said. Yediyurappa also requested for assistance under the PM Cares Fund to procure 800 neonatal and paediatric ventilators. He urged Modi to allocate 40 PSA oxygen production units in taluk hospitals and decentralisation of the distribution of medical oxygen. He appealed for an increase in supply of drug Amphotericin-B, which is used to treat mucormycosis, and an increase in intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) meant for children. The CM told Modi that district authorities have been authorised to impose sanctions depending on the positivity rate. They can also initiate appropriate action against those not following Covid protocols. With the PM asking states to gear up for a possible third wave, Yediyurappa said Karnataka is already increasing the number of oxygenated and ventilator beds and paediatric ICUs. The number of doctors, paramedics and lab technicians in hospitals have been increased and equipment is being purchased. New RT-PCR and genome sequencing laboratories are also being set up in the state, he said.

Whether it was their faith that worked or their discipline, the village, less than 115km from hotspot Bengaluru and with a population of about 500, has not had even a single case of Covid so far. On the night of July 12 (Monday), Polenahalli celebrated its success in keeping the virus at bay by holding a Karaga festival. As usual, all Covid protocols were in place. As Sathyappa, the priest, carried the Karaga on his head around the village followed by a small group, residents ensured strict social distancing was maintained. Everyone wore a mask too. “There was no way we could have celebrated the occasion without propitiating the gods,” says Venkatesh, a member of the Donimadagu gram panchayat under which Polenahalli falls. When the first case of Covid was detected in India last year, Polenahalli residents and their leaders offered prayers at the Gangamma temple in the village and pledged to offer a continuous puja. One family was involved every day to ensure there was no break. They also pledged to celebrate a Karaga festival if no one in the village suffers the infection. Venkatesh says the prayers paid off as none were infected. Monday’s thanksgiving exercise was a fulfilment of the vow, he added. Nearly half of Polenahalli’s population is from the Palliga community, which celebrates the Karaga festival. The rest comprise Kurubas, Bhovis and other communities. Venkatesh said for many years, some rituals including the Karaga festival were halted because of differences among the people, but Covid brought all of them together again. Residents point out that the Andhra Pradesh border is a stone’s throw away from the village and Polenahalli’s residents often visited the neighbouring state. About 20 youths also travel daily to Bengaluru for work and elders had asked them not to venture out of the village for about six weeks when cases were peaking. Venkatesh said that an ASHA worker visited every household in the village frequently to advise them on the need to take precautions against the disease. He said the villagers were advised to drink hot water daily and eat more greens grown in the village itself. Venkatesh said there are nearly 50 collegegoing students in the village, and they instilled confidence among people by educating them on how to protect themselves against the disease. These students also took the lead in the vaccination drive. So far, more than 200 people have been inoculated. Ramesh, a resident and journalist, said people from neighbouring villages too attended the Karaga festivities which went on till the wee hours on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/a-karaga-vow-to-beat-covid-in-kolar-village/articleshow/84484614.cms||Ranganath Krishnaswamy
---||World||UN Security Council asked to authorise more troops for Mali mission||BAMAKO: United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres has asked the Security Council to authorise additional troops for the peacekeeping mission in Mali in response to rising violence by Islamist militants, according to a report seen by Reuters. The proposed increase of 2,069 soldiers and police officers would take the authorised size of the mission, known as MINUSMA, to 17,278 uniformed personnel, the largest since it was established in 2013. Guterres made the proposal in a report to Security Council members that is dated July 15 but has not yet been released publicly. He said additional personnel were needed to respond to Islamist militants, many tied to al Qaeda and Islamic State, who have expanded their operations from their strongholds in the desert north into Mali's centre and neighbouring countries. "Scaling up MINUSMA's uniformed personnel capacity would enhance the ability of the Mission to protect civilians in central Mali and create further space for the peace process in the North," Guterres said. The additional 2,069 personnel would include 1,730 soldiers and 339 police officers. Three quick reaction force companies, comprising 750 personnel in total, and two helicopter units with 260 members would be created. In central Mali, the epicentre of the conflict in recent years, additional troops would be used to create forward operating bases "to expand the reach and mobility of the Mission", the report said. Guterres said the plan could only work in concert with stepped-up efforts by Malian authorities to bolster security and enhance governance. But the proposal comes as Malian forces increasingly pull back from the hotspots in the countryside where they have suffered steep losses, effectively ceding control to the militants. Former colonial power France has also announced plans to begin drawing down its 5,100-strong taskforce that targets the militants across West Africa's Sahel region. Meanwhile, Mali is mired in political uncertainty after military officers in May conducted their second coup in nine months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/un-security-council-asked-to-authorise-more-troops-for-mali-mission/articleshow/84486043.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi cabinet rejects list of police lawyers for farm stir||NEW DELHI: The Delhi cabinet on Friday refused to approve Delhi Police’s list of special public prosecutors for appearing in the court cases related to violence during the January 26 farmers’ protest. It observed that the process won’t be fair and impartial if the lawyers of Delhi Police, which is investigating the cases, were appointed. The cabinet decided that a panel of prosecutors appointed by the AAP government will do the job. The lieutenant-governor, Anil Baijal, had advised the AAP government to approve the Delhi Police panel. This has set the stage for an escalation in the confrontation between the state government and the LG. In a separate decision, the cabinet also refused to give its nod to another panel of three lawyers recommended by Delhi Police for the northeast Delhi riot cases. The government said in a statement that the Centre was putting pressure on the cabinet through the LG to approve the Delhi Police panel. “It is the duty of every Indian to support the farmers of the country. We have not done any favour and have only fulfilled our duty towards the farmers of the country. Farmers are not criminals or terrorists, they are our food providers,” chief minister Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi after the cabinet took the decisions. The decisions have been conveyed to the LG who may refer the matter to the President. If the LG takes that course, it will be the first such instance since the GNCTD (Amendment) Act, 2021 was passed by Parliament giving more powers to the LG. Following a similar tussle, a panel of six lawyers suggested by Delhi Police for the northeast Delhi riot cases was notified last year after the LG referred the matter to the President. Delivering a digital address, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the LG does not have the right to decide what the elected government does on this issue. “This habit of the LG to exercise veto on everything the AAP government does is against democracy, against Constitution and against the decision of the constitutional bench of the SC. It will destroy democracy,” he said. Appointing police lawyers doesn’t fall in extremely rare case category: CabinetDelhi Police had sent its lists for the cases related to the farmers’ stir and the northeast Delhi riots to home minister Satyendar Jain for approval. They had argued that the appointment of their preferred lawyers was essential in the public interest and in order to ensure effective and speedy prosecution. Jain, however, refused to give his approval "in order to protect the integrity of the legal system where the investigators and prosecutors must be independent of each other", said the government in a statement. This proposal was then sent to the LG, who refused to accept the Delhi government’s decision and asked it to reconsider and approve Delhi Police’s proposal through a cabinet meeting. The AAP government and the LG tried to sort out their differences at a meeting on July 1 where the LG expressed his disagreement with the home minister on the issue. In a subsequent letter written to the CM, he requested him to convene a meeting of the council of ministers to reconsider and decide at the earliest. The AAP government said that at the July 1 meeting, the LG had accepted that the public prosecutors appointed by the Delhi government were capable and doing good work and that no complaint had been received against them. Under Article 239AA (4), the LG can refer the matter to the President, stating that there is a difference of opinion between him and the elected government. Referring to a Supreme Court judgment on the power tussle in Delhi, the AAP government said the lieutenant governor can do that only in extremely rare cases and that if the LG invoked the power regularly, democracy won’t survive. The cabinet noted that appointment of special public prosecutors cannot fall in the category of "extremely rare cases". It requested the LG to reconsider his decision, stressing that prosecutors are meant to be independent and cannot be appointed according to the choice of police. It was necessary to maintain a distinction between the investigating agency and the prosecutorial service which is the bedrock of our criminal justice system, said the cabinet. It observed that Delhi high court and the trial courts have repeatedly raised serious questions on the investigations conducted by Delhi Police in several cases related to the northeast Delhi riots for which special public prosecutors were appointed at the request of Delhi Police. Sisodia said the LG should not become an obstructionist and let the elected Arvind Kejriwal government work. He advised the LG to use his "veto power" in only rarest-of-the-rare cases. "If you use your veto in such cases, you not only make a huge mockery of the Constitution, you also violate SC orders and attempt to destroy democracy… Please save the veto power for only rarest-ofrare cases instead of applying this power thrice a day for every good step the Delhi government takes," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-cabinet-rejects-list-of-police-lawyers-for-farm-stir/articleshow/84489388.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||India||Government buying Covishield at Rs 215, Covaxin at Rs 225||NEW DELHI: The fresh vaccine orders placed by the Centre are at a revised price of Rs 215 for Covishield and Rs 225 for a dose of Covaxin, according to an official source. “We are on path to achieving the target of 50 crore doses by July 31, this is crucial towards meeting our target coverage by end of this year,” the senior official said. Nearly 40 crore doses were administered across the country till 10pm Friday. While the Centre has indicated an availability of 13.5 crore doses for July, a fresh order of 66 crore doses for government procurement along with an additional advance payment already made by the Centre to reserve 30 crore doses of Biological E’s Covid vaccine are expected to boost supply. While the Centre was earlier procuring vaccines at Rs 150 per dose, it had indicated that it will revise vaccine prices after the changed procurement plan came into effect from 21 June. “The logistic management has to be linked at production and availability at field level, and while we appreciate the concern of states to get more vaccine doses, we must also appreciate how government of India is increasing production and parallelly ensuring that 75% of doses are given free of cost to states," health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said. On availability of Moderna vaccine in the country, the government said talks are going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govts-fresh-vax-orders-at-215-for-covishield-225-for-covaxin/articleshow/84485945.cms||---
---||India||Hindu dominance must remain intact in India: VHP on population control measures||NEW DELHI: The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Friday said any population control measure should be considered keeping in mind that the dominance of Hindus remains intact in the country. Addressing the media, VHP general secretary Milind Parande also said if there is just one child in a family, "the population of Hindus will be reduced by the Hindus themselves". "When we talk about population control, the dominance of the Hindu society must remain intact in the country. All the principles of politics, secularism and tolerance are being followed in the country because of the dominance of the Hindu population," he said when asked about the issue of population control. Hence, whatever is required to ensure that Hindus remain in the majority must be done, he added. "The Hindu society must think that there should be at least two children in a family. If there will be just one child in a family, the population of Hindus will be reduced by the Hindus themselves," Parande said. He was addressing the media ahead of a two-day meeting of the VHP's governing council and board of trustees, scheduled to begin in Faridabad on Saturday. Parande's comments on the issue came after the VHP recently asked the Uttar Pradesh government to remove the one-child policy norm from its draft population control bill, saying it is likely to lead to furthering of the imbalance between different communities and contraction of the population as well. Sharing the agenda of the two-day meeting, the VHP general secretary said government control over the management of a number of temples, illegal religious conversions and the post-poll violence in West Bengal are among the key issues for discussion. Elections for the VHP's new president and general secretary will also be held during the two-day meeting, he added. Vishnu Sadashiv Kokje, the current president of the VHP, was elected to the post in April 2018. Parande said temples should be managed by the society but a large number of temples are under the control of the government in several states. The two-day meeting will discuss how to free these temples from government control, he added. "From social awakening to knocking the doors of the Supreme Court to free temples from government control -- all these possible measures will be discussed at the meeting," the VHP leader said. He said the meeting will also discuss the issue of illegal religious conversions and the need for the enactment of a central law to put a check on such activities across the country. "Illegal religious conversions are being carried out by the Christian missionaries and the Islamic jihadi elements. It is a nationwide problem. We will discuss this matter at our meeting and come up with a proposal," Parande said. Replying to a question on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's recent remark on Muslims, he said there is no difference in opinion between the RSS and the VHP. "The RSS chief has neither said anything new nor anything different. Our ideological line is still the same. There is no difference between us," he said. Urging Muslims not to get "trapped in the cycle of fear" about Islam being in danger in India, Bhagwat recently said those asking Muslims to leave the country cannot call themselves Hindus and those indulging in lynching people in the name of cows must know that they are against Hindutva.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hindu-dominance-must-remain-intact-in-india-vhp-on-population-control-measures/articleshow/84485899.cms||---
---||World||Lawyer in Vatican abuse trial says no evidence of misconduct||ROME: The lawyer for a former altar boy accused of sexually abusing a younger boy at the Vatican's youth seminary asked a Vatican court to absolve her client Friday, saying there was no evidence of misconduct and that "this trial never should have occurred." In her closing arguments, attorney Rita Claudia Baffioni said the seven-month age difference between alleged victim and aggressor, who were 13 and 14 at the start of the alleged abuse, made the charges of an abuse of authority against the Rev Gabriele Martinelli not credible. The trial has put the spotlight on the St Pius X seminary, located inside the Vatican gardens, which houses boys aged 12-to-18 who serve as altar boys at papal Masses in St Peter's Basilica. The scandal erupted in 2017 when former altar boys went public with allegations of misconduct against Martinelli and a cover-up by the seminary superiors, a Vatican cardinal and the archdiocese of Como, which is responsible for the seminary. Pope Francis waived the statute of limitations to let the trial go ahead, and recently ordered the seminary to move out of Vatican City while letting its students continue to serve at St Peter's. The tribunal president, Giuseppe Pignatone, said a verdict against Martinelli and the former rector of the seminary, Don Enrico Radice, would be returned October 6. Martinelli is accused of abusing his authority as a more senior seminarian to force a younger seminarian, identified as LG, into "carnal acts'' of sodomy and masturbation, using violence and threats, from 2007 to 2012. Radice is accused of covering up the crimes after LG complained. Prosecutors have asked for a conviction and six-year prison sentence for Martinelli, and a four-year sentence for Radice, whose lawyer on Thursday asked the court to absolve her client, saying there was no evidence that Radice knew of any abuse. In her closing arguments, Baffioni noted that Francis' decree removing the statute of limitations was based on claims of abuse by an adult on a minor. But Baffioni said there was no evidence of abuse while Martinelli was an adult and LG was a minor. "This trial should have never taken place,'' she said. She said the victim's testimony that he suffered abuse for years wasn't credible, nor his argument that he didn't object because Martinelli promised to let him serve at papal Masses. She noted that only one former seminarian testified that he witnessed Martinelli's behavior, but without providing any evidence. "We're talking about the first 10 years of the 2000s, with kids who have cellphones, make videos, who aren't so fragile that in order to serve a Mass they accept to be abused three times a week for six years,'' she said. "Objectively, it's difficult to believe.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/lawyer-in-vatican-abuse-trial-says-no-evidence-of-misconduct/articleshow/84486706.cms||---

And I am the product of special expert visas and family migration -- among the many types of legal immigration into the US," were the opening remarks of Dr Sudip Parikh, CEO, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Parikh was testifying before the House subcommittee on immigration and citizenship. A group of US lawmakers recently held a hearing titled 'Oh, Canada! How outdated US immigration policies push top talent to other countries.' The objective was to understand how Canada’s immigration laws and procedures are helping it to attract top talent, these learnings in turn could perhaps spur the necessary immigration reforms in the US. Parikh’s uncle was the first in the family to set foot on American soil. He, in turn, sponsored his brother, who moved from Mumbai to a town in North Carolina in 1968. "My parents worked in furniture factories and textile mills to put us through college and ensure we had opportunities… We exist because of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 and our parent's belief in the vision of the US as a shining city on a hill," stated Parikh. From Albert Einstein to Katalin Karikó, a biochemist from Hungary whose research on mRNA technology and therapies has led to the development of Covid-19 vaccines, the list of immigrant scientists and experts in the technology field is illustrious. Parikh mentioned that according to the National Science Foundation, over 50 per cent of postdocs and 28 per cent of science and engineering faculty in the US are immigrants. Of the Nobel Prizes in chemistry, medicine, and physics awarded to Americans since 2000, 38 per cent were awarded to immigrants to the US. He referred to Canada’s highly successful Express Entry program which helps the country attract highly skilled workers. Last year, the United Kingdom released a roadmap for research and development. A critical component to this roadmap is visa and immigration reforms to create new paths for highly skilled scientists and researchers to study and work. In the context of immigration, Parikh said, "We must attract the best students and R&D talent from around the world." He referred to various statistics. For instance, early data shows promising signs that applications from foreign nationals to study in the US is again on the rise after years of declining rates. The Institute of International Education (IIE) recently released the results of its fourth survey (Covid-19 Snapshot Series), which showed a 43 per cent rise in the number of applications from foreign students for higher education for the 2021-22 academic year. In the US, a considerable proportion of science and engineering degrees -- especially at the doctorate level (34 per cent) -- go to international students, many of whom remain in the US after graduating. "I am not an immigration specialist and I know that matters of immigration can be challenging for many reasons, but it is critical that our immigration policies reflect a 21st century approach in the same way that Congress is now working on legislation to advance research and innovation in critical technologies to compete with China," he mentioned, adding that postdocs and early-career researchers will go where the opportunities are. The US has always been that place -- AKA the land of opportunity -- and must continue to be that place. If not, it is the nation that would suffer. He called upon members of the subcommittee to look at the array of recommendations made by higher education groups such as the Association of American Universities and NAFSA and professional scientific societies -- many of them affiliated to AAAS. Some of these recommendations include:  Expand dual intent visas to include foreign student visas to allow them the option to apply for permanent residency. Adjust post-graduation immigration law to ease entry to work for skilled graduates. Some organisations have recommended proposals to 'staple a green card' to international students graduating with a diploma in specific, targeted fields of study to meet US demands.  Continue to exempt higher education and research institutions from the H-1B visa caps.  Preserve the 'duration of status' policy that provides flexibility for foreign students and exchange visitors to complete their studies.

Whenever allowed, she stepped out, trained on her own and stayed fit. If she needed motivation, her coaches stepped up. In-between, there were friendlies against Uzbekistan and Belarus with the national team which Castanha missed due to a knee injury. She is fit again, eager to make a mark for club and country. “It is a proud moment for every women footballer in India to move a step ahead and play in the AFC Women's Club Championship,” Castanha told TOI on Friday. “After the Indian Women’s League (IWL), we have seen a lot of difference in our game. The AFC tournament is a huge platform. It could pave the way for several other opportunities.” The AFC Women's Club Championship 2021 is a pilot project where an Indian club will take part for the first time. Gokulam Kerala have been handed the chance to represent the country, and even though the club hasn’t played a competitive game since their IWL triumph, Castanha believes they can measure up to the challenge in October. “Overall, women’s football has changed a lot. Day by day, we are improving. We are doing well,” said Castanha, who also has her eyes set on the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup at home. “I believe we can compete in Asia. We can perform and pick up valuable experience (from the tournament). I feel we can do it.” In the last two editions of IWL, Gokulam Kerala have been among the more consistent teams. They lost the semi-finals against Manipur Police in 2019 but came back stronger the next year to defeat Kryphsa FC in the final. “Our team’s aim has always been to emerge champions. It was heart-breaking to lose in the semifinal in the third edition and we promised ourselves that we will win the next year. We won. Now we want to achieve more in the AFC tournament,” said Castanha. The defender captained a team that had several top-notch performers, notably Nepal international Sabitra Bhandari and strike partner Kamala Devi, both of whom got the goals effortlessly. They had quality all over the pitch and will now have to assemble again for the tough Asia assignment. The AFC Women's Club Championship 2021 will feature eight teams from eight different countries and will be played between October 30 to November 14. The only club among Indian Super League and I-League to field a women’s team in IWL, Gokulam Kerala will be in group B (west) where they will take on the might of clubs from Iran, Jordan and Uzbekistan, while group A will consist of clubs from Chinese Taipei, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/indias-women-footballers-can-compete-in-asia-michel-castanha/articleshow/84486945.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Ten seasons ago, with the clock ticking on the final day and arch-rivals Manchester United seemingly assured of the Premier League title, Sergio Aguero smashed home the winner against Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in injury time and heralded a new era for City with their first triumph. Since that goal, City have won the Premier League title five times in the last ten seasons. Aguero has now left to join FC Barcelona, but the Argentinean striker’s goal is being remembered with a special jersey for this season. “For City, it was very clear that we had to celebrate the magic moment from that season because it was such a game changer,” Ulrich Planer, senior graphic designer for all apparel at Puma Teamsport, told TOI in an exclusive interview on Friday. “At the beginning of every season, we get together as a team, collect ideas and think what we can do (with the jerseys). We look at history (of the club), special moments. We did some research, looked at the videos and came up with a design. The first design we presented was accepted by the club.” The home jersey for this season features the 93:20 scoreboard pattern, a fitting tribute to the goal that changed everything for City. The timestamp of that goal is printed on the inside of the collar while number 10, made famous by Aguero, is highlighted within the same number. Aguero brought an end to his illustrious 10-year career at Etihad as he joined Barcelona on a free transfer last month. The Argentinean striker will not get to wear the jersey in an official game for City, but he’ll continue to be remembered. “Aguero didn’t know (about the new jersey). It was a surprise parting gift for him,” said Planer, whose first jersey design was for Borussia Dortmund in 2012-13 when the German side made it to the Champions League final for the first time since they won the competition in 1997. The new City jersey is textured with a traditional scoreboard pattern with a white stripe on either side. 93:20 remains prominently on the collar. “If UEFA rules permitted, we could have had 93:20 bigger, right in front,” said Planer. “Rules allowed only on the collar. We are not allowed to put it anywhere else. When you put the jersey on the hanger, it looks fantastic. 93:20 looks straight at you.” 93:20 should remind everyone of Aguero, a club legend whose greatest moment at the Etihad came in the last minute of his first season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/manchester-citys-new-jersey-is-a-surprise-parting-gift-for-aguero/articleshow/84487036.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The Goa Cricket Association has decided to continue with him after a year's break due to Covid-19 pandemic. The 34-year-old Sangli resident has coached India opener Smriti Mandhana in her formative years. "I am happy with the responsibilities given to me. I know most of the girls as this is my second stint. We have achieved some good results and this group of 29 girls, we will be ready for the next assignment," said Tambavekar Goa finished second behind Andhra Pradesh in the Elite Group C of the Women's Senior One-Day Trophy. "Working with Smriti has helped me understand women's cricket better. I was amazed with the kind of talent pool Goa had when I came here for the first time and for me, it is a continuous work. We have great talent and must strive for better," said Tambavekar. The team didn't train due to Covid restrictions for almost three months and the first task for Tambavekar would be to get them match fit. "We had a meeting a couple of days ago. The girls will train in two groups in the afternoon as we have to follow government SOP. The next tournament will start on September 21. It gives us a good time to get ready," said Tambavekar. Those in the know said GCA may send the team to Bengaluru and Puducherry if monsoon plays spoilsport. "The game is the same, but approach and mindset (for men and women) are different. Women's cricket is more about skills and touch. So, we must groom players keeping in mind those aspects. Things are changing but the basic remains same," said Tambavekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tambavekar-returns-to-coach-goa/articleshow/84487072.cms||Paresh Mokani

The Toronto-based company's Psiphon Network receives US government financial support and also helped people in other countries including Iran and China overcome governmental restrictions on internet access. Thousands of Cubans joined nationwide protests over shortages of basic goods, limits on civil liberties and the government's handling of a surge in Covid-19 infections on Sunday, the most significant unrest in decades in the communist-run country. Psiphon said 1.389 million users accessed the open web from Cuba through its network on Thursday, as well as 1.238 million as noon EDT (1600 GMT) on Friday. "Internet is ON; circumvention tools ARE working," Psiphon said in a statement. Psiphon said the roughly 1.4 million represents about 20% of Cuban internet users. Its open source circumvention tool can be downloaded from app stores like Google Play or Apple to "maximize your chances of bypassing censorship," according to the company. Canadian university researchers developed the software in 2007 to let users evade governmental internet firewalls. Cuba's government has restricted access to platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp amid the protests, according to global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks. "We must stand with those opposing authoritarian regimes," said US Senator Marsha Blackburn, a congressional supporter of US funding for the network. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that the White House is reviewing whether the US government can help Cubans regain internet access. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki sidestepped questions on Friday about the effort or whether Biden's administration has reached out to US tech firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/censorship-circumvention-tool-helps-1-4-million-cubans-get-internet-access/articleshow/84486862.cms||---
---||World||New York street named after Indian origin community leader||Last month, a formal and elaborate ceremony was held at Queen's Richmond Hill, New York City, to unveil a street sign named after Pandit Ramlall, a popular Indian Guyanese and Indian American community and religious leader. New York City council woman Adrienne Adams had presented the proposal to rename the street after Ramlall, who died in January 2019, for approval. It was accepted without dissension and signed into law by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ramlall was active during the independence movement of Guyana and migrated to the US in 1979, and worked at a hospital in Brooklyn. He was a trade unionist who organised workers at the hospital. He was also well known in New York among politicians and Indo-Caribbean community leaders. He hailed from Skeldon in Region Six (East Berbice-Corentyne) in Guyana. Ramlall taught himself Hindi, and later taught the subject at the Tagore Memorial School in Guyana. He was head of the Arya Samaj movement in Upper Corentyne. In 1974, Ramlall left Guyana to study Hindi at an Indian university, where he received a diploma. In New York, he was active in the Arya Samaj movement and helped in founding two Arya Samaj Mandirs and played a role in the formation of the confederation of Arya Samaj Mandirs. He was also closely involved in the launch of the Phagwah parade and Ramayana in the Park. An accredited pandit, he also performed wedding ceremonies for many Guyanese, Trinidadians, and Indians. Ashook Ramsaran, president of Indian Diaspora Council and chair of the Pandit Ramlall Way Street Naming Committee, led the campaign to name the street after Ramlall. Ramsaran takes pride in achieving this remarkable success and feels it is a well-deserved tribute to the late pandit. "Unveiling of the Pandit Ramlall Way street sign was a wonderful celebration and a tribute to a man we respect and admire. Once in a while during our lifetime, we discover a shining jewel among us and it is our duty to give well-deserved admiration, respect, tribute and recognition – that is, to make a lasting tribute and remembrance to the life and legacy of the late Dharmacharya Pandit Ramlall," he said. He led a team of dedicated members who developed an extensive dossier justifying the street name in honour of Ramlall. "We have put it on the map, always visible to everyone and be remembered for generations. June 27, 2021, will be remembered as another historic moment of recognition for Guyanese Americans in New York following the unveiling of Ramesh Kalicharran Way, Officer Jonathan Narain Way, Punjab Ave and Gurdwara Way and Little Guyana Avenue – in Queens, New York."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-york-street-named-after-indian-origin-community-leader/articleshow/84486709.cms||Ishani Duttagupta

Nelamangala police suspect Muniyappa, 60, and his wife Lakshmamma, 55, both residents of Visveswarapura, committed suicide by consuming poison or overdosing on some tablets. Muniyappa sold corn in a push cart. Neighbours saw the couple on July 11 and on Thursday noticed foul smell coming from their house. They informed police, who rushed to the spot and found the bodies.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru Urban ranks 24th in contact tracing, Haveri on top||HAVERI: Although the positivity rate in Haveri is among the lowest in the state, the district’s fatality rate was worryingly high, until recently. However, the district administration’s concerted efforts have helped check Covid-19 fatalities here.  Furthermore, the vigilant attitude of the authorities concerned has put Haveri on top in terms of success in contact tracing. On average, nearly 14 contacts, half of whom are primary ones, are being traced for each patient confirmed infected with Covid-19. Ironically, health minister G Sudhakar’s home district, Chikkaballapura, is at the bottom of the list, with fewer than three people who have been in contact with the infected patient being traced. Bengaluru Urban is at the 24th spot. Haveri additional deputy commissioner S Yogishwar said that efforts in tracing those who had come in contact with infected patients had helped check the transmission of the novel coronavirus. Admitting lack of cooperation from the public was among the major obstacles to the process, he said, “But ASHA workers, along with health department staff and accountants in villages, have been working in tandem with each other to ensure people who’ve been in contact with Covid patients are subjected to RT-PCR test and isolate themselves till they get the results.” Haveri zilla panchayat chief executive officer Mohammad Roshan attributed the success of district authorities to micro-management. “Panchayat development officers are working with staff from other departments and helping trace contacts of infected patients, particularly during the second wave. The gram panchayat task force has been working hard too. We have exceeded our target in terms of tracing contacts, which has helped check positivity rate, especially in rural areas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-urban-ranks-24th-in-contact-tracing-haveri-on-top/articleshow/84484557.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Tasked with shedding 10kg in 1 year, 250 cops take weight test||BENGALURU: Around 250 personnel from the Bengaluru battalion of Karnataka State Reserve Police were seen standing on weighing machines with their fingers crossed as doctors checked their weight at KSRP Ground in Koramangala on Friday. The reason for their anxiety: They had been tasked with shedding 10kg in a span of one year after they were found overweight during health camps. Additional director general of police (ADGP), KSRP, Alok Kumar had warned them if they failed to reduce weight, their promotions and other incentives would be withheld. Most of the men ran for 5km every day under watch and also went through a strict regimen prescribed by dieticians. Their results will be known by Saturday. Around 450 sleuths from different battalions of the state had been found overweight about two years ago and were given a similar task. While 400 of the personnel were successful in reducing weight in one year, about 50 failed to reach the target. Their promotions and other incentives have been temporarily withheld. Alok Kumar said the general health conditions of KSRP personnel were poor. “Tentatively, around 60% deaths of on-duty KSRP personnel are due to health issues like diabetes and cardiac problems, and most of them are overweight. In a bid to keep the general health conditions good, we decided to hold regular health camps. Doctors at such camps identified overweight as a common but major issue,” he said. Also, 50 personnel were found to be addicted to alcohol and tobacco a year ago across the state and were shifted to a de-addiction centre and treated for over three months. “Except five, the rest have kicked the habit,” Kumar added. In all, there are 10,500 personnel with KSRP in the state and of them, 10,490 have been administered both doses of Covid-19 vaccine, Kumar said. “A detailed report on health conditions of the 250 personnel who were examined on Friday will come by Saturday. After studying it, we can decide on further action,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tasked-with-shedding-10kg-in-1-yr-250-cops-take-weight-test/articleshow/84484542.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Robbers used two minor boysto sell 35 stolen mobiles||BENGALURU: Nine men who were arrested recently for robbing people of their mobile phones and from whom 100 stolen handsets were recovered had allegedly used two juveniles for disposing of around 35 stolen phones — including via online platforms — probe has revealed. The two minor boys were produced before a juvenile court and sent to a reformatory, police said. The boys are suspected to have sold at least four-five mobile phones online through an e-commerce platform and got the money transferred to the account of the one of the nine suspects. Police said the suspects thought they could avoid detection by using the juveniles and also felt it would be easy for minor boys to peddle sob stories while selling the devices. “The accused knew that minors can’t be detained in police stations for questioning,” police said. “We contacted the persons who purchased the mobiles from the juveniles online. One of them, a private firm employee from Hebbagodi, said the boy who sold him the mobile claimed he was doing so to raise money towards his school fee. Since the seller was a minor and cited academic reasons, I did not suspect anything amiss. I paid Rs 4,000 online after purchasing the mobile from the boy near Anekal,” the buyer told cops. Police said the juveniles were old friends of the accused. “They live in same locality. The arrested accused are a little older than the juveniles. They became friends while playing cricket in local grounds. Smoking and liquor bound them together,” an investigating officer said. Asked about the educational background of the two juveniles, another investigating officer said, “One is a primary school dropout, while the other dropped out before entering class 10. Their parents are daily-wage workers. These juveniles would take up odd jobs and earn some money,” he said. “Being locals, the juveniles were well acquainted with the floating population in the form of construction workers, truck drivers and employees of industries. They targeted outsiders, knowing they would have a tough time in identifying the sellers. Another reason was that outsiders would often shift back to their hometowns in the pandemic situation,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/robbers-used-2-minor-boysto-sell-35-stolen-mobiles/articleshow/84484450.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Lakhan Kumar was working as a cleaner when he was abandoned by the driver here in July last year. He had gone without food for 10 days when he was found. “When we reached the Mangaluru Junction railway station in our ambulance, Kumar was exhausted due to starvation. He was afraid to come out of the shed due to fear of police and the pandemic. He was mentally depressed too. We immediately took him to a hospital and later shifted him to our rehabilitation centre,” said Mohammed Asif, founder of Maimuna Foundation. “We provided him food and took care of him at our centre for nearly a year before sending him back to his family in Agu Chapra village in Siwan.” Had come in search of jobKumar had come to Mangaluru in search of a job and he was making ends meet till the lockdown. Left to fend for himself, without food or a place to stay, Kumar became depressed. After days of wandering, he took shelter in the shed at the railway station. Even while recovering at the foundation, he failed to give details of his family. In September 2020, the organisation had rehabilitated a mentally disturbed man who was roaming the streets, with the help of Dakshina Kannada Anjana Patel Samaj. Using their wide network across the country, the Samaj had found the man’s family in Jodhpur and sent him back. When members of the group saw Kumar at the foundation’s centre, they sent out feelers again. “With the help of Patel Samaj president Panch Ram and other members, Lakhan Kumar’s family was traced to Siwan. His brother Adhiraj Chouhan came here and took him back on July 15,” Asif said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/bihar-man-stranded-in-mluru-rejoins-family/articleshow/84486049.cms||Vinobha K T

At a news conference with German chancellor Angela Merkel, Biden was asked about ending restrictions that bar most European visitors from entering the United States. Biden said Thursday that a team that is advising him on the pandemic "brought that subject up. It's in the process of (considering) how soon we can lift the ban ... and I will be able to answer that question to you within the next several days." An official with the US travel association, a trade group for the broader tourism industry, praised Biden's comments. "The science says we can safely reopen international travel now, particularly for countries that have made considerable progress toward vaccinating their citizens," said Tori Emerson Barnes, the travel group's executive vice president of policy, citing studies that concluded there is a low risk of transmitting the virus during flights. "Each day that outdated restrictions on travel exist wreaks economic damage on our nation." Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US carriers, said "the time for action is now" to reopen to international visitors. The group noted that the US allows travel to and from Mexico, where less than one-third of the population is vaccinated, while severely restricting travel from Canada and the United Kingdom, two countries with relatively high vaccination rates. The rise and prevalence of Covid-19 variants in Europe, especially the delta mutation that is also spreading throughout the US, has caused the Biden administration to tread slowly about increasing transatlantic travel. Last month, secretary of state Antony Blinken said the administration was anxious to restore travel "as fully and quickly as possible," but said he couldn't put a date on reopening the country. "We have to be guided by the science, by medical expertise." Most of continental Europe has relaxed restrictions on Americans who are fully vaccinated, although the United Kingdom still requires quarantines for most visitors arriving from the US Airlines say, however, that the lack of two-way travel is limiting the number of flights they can offer and seats they can sell. In recent months, US airlines have started new service to European countries that are open to American visitors. Delta launched new or resumed service to Greece, Iceland and Croatia, which opened early to vaccinated foreigners. In some cases, Americans who tested negative for the virus were able to skip quarantine requirements that were in place for other visitors. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said this week that bookings by Americans surged when those countries reopened and others followed. "The problem is, there are only Americans that we are carrying in (to Europe) and carrying out," Bastian told The Associated Press. With most Europeans unable to enter the US, Delta has been forced to keep its transatlantic capacity at around half the level it was before the pandemic, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/biden-comment-hints-at-boosting-travel-between-us-and-europe/articleshow/84487475.cms||---

The Afghan president had accused networks and organisations in Pakistan of supporting the Taliban while addressing an international conference on ‘Central and South Asia Regional Connectivity: Challenges and Opportunities’ in Uzbekistan. Ghani claimed that the destruction of the assets and capabilities of the Afghan people are openly celebrated in Pakistan. It was an indirect reference to rallies that were recently held in the cities of Peshawar in the northwest and Quetta in the southwest by the Pakistani sympathizers of the Taliban in support of the insurgent group. Ghani, quoting intelligence estimates, said that around 10,000 jihadi fighters had entered into Afghanistan from Pakistan and other places in the past one month apart from the support of their affiliates in the transnational terrorist organizations. Disappointed over Ghani’s remarks, Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan responded at the same conference, saying it was unfair to blame Pakistan for the Afghan situation. Khan claimed that no country has tried harder than Pakistan to bring the Taliban to the table for dialogue. "We have made every effort, short of taking military action against the Taliban in Pakistan, to get them on the dialogue table and to have a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan," he said. "To blame Pakistan for what is going on in Afghanistan is extremely unfair," Khan added. He also said that Taliban was no longer willing to compromise after the US gave a date for withdrawal of troops. "When there were 1,50,000 Nato troops that was the time to ask the Taliban to come to the table. Why were the Taliban going to compromise once the exit date was given? Why would they listen to us when they are sensing a victory?" Islamabad also rejected Afghan vice-president’s allegations that Pakistan was providing close air support to militants after they took control of a key border crossing with the country’s Balochistan province. On Thursday evening, Saleh had posted on Twitter: "Pakistan Air Force had issued an "official warning" to the Afghan Army and Air Force that "any move to dislodge the Taliban from Spin Boldak area will be faced and repelled by the Pakistan Air Force." The Taliban took control of the Spin Boldak border crossing with Pakistan in Kandahar province earlier this week. Saleh also claimed that Kabul has proof of the PAF providing air support to the insurgents in "certain areas and said he was willing to share evidence of his allegations. "Afghan aircrafts, as far as 10km from the Spin Boldak border crossing, are warned to back off or face air-to-air missiles," the Afghan official claimed. Pakistan’s foreign office responded to Saleh’s posts in a statement, saying its air force was restricted to protecting the country’s air space. "The Afghan side conveyed to Pakistan its intention of carrying out air operation inside its territory opposite Chaman Sector of Pakistan," read the statement. "Pakistan responded positively to Afghan government’s right to act in its territory. In spite of very close border operations normally not acceded to by internationally accepted norms/standards/procedures, Pakistan took necessary measures within its territory to safeguard our own troops and population," the foreign office said. The statement said that Pakistan acknowledged the Afghan government’s "right to undertake actions on its sovereign territory". Saleh reacted to the Pakistani statement by calling it a "pre-written paragraph". "For over 20 years Pakistan denied the existence of Quetta Shura or presence of Taliban terrorist leaders on its soil. Those familiar with this pattern, Afghan or foreign, know exactly that issuing a statement of denial is just a pre-written paragraph," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/kabul-islamabad-faceoff-over-taliban/articleshow/84487224.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The agency raided the premises of two then divisional commissioners of Kashmir (including Iqbal); then deputy commissioner, Srinagar; then assistant commissioner, Nazool, Srinagar and then tehsildar, Nazool, Srinagar and the accused (private person/beneficiary) in an ongoing investigation of the case, as per an official release. A special judge had issued the search warrant. Incriminating documents including conferment of ownership rights, documents pertaining to several immovable properties located at Srinagar, Jammu and New Delhi, fixed deposits of more than Rs 25 lakh, cash of Rs 2 lakh (approximately), keys of six bank lockers and a number of bank accounts have been unearthed, the release added. The CBI had registered a case — the Roshni scam — on the directions of the J&K high court. It was alleged that ownership rights of state land, measuring around seven kanals and seven marlas, at a prime location in Srinagar were conferred arbitrarily on an ineligible applicant at a throwaway price, causing huge loss to the state exchequer. It was further alleged that the land category was also arbitrarily changed by the then public servants who were members of the price fixation committee (PFC). Iqbal was among the prominent bureaucrats in J&K, who had risen to the position of divisional commissioner, Kashmir. Soon after retirement, he joined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and contested assembly elections from Bhaderwah constituency in 2014. Though he lost the elections, Iqbal was nominated as general secretary of PDP. He was also appointed chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) during the BJP-PDP government in the erstwhile state. However, after the PDP-BJP government fell in 2018, Iqbal gave up his primary membership of PDP and joined the National Conference (NC).

Six F-35Bs will be stationed at the Air SDF's Nyutabaru Air Base in fiscal year 2024, with two more to be added in fiscal year 2025, Nikkei Asia reported. The decision, which was announced by Japanese defence Minister Nobuo Kishi on Friday, comes as tensions escalate near the Senakaku Islands due to increased military activity by China. Senkaku Islands are part of the Nansei chain and are claimed by Beijing. The Japanese Defence Ministry briefed local authorities of the plan on Thursday. "It is extremely important to have the support of the local community," Kishi said. China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions. Recently, tensions between China and Japan have escalated amid increased activity by Beijing in the disputed East China Sea. Earlier this year, Beijing implemented a new law that allows the country's quasi-military coast guard to use weapons against foreign ships that China sees as illegally entering its waters. Japan has reported over 20 intrusions by Chinese ships in the waters around the island chain in 2021 so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/japan-to-deploy-fighter-jets-to-ramp-up-nansei-islands-defence/articleshow/84487692.cms||---
---||World||Most dangerous place in world for mediapersons||ISLAMABAD: The killing of Pulitzer prize-winning Indian photojournalist Danish Siddiqui in Afghanistan’s Spin Boldak town on the border with Pakistan is a stark reminder for working journalists of the risks involved with covering war in the Af-Pak region described by rights and media bodies as the most dangerous place in the world for media professionals. While Siddiqui lost his life after being caught in a crossfire of Taliban and Afghan security forces, a vast majority of those killed on both sides of the Pak-Afghan border were systematically murdered for failing to give up their passion for independent journalism. The Afghan militants and their affiliates in Pakistan, time and again, warn media workers against what they term as “biased and irresponsible reporting”. Newat Rawan, a high-profile Afghan television journalist, was shot dead in Kandahar city in May this year, a day after the Taliban issued warning to journalists against portraying them in a negative manner. At least 11 Afghan journalists were killed last year, with five more reportedly murdered this year by unknown assailants, according to Amnesty International. In early March, three female media workers were gunned down in the eastern city of Jalalabad. Around 1,000 Afghan media workers have left their jobs in the past six months, Afghan Journalists' Safety Committee, a body for protection of journalists, recently said. Afghan civil society members denounce the killing of journalists as a campaign of terror against those who criticise religious obscurantism. The attacks on media workers had significantly increased in Afghanistan after the US started peace talks with the Taliban in Doha. While members of Afghanistan’s educated class — including journalists, activists and judges — have for months been the target of bombings and shootings, many went into hiding or left the country after the US and Nato began withdrawal of their remaining troops in Afghanistan. The American pullout was coupled with Taliban victories in many districts of the war-torn country.

Principal secretary (animal & sheep husbandry), Naveen Kumar Choudhary said the “advisory” issued earlier has been misquoted as a ban order. “It is just an advisory, not a ban order and it has been issued by the Animal Welfare Board asking the concerned to comply with animal laws and the same has been forwarded by the director planning,” he said. The clarification comes after several Muslim bodies across the valley strongly protested an order issued earlier by the Animal Welfare Board, seeking to prohibit illegal killing of cows and camels on Eid-ul-Adha. In a communication addressed to divisional commissioners and IGPs of Jammu as well as Kashmir, the J&K Animal and Sheep Husbandry and Fisheries Department had sought a ban on illegal killing of cows, calves, camels on the occasion of the Muslim festival. “The Animal Welfare Board of India, in view of animal welfare has requested for implementation of all precautionary measures to strictly implement the Animal Welfare Laws viz. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960; Transport of Animal Welfare Rules, 1978; Transport of Animals (Amendment) Rules, 2001; Slaughter House Rules, 2001; Municipal Laws & Food Safety & Standards Authority of India directions for slaughtering of animals (under which camels cannot be slaughtered) during the festival,” the communication read. Mufti Azam Mufti Nasir-ul-Islam said, even otherwise Kashmiri Muslims do not sacrifice cows or camels on Eid-ul-Adha because of the cultural traditions. “So, there was no need for raising such an issue at the time when the country requires development and should focus on other larger issues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-ban-in-jk-on-animal-slaughter-on-eid-administration/articleshow/84487826.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Biden picks former Sen. Tom Udall for New Zealand ambassador||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is nominating former New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall to serve as his ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa. Udall, a Democrat, retired in 2021 after two terms in the Senate representing New Mexico. He spent five terms in the House and served as New Mexico's attorney general. He comes from a family well known for public service: his father Stewart Udall served as interior secretary, his uncle Mo Udall was a congressman from Colorado and his cousin Mark Udall was a senator from Colorado. “Having dedicated my life to public service and having served as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee focusing on policies that promote democracy, international development, and conservation, I am honoured to be nominated by President Biden to this next role serving our great country," Udall said in a statement. Biden is also expected to nominate Democratic fundraiser Jane Hartley to serve as his ambassador to the United Kingdom, according to a person familiar with the decision who was not authorized tocomment publicly. It was not immediately clear when the White House would formally announce the appointment of Hartley, who served as ambassador to France and Monaco during the Obama administration. She was a significant fundraiser for Biden's 2020 run for the White House. The White House declined to comment about Hartley's pending nomination, which was first reported by the Washington Post. Hartley served as chief executive of the economic and political advisory firm Observatory Group, director of congressional relations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and in the Carter administration. She is married to Ralph Schlosstein, chief executive of investment bank Evercore. The UK ambassadorship is one of the highest profiles diplomatic postings and often comes with an expectation that the nominee can foot the bill for entertaining on behalf of the United States. Former President Donald Trump turned to New York Jets owner Robert “Woody” Johnson for the London posting. Barack Obama turned to businessman Matthew Barzun and lawyer Louis Susman during his time in office. Robert Tuttle, a Californian who made his money in the car dealership business, held the post under George W Bush. Biden is also considering nominating Democratic fundraiser George Tsunis, founder and CEO of Chartwell Hotels, to serve as ambassador to Greece, according to the person familiar with the White House deliberations. Tsunis was nominated by Obama in 2013 to serve as ambassador to Norway but gave up on consideration after a difficult Senate confirmation hearing. Tsunis acknowledged during the hearing that he had not visited Norway and mistakenly referred to the country's head of government as “president” rather than “prime minister.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-picks-former-sen-tom-udall-for-new-zealand-ambassador/articleshow/84485820.cms||---

Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir range, Vijay Kumar said the slain terrorists, identified as Ahmed Sofi and Bilal Ahmed, were from Natipora area of the city. They had joined terror ranks on December 14 last year. Kumar said the duo was involved in three crimes committed last month and police were tracking their movement. “We got a lead about them on Thursday after which joint teams of CRPF and police cordoned off Eidgah area. We appealed to them to surrender but they refused. Following their refusal an encounter took place in which both were killed,” he said, adding that the two were earlier affiliated to Lashkar-e-Taiba and had later switched over to ISJK. In the gunfight, two CRPF men were also injured. They were admitted to a hospital where their condition is stated to be stable. Kumar said with this latest operation, 78 terrorists have been killed this year so far in various encounters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-isjk-terrorists-killed-in-downtown-srinagar/articleshow/84487875.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Connectivity an act of trust, India reminds China and Pakistan||NEW DELHI: In a fairly direct reference to China’s BRI initiative, foreign minister S Jaishankar said on Friday that connectivity efforts must be based on economic viability and financial responsibility and should promote economic activity and not create debt burdens. While the comment was seen as a dig at China’s BRI — with several African and Asian nations smarting from the downside of Chinese largesse — Jaishankar also reminded Pakistan that connectivity cannot be a one-way street. As Pakistan PM Imran Khan claimed that the “unsettled dispute” over J&K was blocking connectivity initiatives, Jaishankar said the real issues were of mindsets, not of disputes. Jaishankar was speaking at a south and central Asia connectivity summit in Uzbekistan that was attended also by Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani, Pakistan PM Imran Khan and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. “Blocking connectivity in practice while professing support in principle benefits no one. A one-sided view of trade rights and obligations can never work,” he said, adding that India’s operationalisation of the Chabahar port in Iran has provided a “secure, viable and unhindered access” to the sea for central Asian countries. Jaishankar said building connectivity was an act of trust and must, at the minimum, conform to international law. “Respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity are the most basic principles of international relations,” he said, adding that connectivity must be consultative, transparent and participatory. India has repeatedly said that China’s CPEC undermines India’s sovereignty as it passes through the disputed Gilgit-Baltistan region. “Economic growth is universally driven by 3Cs: connectivity, commerce and contacts. All three need to come together to ensure regional cooperation and prosperity. The challenge we face is that politics, vested interests and instability can be formidable impediments to its realisation,” said Jaishankar.  The minister said for reliable connectivity within and through Afghanistan, the world must have confidence in its governance. Jaishankar described as a welcome development the formation of the India-Uzbekistan-Iran-Afghanistan Quadrilateral working group on the joint use of Chabahar port. He said India has proposed to include the Chabahar port in the framework of the International North-South Transport Corridor — a 7,200-km-long transport project for moving freight among India, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, central Asia and Europe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/connectivity-an-act-of-trust-india-reminds-china-and-pakistan/articleshow/84487919.cms||---
---||World||US to send first vaccine doses to Africa in coming days||WASHINGTON: The US will begin making its first Covid-19 vaccine shipments to Africa in the coming days, with the ultimate goal of sharing 25 million doses this summer across the continent in partnership with the African Union. The first donated doses will be sent to Ethiopia, Djibouti and Burkina Faso, said State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter, with the US working with the Covax global vaccine alliance. In all, doses will eventually go to 49 African countries. According to the White House, Djibouti and Burkina Faso will each receive 151,200 doses of the Johnson & Johnson single-shot vaccine, while Ethiopia will receive 453,600. "The United States has partnered with Sub-Saharan African nations for decades, working alongside African governments, regional institutions, civil society and others on the continent to foster opportunities and address global challenges," said NSC Senior Director for Africa Dana Banks. "The Covid-19 pandemic is no different.'' Non-governmental organizations praised the Biden move to begin vaccine sharing with Africa, but warned doses aren't arriving quickly enough to slow deadly outbreaks. "As many wealthy countries return to normal, Africa is returning to lockdown," said Tom Hart, the acting CEO of the ONE Campaign. "Many of these cases and deaths could be prevented by one thing: access to vaccines. The Biden administration's announcement is a good next step, but the reality is that Africa needs 200 million doses by the end of September to stem this crisis.'' The shipments come as part of an initial supply of 80 million doses that President Joe Biden had pledged to send out to the world by the end of June, though deliveries were slowed by regulatory and logistical hurdles in recipient countries. They mark the Biden administration's down payment on a plan to buy and donate 500 million more doses for the world over the coming year. To date the US has shipped more than 53 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to more than 30 countries and territories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/us-to-send-first-vaccine-doses-to-africa-in-coming-days/articleshow/84488031.cms||---

---||World||Myanmar political crisis risks damaging entire generation of children, warns UN child rights committee||GENEVA: Due to the ongoing political crisis, children's rights in Myanmar are facing an onslaught that risks leaving an entire generation damaged, the UN child rights committee (CRC) has warned. Since February's military coup, 75 children have been killed, about 1,000 arbitrarily detained and countless more deprived of essential medical care and education, according to credible information obtained by the committee. "Children in Myanmar are under siege and facing the catastrophic loss of life because of the military coup," Mikiko Otani, chair of the CRC, said. Nearly 6,000 people have been arbitrarily detained in Myanmar since the military overthrew the elected government and seized power on 1 February. In addition, approximately 900 people, including children, have been killed and countless more wounded. The committee monitors the compliance by states parties to the child rights convention. Myanmar acceded to the convention in 1991. The committee strongly condemned the killing of children by the junta and police. Some victims were killed in their own homes, including a six-year-old girl in the city of Mandalay, who was shot in the stomach by police and died in her father's arms. The CRC also deplored the arbitrary detention of children in police stations, prisons and military detention centres. The military authorities have reportedly taken children as hostages when they are unable to arrest their parents. Among those detained is a five-year-old girl in the Mandalay region whose father helped organize protests against the junta. "Children are exposed to indiscriminate violence, random shootings and arbitrary arrests every day. They have guns pointed at them, and see the same happen to their parents and siblings," Otani warned. The committee is profoundly concerned at the major disruption of essential medical care and school education in the entire country, as well as access to safe drinking water and food for children in rural areas. The UN human rights office has received credible reports about hospitals, schools and religious institutions being occupied by security forces and subsequently damaged in military actions. According to Unicef, the UN children's agency, a million children in Myanmar are missing key vaccinations. More than 40,000 children are no longer getting treatment for severe acute malnutrition. "As a result of the military coup and conflicts, children's right to life, survival and development have been repeatedly violated," said Otani. "If this crisis continues, an entire generation of children is at risk of suffering profound physical, psychological, emotional, educational and economic consequences, depriving them of a healthy and productive future." The committee called for immediate action to bring about a peaceful solution to the crisis and urged Myanmar to uphold its obligations under the convention to protect and promote children's rights to the utmost degree.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/myanmar-political-crisis-risks-damaging-entire-generation-of-children-warns-un-child-rights-committee/articleshow/84488000.cms||---
---||World||Texas county reports first case of monkeypox||NEW DELHI: The Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) on Friday confirmed a case of monkeypox in a Texas resident. This is reportedly the first case of the rare disease in the United States since the 2003 outbreak, which affected 47 people. The patient is currently being isolated at a hospital in Dallas, and is in stable condition. "We have been working closely with the CDC and DSHS and have conducted interviews with the patient and close contacts that were exposed," DCHHS director Philip Huang said in a statement. “We have determined that there is very little risk to the general public." The Texas resident arrived at Love Field airport on July 9 from Atlanta after an overnight flight from Nigeria. The CDC is working with airline, state and local health officials to contact airline passengers and others who may have come in contact with the patient. "This case is not a reason for alarm and we do not expect any threat to the general public," Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said. The DCHHS further added that those who do not have symptoms are not capable of spreading the virus to others. The CDC defines monkeypox as a rare disease caused by the monkeypox virus. The first human case of the virus was registered in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo during a period of intensified effort to eliminate smallpox. According to the CDC, the infection begins with a fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion. Within one to three days -- or sometimes longer -- after the appearance of fever, those infected develop a rash which often begins on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body. Human-to-human transmission of the virus is thought to occur primarily through large respiratory droplets. It can also be transmitted via body fluids or contact with an infected animal or animal products. The CDC further explains that there is "no proven, safe treatment for monkeypox virus infection". The smallpox vaccine, antivirals, and vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) can be used to control the outbreak, it adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/texas-county-reports-first-case-of-monkeypox/articleshow/84488123.cms||---
---||World||Brazilian states seek international funding to fight deforestation||BRASILIA: Nine Brazilian states that are wholly or partially in the Amazon rainforest are negotiating with international organizations for aid to combat deforestation, circumventing the federal government, their governors said on Friday. Flávio Dino, the leftist governor of Maranhao state who is often floated as a potential presidential candidate for elections in 2022, presented the project, known as Plano de Recuperacao Verde, or Green Renewal Plan, at a press conference in Brasilia. Among the goals of the group is eliminating illegal deforestation by 2030, generating employment and aiding the region's transition to a greener economy. "The world is moving and Brazil can't stay still due to domestic political reasons. The price for the country could be very high," Dino said. Deforestation has surged since right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, drawing international outcry from foreign governments and environmentalists. Bolsonaro has called for mining and agriculture in protected areas of the Amazon and has weakened environmental enforcement agencies. That in turn has caused some states to more actively participate in environmental matters. The consortium has already begun negotiating with the LEAF Coalition, a fund organized by the US, British and Norwegian governments to protect the rainforest. The Plano de Recuperacao Verde consortium will deliver the nine governors' deforestation reduction targets to LEAF this week, Dino said. He added that the group plans to begin its work this year and to stop the growth of intentional forest fires and deforestation in the second half of 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brazilian-states-seek-international-funding-to-fight-deforestation/articleshow/84488119.cms||---
---||World||Florida boaters could risk fines, prison by going to Cuba||MIAMI: Federal authorities are warning organizers planning to launch a flotilla next week from South Florida to waters near Cuba that they could risk breaking the law.  The US Department of Homeland Security said in an advisory Thursday that boaters intending to enter Cuban territorial waters must get permission from the US Coast Guard. Violators risk facing fines of $25,000 a day and 10 years in prison, the advisory said.  "It is illegal for boaters to depart with the intent to travel to Cuba for any purpose without a permit," the advisory said.  People who bring foreign nationals into the US illegally risk facing fines of up to $250,000 a day and five years in prison, the department said.  According to Osdany Veloz, an organizer of the boaters, the goal of next Monday's planned trip is to go to international waters near the island, but not cross into Cuban waters, to let island residents know they have supporters in South Florida.  Organizers said they will set sail from South Florida if 100 boaters show up, according to Miami television station WFOR-TV.  "The purpose is to stay on the border, not trespassing, stay in international water and just let the Cuban people know we're also fighting for their freedom, so once and for all they can be a free country," said Jorge Lopez, who plans to make the trip.  Thousands of Cubans began taking to the streets last weekend to protest limited access to COVID-19 vaccines and basic goods. The country is going through its worst economic crisis in decades.  The protests in the island nation have sparked an outpouring of support in Florida, which is home to the nation's largest community of Cuban exiles. Throngs of people in Miami, Orlando and the Tampa area have rallied in support, sometimes shutting down major thoroughfares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-boaters-could-risk-fines-prison-by-going-to-cuba/articleshow/84488194.cms||---
---||World||Afghan fight against Taliban 'a matter of will': Pompeo||DES MOINES, IOWA: Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Friday he believes Afghan forces can secure the country as the US withdraws, but success will depend on whether they have the will to put up a fierce fight against the Taliban. Thousands of Afghans have fled the country in recent days as Taliban forces have surged through northern Afghanistan. In an interview with the Associated Press, Pompeo said he is confident Afghan forces can repel the Taliban, but it's "a matter of will." "I saw on TV the other day, I saw some 22, 23-year-old Afghan males say, 'It's really dangerous here, I want to get out,'" the former secretary of state said. "What those Afghans should have been saying is it's really dangerous here, give me an M16." Under former President Donald Trump, Pompeo oversaw U.S. negotiations with the Taliban and remains the only secretary of state to have met face-to-face with senior Taliban officials. He applauded President Joe Biden's move to withdraw from Afghanistan - rare praise from a Trump loyalist - but said he was worried that US counterterrorism operations could be hurt in the process. Pompeo was in Des Moines, Iowa on Friday speaking at several political events, including a conference for conservative Christians. Since leaving the office at the end of former President Donald Trump's term, Pompeo has formed a political action committee and is considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate. He said he is currently focused on fundraising and recruiting for other candidates. Pompeo pushed Biden to increase pressure on the Cuban government as antigovernment protests erupted there. Pompeo re-designated Cuba a "state sponsor of terror" during the Trump administration's final days, even as Biden was promising a new approach to the communist-governed island. The protests have been spurred by food shortages, rising prices and power cuts, but Pompeo stuck to a hardline, "America first" view of foreign policy. He warned that any moves to send funds to Cuba would show "a fundamental misunderstanding of totalitarian regimes." "You can't fund them, you can't underwrite them," he said. He suggested instead the US could make moves like opening internet access that would help protesters coordinate and increase pressure on the Cuban government. "There are lots of tools that the American government has in its possession and it demands leadership that wants to destroy communist regimes."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/afghan-fight-against-taliban-a-matter-of-will-pompeo/articleshow/84488156.cms||---

On Thursday, Los Angeles County said it would reimpose its mask mandate this weekend. On Friday, public health officials said US coronavirus cases were up 70% over the previous week, with deaths up 26%. Cruise lines Carnival Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line both fell about 5%. "Covid is starting to affect the market, ironically, for the first time since last summer, when the reopening trade began," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Amazon and Apple fell more than 1%. Nvidia lost 4.2%, and the three companies contributed more than any others to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq's declines. The S&P 500 technology sector index lost almost 1%, dipping for a second session after hitting a record on Wednesday. The utility index rallied 1%, while the real estate index edged up 0.1% and touched an intraday record high. This week, investors have balanced worries about a recent inflation spike with reassurances from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the surge in prices is temporary. The second-quarter earnings season picks up next week, with reports from companies including Netflix, Johnson & Johnson, Verizon Communications, AT&T and Intel. Analysts on average expect 72% growth in earnings per share for S&P 500 companies, according to IBES estimate data from Refinitiv. With the S&P 500 up about 15% so far this year, investors will look for strong company forecasts to justify sky-high valuations. "It's been hard for the market to gain here from these already elevated prices," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. The S&P 500 energy sector index sank nearly 3% and ended the week 8% lower, with investors worried about expectations for more supply and a rise in coronavirus cases that raised demand concerns. Data from the Commerce Department showed retail sales rebounded 0.6% last month as spending is shifting back to services, bolstering expectations that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.86% to end at 34,687.85 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.75% to 4,327.16. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8% to 14,427.24. For the week, the S&P 500 fell about 1%, the Dow lost 0.5% and the Nasdaq shed 1.9%, their first weekly declines in four weeks. Moderna Inc jumped 10.3% to a record high after S&P Dow Jones Indices said the drugmaker will join the S&P 500 index as of the start of trading on July 21, replacing Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Cintas Corp surged 4.6% after brokerages raised price targets on the business service provider's stock following its fourth-quarter results. Didi Global Inc fell 3.2% after China sent state officials from at least seven departments to the ride-hailing giant for a cybersecurity review. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.21-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 46 new highs and 124 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was 9.3 billion shares, compared with the 10.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/wall-street-ends-down-as-delta-variant-drives-fears/articleshow/84487979.cms||---

The two spoke for half an hour amid a buzz about cabinet changes. Yediyurappa, who has faced frequent speculation about his time in office, laughed off the talk of a leadership change. “I don’t know of any rumour about leadership change. You tell me,” he told reporters after the meeting with Modi. He said he only discussed development-related issues and would return to Bengaluru on Saturday. He is likely to meet defence minister Rajnath Singh and home minister Amit Shah before flying back. According to some BJP insiders, Yediyurappa wants to rejig his cabinet by dropping a few senior ministers and bringing in fresh blood, like Modi did recently. He went to Delhi to get the go-ahead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bsy-meets-pm-modi-laughs-off-buzz-about-change-of-cm-in-karnataka/articleshow/84488272.cms||---
---||World||Belarus expands crackdown on independent media||KYIV, UKRAINE: Authorities in Belarus raided the homes and offices of independent media outlets and civil society activists Friday, widening a crackdown on opposition in the ex-Soviet nation. The Belarusian Association of Journalists and the Viasna human rights center said authorities searched the apartments and offices of at least 31 journalists and activists in the capital of Minsk and seven other cities. "The authorities are using an entire arsenal of repressions against journalists - intimidation, beatings, searches and arrests," Andrei Bastunets, the head of the journalists' association, said.. The country's main security agency, which still goes under its Soviet-era name KGB, said those targeted were suspected of involvement in "extremist activities." Among those targeted Friday were 22 journalists who worked for the Belsat TV channel, which is funded by Poland, and for Us-funded broadcaster RFE/RL. Authorities broke down the door of RFE/RL's office in Minsk. RFE/RL journalist Aleh Hruzdzilovich was detained after the search of his family's home, his wife, Maryana, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from Minsk. "Nine people broke into our apartment, seized all the equipment and took Aleh away in handcuffs," she said. Viasna said authorities also raided the homes of Alena Anisim, head of the Union of Belarusian Language, and activists with the nongovernmental organization Legal Initiative. Belarus' investigative committee, the top state investigative agency, said the raids were part of a probe into alleged tax evasion and violations of financial regulations by NGOs and media outlets. The new raids continue a sweeping clampdown on independent media and non-government organizations in the country. Earlier this week, law enforcement officers raided the homes of 10 Viasna workers, as well as the human rights center's offices in Minsk and other cities. They also searched a number of other Belarusian NGOs and journalists. The action came after President Alexander Lukashenko, the longtime authoritarian leader of Belarus, promised to "deal with" organizations that he accuses of fomenting unrest. Belarus was rocked by months of protests after Lukashenko's August 2020 election to a sixth term in a vote that the opposition and the West saw as rigged. Belarusian authorities responded to opposition demonstrations with a massive crackdown, including police beating thousands of demonstrators and arresting more than 35,000 people. Leading opposition figures have been jailed or forced to leave the country, while independent media outlets have had their offices searched and their journalists arrested. Overall, 32 Belarusian journalists are currently in custody, either serving their sentences or awaiting trial, according to the Belarusian Association of Journalists. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main challenger in the August 2020 election, who was forced to leave Belarus under official pressure immediately after the vote, tweeted Friday that "the regime destroys every media that dares to tell the truth about the situation in Belarus." Also on Friday, 11 university students and a teacher were sentenced to 2 and 2 1/2-year prison terms on accusations of staging and coordinating protests last fall. US ambassador to Belarus, Julie Fisher, condemned the verdict. "How fragile is a regime that can't abide free expression and civic engagement by 11 university students? These young people present a profile in courage," she said on Twitter. Fisher also said that Friday's raids targeting journalists "demonstrate cowardice and the inability to cope with truth-telling as opposed to the lionization and fantasies woven daily on state TV." RFE/RL strongly condemned Friday's raiding of its bureau and the detention of Hruzdzilovich and former RFE/RL correspondent Ina Studzinskaya and demanded their immediate release. "These raids and arrests testify to the despotic desperation of the Lukashenko regime to cling to power at all costs," RFE/RL President Jamie Fly said in a statement. "Lukashenko's criminalization of independent journalism is a cynical attempt to exert absolute control over what the Belarusian people see and hear. These intimidation tactics will not silence our journalism." The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, denounced the crackdown in a statement issued Thursday. "This new wave of repression is yet another proof that the Lukashenko regime is waging a systematic and well-orchestrated campaign with the ultimate aim to silence all remaining dissident voices and suppress civic space in Belarus," Borrell said. "The severe violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms come at a price. The EU is ready to consider further restrictive measures in line with its gradual approach."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/belarus-expands-crackdown-on-independent-media/articleshow/84488286.cms||---

Expressing condolences to Siddiqui’s family, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani said the journalist, who was employed by an international news agency, had been killed while covering the Taliban atrocities in Kandahar. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla condemned the killing of the journalist while speaking at the UN Security Council on Friday. According to reports from Kabul, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist was embedded with Afghan troops who were ambushed by the Taliban near the Spin Boldak border crossing. “While I extend my heartfelt condolences to Mr Sediqqui’s family and also to our media family, I reiterate my government’s unwavering commitment to freedom of speech and protection of free media and journalists,” said Ghani. The Indian embassy in Kabul was in touch with Afghan authorities to bring back the mortal remains of Siddiqui, officials here said. “We are actively facilitating the return of the body in coordination with Afghan authorities and the ICRC. We are in regular touch with family members of Siddiqui,” said a source here. Afghanistan'’s Tolo News, quoting sources, reported that Siddiqui was killed during clashes in Spin Boldak district in Kandahar. It said that fierce fighting has been under way in Kandahar, especially at Spin Boldak, for the last few days. Afghanistan has accused Pakistan of shielding the Taliban forces who claim to have taken over the border crossing with Pakistan. Afghanistan has witnessed a series of terror attacks in the last few weeks with the US withdrawing majority of its troops from the country and aiming to complete the drawdown by August 31, ending nearly two decades of its military presence in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-condemns-danish-siddiquis-killing-taliban-give-body-to-red-cross/articleshow/84488353.cms||---
---||World||Biden digs in on US public lands nominee as Republican opposition mounts||The White House on Friday backed President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the nation's public lands bureau, pushing back against growing calls to withdraw the nomination from key Republican lawmakers. Earlier, US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell joined calls by several Republican Senate colleagues for Biden to withdraw the nomination of Montana conservationist Tracy Stone-Manning to run the Bureau of Land Management due to her ties to a decades-old tree-spiking incident. Tree spiking involves hammering a metal rod into a tree to prevent logging. On Friday, the White House said in a statement that Stone-Manning "is a dedicated public servant who has years of experience and a proven track record of finding solutions and common ground when it comes to our public lands and waters. She is exceptionally qualified to be the next Director of the Bureau of Land Management.” The BLM, a division of the Interior Department, manages more than a 10th of the nation's surface area, overseeing permitting for energy development, grazing, timber harvesting and recreation. The director position will be central to the Biden administration's effort to address climate change through the management of public lands, including a current review of the federal oil and gas leasing program. This week, 10 Republican members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, including Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, sent a letter to Biden calling for withdrawal. They accused Stone-Manning of making false statements to the committee about her involvement with an extreme environmental group in the late 1980s. The committee's Democratic chairman, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, did not respond to a request for comment. Stone-Manning most recently was a senior adviser for conservation policy at the National Wildlife Federation, advocating against former President Donald Trump's push to maximize fossil fuel production at the expense of other public land uses. Prior to joining the NWF in 2017, Stone-Manning served as chief of staff to the Democratic former governor of Montana, Steve Bullock. She could not be reached for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-digs-in-on-us-public-lands-nominee-as-republican-opposition-mounts/articleshow/84488281.cms||---

Shakiro and Patricia left Douala's main prison in a taxi after a judge ordered them freed until a court could hear an appeal of their five-year sentences. They were arrested on February 8 for wearing women's clothing in a restaurant and convicted of "attempted homosexuality," public indecency and failing to carry identification. "Prison is hell. It's hellfire. Especially when they accuse you of homosexuality," said Shakiro, a celebrity in Cameroon with thousands of social media followers, during an interview at her family's house. "They put chains on our legs, something that is not normal," she said. "That day we slept with those chains and we paid money for them to remove the chains." A spokesperson for Cameroon's justice ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Human rights activists say the arrests reflect a growing criminalisation of sexual minorities in Cameroon. Their appeal is expected to be heard in September. "This day is the most beautiful day of my life because I did not believe that these children would make it out of prison with their health intact," Shakiro's mother, Josephine Njeukam, told Reuters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/transgender-woman-in-cameroon-describes-hell-of-five-months-in-prison/articleshow/84488398.cms||---
---||India||Miffed over Navjot Singh Sidhu elevation buzz, Captain Amarinder Singh writes to Sonia||NEW DELHI: Amid continued infighting in Punjab Congress, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday met party chief Sonia Gandhi at her residence here and in a bid to bring about a truce formula over the state unit revamp. AICC general secretary in-charge for Punjab affairs of the party Harish Rawat, who was present at the meeting along with Rahul Gandhi, will be meeting chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday in Chandigarh to bring him on board over the peace formula. Sources say that report of Sidhu’s elevation has irked Amarinder Singh and he has shot off a letter to Sonia Gandhi, expressing strong resentment over the developments and reports of his elevation. The CM has reportedly told the leadership that the developments will have an adverse impact on Congress’s prospects, as the party stands confused and is at the crossroads. The meeting between Sidhu and Sonia Gandhi comes ahead of the party’s Punjab unit revamp and amid reports that Sidhu may get a key role in the organisation. After the meeting, Rawat said Sonia is yet to take a final decision on the issue and he will share it soon after it is done. Asked whether a decision has been made to appoint Sidhu as Punjab Congress chief, Rawat said, “Who says this?” “I came here to submit my note on Punjab to the Congress chief and as soon as a decision is taken by the Congress president, I will come and share it with you,” Rawat said. Sidhu left Sonia Gandhi’s 10, Janpath residence without talking to the media. According to sources, the Punjab CM has expressed resentment over Sidhu being given a key role. AICC general secretary Rawat had, however, denied such reports. The sources say that reports of Sidhu’s supporters celebrating in advance have also irked Amarinder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/miffed-over-navjot-singh-sidhu-elevation-buzz-captain-amarinder-singh-writes-to-sonia/articleshow/84488430.cms||---
---||India||Still looking for pigeons to deliver bail orders: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said insistence of jail authorities for certified copies of bail orders through snail-paced postal services in the age of internet resulted in agonising delays in the release of inmates and set the ball rolling for a secure electronic mode, christened FASTER (Fast and Secure Transmission of Electronic Records), for quick transmission of bail orders. “In the age of information and communication technology and internet, we are still looking at the skies for the pigeons to communicate the orders,” a bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justices L N Rao and A S Bopanna lamented before launching on the pioneering effort. The bench directed the SC registry headed by the secretary general to prepare within two weeks, in consultation with solicitor general Tushar Mehta and amicus curiae Dushyant Dave, a detailed report on a new internet-based mechanism. This would be called Fast and Secure Transmission of Electronic Records (FASTER) and will deliver the apex court's orders to high courts, district courts, jails and all other authorities. The immediate trigger for the suo motu initiation of proceedings by the CJI on a much-neglected issue was delay on the part of Agra central jail authorities to release 13 persons despite grant of bail by the apex court after it was found that they have spent more than a decade in jail despite being declared juveniles at the time of the crimes. Before the advent of postal services, pigeon post was popular, especially during war times, and was actively used till World War II. The pigeon courier service in India dates back to 1946, when it was handed over to the police by the Army. It was headquartered in Cuttack, Odisha. Pigeons were officially retired in 2002. The postal services and telephones, which signed the death warrant for pigeon post, are now facing serious competition from internet-based email facilities. The CJI-led bench said, "We have asked the Supreme Court Secretary General to devise within two weeks a secure electronic communication mode for instant transmission of SC orders granting bail to accused/convicts to the jail authorities to minimise, to the extent possible, the time lapse between grant of bail and release of the person from jail." The Centre welcomed the idea with both attorney general K K Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta terming the proposed mechanism as "progressive". Mehta said any bail order uploaded on the official website of the Supreme Court should be treated as an officially certified copy by the jail authorities and take steps to release the prison inmate. The bench said, "The idea of passing this order is to develop a fast and authentic electronic mode for transmission of court orders. The bail orders are invariably uploaded in the official website of the Supreme Court. But, the jail authorities are not accepting the copy of the orders downloaded from the website. So we want a secure transmission of authentic copy directly to the jail authorities for expeditious release of inmates who have been granted bail by the court." SC said for the jail authorities to receive the court orders through the electronic mode, every jail needs to be equipped with internet facilities. Given the poor spread of the internet in rural and semi-urban areas where many jails are located, the bench asked the state governments to inform the court a time period within which they would equip every jail with internet facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/still-looking-for-pigeons-to-deliver-bail-orders-supreme-court/articleshow/84488574.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The garba griha will be thrown open to pilgrims across India and the world for ‘darshan’, keeping at least a six-month buffer before the Lok Sabha polls. The grand temple complex as per blueprint will, however, be completed by 2024 by construction firms, Larsen & Toubro and Tata Consultancy, and could also overshoot the deadline, said highly placed sources in the Ram temple Trust. Talking to TOI, Trustee of Ram Mandir Trust Anil Mishra said, “The shifting of idols to the ‘garba griha’ will match the grandeur of the ‘bhoomipujan’, which was hekd last year, with the likely participation of the President, Prime Minister, chief minister, Sangh brass and even Opposition leaders.” The decision to open the mega temple project to pilgrims, followed marathon meetings of the temple trust presided over by the construction committee chairman, Nripendra Mishra, this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ram-temple-to-open-to-public-in-2023-work-to-finish-in-2024/articleshow/84488668.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Education technology solution provider TeamLease Edtech surveyed over 700 students and officials from 75 Indian universities to assess the learning gap in higher education during the pandemic. Nearly 85% of the student respondents believe they failed to learn 40-60% of their course material, it says. Manjula Chowdhry, Dean (Academics) at Haryana’s Kurukshetra University, said grades didn’t reflect learning loss since exams were being conducted online. “Everybody is getting high marks, but when you interact with them, you realise the learning is not happening except for a small number of students who are self-motivated and can learn on their own,” she said. P Subrahmanya Yadapadithaya, VC of Mangalore University, pointed out that online education couldn’t be used to train students in soft skills. He observed that students’ answers in online examinations “showed poor grasping and internalisation process”. The gap in learning outcomes has been acknowledged across the world. World Bank data indicate nearly 220 million students have faced the brunt of the pandemic’s impact on education. However, the perceived learning gap among students in advanced nations and India is stark. The survey blamed five factors for the gap in learning: a digital divide, slow governance in government institutions, pre-existing capacity deficits, longer lockdowns in India than other countries and weak online learning content. C L Dewangan, registrar of Hemchand Yadav Vishwavidyalaya in Chhattisgarh, said students scored well in open book exams, but that didn’t reflect in their knowledge levels. “Sixty percent of the students who would not have been promoted are currently getting promoted with good marks,” he said. Mohammed Nafees Ahmad Ansari, director of the Centre for Distance and Online Education at Aligarh Muslim University, said the learning gap is visible to teachers. There has also been a decline in the participation of women students due to their inability to access digital platforms, Ansari said. Shantanu Rooj, CEO of TeamLease Edtech said that a major reason for the learning gap was because India’s educational ecosystem was not digitised in time. Rooj said their research indicated it will take close to three years to bridge this learning gap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/e-classes-leading-to-learning-gaps-in-higher-education-survey/articleshow/84488749.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

With opposition parties likely to raise issues of retail price inflation, farm laws and Covid “mismanagement” during the monsoon session starting July 19, the government is “well prepared” to respond to the House on all the measures it took to tackle the spread of coronavirus in the country, said the sources. The government is also likely to take up nine pending bills for passage, introduce 14 new legislations and replace at least two ordinances with bills. It is, however, unlikely that the government will bring a legislation to back the formation of the ministry of cooperation, since there is no constitutional mandate of a law in this regard. In legislative business, the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill, 2021, is expected to replace, with some amendments, the lapsed ordinance. An ordinance prohibiting agitations and strikes by those engaged in essential defence services — The Essential Defence Services Ordinance 2021 — brought in in light of indefinite strike calls by major federations of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) will also be replaced by the Essential Defence Service Bill, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-discussion-14-new-bills-likely-this-session/articleshow/84488835.cms||Swati Mathur

Making stinging observations on Tuesday, which were uploaded to the court’s website on Thursday night, the bench of Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay said as long as the wards of the elite class are taking education in non-government schools, tall claims of qualitative changes in the education system will only be an eyewash. The court was hearing a batch of writ petitions filed by more than 100 guest teachers who were first appointed at district level two years back and then were fired by the state government allegedly in an extremely arbitrary manner. The process to appoint more than 4000 guest teachers was started in 2018. The court had stayed their sacking on February 17 this year. It said guest teachers’ engagement was an ad hoc arrangement but they were terminated at the cost of students in government institutions and somebody in the system is required to take responsibility. Terming the state’s education system as ‘derailed’, the court said the government has to put it back on track by imparting quality education to the wards of poor people who are compelled to get admissions in government institutions where basic facilities are unavailable. The court also observed that the education system in Bihar seems to have gone worst and no one is serious about the problem. “It appears that the system is only spoiling the future generation as only formality of school education is done in this state. The system cannot be improved so long as the officials are allowed to educate their wards outside Bihar,” it commented. “During the last few years, media has highlighted the kind of education being imparted in the government institutions in Bihar, but it all falls on deaf ears of those who are at the helm of affairs,” the bench observed. “Even the IAS, IPS officers and elite class are confident that the government educational institutions are not up to the mark for which they are sending their wards to receive education out of state or in private schools on payment of huge admission and tuition fees," the court observed. The court said improvement can be gauged by people’s faith in the system and directed chief secretary to reply how many wards of IAS, IPS, class-I and II officers in state service are studying in government schools. The bench said the golden test of quality change index is public sector educational institutions and not the private ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-state-education-system-derailed/articleshow/84483297.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP executive political resolution chalks out strategy for 2022 polls||LUCKNOW: The UP BJP laid out a formal blueprint of its political strategy of taking ambitious schemes of the Centre and the state government to the people in a bid to consolidate its position for UP assembly elections due next year. The key point was part of a series of political resolutions which were passed by the party’s state executive committee headed by UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Friday. The resolution was put forth by state vice-president and party MLC Laxman Acharya and endorsed by another state VP Pankaj Singh and state secretary Meena Chaubey. The executive made a categorical reference to the recently concluded rural local bodies’ polls in which the BJP claimed a thumping victory, amid opposition’s accusation of misusing government machinery. The party said that its landslide victory in rural polls were a sharp pointer to developmental agenda taken up by the state government, including construction of expressways, providing drinking water facility and wheeling in power to rural households. BJP vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh who presided over the political resolution said that the state has been facing a host of challenges including corruption, mafia, terrorism and appeasement politics. He said that the terror accused no longer wielded any respect in the state and action was also initiated against those involved in forced religious conversion. Deputy CM Keshav Maurya said that work of the state government and organisation has elevated the morale of party workers. He claimed that the party was poised to sweep next year’s state elections on the basis of work done by the state government and strength of party organisation. The state executive also green-flagged the resolution of scaling up its activities vis-à-vis Covid management, amid experts expressing their apprehensions about a third wave hitting the state. The move is seen as BJP attempt to counter an assertive opposition which has been seeking to push the ruling party to the wall accusing it over mis-management of pandemic, especially during the lethal second wave. The executive maintained that while experts expressed apprehensions of Covid taking a heavy toll on the country’s most populous state, it was the strategy of leadership of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath which helped the ruling party cope up with the pandemic. The party also condemned the opposition stance of spreading rumours and negativity which affected state government efforts to counter the crisis. It also slammed the opposition leaders of maligning the image of scientists engaged in manufacture of vaccines. The executive made a specific mention of Varanasi, saying that the city managed to control the second wave of pandemic within 10 days of its emergence. It was yet another endorsement of Varanasi Model of Covid management which was overseen by BJP MLC Arvind Kumar Sharma, the former IAS officer of Gujarat cadre. In fact, Modi had made a specific mention of the `Varanasi model of Covid management’ during his visit to Ahmedabad in May. The executive also hailed the aggressive vaccination programme taken up by the Yogi government to counter the possibility of the third wave which is feared to impact children. The panel also endorsed the party’s focus on religious centres like Ayodhya where the Ram Temple is being constructed, more than one-and-a-half years after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of a temple at the disputed Babri Masjid site. It also discussed the issue of agricultural reforms taken up by the ruling BJP. This comes amid the ongoing agitation by farmers against the new farm laws of the Centre. The farmers’ groups have also threatened to re-group against the state government in the run up to state elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-state-executive-political-resolutionchalks-out-blueprint-for-poll-strategy/articleshow/84487687.cms||Pankaj Shah

His statement came a day after a viral video showed SP workers, while staging a protest against the ruling BJP allegedly raising slogans like “Pakistan Zindabad”. “One can assume what kind of security blueprint the SP leadership has for the state,” Yogi said, while addressing BJP workers at the concluding session of the party’s state executive meeting. “This shows that these people can put national security at stake just for the sake of vote bank politics,” he said. Raking up the issue of Love Jihad, Yogi said that his government formed a strict law to stop the practice of forced religious conversions. The CM also pointed out the recent arrest of two persons – Umar Gautam and Mufti Qazi -- by ATS on charges of being involved in religious conversion of unemployed and children with hearing disability, saying that some elements were hatching conspiracy to mobilize people against the state government. He said that such incidents should alert the BJP about opposition malicious attempt to destabilize the state government with the help of few “Jihadi” elements. “Unfortunately, a responsible politician of the state claims that he has no confidence in the state government and police,” Yogi said, in an apparent swipe at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. Yogi said that the recent win in the recently concluded panchayat elections indicated the party's recognition at the organisational level. He termed the elected representatives at the rural local bodies as key `dharohar’ of the BJP and urged the party workers to make them a focal point of organisational activities. Yogi said that the state government tried to save the lives of people without any discrimination during the past two waves of Corona pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-lashes-out-at-sp-for-pro-pakslogans-during-its-protest-in-agra/articleshow/84487695.cms||---

Last year, the dam overflowed in September, Singh said, attributing the early overflow this year to the week-long heavy showers. Only three days ago, water level in the reservoir stood at 80%. Singh said the present water storage in the Gaunem reservoir is 177 hectare metre. The Gaunem reservoir water level is 63m at full capacity. The overflow began at reduced level 63.5m. The construction of the dam, which will irrigate a proposed 100 hectares, commenced in 2012 and was completed in 2017, but pipelines are yet to be laid, Singh said. Presently, WRD is waiting to settle disputes in at least two cases involving the property through which the proposed pipeline from the dam is to be laid.

When a space by liquor shops is being provided, then why are people consuming liquor in open places and in cars.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/61-held-for-consuming-booze-in-public-places/articleshow/84485197.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Bought used phone? You may want to get its IMEI verified||NEW DELHI: If you are buying a used phone, you may want to verify its IMEI number with Delhi Police. The cops have been blacklisting handsets and blocking IMEIs to curb the sale of stolen handsets. It is a problem of significant magnitude and according to data accessed by TOI, 94,204 handsets were blacklisted by police between May 20 last year and July 14 this year. Delhi Police commissioner Balaji Srivastava is learnt to have recently reviewed the progress of this drive which is being conducted as part of Project CEIR (Central Equipment Identity Register) in collaboration with the central government’s department of telecommunications. The Centre for Development of Telematics, GSM Association and the telecom service providers have also been taken on board. The IMEI can be verified by logging in to zipnet.delhipolice.gov.in. “One should enter the IMEI number of the mobile phone one intends to buy. If the phone has been reported stolen in Delhi, its IMEI is in ZIPNET," said Chinmoy Biswal, the Delhi Police spokesperson. Biswal added, “If any person tries to use a blacklisted device using any SIM, the service provider involved will capture the access log/ traceability data containing details such as mobile number, IMEI, etc, and report to Project CEIR to facilitate police action in tracing the device.” Stolen phones are often bought and used by unwary commoners as well as by antisocial and antinational elements, posing a threat to national security. A good number of the stolen phones are believed to now land with organised crime gangs, whose first task is to make sure that the law enforcement is unable to track the devices. They use special software and instruments to erase the existing IMEIs and to assign new numbers to the stolen handsets. In this way, several handsets often end up with the same IMEI. That is where Project CEIR comes. It enables reporting, blocking and traceability of IMEI numbers of devices reported stolen or lost. Biswal explained, “The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a 15-digit identifier for each mobile device and uniquely identifies each mobile phone handset. However, there are at present many cases of cloned/duplicated IMEI handsets. If a cloned IMEI number is blocked, a large number of mobile phones will be blocked too since they bear the same identifying number, thereby causing inconvenience to many users.” When a police complaint is lodged after the user flags his phone as stolen, the device/IMEI is marked as blacklisted through the ZIPNET system after verification of the theft. The list of all such marked and blacklisted devices is shared with the telecom service providers, who take steps to block these devices in their network. Once blocked, the handsets are no longer able to access any network in any part of India. Biswal said Project CEIR has been launched in Maharashtra and Delhi to make it possible to block and trace stolen mobile phones. “Based on the learnings from this launch, the facility will be extended across India," he disclosed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bought-used-phone-you-may-want-to-get-its-imei-verified/articleshow/84487227.cms||Raj Shekhar

The company is acquiring the local search engine, which boasts more than 30 million listings of enterprises across web, app and voice platforms. The acquisition is one of Reliance’s significant M&As, dwarfing its purchase of online pharma retailer Netmeds and British toy maker Hamleys for over Rs 620 crore each. Under the contours of the deal, Reliance is acquiring 40.95% in Just Dial by subscribing to preferential shares and buying shares from its main promoter V S S Mani and his family for Rs 3,497 crore. Further, it will make an open offer to acquire an additional 26% from Just Dial’s public shareholders entailing about Rs 2,222 crore. Reliance will make the open offer to Just Dial’s non-promoter shareholders at about Rs 1,022 apiece. On Friday, the stock closed at Rs 1,070 on the BSE, down 3%. If Reliance gets the entire 26% through the open offer, its stake in Just Dial will go up to 66.95%. The transaction will see the local search engine maintained as a separate entity, with founder Mani continuing as its CEO to “lead Just Dial through the next phase of growth”. The Just Dial board, which met on Friday, approved Mani’s reappointment as CEO for another five years till July 31, 2026. In its regulatory filing, Just Dial said while the company will be under the sole control of Reliance, Mani, who is currently a promoter, will exercise his voting rights under the instructions of the retailer. Mani’s brother V Krishnan, however, will step down from his role as a director of the company on expiration of his term on July 31, Just Dial said. The deal will help Reliance get access to Just Dial’s massive database,“further boosting the digital ecosystem for millions of our partner merchants, micro, small and medium enterprises”, according to Reliance Retail director Isha Ambani. The capital infused via preferential shares will help the expansion of Just Dial into a comprehensive local listing and commerce platform, the Reliance statement said. Besides Netmeds and Hamleys, Reliance has bought online furniture seller Urban Ladder and lingerie retailer Zivame in the last two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/reliance-retail-buys-just-dial-for-rs-5710cr/articleshow/84487371.cms||Reeba Zachariah

As a result, important trains like Vaishali Express, Sangam Express, Farakka and Magadh Express besides several other goods trains were stranded at various stations. ASM Kanchausi Aniruddh Kumar did not respond to repeated calls from his seniors, forcing them to rush to the railway station, which comes under the NCR division in Auraiya district. According to Vishambhar Dayal, station master Auraiya, his junior was found sleeping in his office allegedly after consuming liquor. A chargesheet has been prepared and the ASM has been suspended, he said, adding that an inquiry has been ordered into the incident. NCR authorities said the ASM has been sent to a railway hospital in Tundla for a medical examination. “The Assistant station master has been sent to Tundla for a medical examination to ascertain whether he was drunk.

---||Patna||Many face post-Covid complications||PATNA: Many people from different age groups, who recovered from Covid-19 infection in the second wave of the pandemic, have reported persisting symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, sensitivity to cough reflex, bacterial infection, gastric issues or other health complications related to heart, lungs, limbs, intestine and brain. Shivansh Kumar, 7, from Saran spent almost two weeks in the ICU for Covid-19 treatment. He is now battling with complications like abnormal growth of head, hair fall and irregular heart rate. His father Ramesh Kumar Prasad told this newspaper that Shivansh was discharged from the hospital on June 20, but he was still facing one health issue after the other. “My son developed fever, rashes on body and his blood pressure level went down. We run from one hospital to another and the doctors prescribe high doses of medicines. I guess because of that he is facing complications even after recovering from Covid-19. His blood sample has been collected and heart test was also done on July 13. We are now waiting for the doctors’ advice,” Ramesh said. Rasmi Pandey (24) of Phulwarisharif suffers from headache for hours even after taking medicine. “It is more than a month since I had been discharged from the hospital. But I still feel very weak and fragile. I am also facing gastric problem, which I had never experienced before,” she said. One Saurav Kumar (name changed), 38, from Jamui recovered from Covid-19 only a fortnight ago, but was shocked after the doctors detected diabetes. “I got steroids during the treatment, which triggered my sugar level. Although the doctors said it is temporary, I can feel some changes in my body like sweating for no obvious reason, anxiety, heaviness in chest and sometimes an increased the heart rate,” he said. Jitendra Kumar Jha, 45, is still facing respiratory problem. “Although I recovered from infection, my oxygen saturation level is hovering between 89 and 94. I am maintaining hygiene and doing exercise and taking all precautions. Sometimes, I feel that I am unable to focus on what I am reading or doing,” he said. AIIMS-Patna nodal in-charge for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar said people experiencing sudden chest pain, breathlessness and drop in oxygen saturation level should consult doctors. “At AIIMS, most of the patients who are returning to the hospital have breathlessness problem as a post-Covid complication. Due to breathlessness, their oxygen saturation level drops. The main reason behind respiratory issues is the damage to their lungs during the infection and pulmonary fibrosis. Some patients are coming back with psychosomatic, blood clots, gastric complaints, cough reflex, weakness or fatigue, blood pressure and diabetes,” he said. He advised such people to maintain proper diet, do exercise regularly, monitor the oxygen level and consult doctors for medication. “According to a recent study, breathing issues can persist from one month to an year, while weakness and fatigue continues from 20 days up to several months,” Dr Sanjeev said. Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha, medical nodal officer for Covid-19 at NMCH-Patna, said most of the patients who were severely infected, have been witnessing post-Covid symptoms. “Shortness of breath, weakness and neurological issues like depressive disorder and anxiety are some of the most common symptoms that we see in recovered patients. Counselling and meditation is important to de-stress these patients and sometimes, medication is also prescribed by the doctors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-face-post-covid-complications/articleshow/84483684.cms||Faryal Rumi

To prevent the infection from spreading in UP, where positivity rates are relatively low, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that a Covid protocol should be formulated immediately and necessary directions issued for mandatory testing and quarantine. Additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said that infection rate was high in some states and people coming from these areas into some districts of UP had tested positive. “There is a need to be very cautious. There is a protocol in place for people coming from outside who should get themselves tested and remain in quarantine. This will be implemented more strictly. Testing will be ramped up at airports, bus stations and railway stations. A new protocol is also being formulated,” he said. The CM said that despite the relatively low positivity rate in the state, it was necessary to maintain a high level of testing and contact tracing. The government is now considering making RTPCR tests compulsory for those who are coming into UP from high positivity states like the northeast, Kerala, Maharasthra, etc. While there is no requirement for a negative test to come into UP currently, officials are also mulling on introducing this, along with ramped up antigen testing at all entry ports. An official said that a final protocol will be issued very shortly. The CM has also directed officials to carry out a focused testing drive for the next 10 days, with five days dedicated to rural areas and remaining five for urban. The state is currently carrying out an average of 2.5 lakh tests a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-mulls-mandatory-covid-test-report-for-visitors-from-other-states/articleshow/84487579.cms||---

Inaugurating the new buildings of PU’s IT and placement cells at Patna Science College grounds, the VC said the virtual classroom was being constructed in 1200 square feet at an estimated cost of Rs30 lakh. Once it becomes functional, the university teachers would be able to directly prepare and record their video lectures after using the facilities of video mixing and audio dubbing in the attached control room of the studio, he said. Choudhary said a university-level committee would be constituted to examine the quality of the video lectures prepared by subject teachers. If the committee approves the lectures, the same would be uploaded to the PU website. Thus, students of the university would be able to hear these lectures from their homes. This initiative has been taken in the light of the recent UGC directive to the universities to make arrangements for holding at least 40% classes online, he said. The VC further said the IT cell of the university would monitor the dissemination of online classes and uploading of video lectures through the university management information system (UMIS). The cell would also ensure that all the PU colleges and departments remain connected with Wi-Fi 24x7. PU pro-VC Ajay Kumar Singh said the placement cell, which had so far been working from a small room of the university, has now been allocated an entire floor of the Student Activity Building of Science College. He said the activities of the placement cell would now be widened with greater placement of university students with handsome pay packages in different organizations. PU registrar Jitendra Kumar Singh, students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar, IT cell in-charge Birendra Prasad, placement cell in-charge Ashim Lal Chakraborty and development officer P K Khan were present at the function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-to-have-virtual-classroom-vc/articleshow/84483510.cms||B K Mishra

The state cabinet on Friday approved the home department’s proposal to release such convicted jail inmates in pursuance of the Supreme Court order in this regard. Many of the jails in the state are congested and, therefore, vulnerable to the coronavirus infection and transmission. However, the number of convicted inmates who will be benefited by the reprieve has to be computed, cabinet secretariat department sources said. Overall, the cabinet approved 11 proposals, including the release of Rs54.08 crore to be utilized by the South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited (SBPDCL) and North Bihar PDCL for the procurement of transformers and cable and their installation in all the government medical college hospitals, Sadar hospitals and sub-divisional hospitals. This is required to supply electricity to run the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants on their campuses. While SBPDCL has been allotted Rs26.51 crore, NBPDCL will get Rs27.56 crore. The cabinet approved the health department’s proposal for an estimated expenditure of Rs1,754.99 crore on the expansion and strengthening of healthcare services in view of the coronavirus pandemic. The money will be utilized to open community health centres at 1,015 health sub-centres, 228 additional primary health centres (APHCs) and in 86 other blocks which do not have community health centres. Besides, the cabinet gave its approval to the construction and opening of 50 other CHCs under the National Health Mission (NHM) programme.

Then the wooden door was dislodged to gain entry inside the room,” he said. Gahlot said one of the five daughters of Yadav, who lived with him, had gone somewhere and he was alone for at least ten days at least. “Yadav was on duty till July 14 morning. After that he was never seen and could not be contacted. It seems Yadav had committed suicide the same day,” the SHO said. Quoting neighbours, he said Yadav used to come under depression and didn’t ever interact with anyone. “The reasons behind it were not clear. No suicide note has been recovered. His son-in-law, a police constable, alleged that he was not granted leave. But family members have not mentioned anything about it in the written application to the police,” he said. Gahlot said Yadav had five daughters and a son. Two daughters are married. One of the daughters is also a police constable.

Farmers, particularly in Rayalaseema, were anxious over utilisation of Krishna river water for power by neighbouring Telangana state. Telangana had utilised about 27 tmc of the 29 tmc received as inflows at Srisailam in the last fortnight, AP officials allege. About 15 tmc of water was released into the ocean from Prakasam barrage due to the power generation by Telangana at Pulichintala project. “Bringing all irrigation projects under the control of the river boards, particularly the Krishna projects, will surely put tension between both the states to an end. The sharing of water should be done according to awards and allocations to the existing projects,” said Siva Racharla, an irrigation expert. He, however, observed that a working manual should be readied in such a way that the states should be allowed to make use of flood waters depending on the inflows without waiting for the formal approvals from the river boards. Kundu River Area Farmers Association leader Kamani Venugopala Reddy said that Telangana’s attitude had only helped the Centre to take over the projects. “Both the states have lost freedom to make use of waters. Now they need to depend on the mercy of the river boards,” said Venugopala Reddy. He demanded that the Centre should grant approvals for Siddeswaram, Petnikota and Gundrevula reservoirs to render justice to Rayalaseema and allow them to utilise their quota of 144 tmc water. MVS Nagireddy, vice-chairman, AP Agriculture Mission, said that the Centre should bring all the projects in Maharashtra and Karnataka under the purview of the KRMB for effective management of river waters. He said that neither Telangana nor AP would get water from upstream if Maharashtra and Karnataka were allowed to continue illegal projects in the Krishna basin. “We welcome empowering the river boards. At the same time, KRMB should be redefined as Krishna Basin Management Board (KBMB) by bringing all the projects in Maharashtra and Karnataka under the purview of a single autonomous authority,” said Nagireddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/experts-farmers-welcome-empowering-of-river-boards/articleshow/84485364.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Uncertainty still looms over ‘Shravani Mela’||BHAGALPUR: The possibility of cancellation of the ‘Shravani Mela’ for the second consecutive year due to Covid-19 pandemic has evoked mixed response from the devotees and common people here. Even though the state government is allowing various activities in phased manner under the unlock plan, but temples are closed and no religious, social and political gatherings are allowed. Shrawani Mela is organised every year in July and continues for a month. More than one crore pilgrims from across the country besides neighbouring countries Nepal and Bhutan reach Sultanganj in Bhagalpur district for the pilgrimage. While staunch devotees have expressed some resentment, majority of the locals, including people from medical fraternity, are in favour of cancellation of the Mela to check any probability of third wave. They said that if the event is allowed to be organised, the huge congregation of devotees may lead to further spread of the virus. Pundit Kunjbihari Sharma is of the view that the governments of Bihar and Jharkhand should allow the pilgrimage in strict adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour. “If possible some arrangements for ‘Jalabhishek’ by devotees under Covid preventive guidelines be taken, so that their religious aspirations get fulfilled,” said Sunil Kumar, who visits Deoghar, Baba Basukinath Dham and Tarapeeth each year along with his wife Sangeeta. Dr Sandeep Lal, president, local chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) said, “There was a sharp rise in Covid cases after Holi. Besides, lack of Covid appropriate behaviour led to the second wave of the pandemic. Hence congregation of any sort should be avoided.” Eastern Bihar Industries Association (EBIA) general secretray Alok Agarwal acknowledged that ‘Shravani Mela’ may lead to spurt in Covid cases but also said that the traders and hoteliers in Deoghar and Dumka districts are staring at huge losses to the tune of Rs 300 crore. Lakhs of kanwariyas fetch water from the Ganga at Sultanganj in Bihar and then walk over 100km to pour it on the ‘Jyotirlinga’ in Deoghar. Both Sultanganj and Deoghar residents are staring at an economically bleak year ahead. From puja essentials to hotels, food and conveyance, the devotees contribute heavily to the towns economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/uncertainty-still-looms-over-shravani-mela/articleshow/84483670.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Speaking to the media in New Delhi on Friday, a senior official of the Jal Shakti ministry said that they have held in-depth discussion and deliberations before drafting the notification. “Every word and sentence in the notification was carefully vetted without giving any scope for ambiguity,” said the official. He said that APRA, 2014 would be the basis for distribution of water and power between both the states. He said that the apex council was constituted as per section 84 of the APRA. While the Union Jal Shakti minister was the chairman of the council, both chief ministers are members. He said that the apex council first met on 2016 but failed to take a call on river management boards. However, the apex council held in October 2020 had finally decided to go ahead with issuing the notification, the official said. “Subsequently, we held discussions with all the stakeholders and experts. We have taken the views of all into consideration before finalisation of the notification,” he said. He added that AP and Telangana would have to deposit 200 crore each within 60 days of the notification to manage the boards. He said all the projects listed in schedule-II would be managed by the boards and projects listed in schedule-III would be handled by the respective states. Water releases would be made based on the indents given by the respective states from their own quotas prescribed in the APRA, 2014, he said, adding that AP had specific allocations from the tribunals and water would be shared based on the tribunal verdict. He said the relocation of the KRMB office would also be completed shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/apra-2014-to-be-basis-for-water-distribution/articleshow/84485446.cms||Samdani MN

The incident left the locals shocked as they were aware of the relationship between the two residing in Moksi village. The police said that they have registered a case of accidental death and started investigations into the case. “The deceased Harish Chavda and Seema Chavda, both 21-year-old, were neighbours. They got into a relationship a year ago and wanted to marry each other. But their parents refused to accept their relationship as they were from the same caste,” said Kirtansinh Narendrasinh, head constable, Bhadarva police station. The couple tried to convince its parents, who earn a living by farming, but failed. “Recently Seema got engaged to some other man. So, Seema and Harish decided to end their lives as they felt that their community won’t accept their relationship. They both left their home on Wednesday. Their parents tried to trace them but couldn’t find the duo. Late on Thursday night, they hung themselves with a rope on a tree,” Kirtansinh added. The cops found a bottle full of water and another bottle with some blue liquid. “We have sent the liquid for tests and also taken viscera from the bodies to ascertain if the couple consumed some poison too,” Kirthansinh said. Recently, a couple from Ghoghamba taluka in Panchmahals too had ended life in a similar fashion as their community didn’t accept their relationship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/girl-recently-engaged-ends-life-with-boyfriend-in-savli/articleshow/84485137.cms||---
---||Patna||I want to strengthen LJP at the grassroots level: Chirag Paswan||KATIHAR: Jamui MP Chirag Paswan on Friday said his priority would be on strengthening the organisation at the grassroots level after a coup in the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) founded by his father late Ram Vilas Paswan. Chirag told mediapersons in Katihar on the sidelines of his ‘ashirvad yatra’ that he was seeking people’s blessing and also trying to feel their pulse during his visit to different districts as part of the yatra. At the same time, he predicted a mid-term poll in the state. He said the NDA will not remain united in days to come, leading to a mid-term poll in the state. “We have started preparations for the mid-term polls and asked the workers of the party to be ready. I have decided to start ‘padyatra’ from October,” he added. “We were betrayed by own family members, then what to talk of others. The purpose of my yatra is to garner the support of 25 lakh voters,” Chirag said. “As a Union minister, Paswanji worked tirelessly for the food security and other related Bills in the Parliament. He had worked with six Prime Ministers of the country. Thus, we want his ‘vision document’ to be implemented in every village and every household for uplifting the condition of the poor and the downtrodden,” the LJP MP from Jamui said. The yatra will conclude with the National Council meeting in Patna, in which party workers from the grassroots to district-level will congregate, said Chirga, adding that in the coming week he will undertake the yatra at Gaya and Jehababad. “The response to my yatra is huge. Scores of people queued up in Begusarai and Naugachchia while on way to Katihar. The days are not far away when LJP will become one of the largest parties in the state,” the MP added. On possible alliance with the RJD, he said, “This is not the right time to comment.” “As far as CM Nitish Kumar and JD(U) is concerned, in the NDA alliance, the party is relegated to third position,” Chirga quipped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/i-want-to-strengthen-ljp-at-the-grassroots-level-chirag/articleshow/84483436.cms||---
---||Business||Zomato IPO subscribed 38x led by institutional bidders||MUMBAI: The initial public offering (IPO) for food delivery major Zomato was subscribed a little over 38 times, led by institutional investors with a 52 times oversubscription of the part reserved for this segment. According to BSE data, the non-institutional (high net-worth investors) portion in the Rs 9,375-crore IPO was subscribed 33 times, while the retail part was subscribed 7.5 times. Interestingly, the part reserved for Zomato’s employees, the ones who are expected to know the company better than most others, was undersubscribed. Of the 65 lakh shares earmarked for this group, 62% or a little over 40.5 lakh shares were taken by the employees. The total book size at close was for 2,751 crore shares compared to 71.9 crore shares, BSE data showed. The bidding in the offer, priced at between Rs 72 and Rs 76, had opened on July 14. The shares are expected to be listed around July 27. At the upper end of the price band, the loss-making Zomato will have a market capitalisation of Rs 60,000 crore. The company’s estimated valuation, which is on a par with the total market value of all the listed hotel companies taken together, has been a subject of much debate. Zomato’s estimated value is also equal to the combined market cap of all the listed quick service restaurants (QSRs) in India, which are its customers as well as competitors. The divide over how to approach a loss-making tech-enabled company is quite wide and palpable. In recent times, Kotak Mutual Fund MD Nilesh Shah said that IPOs of Indian new-age companies could attract global investors who have burnt their hands in similar companies in China. Chinese new-age companies have lost $800 billion worth of market cap from their top. Successful listing of new age companies’ can re-rate many existing companies, which can pull the market higher from current levels, Shah said without specifically naming Zomato. Successful listing of the company will place the IPO among the top 10 such offers in India in terms of fund mobilisations. On the other side of the spectrum is billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, also known for his acumen to invest in relatively unknown companies to bring in returns of multiple times. Speaking at a session organised by domestic broking major Motilal Oswal, Jhunjhunwala expressed skepticism about the valuation of new-age companies. When asked about his views about these companies, Jhunjhunwala said, “The party is not mine…I don’t get these (valuations).” According to the much-followed investor, Zomato could give a 10-15% upside but the risk of downside was 50-60%, he said at the online fireside chat. Jhunjhunwala said he was happy being bullish on banking, metal and commodity stocks. In the grey market for stocks, which are to be listed soon, the premium for the shares of Zomato witnessed some smart rise as subscriptions in the IPO grew during the day. At close of bidding, the GMP has risen substantially to about Rs 14 from Rs 12 on Tuesday and Rs 7.5 the day the IPO was launched, market sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zomato-ipo-subscribed-38x-led-by-institutional-bidders/articleshow/84487443.cms||---

While Prayagraj registered the highest number of cases in the category of people not wearing a mask in a public place, Fatehpur district registered the highest number of cases against people spitting in public places since the outbreak of the pandemic last year. Figures claimed that the highest number of challans (2,73,752) against the violators were issued in the Prayagraj district followed by Pratapgarh (52,881), Kaushambi (37,494) and Fatehpur (34,977).

---||Vijayawada||Will abide by the decision of Centre, says Andhra Pradesh water resources secretary J Syamala Rao||AMARAVATI: The AP government has welcomed the Centre’s decision to issue a notification to fix the jurisdiction of the Krishna and Godavari River Management Boards. Speaking to the media here on Friday, water resources secretary, J Syamala Rao, said that the government would fully abide by the decision of the Centre. He said that trouble broke out only due to the ‘unilateral decision’ of the Telangana government to utilise water for hydel power generation at inter-state projects. He said that Telangana used nearly 66 tmc of water for power generation in the last 45 days since June 1. He said that the Telangana government did not relent despite their repeated requests and instructions of KRMB. “As per the operational protocol of the projects, water from the projects should be utilised for power generation only; there is no need for irrigation. They have unnecessarily released water without seeking any permission from KRMB or indent from AP,” said Syamala Rao. He explained that Telangana tapped nearly 29 of 30 tmc received at Srisaialm project for power generation which resulted in a dip in the water level. “AP can draw water from Srisailam only when the level touches 854 ft. Unauthorised usage of water had not allowed the water level to build up at Srisailam rendering injustice to AP,” said Syamala Rao. He said Telangana had utilised another 35 tmc of water from Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala projects, and added that water went into the ocean from Pulichintala project as there were no balancing reservoirs downstream. He hoped AP could utilise its quota of water after the management of projects was taken over by river management boards. He, however, said they would request the Centre to remove Dowleswaram barrage and Prakasam barrage from the project, which would not have any impact on Telangana, from the purview of the river boards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/will-abide-by-decision-water-resources-secy/articleshow/84485106.cms||Samdani MN
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh’s approach yields victory, hopes Centre’s move will end water wars||AMARAVATI: The AP government has scored a big victory without making much noise as the Centre issued a notification fixing the jurisdiction of river management boards without taking Telangana’s objections into consideration. The state government had been struggling to contain Telangana since the latter ‘unilaterally’ started power generation at Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala projects two weeks ago. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat requesting them to intervene and stop the ‘illegal use’ of water by Telangana. Jagan had also appealed to the Centre to take over the projects by deploying Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF) in order to stop the ‘illegal use’ of water by the neighbouring state. After failing to get the expected response from New Delhi, the state government knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court by filing a writ petition seeking direction to the Centre to issue the notification for the river boards’ jurisdiction. “We welcome the Centre’s decision to empower the river boards to look after water allocations from the inter-state projects. This will resolve the frequent tussles between the Telugu states,” said the state government advisor (public affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy. He said that Telangana would not have completed Palamuru-Rangareddy, Dindi lift irrigation schemes, which were not approved by any authority, had the Centre issued the notification soon after the bifurcation in 2014. He said that AP suffered due to the undue advantage taken by Telangana in the last seven years. He said they have not lost their cool despite leaders from Telangana making provocative statements in the last two weeks. YSRC legislator Malladi Vishnu said that the Centre’s notification on river boards’ jurisdiction was big relief for AP. BJP MP GVL Narasimha Rao welcomed the Centre’s decision. He said that the notification would put an end to water wars between the two states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/aps-approach-yields-victory-hopes-centres-move-will-end-water-wars/articleshow/84485251.cms||Samdani MN

The matter came to light after former CMC standing committee chairman Nandu Nagarkar along with other Congress corporators sought explanation from municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite on why no taxes were levied on CSTPS having its two 500 MW units and dozens of buildings in CMC jurisdiction. Deputy commissioner, CMC, Ashok Gharate admitted that CSTPS has not been charged any taxes. He claimed it is matter of investigation. “The assistant commissioner concerned has been ordered to look into it. A notice has been served to CSTPS in this regard,” he said. Mohite was not available for his comment on phone. Nagarkar claimed that during his tenure as standing committee chairman, he had charged local body tax on CSTPS while the construction of new units no. 8 and 9 was under way. “Rs18 crore was recovered from CSTPS for two years starting from 2012,” he said. “CMC held a property survey in 2014 to revise taxes but completely overlooked CSTPS units and its building falling under the civic body’s jurisdiction. Why not a single penny has been recovered from CSTPS in more than six years? It has cost CMC revenue to the tune of around Rs40 crore,” said Nagarkar. He claimed that the state energy minister has been apprised of the issue and sought Rs10 crore for development works of Chandrapur “as it is the citizens who suffer due to heavy pollution from CSTPS”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chanda-civic-body-didnt-levy-tax-on-cstps-in-6-years/articleshow/84487206.cms||Mazhar Ali

He directed the officials of the state assembly secretariat to get in touch with the nodal officers appointed in various departments to get the timely replies to the questions submitted by the lawmakers for replies from the ministers on the floor of the House. The replies are put online on the assembly’s website for perusal by the MLAs concerned and others, so that more supplementary questions could be asked on any question after the minister has given his reply. The Speaker appealed to the lawmakers to play a positive role in the running of the House and also fulfil their duties without any fear. Meanwhile, opposition parties seem to gear up to take on the NDA government inside the House on price rise. State Congress will take out a cycle rally from Boring Road crossing to JP roundabout near Gandhi Maidan on Saturday. Senior party leaders will also participate in this rally.

Salim is lodged there for his alleged involvement in the June 17 Darbhanga railway station parcel bomb blast case and pan India terror plot. Salim, after his arrest with associate Kafil Ansari from Kairana in Shamli, Uttar Pradesh, on June 2, had fallen ill. The NIA was unable to take him on remand for detailed interrogation solely due to his illness. The agency on Friday prayed before the court of ADJ-XIII Rajesh Kumar Dwivedi (in-charge of special NIA court) for Salim’s three-day interrogation inside the jail from Saturday. The court allowed it. Sources said Salim is a vital link between the alleged LeT terrorist brothers Mohammad Nasir Khan and Imran Khan and Pakistan based operatives of the terror organisation. “Only he can reveal the larger pan India terror attack plot planned by the Pakistan based handlers. He had been to Pakistan several times and can tell about the people linked to LeT or ISI either based in Lahore or Karachi,” a NIA source said. Meanwhile, NIA didn’t press for further remand of Nasir and Imran following which they were forwarded to judicial custody. Both of them remained in NIA’s custody for 14 days during which they were interrogated and taken to Kairana and Hyderabad multiple times. All four will be produced again before the court on July 23. Prisons sources said doctors inside jail are treating Salim in consultation with experts from IGIMS. “He has chronic kidney disease. Several test reports of Salim were awaited,” a source said. Sources said Salim and Kafil Ansari are in the high-security ward with men guarding them round the clock. “Nasir and Imran would also be kept in a high-security ward,” the source said. Nasir and Imran were arrested from Hyderabad on June 30. They also belonged to Kairana, but had settled in Hyderabad two decades ago. The NIA sources said they had prepared an IED with liquid explosives and kept inside the parcel of garments and booked it in a train from Secunderabad to Darbhanga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nia-to-interrogate-ailing-let-recruiter-inside-jail/articleshow/84484697.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Sebi defends intervention prior to EGM of PNB Hsg||Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi on Friday informed the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) that it had to intervene ahead of the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of PNB Housing Finance to get the right valuation for placement of shares to global private equity major Carlyle and its associates through the preferential route. Sebi said that it was necessary for the company to take a new valuation report by an independent agency before going ahead with the EGM to endorse the placement. In May, PNB Housing had announced that Carlyle and its associates would take a majority stake through a combination of preferential placement of Rs 4,000 crore and an open offer for an additional 26% in the company at Rs 403 per share. Shareholders were to endorse the decision through the EGM on June 22. After Sebi asked PNB Housing to postpone the EGM, it moved SAT which allowed the meeting to go ahead but asked the company not to announce the voting outcome. On July 13, SAT had pulled up Sebi for trying to pre-empt the outcome of the PNB Housing’s EGM. Questioning Sebi’s decision to halt an EGM of PNB Housing shareholders, the tribunal had asked whether it was fair for Sebi to step in before shareholders taking a decision and whether the regulator thought that shareholders were “dummies”. The hearing in the case will continue on July 19. Last month, Sebi had written two letters to PNB Housing, one to the company to put on hold its scheduled EGM on June 22. On June 25, Sebi had written another letter to the board members of PNB Housing asking all the directors to explain why they allowed the process and pricing of the preferential allotment to Carlyle that was alleged to have flouted the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-defends-intervention-prior-to-egm-of-pnb-hsg/articleshow/84487430.cms||---

But my job has been at constant risk for the last eight months because of the pandemic,” said Usha Devi, who works as a domestic help in Danapur area. “I have to work even if the employer pays me lesser than usual. I get Rs1100 only a month from a house where I work,” she said. “I used to work in four houses and my daughter in three. However, for the last one year, we have only been working in four houses. There is only one house where I have a sense of security because the employers are old and dependent on my help,” said Gudiya, a domestic help from Patel Nagar. But there are some who consider themselves ‘lucky’ because their employers continued to pay them throughout the Covid-induced lockdown. “I have a son who does not work. He got a phone from somewhere and it consumes all his time now. My younger daughter has to be married but even getting proper meals is a big problem,” said Saraswati Kumari, a domestic help from Raja Bazaar. She added: “My didi (mistresses) has been kind enough to pay me throughout the lockdown even though she did not call me for work for almost nine months.” In various apartments across the city, only the elderly people allowed house help to work during the pandemic. “It was fairly easy for me since I worked in six houses of the same apartment before the pandemic. Now I have the permission to work only in two houses where the employers are old and cannot do much by themselves. I have had to change my house and move into a congested space because of lesser income,” said Pinky, a domestic help from Ashiana Nagar. Though the middle and affluent class is dependant on their maids, they have been sceptical about the safety of their family members when people from outside come to work. “I am a working mother of two and my husband also has a job. It’s very difficult for us to manage the house with our tight schedules. But I am ready to do all the extra work because calling a domestic help will put my children at risk,” said 38-year-old Ratna Tiwari. Mamta Tripathi from Kankarbagh also had a similar view. “We called our domestic help early in January this year, but soon after my husband, my 16-year-old daughter and I tested positive for Covid. That is when I decided not to let my house help or driver come to work any more. Covid was one of the scariest experiences of our lives and I wouldn’t wish it upon my family ever again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/domestic-help-among-worst-sufferers-during-pandemic/articleshow/84483744.cms||---

Two chowkidars have been suspended,” Champaran Range DIG Lallan Mohan Prasad told this newspaper on Friday evening. An IPRD press release said the administration had taken cognizance of sixteen ‘suspicious’ deaths (as reported by this newspaper). Earlier on Friday, DM Kundan Kumar and Bagaha SP Gorakh Kumar Jadhav (deputising for on-leave Bettiah SP), briefed some newsmen on their return from the area and said the kin of deceased Ratul Mian of Bagahi showed medical prescriptions establishing that the deceased was undergoing dialysis. Similarly, family members of Latif Sah of Deorwa, too, showed medical papers pointing to the deceased’s illness. However, the kin did not say whether the deceased took the occasional or regular tipple. The victims suddenly took ill and succumbed is all that their kin said. Saving the two deceased with medical history, the administration is treating the remaining 14 deaths as suspect cases of liquor poisoning. The kin of deceased Ram Briksh Choudhary, Lateef Sah, Bikau Sah, Bhagwan Panda, Suresh Sah, Naim Hajam, Basisth Soni, too, spoke of sudden illness leading to death, thereby not admitting liquor consumption. However, on Friday, the kin of deceased Guddu Mian (misspelt as Bhuttu Mian in earlier report), Tej Mohammad, Jawahir Mian and Julphan Mian attributed the loss of their dear ones to hooch. The kin of deceased Hira Lal Dom, Amirul Sah, Ijharul Ansari and Jhunna Mian too did not admit hooch consumption before the officials. But denials apart, that the police are investigating on the premise of a hooch mishap point to valuable leads. One such lead has led the police on the hooch trail. Mumtaz Mian of Deorwa was found under treatment at a private nursing home at Bettiah. The unconscious patient’s cousin Bhola told the police that Mumtaz had fallen ill due to alcohol which he used to consume at Thug Sah’s outlet. Police, registering a case on Bhola’s statement, are conducting raids. That the administration is rightly on the hooch track was vindicated by a fact-finding visit to the area by CPI(ML) MLA Birendra Prasad Gupta. He, too, found two victims with medical history. But for deceased Arun Pandey alias Bhagwan Panda and Jhulphan Mian, whose homes he could not visit, Gupta learnt that the remaining 13 victims suffered almost similar symptoms before their quick deaths: Nausea, vomitting, acute headache and/or stomach ache, frothing at the mouth, blurring/loss of vision and in some cases, even blackening of the body. “This tragedy is definitely due to hooch,” the MLA said on return. Meanwhile, a few videos gone viral on social media also point to hooch. Villagers in one video allege that local chowkidar Sohrab Mian threatened villagers at Deorwa on Thursday not to mention hooch before officers. “He said they’ll dig out the graves,” a villager is heard saying on camera. “I have retired. My son is the chowkidar now,” Sohrab said, denying that he intimidated villagers. “All these bhatti walas like Thug, Ajai Pasi, Santosh and Suresh want to get even with me for my action against them earlier,” he said. The DIG, meanwhile, said two chowkidars, including Sohrab’s son, have been suspended. A lady sitting beside Lal Bibi Begum, the widow od Bikau Mian, is heard saying on camera: “Jo jo sharab piyen hain sab mar gayen hain. Kuchh ki dainiye halat hai.” The area is under police boots and sniffer dogs since Friday morning. The administration has also set up medical camps -- a la Covid check-up camps. “People are being advised to avail medical attention promptly if they show any sign of illness. Door-to-door check-ups will also be done,” an IPRD Bettiah press release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/champaran-hooch-tragedy-5-held-2-chowkidars-suspended/articleshow/84483946.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

The directive was issued to the DMs during a virtual meeting held on Friday to assess the preparations for the election to the three tier panchayati raj institutions. “The candidates will be allowed to hold public meetings or rallies at the earmarked spots only,” the DMs were told. Such an initiative has been taken in the wake of Covid-19 protocol, which made social distancing mandatory to check the spread of the deadly virus. “In no case, public meetings or rallies will be held on the spots other than those identified by the district authorities,” a senior SEC official said. The exit and entry points of the venue have to be mentioned clearly. In addition, the electors will queue up at their respective polling booths in such a manner that social distancing is maintained. The DMs were asked to rope in officials of the health department to ensure that Covid-19 guidelines were strictly followed at the venue of the public meetings or rallies. The SEC also issued directives related to requisite qualification of the candidates. Neither the candidate nor the proposer should be below 21 years of age. Moreover, aspirant for the post of mukhiya can also contest for the post in other panchayats but under the same block. Similarly, for panchayat samiti member or a sarpanch, the candidates should be voters from the same block. And for the post of district board member, the candidates should be residents of the same block. For panch and ward member, the candidates should belong to the same panchayat. Meanwhile, the SEC has added two more documents in the recognized documents category for voting. Apart from the existing documents, those who don't have voter identity cards or any other recognized documents can cast their votes by showing their arms license and land ownership papers. Authoritative sources said that earlier only 14 documents were recognized by the Election Commission. Now arms license and land papers have been included in the list of the recognized documents to make the voters eligible to use their franchise. The schedule of the panchayat election to elect over 2.58 lakh representatives is yet to be announced by the Election Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sec-to-dms-identify-spots-to-hold-rallies-for-panchayat-polls/articleshow/84483623.cms||Ramashankar
---||Allahabad||Nature of worship: Uttar Pradesh temple gives saplings as ‘prasad’||PRAYAGRAJ: Intending to associate religious sentiments for increasing the ‘green cover’, the temple management of Mankameshwar temple, one of the eminent Shiva temples of the city located on the banks of river Yamuna, has decided to present a sapling to each devotee as ‘prasad’. This special prasad (saplings) is given to each devotee who performs Rudraabhishek in this ancient temple. The Mankameshwar temple dates back to several centuries and it is believed that Lord Ram himself had established the Shivlinga in the temple back in Treta Yuga. This belief associated with the temple is well known not only in the district or the country but also abroad. During the coming month of Shravan, a large number of devotees perform Rudraabhishek in the temple. During the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic (2020), the priests of the temple had performed the Abhishekam virtually and live streaming was arranged for several devotees, especially those from foreign countries. However, this year, devotees are happy that presently the temples are open and hence they can perform Abhishekam at the temple. Adding to the ecstasy of the devotees is the initiative of the temple management to present a sapling, associated with Lord Shiva and the one which is known for enhancing the level of oxygen in the atmosphere. Moreover, when the saplings come as prasad, the devotees are taking good care of the planted sapling and the priest is making the devotees pledge for protecting the tree at the time of Purnaahuti (last offering). The practice has begun on a trial run, owing to the rainy season, and the temple authorities have planned to take this up on a larger scale during the coming month of Shravan. Brahmachari Sridharanand of the temple says, “By planting saplings, the present and future of a person becomes prosperous and at the same time, the ancestors also get satisfaction. However, the present generation is ignorant of this knowledge. For this reason, pandemic like Covid-19 has occurred and costing lives. Everyone talks about environmental protection, but no one wants to plant saplings”. For this reason, people performing rituals in the temple are given a plant free of cost as a blessing to Bholenath. This automatically awakens the person’s sense of faith in that plant. He will plant the sapling and take care of it with full devotion, he added. The oxygen enhancing trees, saplings of which are being given to devotees includes Peepal, Banyan, Pakad, Neem, Sycamore, Jamun etc. Apart from this, plants of Navagraha, Tulsi, Bel, Shami, Mango etc. are also given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/devotees-get-sapling-as-prasad-in-this-shiva-temple/articleshow/84484765.cms||Rajeev Mani

Inaugurating the Centre for CSR Studies of Chandragupta Institute of Management Patna (CIMP) here Prasad observed that the government alone cannot take care of all the societal needs and hence every earning individual must spend a part of his income in social welfare work. The deputy CM said even in ancient Indian culture and tradition, social responsibility was part and parcel of our life. “Our ancestors used to spend at least one-tenth of their income in social work. I am happy to learn that even though CIMP does not qualify to be a corporate from any angle, still it has been making all efforts in fulfilling its social responsibilities. It has done commendable work by starting the centre for CSR studies with a view to educating its students about the importance of corporate social responsibilities as most of them would be serving the corporate world after completing their studies here,” he said. Prasad thanked chief minister Nitish Kumar for establishing such a brilliant management institution in the state. The products of this institute are getting employment in top companies of India and abroad. He also appreciated the efforts of its founder director V Mukund Das for ensuring the all-round development of the institute since its inception more than a decade ago. Speaking as the guest of honour on the occasion state road construction minister Nitin Nabin lauded the CIMP’s initiative in starting CSR studies for ensuring the balanced development of students’ personality and the development of the society as well. He offered all sorts of help to the institute in carrying out its CSR initiatives. Nabin also pleaded for faithful implementation of the ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ for making our cities clean and healthy. He said it is the duty of every citizen to contribute his worth towards societal development. At the outset, Prasad Sundararajan welcomed the guests. Centre’s coordinator Kumod Kumar proposed the vote of thanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/deputy-cm-opens-csr-studies-centre-at-cimp/articleshow/84483798.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna: Some PMCH buildings vacated to develop world-class hospital||PATNA: The prisoners ward of PMCH was shifted to the the building of central emergency on Friday under a phased plan to vacate the wards and departments of the biggest public health faculty of the state for demolition and reconstruction of new highrise blocks. All the four prisoners were shifted to the new ward, said PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur. This institution-cum-hospital situated on the bank of Ganga is to be upgraded from the existing 2,000 to 5,500 beds with many modern facilities at a cost of Rs5,540 crore. This is a dream project of chief minister Nitish Kumar, who had laid its foundation in early February this year. More beds with state-of-the-art facilities and an elevated road to be built on the Ashok Rajpath to provide jam-free access to the biggest hospital is likely to have a distinct place in health sector in the country. The construction company has already begun restructuring the Jeevak hostel for medical students to a seven-storey building. Dr Thakur said on completion, the new hostel would accommodate more than double the existing number of students. Health minister Magal Pandey, during his visit to the PMCH on Thursday, reviewed the progress and asked the officials to expedite the work. Thakur said the cottage building has already been vacated and its electrical appliances removed. He said the ‘Lawaris ward’ meant for orphans would be vacated on Saturday and its patients would be shifted to medicine, surgery and orthopedics wards. The PMCH administration is planning to shift the GNM school for nursing and its hostel to pharmacy college near the NMCH, he said. Many other buildings would also be vacated and handed over to the agency concerned for construction of new buildings. “However, despite many reminders, about 20 nursing staff are yet to vacate the nurses hostel slated for demolition in the first phase. Now we would issue them a final warning to shift to another building,” he said. Thakur said technical experts have already completed test piling at various sites as the first step for construction of the new G+7 buildings. Meanwhile, though the number of admitted Covid patients dropped to two on Friday, the Covid ward would not be closed, Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/some-pmch-buildings-vacated-to-develop-world-class-hospital/articleshow/84484641.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: PIL says lawyer’s dress code not suited to our climate, against religious beliefs||LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court on Friday issued a notice to Bar Council of India (BCI) on a plea seeking ban on lawyer’s dress code of black coat, robes and neck band. A division bench of Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyay and Justice Ajai Kumar Srivastava directed the Centre and High Court administration to file a response by August 18 on the public interest litigation filed by lawyer Ashok Pandey. The petitioner challenged provisions of Chapter IV of Bar Council of India Rules, 1975, framed under Section 49 (i) of Advocates Act, 1961, pleading it violated provisions of Articles 14, 21 and 25 of the Constitution. The petitioner sought directions to Bar Council of India to frame new dress code, keeping in view the country’s climatic condition, particularly during summer. “Even a mad man will dump the coat and gown in summer, but sadly lawyers and judges wear it proudly,” he pleaded. “The prescribed dress is unreasonable, unjust and violates fundamental rights of lawyers guaranteed by the Constitution and is against our religious beliefs,” he pleaded. The PIL also sought quashing of the circular framed by High Court administration that mandates wearing of black robes during hearings. “The advocates band is a religious symbol of Christianity and non-Christians cannot be compelled to wear it. Also, white sari and salwar kameez is symbolic of widows in Hindu culture and tradition. BCI did not apply its mind while prescribing the dress code and the government did not perform its duty of protecting the fundament rights of lawyers,” the petitioner said. The bench asked assistant solicitor general of India SB Pandey, advocate Anand Dwivedi and HC administration lawyer Gaurav Mehrotra to file counter affidavit. Since BCI was not represented by any lawyer, the court issued a notice to the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pil-says-lawyers-dress-code-not-suited-to-indian-climate-against-religious-beliefs/articleshow/84487562.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

It also praised the Nitish Kumar government for providing job opportunities to large number of people, including migrants, through MGNREGA. Party leaders said the target of creating 20 crore man days have been fixed for this financial year. Sharing the data of the work done in the rural areas and government’s plan for developing infrastructure in the villages, JD(U) spokespersons Ranvir Nandan and Abhiskek Jha on Friday said 4.21 crore man days have been created by the Nitish government so far in Bihar. “Nearly 10 lakh labrourers are engaged in 4.48 lakh various schemes under MGNREGA. Now our target is to create 20 crore man days in 2021-22,” Nandan said, adding that Rs150 crore will also be spent in 2021-22 on solar street lights in all the villages. Jha appreciated the increase in the participation of women in the works under MGNREGA. He said their percentage has gone up by nearly 15% in the past four years, from 40.9% in 2015-16 to 55.9% in 2019-20. The duo criticised the RJD for ignoring rural development for 15 years during its rule. “CM Nitish gave utmost priority to the development of villages. Over 61,000 village organizations, 1,161 cluster associations and nearly 10.18 lakh self-help groups have been set up in Bihar. That boosted the economic growth of people in the rural areas,” they said. They said the government has already declared 8386 panchayats ODF. The JD(U) leaders said continuing with the development of villages, the state government under Saat Nishchay part-II is focusing on providing irrigation water to all the farmlands.

---||Mumbai||In MLC nom case, governor should accept govt advice, Bombay HC told||MUMBAI: During hearing a PIL on state government nominations for 12 MLCs pending with the governor’s office for 13 months, the Bombay high court was told on Friday by the petitioner: “There is no reason why the governor should not act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers.’’ Senior counsel Rafique Dada, appearing for the state, added: “The governor has no choice but to accept the aid and advice of the council of ministers in nominating the 12 Members of Legislative Council (MLC) whose posts have been lying vacant since June 2020.” With constitutional questions being raised, the Centre wanted to make a point. The HC directed the Centre to be made party to the PIL and will hear it on Monday. One of the issues, the court said, is whether under the Constitutional provisions and rules of business, “any discretion is available to the governor not to nominate members of the Maharashtra legislative council on the aid and advice of the council of ministers”? In his PIL, Ratan Soli Luth has sought that the failure of Governor B S Koshyari to nominate be declared a breach of his constitutional duties and obligations. Luth’s counsel Aspi Chinoy submitted that the governor has to act on the advice of the ministers. It is a mandate of the constitution that all these nominated MLC have to be part of the upper House, said Dada. Ruth’s PIL said by failing to act on such nomination, the legislative council as well as the citizens of Maharashtra are deprived of such nominated councillors who have special knowledge and experience in fields of literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social service. The PIL delves into the Constitutional power and duties of the governor and several HC and SC rulings were cited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-mlc-nom-case-guv-should-accept-govt-advice-hc-told/articleshow/84487220.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Patna||Bihar: 'One bridge across Ganga at every 40km'||PATNA: The road connectivity between north and south Bihar is expected to improve further with 18 bridges over river Ganga either ready or to be made ready over the next five years. Additional chief secretary (road construction) Amrit Lal Meena said as per the chief minister Nitish Kumar’s directive, more and more bridges are being constructed by the department to ensure that people from any corner of Bihar reach Patna within five hours. Elaborating on a detailed plan of bridges, Meena told TOI: “Road construction department has planned to ease the traffic flow by constructing one bridge across river Ganga at almost every 40km. Land acquisition, forest clearance and other requirements have been completed for smooth progress of work on all the proposed bridges.” He added: “Prior to 2005, there were only four bridges with total 10 lanes across the Ganga. In the last 15 years, the chief minister gave impetus to more and more bridges. As a result, there are 18 bridges either ready or shall be ready within a span of five years with total 62 lanes.” Highlighting the connectivity from Patna to Hajipur and Sonepur, Meena said efforts have been made to ease the traffic pressure through construction of at least three new bridges. “A new 4-lane bridge parallel to JP Setu is under consideration. Also, foundation work on a new four-lane bridge parallel to Mahatma Gandhi Setu has already started. Work is also underway on Kachchi Dargah-Bidupur six-lane bridge,” Meena said. Deliberating on the new four-lane bridge parallel to Gandhi Setu, the additional chief secretary said: “It is being constructed by the ministry of road transport and highways. It is 5.634-km-long while the total length of the bridge project (including approach road) is 14.5km. There is provision of a flyover or viaduct at every road crossing. There will be four minor bridges with a four-lane service road of 21.15km. The target is to complete the project by the end of 2024 with a total cost of Rs1800 crore.” Meena also claimed that with the rehabilitation of eastern flank of Mahatma Gandhi Setu by March 2022, there would be no problem of traffic jam in the area. Rehabilitation of the 39-year-old Gandhi Setu is being done by demolishing the old superstructure of the bridge, except pillars, and erecting triangular steel girders with concrete slab — as seen in the rail-cum-road bridges like Rajendra Setu or Koilwar rail bridge — on the existing pillars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-bridge-across-ganga-at-every-40km/articleshow/84483584.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Is it becoming harder and tougher to see any difference? Political observers say the parties are becoming more and more alike and cite the example of Eatala Rajender joining the BJP. Eatala was once a radical left wing student leader and later sailed with the TRS for close to two decades. Not just Eatala, at least a dozen leaders have jumped the fence in the last seven years by switching their ideologies and by not unduly worried about political ethics. Tula Uma, who joined the BJP along with Eatala, was also associated with far left wing groups. Eatala was an active leader of Progressive Democratic Students Union, a student wing of the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) New Democracy, a splinter group of Naxalites, in the early 1980s. Without batting an eyelid, Eatala said: “My DNA is secular. My agenda now is neither right nor left. My only agenda is to get Telangana rid of the dictatorial and feudal rule of KCR.” Once staunch Congress leaders, G Vivek Venkatswamy, Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy and Gudur Narayan Reddy are now with the BJP. Businessman-turned-politician AP Jithender Reddy served as Mahbubnagar MP twice — once as a BJP member between 1999 and 2004 and as TRS MP in the 16th Lok Sabha between 2014 and 2019. When denied ticket by the TRS, he again went back to the BJP in June 2019 along with DK Aruna, who served as a Congress minister in united Andhra Pradesh. Political analyst S Ramakrishna attributes this to leaders growing fond of authority and not wanting to give up their control. “During the ’80s, leaders wore their ideology on their sleeves. Now, it’s all about wielding power and having clout. Take a look at the leaders in Telugu states, a majority of them have changed one party or the other.” Some leaders say their ideological affiliations in their younger days have got nothing to do with the present day demands of political arthimetic. “Till ’90s, because of oppression, there was a constant need to agitate and fight for rights in Telangana. Now, we are in the process of rebuilding. President Obama won the US elections based on the concept of perhaps only one word -- Change,” a senior BJP leader, not wanting to be named, pointed out, saying ‘change’ is the buzzword in politics. Congress MLA Danasari Anasuya alias Seethakka, who was once a gun-toting Naxal dalam commander, says joining a political party does not mean moving away from serving people and forgetting one’s ideology. “I had a purpose when I was with left wing groups. But, I realised soon I can serve people better if I join the mainstream,” Seethakka says. She gave up arms in 1997 and joined the TDP in 2004.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ideology-blurs-leftists-take-a-right-turn-in-state/articleshow/84487194.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Goa||Gunmen nabbed, were hired to kill Vasco businessman: Cops||VASCO: The two accused who killed Amir Naik on Thursday evening at Ranghavi Estate, Bogmallo, were arrested early Friday morning, police said. Nine teams of South Goa police worked for 12 hours throughout the night to nab the accused who had fled with the weapon. Police said the duo was hired to kill the victim. They were engaged by a person from Uttar Pradesh who lives in New Vaddem, at the behest of another person, police said. Incidently, the victim is also a resident of New Vaddem. Both the Uttar Pradesh natives — Shailesh Ramasare Gupta, 29, from Gorakhpur and Shivam Sarvajeet Singh, 22, from Jaunpur — were arrested from Cansaulim railway station and taken into seven days police custody. Naik was shot in the head at close range outside a house in an affluent colony at Bogmallo, where he had gone with a friend. He later succumbed to injuries in hospital. The victim was involved in property dealings and mining, and also operated a transport business. Police said that although it was suspected that the motive for the murder was a property deal gone awry, investigations are under way and all angles are being probed, including a love affair. Superintendent of police Pankaj Kumar Singh said, “The accused came to Vasco twice to meet Naik. The accused were specially invited by a friend to commit the crime.” Both accused had arrived in Goa around 10 days ago and stayed in Anjuna. They rented a car from Calangute to drive to Vasco. “We found empty cartridges in the hired car. We are investigating how they procured the weapons. We are also probing the network behind the crime,” Singh said. Police have rounded up some persons who came in contact with the accused to obtain more information about their activities in the state. Hiring contract killers to murder a local businessman has put the spotlight on high-profile people being involved in the case, police said. “The motive behind the murder is yet to be ascertained. Investigations have revealed the names of more people and information connected to the murder. We are hopeful of cracking the case and arresting more and closely-connected people with the case,” he added. Sources said that the accused worked as a crane operator and part-time truck driver in Maharashtra. They are known to be contract killers, police said, adding that efforts are under way to learn more about their background by contacting police in other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gunmen-nabbed-were-hired-to-kill-vasco-bizman-cops/articleshow/84487221.cms||Ruvina Khan

On reaching Mumbai, all the job aspirants filed a complaint with Sahar police against the travel agents and Manpower Consulting Firm, which has offices in Delhi and Kolkata, for allegedly duping them with false promises of jobs in Gulf nations and collecting between Rs1lakh-Rs1.5 lakh fees from each of them. Police arrested the two agents, who were booked for cheating and forgery. “The victims hail from Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Kolkata, etc. They had taken flights out of Mumbai. Some of them had paid fees for an engineer’s job, while some are in the blue collar category. The consulting firm hired the agents to make arrangements for the job aspirants’ flight tickets and their hotel stay,” said a police officer. The flyers said they learnt they were duped when immigration officials at Maldives started making enquiries. “The arrested travel agents who travelled with the victims said the plan was to keep the job aspirants in 14-day hotel quarantine in the Maldives before arrangements to send them to Saudi Arabia were completed. However, immigration officials found there was no proper documentation for their stay,” said the police officer. The officer said the Maldives route was planned as there are no direct flights to Gulf nations from India till July 21. The victims alleged they were issued fake return tickets, which the police are verifying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-maldives-deports-168-job-seekers-2-agents-held/articleshow/84487230.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The boy is believed to be from Punjab as he has identified photographs of the Golden Temple as well as bus stands in Amritsar and Attari. Authorities here have sought permission from the Rajasthan child commission to go to Attari in Punjab to look for the boy’s home. According to officials, they have not been able to find as to how the boy reached Jodhpur. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, “Other than being hearing and speech impared, the boy, whom we call Gopi, is very intelligent and active. However, he has not been able to tell us as to how he reached here or for how long it has been since he left home. On being shown pictures, he did confirm that he is from Punjab. Unfortunately, the child commission department there is not cooperating well.” Though state officials advertised and provided information about the boy, they have not yet received any response. Counselors also failed get any information from the child. Officials stated that they would keep making efforts to get more details about his background and take him back home. Recently, a 11-year-old motherless girl, who ran away from home in Jaisalmer over a month back, was found living in a children's shelter in Madhya Pradesh’s Vidisha. Though Rajasthan’s child commission asked its counterpart to send the girl home, she has not yet returned. The girl apparently fled from home as she was being regularly beaten up by her father. The girl had joined a group of ragpickers and was spotted at Vidisha railway station by a school teacher who took her to the shelter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/hearing-speechimpaired-boy-frompunjab-stuck-injodhpur-shelter/articleshow/84487232.cms||---

Justice Shircy V said: “Harassment, abuse and torture, both mental and physical towards married ladies are increasing by day to pressurize them to bring more wealth to the family of the bridegroom. Though so many cases are being registered against husbands and in-laws, there is no change in the attitude of the society towards married women and family members. The attack towards them are of course, for various reasons, making their matrimonial homes as most dangerous place to live…This has to be stopped forever. But, if anticipatory bail is granted to such wrongdoers that will definitely give a ‘wrong message’ to the society.” Sijo Rajan RV of Vattappara in Thiruvananthapuram, his parents, and his brother were accused of attacking Sijo’s wife, her father, and her brother when they came to the matrimonial home to take the bride back to her home as she complained of torture. A car and Rs 7 lakh were given as gift to Sijo’s wife during marriage in September last year and her parents had registered two acres in her name, as per the prosecution case. Sijo is alleged to have forced his father-in-law to transfer 10 cents to his name. At the matrimonial home, the bride allegedly faced torture from the accused who demanded that the two acres should also be transferred to Sijo’s name. In the attack on April 14, the bride’s father sustained severe injuries on his neck and spinal cord. The bride and her brother also sustained fractures, as per the petition. Advocate Thomas J Anakkallunkal, who represented the bride, argued that the bride contacted her parents when the physical torture became unbearable and that she and her family members are still undergoing treatment for the injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/doc-denied-pre-arrest-bail-in-dowry-case/articleshow/84486160.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana earns another Rs 730 crore from Khanamet land auction||HYDERABAD: A day after earning Rs 2,000 crore from Kokapet land auctions, Telangana saw another successful run at Khanamet on Friday, with five plots raising Rs 729.4 crore for the state coffers. The total area that went under the hammer was 14.9 acres. While the highest bid on Thursday touched Rs 60.2 crore (per acre) — Rajapushpa Properties picked up 1.67 acres at that rate in Golden Mile to widen its existing four-acre land parcel at the same site — in round two, the top bid hit Rs 55 crore. The 2.9 acre land (labelled plot no. 14) went to another city-based real estate firm, Manjeera Constructions. The firm has multiple residential, commercial and mall projects in the city, particularly Kukatpally — only 10 minutes away from Khanamet . “We are thrilled with our new land possession,” said G Yoganand, chairman and managing director of Manjeera Group. “We will be developing a high-end residential project here, which would be our tallest venture so far; standing at 30 floors. Given the multiple advantages of this location and the availability of wide roads on all sides, the price of this property will certainly be fixed upwards of Rs 8,000 per square feet. Also, this particular pocket of the city handles 40% traffic working along the western corridor.” Abutting Hyderabad’s IT epicentre — Hi-Tec City — Khanamet is already home to large residential and office spaces. Also on the cards are, real estate sources say, are a fleet of new ventures including a 1,000-bed hospital. Not surprising then, the location has been witnessing a surge in land prices on the past few years. For Friday’s auction, conducted by Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, the state had set the minimum bid amount at Rs 25 crore per acre. While Manjeera’s bid more than doubled that price, the others winning amounts too ranged at a high Rs 43.6 crore to Rs 50.4 crore per acre for plot sizes ranging between 2 acres and 3.7 acres. Those who successfully bid for them were Linkwell Telesystems, Uptown Life Projects and GVPR Engineers. “Most bidders are expected to develop commercial projects on these sites,” said Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary industries and commerce, reiterating Khanampet’s USPs. “That it is so close to Kukatpally is also a great advantage since a sizeable population of the workforce employed in the IT sector lives in this area, which has managed to keep its affordability tag intact. We only hope bidders can deliver the projects soon. The government will provide the support they need,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-earns-another-rs-730-crore-from-khanamet-land-auction/articleshow/84487218.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Nagpur||Expenses higher than revenue: Biggest failure of solid waste management in country||NAGPUR: Management of municipal solid waste is a big challenge for the country, the main reason being operational expenses are higher than the revenue earned, due to wrong selection of waste management technology. This was highlighted by Harish Hirani, director of Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI), Durgapur, which is a mechanical engineering research institute and a constituent laboratory of the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Hirani was speaking in a webinar on ‘CSIR-CMERI’s Municipal Solid Waste Technology’ for municipal corporations and other administrative bodies and industries. The meet was organised by Ministry of Micro Small and Medium Enterprise – Development Institute, Nagpur, in association with HVPM’s College of Engineering and Technology, Amravati. Stating that improper management of municipal solid waste is responsible for both surface and underground water pollution, Hirani said, “The major component of municipal solid waste is bio-degradable waste, which is in the range of 60-80%. Improper handling of this waste not only leads to emission of toxic greenhouse gases during its decomposition but also pollutes the groundwater through percolation of leachate.” CMERI has developed a Decentralised Solid Waste Management Technology (DSWMT) comprising of a number of modules, which tries and provides solution for management of every aspect of solid waste. “The pilot plant of CMERI offers module-wise technologies for the disposal of individual components of waste, which can help the user division obtain a sustainable model,” said officials. Inaugurated in November 2017, the technology is being implemented in CRPF Group Centre, Durgapur, Senapati, Imphal East, Imphal West, Bishupur districts of Manipur, and plastic agglomeration module in all 16 districts of Manipur. “Efforts are also underway for the installation of a 5-tonnes per day plant for fruit and vegetable waste, to be sponsored by the Punjab Mandi Board, Mohali,” said officials. The DSWMT consists of eight modules, including mechanized segregation, bio-methanation, composting, briquetting, pyrolysis, plastic agglomeration, plasma gasification, and bricks and aggregates. “Proper disposal of bio-waste at the generation site in decentralized manner is of utmost importance as it only taps the energy from the waste through production of biogas in anaerobic digesters. Moreover, briquettes from waste, compost and vermi-compost also add to the sustainability of the model, thereby reducing the cost of transportation and the associated pollution from fossil fuel combustion in vehicles carrying waste,” the experts said. They added that the voluminous segregated plastic waste and high bulk density inert waste can be collected, segregated and disposed in a centralized pilot plant to be developed zone-wise in an eco-friendly way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/expenses-higher-than-revenue-biggest-failure-of-solid-waste-management-in-country/articleshow/84487222.cms||Manka Behl
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Tree experts in all wards to assess risk scientifically||MUMBAI: After carrying out the city’s first scientific survey of trees in south Mumbai (D ward), BMC will soon roll out scientific risk assessment of trees through arborists across the city in other wards. Once the plan takes off, wards in the city will be able to engage arborists to carry out risk assessment of trees. A pilot project to carry out scientific risk assessment of trees took off in south Mumbai last month. BMC has roped in arborist Vaibhav Raje for the job. TimesViewBMC’s move to get a scientific risk assessment is welcome. Rising incidents of uprooting of trees show that tree-trimming is vital so that falling trees and branches don’t hurt people, and so that trees are not hacked in the guise of trimming. BMC must carry out trimming work scientifically through experienced agencies. It should be made mandatory to have an arborist or horticulturist on site before every trimming exercise.As part of the scientific risk assessment of trees, a detailed survey of trees will be done, using the resistograph (see infographic) and a report will be submitted to the BMC. The survey will take around two weeks for each ward and will cover around 100-150 trees in every ward. “We have put up a proposal to allow wards to engage arborists for scientific risk assessment of trees in the wards,” said a senior civic official. “Once approval is given, wards will be able to engage arborists to get trees surveyed.” Every year, several people die when trees or branches fall as they are not trimmed properly by BMC-appointed contractors who don’t have expertise in tree-cutting. Two people died due to tree fall incidents on May 17 as cyclone Tauktae hit the city. Over 40 have died due to tree fall incidents in the city since 2012. Raje said that scientific timing of trees is important. “We will not use a resistograph on all trees. A detailed visual survey will be done first and those trees that are vulnerable will be studied further... Once a proper risk assessment plan for trees is put in place, we can save the city’s green cover. We hope to finish this survey in two weeks and submit the report to the BMC,” Raje said. He said that he had used the resistograph (see infographic) to check the structural stability of trees in Colaba last year. BJP’s MLA from Bandra (west), Ashish Shelar, had demanded that the civic body appoint an arborist to protect trees ahead of the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tree-experts-in-all-wards-to-assess-risk-scientifically/articleshow/84488461.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

As many as 99.99% of its SSC students passed the exam. The overall pass percentage for Nashik division was 99.96%. Dhule district (99.98%) bagged the second position, Nashik (99.97%) was placed third and Jalgaon (99.4%) fourth. “There were 2,00,155 students who appeared for the examinations. Of them, 2,00,093 have cleared the examinations. The results of 62 students have been withheld and the state board would soon take decision about them,” said Krushnakumar Patil, president of Nashik Divisional Board. This time, more percentage of girls from Nandurbar and Nashik districts have cleared the exams than the boys. In Jalgaon, higher percentage of boys have cleared the exam compared to girls. In Nandurbar district, all 9,748 girls have cleared the examinations. In Dhule district, the passing percentage of the boys and girls is same. In case of repeaters, 7,513 students appeared for the examinations, of which, 7,003 or 93% have cleared the examination. According to the officials, as many as 39% of the students got distinction. In Dhule, 13,450 students (41%) of those appearing for the examinations have received distinction. The students and their relatives had tough time in getting the results online. “It was tough time for us to view the results because the website did not respond. I had been to the internet café to view the result as my father was on duty. I waited there for one hour,” said Sunita Kamble, one eager student. Many students gave similar reaction and expressed their frustration at not being able to access their result. An official from the divisional board said that heavy traffic to the website led to problems. “Since there were a large number of hits at the same time, the site could not respond. The situation was normal after many hours – when fewer people were trying to look for the results,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nandurbar-gets-top-rank-in-nashik-division-ssc-result/articleshow/84483778.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Presently, the card holders are being given five-kg rice per unit free of cost. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced this five-kg free rice every month to the white card holders up to Deepavali keeping in view of the second wave of the pandemic. The issue has been taken to the notice of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who is expected to take a final decision soon. Though it was expected that the state government would add another five kg of rice to the PM’s rice quota and distribute 10-kg of rice free of cost to the card holders from July, it did not happen. Enquiries revealed that the state government would incur Rs 700 crore financial burden if it extends five-kg free rice every month up to Deepavali in addition to five-kg free rice from the central quota. tnn Enquiries revealed that the state would incur Rs 700 crore financial burden if it extends five-kg free rice every month up to Deepavali in addition to five-kg free rice from the Centre||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-to-take-a-call-on-5kg-free-rice/articleshow/84487234.cms||---

An appellate tribunal under PMLA Act had earlier directed the authorities to obtain cash deposit of equivalent worth of this land from the company and release the land from attachment. Accordingly, the company deposited Rs 5.6 crore with the ED, but the agency did not release the land till now. ED’s counsel Anjali Agarwal said they have challenged the tribunal order before the high court and the HC earlier asked both parties to maintain status quo in respect of this land. Hetero counsel P Nagendra Reddy said it is unfair on the part of ED to keep both the land and the cash with it. The bench, too, found the action of the ED unacceptable. It refused to entertain the request of the ED counsel for more time and modified the earlier status quo order and directed the ED to release the Hetero land. Taking up a related case in the quid pro quo episode filed by Jagathi publications and auditor Vijay Sai Reddy, Justice Shameem Akther of the high court sought copies of the counters filed by all the parties in physical format and posted the case on July 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-orders-ed-to-release-hetero-land/articleshow/84487235.cms||---

The minister has asked the leaders of the community along with the government officials to promote benefits of the vaccine in tribal areas where hesitancy towards vaccination was high. “All those saying vaccine is harmful and it causes or induces illness to the person who has been vaccinated is nothing but rumours. People should not believe it and see what the local government doctor is saying, and get vaccinated at the earliest,” Bhujbal said. The guardian minister was addressing a programme organized in Yeola for presenting Khavti – financial assistance to tribal families by state government. The state government has decided to give Rs 231 crore as assistance to the tribal families due to loss of work during Covid-19. Khavti is an assistance given to the tribal families since 1978 in the form of loans during the lean period of monsoon when they are unable to find job anywhere, on returnable basis. The practice was stopped in the year 2013-14 and was revived by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) after it came to power. The assistance was provided to the families to help them fight Covid-19 during which many people have failed to get jobs. The assistance is being given in cash of Rs 2,000 transferred directly to the beneficiaries’ account and even food grains and other consumables worth Rs 2,000 to every family. There are 61,000 such families that will receive the financial aid from the government. Bhujbal has asked the authorities to expedite the process of giving Khavti to the beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-urges-tribal-people-to-get-shots/articleshow/84483750.cms||---

Conveying their sentiments during the BAC meeting, the opposition parties said that all the unfinished business of the 14th assembly session needs to be taken up for discussion. Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP) said the government doesn’t want to have 10- day session as they know the government would be exposed for corruption and scams. “I have submitted a dissent letter to the speaker during the BAC meeting and strongly objected to the government’s decision to prorogue the 14th session assembly,” leader of the opposition Digambar Kamat said. An emergency business advisory meeting was convened on March 30 and the session was adjourned till July 19 in view of the rise in Covid-19 cases. The state budget was to be passed during this session from July 19, which was to be of 10-days duration with all the remaining business scheduled from March 30 to April 16 to be carried over. The speaker had assured the MLAs that the session was not prorogued and that all pending business would be taken up. “The ploy to replace these 10 days of important and critical business by a mere three days of tokenism is unacceptable. This will mean that even the budget will have to be passed without proper discussion on the demands, which is just not acceptable,” GFP president Vijai Sardesai said. “Shocked to see that my Resolution to recommend to Government of India @PMOIndia to make Anti-Defection Law stronger to put an End to Defections does not figure on the List of Ballot. Intentions of the @BJP4Goa Government to promote Defections & encourage Horse Trading exposed,” Kamat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-against-10-day-session-afraid-of-scams-being-exposed-opposition/articleshow/84487245.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||Exempt us from giving medical seats for all-India quota: Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Besides exemption from NEET, Tamil Nadu has also sought the Centre’s nod to free itself from allocating UG, PG and super-speciality medical seats in state-run institutions to All India Quota (AIQ), health minister Ma Subramanian has said. If the request is accepted, more than 1,700 more medical seats, including 500 MBBS seats, will be available for TN students, he said. But the decision may also deny TN students the option of getting into government medical colleges of other states. Every year, TN surrenders nearly 500 of 3,400 MBBS seats from 25 government medical colleges, 950 of 1,938 postgraduate seats in 14 TN government medical colleges and all the 184 DM seats and 95 MCh seats across 12 colleges to the central pool under AIQ. A day after meeting union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya in New Delhi, Subramanian told reporters that as a part of the 13 demands from the state, the government has sought exemptions from seat-sharing for AIQ. “We are awaiting permission from the National Medical Commission to sanction the admission of 1,650 students to the 11 new medical colleges in Tamil Nadu. Once we get the permission, we will start discussions regarding seat-sharing,” he told reporters. All state governments surrender 15% of MBBS seats, 50% of post-graduate medical seats and entire super-specialty seats for All India Quota, to enable the central government to admit students through a common pool. The medical counselling committee, under the directorate-general of medical services, admits students through a centralised online counselling based on marks obtained in NEET. If any of the surrendered seats remain vacant after two rounds of counselling, they are returned to the state. If the state decides not to share seats with the Centre, then admission to all these medical seats will be done by the state selection committee attached to the directorate of medical education following merit in NEET and 69% rule of reservation. “This way we can ensure all seats in the state are reserved for students belonging to our state,” Subramanian said. “Admission to all super-specialty seats we created in our colleges will also be reserved for our students,” he said. Doctors’ bodies and several political parties, including AIADMK, have been demanding 50% reservation of seats for OBC students, as per the 69% reservation formula in Tamil Nadu in the centralised counselling. “Many students from our state go to other states to study medicine after clearing PG NEET. They will lose that opportunity,” said former health minister C Vijayabaskar. Tamil Nadu has a large number of seats in government colleges, he said, adding: “We have to study the benefits of not sharing seats before making a policy decision.” Aspiring students and parents were also worried. “We have only 300 super-specialty seats. Many Tamil Nadu doctors have to spend more money for admissions in deemed universities if the option of taking part in common counselling is denied,” said Dr Sindhu H, who wants to be an interventional cardiologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/exempt-us-from-giving-med-seats-for-all-india-quota-tn/articleshow/84486180.cms||---

The submission was made by NIA in opposition to the bail plea filed by Swapna Suresh, a key accused in the case. NIA submitted that the accused were well aware that their actions would damage India’s relations with UAE. They conspired, recruited people, formed a terrorist group, raised funds, and smuggled around 167kg of gold from UAE between November 2019 and June 2020 in the name of cargo for diplomats at the consulate general of UAE at Thiruvananthapuram, the court was informed. These acts amount to offences under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), including committing a terrorist acts, conspiracy, and being part of a terror organization, NIA informed while arguing that Swapna should not be granted bail. She has connections with influential people within the country and abroad and they will be used to abscond from the process of law, NIA has contended. A thorough investigation was conducted by the NIA and it has established that prime accused Sarith, co-accused Swapna, and the other accused committed a terrorist act while knowing that smuggling large quantity of gold into India would threaten the security and economic security of the country, NIA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gold-smuggling-a-terrorist-act-nia/articleshow/84486221.cms||---

This is perhaps for the first time a police inspector posted in the city was suspended on corruption charges. Police said inspector Vishnu Vardhan Reddy and SI Kumara Swamy have been suspended after internal inquiry. Police had traced a lorry, which was carrying a load of stolen iron rods. But the inspector, instead of registering a case, let off the lorry driver after allegedly taking bribe. In another case, too, the inspector accepted bribe from an accused nabbed for transporting banned tobacco products. The inspector accepted the bribe through the SI to grant a station bail to the accused in 2020. The accused allegedly paid Rs 50,000 bribe and obtained the bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inspector-si-suspended-for-accepting-bribe/articleshow/84487239.cms||---

He said the government earned Rs 2,000 crore from the auctions at Kokapet on Thursday. Claiming that some leaders were making baseless allegations on the auctions, the CM said only those government lands which were prone to encroachment were being sold. Speaking at Telangana Bhavan after inviting former Telangana TDP president L Ramana into the TRS along with other leaders on Friday, the TRS president said the government would launch an insurance scheme for the weavers’ community in next two to three months.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Viagra ‘sellers’ of Kalina dupe US citizens, 3 held||MUMBAI: An illegal call centre that duped US citizens by offering to sell Viagra and other drugs without the mandatory medical prescription was busted on Friday by the crime branch of the city police. Three people, including the owner of the call centre that operated at night from a rented place in Kalina, have been arrested. The scam involved lakhs of rupees, said officials. The call centre employees would call up people in the US, using fake names and enquired if the person at the other end needed to buy Viagra or other drugs for which a medical prescription is a must. The call centre employees also offerred other drugs which cannot be bought over the counter without a medical prescription, said a police officer. Such drugs include Cialis, Tapentadol, Soma, Xanax, and Tramadol. An official said that the call centre had an agent in the US who would ask interested buyers to deposit money in a bank account in the US. “The agent would deduct his commission and sent the rest to his accomplices in Kalina,” said the officer. “Once the money was received, nothing was sent to the buyer who would end up being duped.” Transactions worth lakhs of rupees were routed through this account and the financial records will be studied, said an investigator. Those arrested included Kunal Gupta (26), owner of the illegal call center, and two managerial level agents _ Arshad Sayyed (21) and Faiz Qureshi (20). They were produced in a court which sent them to police custody till Monday. The police are now hunting for a partner in the call centre, Rahul Jaiswal. Those working at the call centre made calls using Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to avoid getting caught, the police, said, adding that they had purchased data of US citizens from the darknet. Employees at the call centre were paid between Rs 15,000 and Rs 25,000 a month. Teams from the Social service Branch and crime branch led by officers Ghanshyam Nair, inspector Bhosale raided the call centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-viagra-sellers-of-kalina-dupe-us-citizens-3-held/articleshow/84487243.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Kolkata||Now, a fake ED official in cop net||KOLKATA: After a fake IAS officer and fake CBI special counsel, now a fake ED officer was arrested by the detective department from Esplanade on Friday. The man posing posing as a senior ED officer called up Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen in an attempt to dupe him. The accused — identified as Chandan Roy (38), resident of Dum Dum — had allegedly called Sen and introduced himself as a senior ED official. The accused Roy, who introduced himself as Shantanu Maitra, claimed that several cases against Sen were pending with ED and they could be resolved if he agreed to a financial settlement. Sen immediately lodged a complaint with the local police as well as with the detective department too. The accused has similar cases registered against him at Karaya and Tangra police stations. “Roy was impersonating as Shantanu Maitra, an officer of ED. He called the complainant and offered his help in tackling cases in lieu of money. A case was registered against him at the Karaya police station under different sections of the IPC pertaining to 170 (impersonating a public servant), 419 (cheating for impersonation), 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation). We arrested the accused from the Esplanade bus terminus near 12B bus stand around 9.15 pm,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “I am thankful to Kolkata Police for its prompt action. Such incidents unveils how the present BJP government has lowered down the image of institutes CBI and EB,” Sen told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/now-a-fake-ed-official-in-cop-net/articleshow/84486210.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Delhi: How spurt in flu cases is sending confusing signals||NEW DELHI: Even though the number of Covid-19 cases in the capital have remained the same over the last week, doctors report a significant rise in the incidences of cough and sore throat — symptoms to both Covid-19 and seasonal flu. Doctors at Apollo, Max, Manipal and Sir Ganga Ram hospital among others said they were seeing at least four to five patients everyday who presented with fever, cough and sore throat, but tested negative for Covid-19. “As a precautionary measure, we advise a Covid-19 test and even if they test negative, we ask them to isolate and keep a tab on vitals like oxygen saturation,” Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine at Apollo hospital, said. Dr Ankita Badiya, consultant, infectious diseases at HCMCT Manipal Hospitals in Dwarka, said many patients were rushing to OPDs panicking about Covid-19 even though tests for the viral infection came negative. “We haven’t gotten rid of the Covid pandemic, but other influenza viruses have also not waned completely,” Badiya said. “We tell our patients not to panic but take all precautions.” Both Covid-19 and flu (also referred to as the seasonal influenza) cause respiratory disease and are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. Yet, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are important differences between the two viral infections and how they spread. “Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms),” the WHO says. It adds that while the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. Covid-19 causes higher mortality compared to seasonal influenza. “Seasonal flu cases are going up due to change in weather,” Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital said. Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max Saket, said it was important to reassure the patients since there's a lot of fear and panic associated with the novel coronavirus and advise them to follow up on a regular basis. “We also need to test patients coming with fever, sore throat and other symptoms for dengue, malaria and typhoid since this is that time of the year when we see lots of such cases and the challenge is to differentiate them from Covid-19,” Dr Tickoo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-spurt-in-flu-cases-is-sending-confusing-signals/articleshow/84487248.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Nashik||High marks thrill Nashik students, some still keen on exam||NASHIK: A large number of the students said the state education board had given them a gift at the time when they were stuck with Covid but a small section wanted a more concrete evaluation. “The evaluation is based on past performance. Since the second wave of Covid infection was at its peak between March and May, the Board’s evaluation method brought much relief to students. Many were affected due to Covid in some way or the other way,” said Rohit Kulkarni, who scored 87% marks. However, there are others who believe that there should have been an examination to judge the real learning. “Given the pass percentage, it shows that the Board has helped the students clear their exams so that they can move ahead in their career. But at the same time, the Board could have conducted online examinations thorough the Optical Mark Recognition sheet with students being given the options to attempt the same,” said Keshav Patil, who scored 91% in the exam. The teachers also pointed out that the examinations and the results – both were in the favour of the current situation. This should be considered as an exception and hoped that newer ways would be evolved to deal with such situations in the future. “During the March – May period, the schools could have physically conducted the examinations of the students as only class X students would have required to come to the schools. We hope the Board will take proper decision on conduct of examinations – just on the lines that examinations were conducted by Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU),” said Ragini Kulkarni, a teacher with a private English medium school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/high-marks-thrill-students-some-still-keen-on-exam/articleshow/84483808.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Hyderabad||Do TRS, KTR expect women to sit indoors, asks YS Sharmila||HYDERABAD: YSRTP president YS Sharmila on Friday assailed TRS working president KT Rama Rao and the state government’s ‘anti-women’ stand, alleging that there was no respect for women in the ruling TRS. “KTR who,” she said when asked about his recent comments mocking the YSRTP chief’s deekshas every Tuesday. “Is he talking like a chief minister’s son? They do not even have a proper representation of women in their party and the cabinet. Do they expect women to sit indoors?” she shot back. Addressing her maiden press conference here, Sharmila said her late father and former CM YS Rajasekhara Reddy was never opposed to Telangana. She said he had in fact recommended formation of Telangana to then government at the Centre. “I have studied here. I am married here and had given birth to my children here. Why do you (TRS) consider me as an outsider,” she wondered. The YSRTP chief clarified that she did not float a new party because she was denied the Kadapa MP ticket. “No one floats a party if they have problems with their maternal home. I have come here because the party (TRS) has failed the people after formation of a separate state. Many youngsters are dying by suicide due to lack of jobs,” she said. Taking a dig at the other parties, she said Congress was bought by Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP and that partymen do not know if they were in the TDP or Congress. “The BJP is totally in league with the TRS in the state. If BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay has proofs against the TRS government’s corruption, why hasn’t the Centre taken any action till now,” she sought to know. She termed the BJP as a communal party. “We are a secular party. We are the only effective opposition in the state,” she said. To a pointed question if she was the ‘shadow’ of YSR, Sharmila said: “I am a replica of YSR.” She said she would try to bring ‘Rajanna rajyam’ (YSR era) in Telangana. In another important revelation, Sharmila said she won’t mind using the services of political strategist Prashant Kishor for her party. “Why not, we will use him when the need arises,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/do-trs-ktr-expect-women-to-sit-indoors-asks-sharmila/articleshow/84487261.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Kolkata||Kolkata film festival’s 27th edition shifted to January 2022 as Covid third wave fear looms||KOLKATA: Keeping in mind the possibility of a Covid-19 third wave, the Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF) will not be held this November. The 27th edition of KIFF will be held from January 7 to 14, 2022. A change in KIFF chairmanship too is expected this year. The final call will be taken by the chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The 26th edition of KIFF was also pushed from last November owing to the health concerns involving the pandemic. The physical edition of 26th KIFF was successfully held from January 8 to 15 this year. It was the first international film festival in India to have a physical edition. The dates of the 51st edition of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) had also been pushed from November last year. A hybrid edition of the festival was held this year from January 16 to January 24. Unlike KIFF, IFFI will host another edition this year again. The 52nd edition of IFFI will take place in Goa from November 20 to 28. This year has also seen 26th KIFF chairperson Raj Chakraborty making his foray into politics after ensuring a successful edition of the festival. On being asked how he sees his role in respect to 27th KIFF, Chakraborty said, “I am always there for KIFF but I also believe that everyone should get an opportunity to work. I have been the chairman for two editions of KIFF. It will be great if someone else gets a chance to work for the festival that is the pride of Bengal. I will give this proposal to our chief minister. The final call will be taken by her.” Before the pandemic broke out, KIFF was the first Indian festival to screen most of that year’s Cannes, Venice and Berlin-winners. All other international festivals of India would be held subsequently. Pushing of the 27th edition of KIFF will either mean film buffs having to watch out for screening of such award winners at IFFI or wait longer for KIFF. Reacting to this, Chakraborty said, “With third wave approaching, we need to take a little more time to host another edition instead of rushing into anything. Besides, very few films have been made this year. Since we had an edition in January, we decided to host the next edition after 12 months.” Film-makers have already been asked to submit their entries. The last date for submission is September 30. With less films being made and many having direct OTT release during the pandemic, is there any chance of the latter making it to KIFF? “Once our committee is finalized, it will decide on what to do on this issue,” Chakraborty added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-film-fests-27th-edition-shifted-to-jan-2022-as-covid-third-wave-fear-looms/articleshow/84486245.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||Allahabad||Allahabad high court seeks Uttar Pradesh government's reply in plea against Shia Board poll||PRAYAGRAJ: Hearing a writ petition challenging the election notification for holding election of members of Shia Central Waqf Board, the Allahabad high court has directed the state government to file a reply (counter-affidavit) stating specifically as to on what basis the ‘mutawallis’ have been selected for the electoral college and whether before selecting them care was taken to determine the annual income of their waqf by an audit to ascertain whether they would qualify to be members of the electoral college under the Waqf Act, 1995. Hearing a writ petition filed by one Allamah Zameer Naqvi and another, a division bench comprising Justice Manoj Misra and Justice Jayant Banerji on July 14 directed that the election, if any, held in between shall be subject to the decision of the writ petition. The court directed to list this matter for next hearing on August 23. According to the petitioner, the election notification dated March 24, 2021 for holding election of members of Shia Central Waqf Board is not sustainable until determination of ‘mutawallis’ of waqfs that have annual income of Rs.1 lakh and above. It is stated that under the Waqf Act, 1995, the members of the Board are to be elected by an electoral college of which one of the constituents are ‘mutawallis’ of such waqfs that have annual income of Rs.1 lakh and above. It is submitted that Sections 46 and 47 of the Waqf Act envisage an annual exercise of audit of a waqf to ascertain its income. The case of the petitioner is that such an exercise has not been conducted and, in absence thereof, there can be no valid electoral college and, therefore, the election notification is unsustainable. The matter requires considerations. ‘Mutawalli’ is the person who manages a wakf. Under the Muslim Law, a ‘mutawalli’ has no right in the property belonging to the wakf. Nor is property vested in him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-govt-reply-in-plea-against-shia-waqf-board-poll/articleshow/84484732.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The deceased, Afroz alias Neelam, a resident of Civil Lines area of Chattarpur, MP had allegedly consumed poison at her in-laws’ home on July 6 though her father has filed an FIR alleging that she was murdered by her husband and in-laws. The body was exhumed in the presence of SDM Jhansi, Atul Kumar and City SP Chattarpur, Lokendra Singh. The MP police team had reached here a day earlier with a letter for DM Jhansi, seeking permission which was granted. Adequate police force was deployed to avoid any mis-happening. The post-mortem was performed at Jhansi Medical College and the body was handed over to MP police along with the report. The deceased, who was initially a Hindu by faith, had changed her religion after marriage. Police swung into action after the father of the deceased lodged an FIR with Chattarpur police alleging that she had been murdered by her husband Talib Khan and in-laws. During the processes of exhuming the body, the father of the deceased Kishorilal Ahirwar was also present along with her husband Talib Khan and a few more relatives. As per Kishorilal, her daughter Neelam was abducted by Talib Khan alias Tabbu in 2015 when she was a minor. She was later recovered by the police and sent to a shelter home. In 2017, Neelam ran away from the shelter home and married Talib and converted to Islam with her new identity as Afroz Khan. Alleging that her daughter had been murdered by her in-laws, Kishorilal told the police that on July 1 he had received a call from her daughter, saying that she is being forced to adopt the rituals of Islam which she had denied and may be killed. The next day he along with his son went to meet her, but were not allowed by the in-laws. He further alleged that on July 7, he got a message of some mishap and reached Afroz’s home where he found it locked. He came to know through the neighbours that his daughter was taken somewhere wrapped in a white sheet. On further investigation, he got a clue that his daughter was taken to Jhansi. As a result, he lodged a police complaint alleging murder of his daughter by her in-laws and demanded that the body be handed over to him. Police sources reveal that Afroz was brought to Jhansi by her in-laws where she died. She was later buried at Premnagar burial ground in Jhansi with the help of the maternal uncle of Talib who lives in Jhansi. The burial was done without informing police or getting a post-mortem conducted. CSP Chattarpur said, “The body was exhumed as part of investigation of the death of Afroz on the basis of the complaint lodged by her father Kishorilal. Till now no arrest has been made and the matter is being probed further.” SDM Jhansi said, “Afroz’s body was exhumed under section 176 CrPC under my watch as executive magistrate nominated by Jhansi DM. Further investigations are underway.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/body-of-mp-woman-in-inter-faith-marriageexhumed-in-jhansi-on-suspicion-of-murder/articleshow/84485361.cms||---

The meeting would be attended by sangh offshoots, top BJP and senior RSS office-bearers from across the state. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, his two deputies, UP BJP chief Swantranta Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation) Swatantra Dev Singh would attend the meet on the second day. ‘Focus on common man’s sentiments’ On Saturday Hosabale would be holding a meeting with UP’s two regional pracharaks along with RSS groups from all the prants. The meeting would focus on the agenda around common man’s sentiments and governance of the BJP. The day-long meeting would mostly be represented by Sangh office-bearers. The meeting, though is held annually, this time it's significant as it is being held months before UP polls. The second day would see RSS feedback sessions from Sangh offshoots. The meeting would mostly focus on RSS future programmes, UP government’s performance and what all needs to be done. RSS office-bearers’ feedback at such a time is significant as such sessions later on show impact on the governance in various ways, a senior RSS functionary told TOI. Sources said that besides feedback of the RSS pracharaks about the government, discussion on nomination of MLCs and cabinet expansion is also likely to be taken up. The meeting is being seen as the first preparatory meet before UP goes to the polls. A senior RSS functionary told TOI that the significance of the meeting could be gauged from the fact that RSS general secretary Hosabale, who is second in command in the sangh, will be present on both days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hosbale-to-holdcrucial-rss-bjpcoordination-meet/articleshow/84487708.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Ram Lalla idols in ‘garbha griha’ for ‘darshan’ by 2023, ahead of Lok Sabha poll||AYODHYA: With BJP planning to catapult Ram temple to the centrestage of 2024 Lok Sabha elections, construction of the temple is being undertaken on a war footing to erect the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) by 2023 and shift idols of Ram Lalla, Sita and Laxman there from the temporary structure, where it’s currently housed. The garbha griha will be thrown open to pilgrims across India and the world for ‘darshan’, keeping at least a six-month buffer before Lok Sabha polls to enable BJP to drum up the temple fervour and deliverance of its decades-old promise. The grand temple complex as per blueprint will, however, be completed by 2024 by construction firms, Larsen & Toubro and Tata Consultancy, and could also overshoot the deadline, said highly placed sources in the Ram temple Trust. Talking to TOI, Trustee of Ram Mandir Trust Anil Mishra said, “The shifting of idols to the ‘garbha griha’ will match the grandeur of the August, 2020, ‘bhoomipujan’ with the likely participation of the President, prime minister, chief minister, Sangh brass and even Opposition leaders. This will mark the culmination of centuries-old struggle for Ramjanmabhoomi and Ram Lalla will return to his place of birth after 500-year of exile. Construction firm Larsen and Toubro has a four-year contract to complete the temple, but it could take more time to make it an architectural marvel. Only the garbha griha will be accessible to devotees and the entire campus will be developed by the end of 2025," said Mishra. The decision to throw open the mega temple project to pilgrims, followed marathon meetings of the temple trust presided over the construction committee chairman, Nripendra Mishra, this week. India’s best brains from top engineering institutions have finalised the blueprint of the temple foundation, which is scheduled for completion by October and work on retaining boundary walls will begin by November.

She was greeted with flowers and slogans — Ek hi samkalp hai..Congress hi vikalp hai (There’s only one vow that Congress is the only alternative). After a brief stopover near Vidhan Sabha, Priyanka Gandhi reached GPO Park to offer floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi and prayed for those who died during the pandemic. Instead of resuming her journey, Priyanka decided to sit at the Gandhi statue and announced a ‘maunvrat’ (pledge of silence) to protest against UP government’s effort to demolish democracy. Senior leaders, including UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu, CLP Aradhana Mishra Mona, veterans like Pramod Tewari, PL Punia and key members like Deepak Singh, Pramod Pandey and Naseemuddin Siddiqui sat next to her. Enthused by their leader’s gesture, party workers joined in the silent stir. Announcements were made at UPCC headquarters on Priyanka’s arrival and district leaders who queued up for a one-on-one were asked to join her at GPO. While Priyanka remained silent, slogans like ‘sangharshon ke aadi hain, hum toh Gandhiwaadi hain’ echoed the air. After a two-hour sit-in at GPO, Priyanka headed to meet party workers waiting for her since morning. Speaking about her ‘maunvrat’, she said: “I observed silence to draw the attention of people of my country towards the way the Constitution was being destroyed in Uttar Pradesh.” She also apologised for her late arrival which not only caused inconvenience to workers, but also pushed planned meetings way behind schedule. Though late, Priyanka met delegations of farmers, students and held discussions with party leaders. Around 9 pm, jobless computer graduates from Rajasthan tried to meet Priyanka, which led to a clash between a section of party workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-observes-2-hour-maunvrat-at-gandhi-statue-cadre-raises-slogans/articleshow/84487698.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Pune||Dy CM: Govt to take call on who will draft 23 villages’ DP||Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said the state government would take the final call on whether the PMC or the PMRDA would prepare the development plan for the 23 villages recently merged with the cvic limits. He said the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had the right to pass a resolution about the DP, but the state government would finally decide what would be done.Pawar’s comment comes a day after the general body of the PMC approved the civic administration’s proposal to prepare the draft DP for the 23 villages recently merged with the municipal limits despite the state entrusting Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) with the task. The state government had on Wednesday issued a notification stating that the PMRDA would draft the development plan for the 23 villages.“I won’t say anything about who should prepare the DP, as there are some disagreements over this and the PMC has the right to pass a resolution. But whoever prepares the DP, it should be done keeping in mind the next 50-100 years. The plan should be done with thoughts and reservations for public places such as schools, graveyards, crematoriums and grounds,” Pawar said. “If it comes to light that any one is using their rights in an unfair manner, the state can intervene. Besides, there is the high court as well,” he addedOn state Congress president Nana Patole’s recent comments on the party’s stand on elections, Pawar said, “Senior Congress leaders such as Balasaheb Thorat and Ashok Chavan have clarified that the (MVA) alliance is working together. Patole also echoed similar sentiments later.”A week after NCP president Sharad Pawar dismissed his remarks that the Congress would contest future elections on its own, Patole on Wednesday said NCP had “betrayed” the Congress in the 2014 assembly elections. As a result, Patole said, the Congress had geared up to contest the 2024 general and assembly elections on its own.Pawar refuted media reports that he had discussed this issue with CM Uddhav Thackeray and also that the Zoting Commission report had indicted NCP leader Eknath Khadse in a land deal. He said the state has not yet received the report . On the proposed airport in Purandar, he said details would be shared when the land was finalised. Pawar also cleared Rs695 crore under the District Planning and Development Committee (DPDC) and directed the departments concerned to use the funds for various development projects. The state government had in April decided to impose a 30% cut on funds allotted for DPDC funds and use the amount in the pandemic management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-govt-to-take-call-on-who-will-draft-23-villages-dp/articleshow/84487275.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP president JP Nadda Nadda lauds chief minister Yogi Adityanath for putting Uttar Pradesh on fast growth trajectory||LUCKNOW: BJP national president JP Nadda on Friday termed Varanasi, the parliamentary seat of PM Narendra Modi, as the origin point for a new brand of politics which holds sway at the national level. He was speaking at the inaugural session of the UP BJP executive committee which was held virtually. Nadda's observation came a day after PM Modi visited Varanasi to dedicate a host of development projects. The visit was seen as a precursor to BJP's election campaign for the high-stake UP assembly elections due next year. Modi also invoked Ayodhya and Mathura to term them as cultural cities of India. The BJP president, at the same pitch, lauded UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for putting the state on an accelerated growth trajectory. He said that the work done by the UP government in mitigating the pandemic was indeed appreciable. Nadda said that the party workers will have to remember how the state was “infested” with the politics of appeasement a few years ago. “Appeasing one particular caste and community to target others had become the order of the day,” he said, in an apparent barb at the opposition, mainly the SP and the BSP. “The state had turned into a hub of corruption, nepotism and anarchy,” Nadda charged. “In contrast, in the past four years, UP has become one of the leading states in the country,” he said. The BJP president also did not miss the chance to mention the recent victories in the Zila Panchayat chairperson and Block Pramukh elections, in what marked the party escalating its presence in the rural areas which determine the electoral fortunes of any party. “This will help the party in contributing its bit in development at the grass-roots level,” he said. Nadda said that it was the strategy of PM Modi which helped the country cope with the deadly virus like Corona which, otherwise, had left a host of countries including the US and many of those in Europe, helpless. Nadda asked the party workers to ensure that the achievement of the BJP government percolated down to the people. The BJP chief categorically hit out at the opposition for stoking rumours in the name of politics over pandemic. “While the country came up with vaccines against the virus, some political leaders were fuelling factually wrong narratives to misguide the people,” he said, launching a frontal attack on the opposition. “One of the `neta’ from UP termed it as a BJP vaccine,” he said, in an apparent swipe at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nadda-lauds-yogi-for-putting-up-on-fast-growth-trajectory/articleshow/84487705.cms||Pankaj Shah

The AG said the state has for the first time “gathered such information” having set up a dedicated email and widely published on the government of Maharashtra websites and using social media platforms. He said in Pune where state plans to launch its pilot project for home Covid-19 vaccinations there were 50 such bedridden persons. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, hearing a PIL filed by advocate Dhruti Kapadia for door-step jabs to the elderly, homebound and bedridden people, pointed out that Pimpri-Chinchwad had a figure of 1,969. The bench said to the AG, “Why don’t you start the pilot project in Pimpri Chinchwad instead?” The information being sought by the state was name, age, address, phone and reasons for being bedridden, said Kumbhakoni. The BMC too is doing its survey, said its counsel Anil Sakhare and a provisional report pegged the bedridden people’s figure at 2,780. The highest is in R Central (Borivli) at 297 followed by 290 in N ward (Ghatkopar area). So far, the survey had been completed in seven wards but for 17 wards the information was still being gathered. The HC asked the state why it was not placing advertisements as discussed earlier. The HC posted the matter now to Monday, July 19 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai14k-responded-to-home-vax-awareness-drive-online/articleshow/84488482.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Delhi: As monsoon recovers lost ground, rain deficit more than halves in just 3 days||NEW DELHI: The three days of rain following the onset of monsoon has helped improve its distribution over Delhi from 65% in the “large deficit” category on June 13 to 39% on Friday — in the “deficit” category. A Met official said consistent rain expected through the month was likely to bring the capital to “normal” category by July-end. India Meteorological Department (IMD) data showed that north Delhi was in the “excess”, while New Delhi and North West districts were in the “normal” categories. From June 1 to July 16, Delhi received 101.8mm rainfall against the normal mark of 167.7mm. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist, IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “After the arrival of monsoon, the capital has received moderate to heavy rain spells. Another similar spell is expected in the month, which will help improve the rain deficit rate.” According to IMD, rainfall is classified as deficit when it is more than –19%, “large deficit” or “large deficient” (LD) when it is more than –59%. Between -19 and 19% it is classified as normal and between 20 and 59% as “excess”. At 209.9mm, the North district had, so far, fared the best in terms of rainfall against the normal mark of 158.4mm — a surplus of 32%. North West district received 150.8mm rainfall between June 1 and July 16, against the normal mark of 134.5mm in the “normal” category and surplus of 12%. New Delhi district was also placed in “normal” category with a rain deficit of 17%. Only two districts were in the LD category— South Delhi (77%) and South West Delhi (63%). With just 41.8mm rainfall, South Delhi fared the worst as opposed to 177.8mm normal rainfall. The data of Central district was unavailable, while North East district was placed in “deficit” at 56%. Though no rain was recorded in Delhi on Friday till evening, Met officials said light rain or thundershowers were likely on Saturday evening or night. IMD has issued an “orange” alert for Sunday as there are chances of heavy rain at isolated places, while light to moderate rain is expected on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-monsoon-recovers-lost-ground-rain-deficit-more-than-halves-in-just-3-days/articleshow/84487289.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Semen becomes ‘soil’, rape accused almost off hook||CHENNAI: A typographical error of ‘semen’ being recorded as ‘semman’ (which means red sand in Tamil) almost allowed a rape accused to go scot-free, before the Madras high court stepped in and reversed his acquittal by a lower court. Instead of mentioning that a two-and-a-half-year-old girl’s genitals had traces of ‘semen’, the chargesheet mentioned it as ‘semman’ — meaning red soil in the genitals. Citing the ‘dirt’ that might have got stuck as the child might have been playing around, the Tiruvarur district Mahila court freed the offender from the case. Justice P Velmurugan of the Madras HC, however, sentenced S Prakash of Tiruvarur district to five-year jail term and directed the government to pay Rs 1 lakh compensation to the girl. In September 2017, Prakash raped the child when her mother stepped out to buy food. On her return, the mother found the child crying and noticed a white liquid on her private parts. She admitted the child to a hospital and lodged a complaint. The prosecution told the HC that while recording evidence before the trial court, the word ‘semen’ in English was typed as ‘semman’ in Tamil. Taking advantage of the mistake committed by a typist during trial, the defence had argued that what the mother found on her child was ‘red colour soil’ (semman) and that no semen was found in the child’s undergarments. Justice Velmurugan said the investigating officer should have made more effort, and added: “Culprits are escaping due to technical reasons and, unfortunately, investigation wing is also not up to the standard. The trial court also, at times, are not applying their minds and exercising their discretionary power either to direct for reinvestigation or searching for proof beyond reasonable doubt, giving benefit of doubt to the accused. But cases like this, we cannot give much importance to the technical ground of proof.” As for the two-year delay in lodging the complaint, Justice Velmurugan said that in cases like these, where the victim is a child who cannot communicate immediately and the mother, an illiterate, delay in filing FIR should not be fatal to the case of the prosecution. “No mother of a victim, especially an illiterate woman in rural areas, would immediately go to police in such cases and the prosecution and court failed in their duties when they stressed on technicalities like delay in the complaint,” Justice Velmurugan observed. Pointing out that the police complaint clearly showed that the woman had meant white colour fluid while narrating the complaint and that it was the typist who wrote the English word ‘semen’ as ‘semman’ in ‘Tamil, the judge said, “admittedly, the defence side has taken flimsy defence that the mother stated as “semman colour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/semen-becomes-semman-rapist-almost-escapes/articleshow/84486324.cms||Srikkanth D
---||Lucknow||Democracy under attack in UP; Conghere to save it, says Priyanka Vadra||Lucknow: Accusing the Yogi Adityanath-led government of an organised attack on democracy in Uttar Pradesh, Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said her party was committed to save it come what may. “Even though the methods of the ruling BJP are not new to the people of UP, this time they have stooped to a new low. They are misusing the system, administration, and police to destabilise and end democracy here. But we believe in democracy and have come to fight for it and save it … we will never let them succeed,” she said at the UP congress headquarters before her meeting with the party functionaries. Challenging PM Narendra Modi’s appreciation of Yogi Adityanath government for managing the second wave of Covid-19 well, she questioned: “The PM stated that UP has entered the age of Vikasvad (read development politics). I want to ask what kind of development is this… where panchayat elections are organised when people were battling for lives in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic… And then in the zila panchayat elections, the government resorted to violence.” Adding that the administration and the police were intimidating candidates, kidnapping them and preventing them from filing their nomination, women candidates were assaulted and disrobed, Priyanka asked: “What is happening in UP? The system had collapsed during the second wave of the pandemic … and such a system is getting a certificate of appreciation from the PM.” Stating that neither the people of UP nor the opposition will stay silent, she said: “This kind of lawlessness speaks for the ineptitude of the ruling government.” In response to why the PM is lauding the UP government, she said: “He cannot see the truth… every woman in UP knows what is happening… What has this government done to guarantee the safety of women? We have come here several times and staged demonstrations to support distressed women.” Priyanka refused to take any questions on the ongoing crisis in Punjab Congress stating that she was in Lucknow for UP’s sake. She had earlier tweeted: “The certificate by Modiji will not be able to hide the cruelty, carelessness and mismanagement during the second Coronavirus wave in the state,’’ she wrote. “People faced immense pain, helplessness all alone. Modiji, Yogiji can forget this truth, those who suffered the pain of Coronavirus pandemic, will not forget,” the tweet further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/democracy-under-attack-in-up-conghere-to-save-it-says-priyanka-vadra/articleshow/84487703.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Seventeen fish shops and five chicken shops were gutted in a fire that broke out in the market in the early hours on March 14. Since then the cantonment has not been able to repair the damaged properties due to fund shortage. Amit Kumar, PCB’s CEO, said, “We have made budgetary provision for the work. It has been forwarded to the Principal Director Defence Estates of Southern Command for approval. Thereafter, it will be tabled before the Southern Army Commander for final sanction.” A team of engineers from the public works department, Pune circle, has already inspected the damaged section and estimated the repairs cost at Rs 2.5 crore. Traders and vendors operating at the market agreed to pay the pending rent dues worth Rs 25 lakh to the board in a meeting held on Thursday. “Pune cantonment MLA Suresh Kamble will contribute Rs 25 lakh from his funds for the work. The vendors have already paid Rs 12.5 lakh dues to us. We have given them two weeks to pay the remaining amount,” Kumar said. Manzoor Shaikh, president of the traders’ association of Shivaji Market, said, “We have urged all the vendors and traders to clear dues at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-cantt-to-spend-rs-50l-on-shivaji-market-renovation/articleshow/84487298.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Delhi||How Delhi’s water tables are going deeper underground||NEW DELHI: Large parts of the capital have seen a drop in the groundwater table by four metres or more, a decadal analysis carried out by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) between 2005 and 2014 has shown. A more recent analysis says Delhi is losing groundwater at 0.2 metres on average every year. While Delhi has the potential to utilise 457 million cubic metres of surface runoff rainwater, waterlogging on streets during the season’s first downpour showed the capital was failing to capture a large chunk of it. According to data, around 87% of Delhi’s monsoon occurs between June and September (533.1mm out of 611.mm of rainfall), making it a key period to recharge groundwater aquifers. CGWB’s decadal data shows that while the groundwater table has fallen by 2-4 metres in almost every location, parts of Delhi along the Yamuna floodplain, central Delhi, southwest near Najafgarh and a part of the northwest have shown an increase, indicating more recharge over extraction. For central Delhi, rainwater harvesting has played a key role with a number of government buildings utilising such units to increase groundwater recharge. According to the National Project for Aquifer Management (NAQUIM) report released by CGWB recently, areas such as JNU and Sanjay Van recorded good groundwater recharge, but just next to it Hauz Khas and Greater Kailash showed considerable extraction, more than what was being replenished through rainwater harvesting. The NAQUIM report recommended groundwater extraction only along the Yamuna floodplain or in parts of north and northwest Delhi, while also highlighting poor groundwater quality in southwest district, largely along Najafgarh and Dwarka. The latest CGWB data from May 2019 showed that out of 73 wells analysed across Delhi, six had a depth of over 40 metres below ground level (mbgl) and 13 wells were between 20 and 40 mbgl. The deepest point was 62.6 mbgl in South district, while the shallowest point was in South West district at 1.1 mbgl. North district had the best water levels, all ranging between 2 and 10 mbgl. Diwan Singh, a water activist, who has worked on the revival of several waterbodies in Dwarka, said simple utilisation of stormwater drains could help capture millions of litres of rainwater, which could be diverted to recharge pits or waterbodies. “Over time, these waterbodies recharge the groundwater table naturally. Instead of letting rainwater go to waste, there are ways to utilise it better,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-citys-water-tables-are-going-deeper-underground/articleshow/84488045.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Pune||‘State draft EV policy stimulus for auto sector’||PUNE: Industry groups and manufacturers in the automobiles and electric vehicles space have said the draft electric vehicles policy announced by the state government this week would help boost demand, especially in the two-wheelers and commercial vehicles segment. The draft EV policy includes sops such as road tax and registration charges exemptions, as well as subsidies for different classes of electric vehicles, which will substantially bring down the prices for some of the most sold models of e-vehicles, both in the private and commercial segments. Industry groups said the draft policy, if adopted and implemented, would address both supply and demand side needs, especially with fuel prices shooting up. “The policy on EVs is progressive and its speedy implementation has the potential to not just retain Maharashtra’s leadership in the automotive sector, but to catapult it further,” said Prashant Girbane, director general of the MCCIA. Manufacturers also emphasized that allied infrastructure to EVs, which have been mentioned in the report, can boost last-mile connectivity and reduce range anxiety. “Emphasis on the development of charging infrastructure is crucial as it will minimize the concern about the range anxiety and promote EV penetration in the state. It will lower the cost for the customers and aid in a shift towards e-vehicles,” said Diego Graffi, CEO and MD of Piaggio Vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-draft-ev-policy-stimulus-for-auto-sector/articleshow/84487306.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The woman’s heart gave a new lease of life to a 29-year-old woman at a hospital in Navi Mumbai. The woman’s liver benefited a 60-year-old man at Jehangir hospital in Pune. The donor, a resident of Malshirus in Solapur, had suffered intra-cranial (IC) bleeding and was hospitalized at Jehangir hospital on July 2. She was declared brain-dead two days ago. “The woman’s husband and children consented to donate her vital organs, including the heart,” said Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator, Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), Pune branch. The woman’s small bowel was also donated. The oragn was harvested and transplanted into a small baby. However, the body rejected the organ soon after the transplant at Jupiter hospital in Baner. “The woman’s harvested heart was successfully transplanted into a patient at Apollo hospital in Navi Mumbai on Thursday. The recipient is doing well post-surgery.

---||Coimbatore||Lockdown spurs more minor marriages in Coimbatore district||COIMBATORE: The district has seen an increasing number of child marriages during the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown to contain the contagion. As per the data available with the social welfare department, 21 minor girls were married off so far this year, compared to just three in 2020. A social welfare department official said they were notified about 62 child marriages till date this year and had stopped 41 of them. In the case of the 21 marriages that were consummated, first information reports have been registered in 13 cases under relevant sections of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, while the remaining eight cases are under investigation. The official said the highest number of child marriages was reported from Madukkarai block, followed by Sulur and Karamadai blocks. The department was notified about 92 child marriages in 2020 and had stopped 89 of them. The grooms were booked in the remaining three cases, the official said. Last year, the official said, the highest number of child marriages was reported from Sulur followed by city corporation limits and Madukkarai. In 2019, the department had stopped all the 91 child marriages that were brought to its attention. Officials and activists attribute the rise in child marriages to the lockdown and are confident that the trend would decline when normalcy returns. G P Godhanavalli, a family and student counsellor, says, “Now that the classes are held online, girl students get easily distracted from the studies. They fall in love and get married without understanding the implications of it. In some cases, they are forced into marriage.” Child marriages, she said, could be controlled by creating awareness among the girls and counselling. However, according to her, online counselling is not as effective as direct sessions. “Apart from giving special attention to the daughters, parents should also engage them in extracurricular activities to transform their energy into useful things. When schools reopen, they will be occupied with their studies.” Latha Sundaram, managing trustee, Aram Foundation and Charitable Trust, says there were instances of forcing minor girls into marriage to reduce the size of the family because of the present economic crisis. “When counselling and awareness sessions were conducted at schools, it was easy to identify the children under stress and trauma. But now it has become difficult as the schools are shut.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lockdown-spurs-more-minor-marriages-in-dist/articleshow/84487300.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Addressing mediapersons on the sidelines of an interaction with industrialists, Rajeeve said the committee has been asked to submit its report in three months. National university of advanced legal studies (NUALS) vice-chancellor K C Sunny would chair the committee in which former civil servant T Nandakumar and law reforms commission vice-chairman K Sasidharan Nair would be members. “The committee would review all rules and regulations that appear to be outdated or not in sync with modern times. It would also give recommendations towards simplifying the upkeep of various industrial registers by different government departments,” he said. KSIDC would coordinate the functioning of the committee and the panel would hear industrialists and public before finalizing its report, Rajeeve said. The industries minister is holding a series of interactive sessions with industry representatives, following allegations by Kitex group against hostility meted out to investors and industrialists in the state. According to the minister, a large chunk of government officials and the public are unaware of the new rules and regulations passed by the government regarding industries sector. As a result of this, several services get delayed unnecessarily. Hence, government would conduct programmes to create awareness among officials and the public, Rajeeve said. “Government has plans to draw a common guideline to help industrial estates to function with more autonomy. A bill on statutory grievance redressal mechanism would soon be introduced in the assembly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/panel-to-recommend-industrial-law-reforms/articleshow/84486374.cms||---

While the corporation claims that the structures were encroachments, they were popular places of worship, said Hindu Munnani state president Kadeswara Subramaniam. “When P V Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister, an Act was passed in Parliament prohibiting demolition of temples older than 75 years. But the Coimbatore corporation demolished temples that were centuries-old. We strongly condemn the demolition,” he said. “Several government offices including the Tirupur collector’s office are on temple lands. The buildings should be removed from the lands.” “The Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) minister has been saying that the department will retrieve temple lands and protect temples. He should reveal information regarding such lands,” Subramaniam said. “The state government is acting against Hindus and it will be reflected in the next election.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hindu-munnani-stages-protest-against-demolition-of-temples/articleshow/84487301.cms||---

Additional liquid medical oxygen supply, capping the cost of the drug cocktail that seems to be working against Covid, and enhancing vaccine supply to try to ward off the third wave or bring down its severity were on the wish-list that Thackeray, attending a video conference with Modi along with CMs of five other states, presented. He also suggested setting up excellence centres for post-Covid treatment. These would help people who have recovered from Covid, but continue to have lingering health issues. Maharashtra is projected to require 4,000MT of oxygen daily, if a third wave hits. The state has scaled up its production to 2,000MT from around 1,200MT and it will be a great help if the remaining 2,000 MT is allotted from nearby sites -- like Bhilai, Jamnagar or Bellary steel plant, Thackeray said. During the second wave, the state was allotted additional oxygen, but from Odisha and Tamil Nadu leading to delays. Thackeray also demanded that the Centre should cap the cost of the monoclonal antibody treatment --- one that Donald Trump got --- that is proving effective but costs between Rs 50,000 and Rs 60,000 per dose. “Even if 50,000 patients were to get the drug in the third wave, it will cost Rs 300 crore. The Centre should take steps to bring down the price,” said Thackeray. The state also sought increased vaccine supply, especially in the 10 districts where cases are on the rise. There are 2 crore eligible beneficiaries in these districts who need to be fully vaccinated at the earliest to bring down that spread. Thackeray briefed Modi about the Covid situation in the state and the measures put in place to handle the third wave, especially to ensure that industry production and operations are not affected. Finally, he expressed concerns about increasing crowds in public places for tourism, and religious or social reasons. “This is not only happening in Maharashtra, but everywhere. Revenge tourism, revenge shopping has led to people running out of their houses. The state is trying to stop this, but even at the central level, a comprehensive policy is required,” said Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-asks-pm-for-more-o2-cost-cap-on-drug-cocktail/articleshow/84487329.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Dip in incidents of elephants straying into human settlements, finds study||COIMBATORE: The Periyanaickenpalayam forest range in Coimbatore has reported the highest number of wild elephant straying incidents in the district, according to a study by the forest department. The study conducted between November 2020 and June 2021 also found that lone male elephants constituted 63% of the jumbos that strayed into human habitations. The average elephant straying incidents have come down from 6.83 times in November last year to 5.19 times in June this year. The anti-depredation team of watchers termed as Border Night Patrolling Team (BNPT), which drives back the straying elephants that leave the forest for crop raiding, collected information on the elephants’ leaving the forest on daily basis. An analysis of the daily data collected on elephants that engage in crop raiding was undertaken by a team of officials led by I Anwartheen, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), Coimbatore circle, D Venkatesh, district forest officer, Coimbatore forest division, assistant conservator of forests M Dinesh and Senthilkumar and biologists Naveen and Peter. The analysis of daily data reveals that elephants came out of the forest at high average of eight times a day in December 2020 and lowest of three times a day in March 2021. In the last eight months, single males have come out of forest 832 times, male group 177 times, female herds 206 times, females with calf 82 times and lone female 6 times alone have come out of the forest. Venkatesh said that the maximum number of single male elephants that came out of the forest in November, December 2020 and January 2021is about 125 to 134. It dropped from 88 to 65 in February and March respectively and rose 70 to 111 times in April, May and June 2021 respectively. “The data revealed that 63% of lone male elephants strayed into the human habitations and 16% of the female group and 14% of male group elephants strayed into human habitations. Only one percent of lone female elephants strayed and 6% of females with young elephants strayed into human habitations from November last year to June 2021,” Venkatesh said. It indicated the seasonal excursion of elephants into crop lands in synchrony with their presence in Coimbatore forest division post northeast monsoon when the grasses and vegetation are available, and streams are full. According to the crop raiding incidences during this period, 28% of the incidents took place in the Periyanaickenpalayam forest range,18% in the Coimbatore forest range,17% in the Sirumugai forest range, 14% in the Mettupalayam forest range, 9% in the Karamadai forest range, 11% in the Boluvampatti forest range and 3% cent in the Madukkarai forest range. The above analysis is already used by the department to develop suitable adaptive mitigation strategies, long term monitoring will be undertaken to develop better databases and analysis to develop effective appropriate mitigation strategies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dip-in-incidents-of-elephants-straying-into-human-settlements-finds-study/articleshow/84487310.cms||---

The AUM stood at Rs 1.11 lakh crore in June 2021, up by Rs 6,286.93 crore against May’s Rs 1.05 lakh crore in Gujarat.  According to experts, fresh inflows in June and a buoyant SIP investment drove the growth. The last time the growth in equity-linked MFs was above this level was in June 2020 versus May 2020 — at Rs 6,316.18 crore. “The inflows into systematic investment plans were very good in June. In fact, across India, SIP inflows crossed the pre-Covid levels to touch Rs 9,000 crore,” said Mumukshu Desai, the director of an Ahmedabad-based financial advisory firm. “At the same time, markets have given no signs of a major correction in the near future. Therefore, fresh investments continued to pour in from both retail as well as HNI investors.” Desai said that international funds as well as hybrid funds have witnessed good traction from investors. “Equity-linked mutual funds investment is a major point of attraction because of better returns and also due to the plunging fixed deposit rates,” said Desai. Financial consultants said that the net asset value of existing investments also went up significantly. “The mark-to-market value went up as the stock market indices grew,” said another financial analyst based in Ahmedabad. “As a consequence, the overall AUM for equity- investments grew.” The overall assets under management also grew by Rs 6,883.01 crore to settle at Rs 2.3 lakh crore in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/growth-in-aum-for-equity-mfs-at-12-month-high/articleshow/84486465.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Dehradun||As Rawat seeks CM face before 2022 Uttarakhand polls, Pilot says Congress ‘tradition’ is to name one after||DEHRADUN: Congress in Uttarakhand has been occupied with one question for a while — whether it will pick a CM candidate before or after the 2022 assembly polls. While former CM and AICC general secretary Harish Rawat has been demanding a name for seven months now, former deputy CM of Rajasthan and senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot said on Friday that he favours the “tradition” of announcing one only after the election. “Traditionally, the party contests an election under a collective leadership,” Pilot said in Dehradun on Friday. “After winning an election, the national leadership consults elected members to take a call (on who the CM should be).” It has been a contentious subject. When Rawat sought a “senapati”, or commander, for the polls in January, Congress set up a coordination committee. Rawat, who has lately been tied up with the tussle over Punjab Congress leadership as the state unit’s in charge, was not happy. “There should be no confusion while going into a battle. The chain of command should be clear to everyone,” Rawat had told TOI on Wednesday. “A local face needs to be promoted. Examples can be seen in many states. Projecting a CM face has, for the most part, been advantageous. I am not saying I should be the CM candidate. The decision is up to the national leadership. If the youth cannot take up the responsibility, I will not hesitate to take up the baton.” The other question facing the Congress is who will take charge as the leader of the opposition. Indira Hridayesh died on June 13 and since then no replacement has been named. Uttarakhand Congress leaders have been making the rounds of Delhi, but no decision has been taken. Up to four “camps”, meanwhile, are said to have come up within the party, each angling for its candidate to the key post. Asked about these differences, Pilot said, “Healthy competition among leaders is good for the party as, at the end of the day, all our members are working with a vision for the growth of the nation and their states.” Pilot was in Dehradun to talk about price rise as part of a countrywide Congress campaign to engage with the public. “Petrol prices have breached the Rs 100-mark in several cities,” he said. “While the international rate of crude oil has gone down, the rates of petrol and diesel have gone through the roof. As have those of LPG cylinders. BJP leaders who were extremely vocal when the UPA government even slightly increased petrol and diesel prices are now silent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/as-rawat-seeks-cm-face-before-22-ukhand-polls-pilot-says-cong-tradition-is-to-name-one-after/articleshow/84484012.cms||Kautilya Singh

The woman’s heart gave a new lease of life to a 29-year-old woman at a hospital in Navi Mumbai. The woman’s liver benefited a 60-year-old man at Jehangir hospital in Pune. The donor, a resident of Malshirus in Solapur, had suffered intra-cranial (IC) bleeding and was hospitalized at Jehangir hospital on July 2. She was declared brain-dead two days ago. “The woman’s husband and children consented to donate her vital organs,” said Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator, Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), Pune branch. The woman’s small bowel was also donated, but the recipient, a small baby, rejected the organ soon after the transplant at Jupiter hospital in Baner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-new-lease-of-life-for-29-year-old-with-heart-of-solapur-woman/articleshow/84488537.cms||---

A student from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) suffered minor burns. No other person from the institute suffered any injuries as the building was evacuated immediately. However, a firemen suffered injuries while dousing the fire. It took the Pune fire brigade two hours to control the fire. The Pune fire brigade chief Prashant Ranpise told TOI, “We received the call around 12.10pm and a fire tender from Pashan fire tender was immediately sent to the spot. Later, we sent more fire tenders.” The fire tenders from Pimpri Chinchwad fire brigade and HEMRL too were pressed into service to douse the fire. Ranpise said that thick smoke was emanating because of the chemicals inside the laboratory. The firemen had a tough time dousing the fire, he said. “We controlled the fire around 2.40pm. The reason for the fire was yet to be ascertained,” Ranpise added. An official from the IISER said, “A student suffered minor injuries on his hands and had been attended to with first-aid.”  “The extent of damage to the research lab was being assessed. The institute shall appoint a committee to investigate the incident,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fire-breaks-out-in-lab-at-iiser/articleshow/84487323.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt provides lifeline to Building Use defaulters till March 31, 2022||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has granted relief for those who have not followed construction norms and who are yet to obtain the Building Use permission for their buildings, at least till March 31, 2022. Claiming that the government is overburdened with work in the Covid-19 pandemic and does not wish to to disturb people’s livelihood in these troubled times, the state government has given a great relief to buildings with no BU permission till three months from the last day of applicability of the Gujarat Epidemic Diseases, Covid-19 Regulations. Considering that the epidemic regulations came into effect on March 13, 2020 with onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and have been made applicable till December 31, 2021, this effectively means that erring buildings sans BU permission will be spared `coercive action' like sealing, at least till March 31, 2022. In a notification issued on July 8, the urban development and urban housing department has directed all civic bodies to take “proactive appropriate measures” for compliance of BU permission, but restrained the authorities from taking coercive action against such buildings for breach of development control regulations including change of use, margin, height restrictions and those without having valid BU permission, till three months from the last day of applicability of the Gujarat Epidemic Diseases, Covid-19 Regulations. Mukesh Puri, additional chief secretary, urban development department said, “The state government, considering impact of Covid 19 and difficulties in compliance of GDCR norms, has decided not take any action till March 2022 so that people will have time for corrective actions to comply with norms. It is to be noted that government has not given any relaxation in GDCR norms so there shall not be any compromise in ensuring safety other norms but given more time for compliance only.’’ The notification has, however, asked the owners/occupiers of buildings without valid BU permission to take corrective measures to comply with the development control regulations. The state government has been under pressure from the Gujarat high court, which has asked it to come up with “a concrete solution” to the problem of illegal structures in four weeks. During a hearing on July 9, the state government submitted that it is striving to deal with the issue but strict and immediate implementation could lead to demolition of 90% of such buildings, for regularisation does not seem possible for these buildings. The other option that the government had is to bring in another impact fee law for regularise such constructions. The leniency has been shown by issuing directions under Section 122 of the Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976. The reason cited for the relaxation is that restrictive measures due to Covid-19 pandemic have impacted construction activities of real estate projects across the state. Moreover, the administration is at present pre-occupied with the work of vaccination and health and medical infrastructure augmentation. Surveying, assessing buildings in the entire state for non-compliance of development control regulations in general and BU permission in particular is an exhaustive, tedious, time and resource consuming exercise. This issue has several facets such as building being used for purpose other than development permission issued, construction not done according to sanctioned plan, lack of non-renewal of fire NOC and absence of documents required from different agencies. The notification further said that for default in following these norms, action contemplates discontinuation of the use of building, which can further adversely affect the economic situation and loos of livelihood. The government has also said that it is not in favour of compromising with public safety, but the Covid-19 pandemic situation warrants saving the livelihoods and to ease the difficulties of people in compliance of building bylaws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-provides-lifeline-to-bu-defaulters-till-march-31-2022/articleshow/84486380.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Pune||99.95% of 15.7L students in Maharashtra clear SSC, only 758 unsuccessful||PUNE: A changed evaluation pattern and the inclusion of students’ performance in Std IX generated a record 99.95% success in the Secondary School Certificate (SSC, Std X) exams in the state, the results of which were announced on Friday. The results were announced by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education at 1pm on Friday. As many as 957 students scored 100% — a three-fold jump — while those scoring above 90% crossed 1 lakh. Konkan division had a 100% success rate while Nagpur had the lowest at 99.84. Nine schools in the state registered zero per cent results. The state government had cancelled offline exams due to the Covid pandemic. Students’ performance in Std IX and X was considered for assessment. The evaluation was based on 100 marks per subject, consisting of 50% marks from Std IX, 30 marks on year-long performance and 20 marks on assignments, oral exams and practical work. Schools had formed a seven-member committee to oversee the results. The evaluation method was announced by the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research & Training in June. The exam was conducted in nine divisions of the state — Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Latur, Konkan, Kolhapur and Amravati. All divisions had a more than 99% success rate. State board chairman Dinkar Patil said, “Considering the Covid situation in the state and the decisions thereof, we have been successful in announcing the results sooner than expected, even before CBSE or ICSE. The schools and all other state board officials have worked hard to ensure that the results are announced in time. The outcome of the results was expected, considering the nature of evaluation. It is probably the best result in the history of the board so far.” The pass percentage in the state is 4.65% higher than last year for fresh candidates. Of the 28,424 external students who gave the exam, 97.45% passed. “Among the total number of successful students, 1,04,633 have scored over 90% marks, which is nearly 15,000 more than previous year. It would result in major competition during admissions based on SSC results,” said career counsellor Veena Kulkarni. About 2.02 lakh students in Maharashtra were given grace marks for excelling in extra-curricular activities. In Pune division, 45,762 students were given grace marks. Darshana Korke, officiating principal at Ahilyadevi High School, said, “The results are not surprising as the evaluation was completely online and monitored by students’ parents. We were aware of this at the time of compilation.” The results of nearly 4,922 students were reserved by the state board due to unavailability of data. Among repeaters, 82,802 students registered for the exam while 74,618 passed, recording a 90.25 pass percentage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/99-95-of-15-7l-students-in-state-clear-ssc-only-758-unsuccessful/articleshow/84487338.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Delhi cabinet today led by Arvind Kejriwal approved the bid for 160 low-floor CNG AC buses, which will be on the roads by Nov. These buses fully confirm to BS-VI emission standards and will have CCTV, GPS and panic buttons. With this, our bus fleet size will grow to 6,910,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot tweeted on Friday. These 160 buses are part of a total 1,000 low-floor, airconditioned buses that are being brought under the Cluster scheme. Out of the 1,000 buses, 311 are already operational and 89 more buses were expected to arrive by this March this year but got delayed due to the second wave of Covid-19 cases. This lot of buses is now expected to arrive by next month. Delhi has a total 6,752 buses at present, including 3,762 buses in Delhi Transport Corporation’s (DTC) fleet and 2,990 in the Cluster Scheme fleet. Delhi needs a total of 11,000 buses to meet the current demand. The exponential growth of Covid-19 cases compelled the Delhi government to impose a lockdown from April 19, which has now been relaxed to a large extent. However, it did result in Delhi government’s plans to reach the target of 11,000, towards which it had been steadily moving, hitting a brake. The second wave has also affected the delivery of electric buses for the DTC fleet, along with the creation of supporting infrastructure such as charging stations at designated bus depots. On March 26, the Delhi cabinet had approved the engagement of 300 low-floor electric AC buses by DTC. As per the schedule, 118 buses were to arrive in October, 100 by November and 60 buses were planned to be added by December, 2021. The remaining 20 buses are likely to arrive by January 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/160-low-floor-ac-buses-to-hit-the-streets-by-nov/articleshow/84488077.cms||---

A single agency has been appointed that will operate the car park facility as well as develop the Santa Monica jetty area for tourists, a tourism official said. “The appointment of an agency was delayed due to the pandemic, but now we have it on board. It will operate the facility as well as develop the area adjacent to the jetty,” the officer said. The facilities at the jetty will chiefly include a common ticketing counter for all cruises, including those that are docked at the Captain of Ports (CoP) jetty. There will also be a common waiting area that will reduce congestions along the jetty when tourists queue up for a cruise ride, he said. During peak hours, the area witnesses a lot of traffic as it is the main entry and exit point to the city. Traffic flow slows along this stretch down during the tourist season due to the cross-movement of tourists. While a cruise trip is regarded as an important on the itinerary of a domestic tourist, Santa Monica jetty does not have any facilities for them, while on the other hand, the multi-car parking facility project worth Rs 35 crore has remained unused even as the city’s parking woes have no end. After numerous delays, the project was completed in November 2016. Spread over an area of 14,611 sqm, it can accommodate a total of 465 cars on its three floors, terrace, and open space on the ground floor. Earlier attempts by Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) to hire an agency did not fructify even as more than once a tender was floated. On one occasion, an agency was finalised after completing the tendering process, but GTDC’s decision was vetoed by the finance department. Later, the tendering was deferred as the area adjacent to the multi-car parking facility, where GTDC planned to have facilities for tourists, was used for accommodating material for the third Mandovi bridge which was under construction then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-four-years-agency-finalised-to-operate-panajis-multi-car-park-facility/articleshow/84487345.cms||Bindiya Chari

So, we will have a coalition with the BJP in the civic polls,” he said, while addressing a news conference here on Friday. Athawale said that his party wants a separate municipal corporation for the 23 villages newly merged into the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. He said some more villages can be added into the municipal limits if a new corporation is created. A separate corporation needs to be formed to cater to a population of around 40lakh, Athawale said. The RPI chief said that he has appealed to the Shiv Sena chief to join hands with the BJP and form a government. The chief minister’s post can be shared between the two parties for two-and-a-half years each, he said. Athawale said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) does not have a good future together due to the internal rift. The parties in alliance are already talking about fighting the polls on their own. The ruling MVA is not conducting election to fill the Speaker’s post in the assembly as it is afraid of losing the polls. The Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are afraid that their MLAs will indulge in cross voting in the election. “If this happens, the post of chief minister will be in danger and he will have to resign. So, the ruling parties are avoiding the election,” he said. Athawale said that the issue of political reservation for other backward classes (OBC) will be taken up. A notification regarding it can been issued by the Union government to facilitate reservation. “The whole census process can be carried out based on caste. This process will not promote casteism but make the picture of each caste clear,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rpi-to-join-hands-with-bjp-for-civic-polls-athawale/articleshow/84487326.cms||---

To be declared online, the results will not be directly accessible to students. Schools will access the results and hand out the marksheets to students after downloading it from the website. After cancelling Class 12 board exams, GSHSEB laid out guidelines to evaluate the academic performance of students based on merit-based progression. The performances in Class 12, Class 11 and Class 10 exams were given 25:25:50 weightage. In the case of Class 12 performance, students were evaluated on the basis of marks got in the first unit test and internal exam held in 2020-21. While Class 10 board results were given 50% weightage, first and second internal exams of Class 11 carried 25% weightage. Students, who are not satisfied with the results, will be given a chance to take board exams in pen-and-paper (offline) format. For this, regular students will have to return their marksheets to the state education board’s office within 15 days of declaration of results. The state education department has made some changes this year in the criteria for engineering admission. For candidates who have cleared their Class 12 science, including those with B group or Biology subject, there will be equal weightage for Class 12 and GUJCET performance to get admission in engineering courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/class-12-science-results-to-be-announced-today/articleshow/84486490.cms||---

The malls are closed in the state in accordance with the level 3 restrictions imposed by the state. “People tend to spend a lot of time in the malls. The malls have been kept closed as we fear crowding there. But there is a demand from fully vaccinated shopkeepers and traders to relax the restrictions. The state is considering whether the fully vaccinated criterion can be considered as the condition to provide relaxations,” he said after the weekly Covid review meeting at Council Hall in Pune. He made it clear that there would be no easing of curbs in Pune and a few other districts where cases remain high and so does the positivity rate. Pawar said though there has been a slight fall in cases in Pune district, restrictions would continue. The positivity rate has come down to almost nil in some districts, but not in Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, Pune, Raigad and Ahmednagar. “The weekly positivity rate of Pune is 5.7% and the recovery rate is 97.3%,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-malls-to-open-for-those-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/84487344.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi government plans online portal for artists for better exposure||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is working on a portal that will act as a database of all artists and performers in the capital and as a platform to promote their talent. The art, culture and languages department is working on completely revamping its website and one component of its new avatar will be the portal that will act as a dynamic and real-time database of all artists from every sphere of art and culture. The aim is to become a platform to provide exposure to local talent in a transparent way, which may elude them otherwise. An official said the initiative took off after deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia recently wrote to the department to create an extensive database of artists detailing the art form they practise, their experience and awards received, if any. “What we are planning is a real-time database, where say a tabla player from Mundka can put up his profile with his photograph and details about where all he has performed, his capabilities and if he has received any award or recognition,” the official said. “It will be an open page where anyone can update their own credentials, making it dynamic,” the official said. “We also want to groom the local talent that is available in Delhi and that is the perspective with which the department is working. There are many artists who may be exceptional at playing an instrument or creating beautiful things but don’t get the platform,” the official said. “That is why when the direction from the deputy CM came, we got the opportunity of making something beautiful and we are trying to at least create the database as fast as possible and it should not take much time now,” he said. The primary aim behind the initiative is to act as a media for upcoming or even established artists to promote themselves. “The portal will see people’s participation and artists and others will themselves come forward. Another aim of the portal will be to showcase Delhi’s art and culture,” the official said. The portal also aims to bring more transparency when it comes to giving chance to more people at different cultural programmes and promotional activities.  “It is usually the same group of artists that you see everywhere and the process of promotion becomes selective and partisan. This portal will help promote all local talent, with a focus on street performers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-plans-online-portal-for-artists-for-better-exposure/articleshow/84487375.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Big private hospital cuts down on vax sites amid fewer takers||PUNE: Low footfalls for vaccination and more government centres have started showing on private hospitals offering Covid-19 inoculation, prompting a big private hospital to reduce the number of sites. Another private health hub has similar plans in place. Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, told TOI, “A lot of logistics are involved in conducting the vaccination drive, including manpower and vehicles, among others. With low footfalls and thousands of doses lying unused with us, we have decided to bring down the number of centres to just one. Like our routine paediatric vaccination centre, we will continue with one Covid vaccination centre for now. We had multiple centres earlier, two in Magarpatta city, one in Amanora city and three in the hospital campus, among others, which may no more function as vaccination sites.” “If there is requirement, we will add more centres,” Dr Sale said. A source from another city-based hospital said, “Footfalls for vaccination at private sites remain on the lower side, due to which one of our centres had to be taken off the drive. We then thought of diverting the manpower from another centre with lower footfall to another, which already was catering to a thousand people per day. There was 50% reduction in footfalls in the centre that had to be taken off the drive.” Some other multi-centre private hospitals, however, said they did not plan to close down any vaccination sites as of now. Hospitals also said they had cut down on vaccine purchases by around 70% in July, owing to less demand at private sites. Some others have not placed any additional orders in July. Bomi Bhote, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We are not buying the huge quantities of doses that we would buy initially, as there are now enough number of government centres to cater to the city’s vaccination demand. It is a resource intensive activity and a lot of manpower has to be diverted to vaccinations. With adequate vaccines at the government centres, we have tapered off our requirements, with almost a 70% reduction in the average vaccine orders this month.” Dr Sale said till the existing stock was consumed, the hospital would not place any additional order. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital, said, “We have 40,000 doses lying unused with us. This stock is likely to continue for over three months, so we do not wish to place any additional orders for some time now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/big-pvt-hospital-cuts-down-on-vax-sites-amid-fewer-takers/articleshow/84487336.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rituals won't be broadcast from Char Dham shrines||DEHRADUN: In a meeting of the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board held on Friday, which was presided over by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, a unanimous decision was taken to not livestream puja from the sanctum sanctorum of the Char Dham shrines. The Uttarakhand high court had earlier directed the state to livestream all rituals and prayers offered in the revered shrines for devotees across the country. This followed a stay by the HC on the state’s decision to start Char Dham yatra from July 1 for locals of the districts in which the shrines are situated. After the advocate general last week submitted that “shastras might not permit livestreaming of rituals”, the court had taken strong exception and pointed out that “India is a democratic country ruled by law, not by shastras.” Apart from the decision on livestreaming, the meeting also approved the budget of the board for the year 2021-22. The commissioner of Garhwal and chief executive officer of the board, Ravinath Raman, said that in the year 2021-22, a budget of Rs 24.46 crore for Badrinath, Rs 29.92 crore for Kedarnath and Rs 50 lakh each for Gangotri and Yamunotri has been approved by the board. In other highlights of the meeting, the members decided to set up a Veda Study Centre in Joshimath, on the land of Shri Badrinath Veda Vedang Postgraduate Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya, Joshimath. The board agreed to select a consultant for carrying out the construction work of infrastructure, as per the master plan, for the successful operation of worship and yatra arrangements in Kedarnath. Dhami said that the old traditions would continue as before in the Char Dham temples. “The task of the state government is not to control the internal arrangements of the temple, but to cooperate. Our aim is to be a partner in the development of the facilities of the temple complexes,” said the CM, adding that in case of non-operation of the yatra, if necessary, additional financial assistance would be considered for the board, for which he asked for a revised proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rituals-will-not-be-livestreamed-from-sanctum-sanctorum-of-char-dham-shrines-says-govt/articleshow/84484077.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Vaccine offers 99% protection against death in Delta strain, finds NIV study||MUMBAI/PUNE: Scientists from the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) conducted the largest study done so far in India to understand why people got Covid-19 despite taking one or two vaccine shots. The genomic analysis carried out as part of the study showed the Delta variant’s presence in the majority of the samples, but there also were other variants such as Alpha, Kappa, Delta AY.1 (known as the Delta-plus variant in samples from MP and Rajasthan) and Delta AY.2. The occurrence of Covid in vaccinated people is called a ‘breakthrough infection.’ The NIV study, which is in the preprint stage of publication, proves that the Delta variant -- first isolated in Vidarbha in October 2020 and now acknowledged as the cause for the massive second wave -- caused breakthrough infections. Read AlsoTwo shots helped cut deaths by 95% in 2nd wave: ICMRTwo doses of Covid vaccine were successful in preventing 95% deaths due to Covid-19 during the second wave, whereas deaths were lower by 82% among those inoculated with one dose, the government said citing a study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) among more than 1.2 lakh“At the moment, the Delta variant is causing infections throughout the world, but the most important point of our study is that vaccination offers more than 99% protection against death even in the presence of the highly transmissible and more virulent Delta strain,” said Dr Yadav. While 53 samples for the study, conducted between March and June, were collected from Maharashtra, the highest number was 181 from Karnataka and the lowest number was 10, from West Bengal. Genetic sequencing was performed on each positive sample to find the Delta variant. Read AlsoNext 100-125 days critical for averting 3rd wave, says govtNEW DELHI: The next 100-125 days are very critical to avert a surge in Covid-19 cases that may lead to a third wave, health officials said on Friday underlining that the rise in cases globally and the slow pace of decline in India should be considered as “warning” that an outbreak may happen here“This study indicated that a majority of the clinical cases in the breakthrough were infected with the Delta variant and only 9.8% cases required hospitalization, while fatality was observed in only 0.4% cases. This clearly suggests that the vaccination does provide reduction in hospital admission and mortality,” concluded the study. Most patients in this study were young -- the median age was 44 (31-56), more were men (65.1%) and 71% of them were symptomatic, with one or more symptoms. Fever (69%) was the most common symptom, followed by bodyache, including headache and nausea (56%), cough (45%) and sore throat (37%). The researchers said breakthrough Covid-19 infections have been reported from various countries. “It appears the current Covid-19 vaccines are disease-modifying in nature wherein mild or less severe infections are expected to occur in vaccinated individuals,” said the study. Vaccination prevents severe disease, hospitalization and death, as is being seen in the UK, Israel and Canada. The NIV doctors who carried out the study said that the continuous monitoring of breakthrough infections is important. “Such monitoring will help us to understand the need to adequately tweak the available vaccines and also develop new vaccines with enhanced potential to protect against variant strains of SARS-CoV-2,” said Dr Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-vax-offers-99-protection-against-death-in-delta-strain/articleshow/84487386.cms||Malathy Iyer

An official of UN Special Procedures told TOI they had raised their concerns with the Centre “through appropriate diplomatic channels” on Wednesday. Despite repeated attempts, the Haryana chief secretary could not be reached for a comment on the UN body’s appeal. On Friday morning, MCF officials set up a camp on the campus of Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Surajkund for registering villagers who are eligible for rehabilitation. Around 100 villagers were registered on the first day. The Faridabad corporation has announced three conditions for villagers to be eligible for rehabilitation in the 1,800-odd EWS flats in Bapu Nagar and Dabua Colony. The villagers must fulfil at least one of these conditions. According to the eligibility criteria, at least one earning member or the head of a family should be a registered voter of the assembly constituency of Badhkal as on January 1, 2021. Those who vote in Delhi wouldn’t be rehabilitated in Haryana, officials have clarified. Secondly, the head of the family should have a “parivar pehchan patra” (a family ID card) issued by the Haryana government as on January 1 this year. The third condition is that an electricity connection offered by DHBVN should be in the name of an earning member. Villagers said they had little choice. A villager carrying a voter card of Delhi appeared worried. “I have been living in Khori for the past 10 years. We don’t know where we will go if the government does not rehabilitate us,” the villager said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/camp-to-sign-up-for-new-homes-as-demolitions-continue-in-fbd-village/articleshow/84488086.cms||Vishakha Chaman

Police denied permission for a ‘chalo Raj Bhavan’ rally. “KCR will have to face severe consequences after Congress comes to power if he continues to suppress the agitations by using police force. Our agitation will not stop until the central and state governments reduce the taxes to bring down the fuel prices,” Revanth said. He was addressing a gathering of party leaders and workers at dharna chowk near Indira Park where they had gathered to observe a deeksha, which was to be followed by a ‘chalo Raj Bhavan’ rally. However, police took into custody Revanth, hundreds of leaders and party workers when they tried to march towards Raj Bhavan. Tension prevailed at the dharna chowk before police brought the situation under control. The BJP government at the Centre and TRS government in Telangana have collected Rs 36 lakh crore in the last seven years towards taxes on petrol and diesel. While petrol can be given at Rs 40 per litre, central and state governments’ taxes put together are taking the total price to Rs 105 per litre in Telangana, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chalo-raj-bhavan-rally-of-cong-foiled-revanth-others-held/articleshow/84487367.cms||---

In some parts like Cambrabhat and Peterbhat, water entered people’s homes, and throughout the capital, vehicular traffic slowed down to a crawl. Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) workers were seen slogging through heavy rain in a bid to clear storm water drains. With the state receiving heavy showers for the fourth day in a row, the water level has risen, swelling water bodies and flooding low-lying areas. The state again recorded higher-than-average rainfall in the last 24 hours. The seasonal total now stands at 1,623.2mm (64 inches). IMD had earlier upgraded the rain warning from orange to red for Friday, and had warned of moderate to high flash flood over the Konkan area. Water logging was noticed near the bus stand, at Campal and other parts of the city. CCP officials said that the persistent rain has washed plastic bottles, jute bags, discarded cloth, polythene bags and vegetation into drains, blocking the flow of the water. The residents of Peterbhat, Taleigao, complained that water had entered their homes, and had reached waist-high level two days earlier. “Who can we complain to? Can anyone stop the rain?” said Santosh Patil, an electrician at Camrabhat. CCP has deployed additional manpower to clear the storm water drains. Goa received a brief respite from the heavy to very heavy rainfall in the afternoon. The department of fire and emergency services said that 16 emergency calls were received on Friday, but no major damage to property or life was reported. In the state capital, two trees came crashing down. A mango tree fell near Bhumika Temple, Sattari, which was uprooted due to the strong winds and heavy rain, damaging electrical lines and a bike. Fire department personnel said that the incident led to a loss of Rs 10,000, while goods worth 20,000 were salvaged. Similarly, at Kundaim, a teak wood tree fell on a house, causing damage worth approximately Rs 10,000, while appliances worth Rs 30,000 were saved.

Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC informed the HC that 2,773 people received fake jabs, and it has requested them to be de-registered, after which the civic body will vaccinate them at the earliest. He also said the police probe revealed that most of the unsuspecting recipients of the fake vaccines had received “saline water.” The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a PIL filed by advocate Siddharth Chandrashekhar on streamlining vaccinations in the city, asked the Centre to ensure such de-registration on the CoWin app is done soon for victims of the jab scam. Anita Castellino, counsel for Chandrashekhar, sought to point out that many others may have been similarly duped. The HC said the police were doing their probe and they be allowed to continue investigation which will unearth more details. The court observed that there appear to be three-four accused common to the several cases registered by Mumbai police. Sakhare also said that on July 1, the civic chief signed a new SOP for camps that are sought to be held at housing societies, with more checks in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-may-file-chargesheet-in-fake-vax-scam-in-two-weeks/articleshow/84488556.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Covid cases dip, load off healthcare system||BENGALURU: With the daily incidence of Covid-19 steadily declining, and remaining below the 2,000-mark consistently for the past six days, the pressure on the healthcare system has come down. Oxygen consumption has fallen and in hospitals across the state, non-Covid care is back on track. Covid-19 cases in Karnataka had peaked on May 5, crossing 50,000 for the first time in the second wave. Of the 50,112 cases reported from across the state, 23,106 were from Bengaluru alone. On July 10, the state reported 1,978 fresh cases, and the daily spike has remained below 2,000 since then. On Friday, the state reported 1,806 cases. Across 1,222 Covid-19 hospitals in the state, 6,399 patients were on oxygen support and 165 kilolitre of medical oxygen was used on July 14. Contrast this to consumption during the Covid peak in early May: the state required more than 700 KL of medical oxygen daily. The decline in Covid-19 cases has brought huge relief to healthcare staff. Hosps stepping up non-Covid careDoctors say besides sparing them the stress of dealing with the uncertainty of the disease and its progression in patients, they can now breathe free, quite literally, without having to wear PPE suits for long hours. With the viral load reducing, private and government hospitals are stepping up non-Covid care that was hitherto restricted to emergency only. At St John’s Medical College Hospital, in the past month, the number of Covid patients seeking beds has drastically reduced compared to the surge seen in May, says chief of medical services Dr Sanjiv Lewin. Currently, the hospital has 41 patients and 25% of them are in the ICU. The hospital has currently shut nine huge wards dedicated to Covid. “In the second wave, we had both Covid and non-Covid services going on. Even during the peak, we had 700 non-Covid patients seeking consultation in the outpatient unit. Now the OPD footfall is no less than 1,200 a day,” said Lewin. Some of the hospital’s doctors have also taken a short break from work, including one who has travelled to Himalayas, after Covid cases declined. The head of a 100-bed hospital in west Bengaluru told TOI that it was the high demand for medical oxygen that made Covid management tough in the second wave. At Victoria Hospital, while non-Covid outpatient services began on July 15, admissions are likely to begin in a week. Dr KC Gurudev, president of Ramaiah Memorial Hospital, says the number of Covid admissions has dropped drastically. The recent admission, he said, was of six members from a doctor’s family, while there is only one patient in ICU. “We have not had any admissions in Covid ICU for the last 10 days. There are 30 Covid patients at our memorial hospital and medical college hospital together,” he said. Recalling more than 100 enquiries a day for ICU admission a couple of months ago, Gurudev said those days were the most stressful. The hospital currently has nearly 400 non-Covid in-patients. While cases decline, doctors are counting the days of respite. At the back of their minds, they admit, is fear of a potential third wave. “The concern is that our medical college hospital will become a Covid hospital again and our medicos’ non-Covid treatment experience will suffer again,” says Dr Smitha S Segu of of BMCRI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-cases-dip-load-off-healthcare-system/articleshow/84488917.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Medical colleges in Karnataka to open for jabbed students||BENGALURU: With the second wave on retreat, the Karnataka government on Friday decided to reopen all health and medical educational institutions — medical, dental, Ayush, nursing and other allied healthcare colleges — with immediate effect. It will decide on reopening other colleges in 3-4 days. The decision comes with a rider: Only those (students, teaching and non-teaching staff) who have taken at least one dose of Covid vaccine will be allowed into the campus. Schedule for degree, diploma exams outColleges must strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and SOPs, according to a circular issued on Friday. Dr Jayakar SM, acting vice-chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, the umbrella university for colleges offering courses in health sciences, said a majority of students have taken the vaccine. “Being in healthcare sector, all students and staff were on priority list. Most colleges have had more than 90% of their students and staff vaccinated. A large majority have received their second dose,” said Dr Jayakar. The colleges are likely to start campus classes from Monday, but they are yet to take a formal decision. RGUHS has 950 affiliated colleges with 3 lakh students. Exams of various courses, including Ayurveda and PG dental, are under way. The circular signed by N Manjunatha Prasad, member-secretary of the state executive committee, said violation will warrant action under Section 51-60 of the Disaster Management Act 2005 and Section188 of the IPC. The decision on reopening other colleges will be made in 3-4 days after discussion with the chief minister, higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan said. About 65% of the students of government and government-aided institutions have been vaccinated, he said. Narayan announced the schedule of examinations of diploma and degree courses. For diploma, practical exams for odd semesters (1/3/5) will be held from July 26 to 28 and theory exams for leftover subjects (1/3/5), and other semesters will be held from August 2 to 21. Practical exams for even semesters (2/4/6) are scheduled from November 2 to 12 and theory exams from November 17 to December 6. Exams of degree courses for odd semesters (pending in Gulbarga, Karnataka and Bengaluru universities and a few subjects left in some other universities) are scheduled by August 15, and for even semesters in October.

The positivity rate of the city dropped to 1.2%, and daily deaths remained steady at 11. The state reported a slight dip in cases (7,761) as well, and 167 deaths. With this, the total caseload touched 61.97 lakh and fatalities rose to 1,26,727. The caseload in the city rose to 7.3 lakh and the total death toll touched 15,678. “The daily cases have been hovering around 500 in Mumbai for a long time now, and there is no indication of any surge or sign of worry,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. The thick tail of Covid in Mumbai has been worrying experts, though BMC officials have maintained it is a function of the huge population density and the large floating population. The WHO said the third Covid wave is apparent in some parts of the world, but chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday countered that the second wave in the state has ebbed but the thick tail of the second wave is still around. “The cases and deaths in the state have come down, but they have stagnated at 8,000-9,000 cases. We are trying to bring down the cases further. We have asked districts to increase tests, especially RT-PCR tests,” said Thackeray. Health minister Rajesh Tope took a review of the Covid measures in Kolhapur, where cases are surging. The district administration has been asked to ensure more people are treated in institutional quarantine and home quarantine is discouraged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-covid-cases-lowest-in-city-since-feb-9-state-tally-too-sees-dip/articleshow/84491636.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Tough race for admissions for vocational courses||PUNE: The state directorate of vocational education and training had announced two weeks ago that admissions for all vocational courses, including the industrial training institutes, would be held based on SSC results. Institute heads stated that the high success rate in SSC results would lead to a tough competition among students seeking admission for vocational courses across the state. Students mainly opt for diploma, technical courses, skill-based or vocational courses after SSC. Students who wish to take admissions in mainstream arts, science and commerce would have to appear for the common entrance test for admissions. However, other than the mainstream courses, all the other admissions would be conducted based on SSC marks only. Yogesh Patil, the admissions coordinator at the state directorate of vocational education and training, said there would not be any entrance test for admissions to ITI courses. “The admissions would be conducted based on SSC results and the results were hinting that it would be tougher than previous years.” Prakash Saigaonkar, the pricinpal of ITI, Aundh, said, “The students can start applying for the courses as soon as the procedure is declared by the directorate. The demand has definitely been growing for the past few years and we will wait and watch how it pans out this year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tough-race-for-admissions-for-vocational-courses/articleshow/84487394.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The festival marks the onset of Hindu month Shravan, believed to be Lord Shiva’s favourite month. On the occasion, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami planted a few saplings at Dehadun's MDDA City Park. He urged the people present there to greet him with saplings instead of bouquets. “Our ancestors took several major steps towards the preservation and protection of the environment. Therefore, it is our duty to continue this heritage. Our future generations should also carry forward this tradition,” said CM Dhami. Meanwhile, Uttarakhand governor Baby Rani Maurya also planted saplings at the Rajbhavan Complex. “Harela gives us the message of environmental conservation. Efforts should be made to increase green cover across the globe as global warming, water scarcity and pollution have become major challenges today.” Several other plantation drives were held in Kumaon, where the festival is celebrated with much fervour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/harela-celebrated-across-ukhand-cm-dhami-governor-plant-saplings/articleshow/84484145.cms||Mohammad Anab

The order comes into force from Saturday. Under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the assembly of five or more people is banned at these places and in a one-km radius of the tourist spots. The order will remain in force till the next order is issued. The decision has been taken in view of crowding at the seven tehsils — Bhor, Velhe, Mulshi, Maval, Haveli, Junnar and Ambegaon — throughout the week. Deshmukh told TOI, “People have been crowding these places over the last few weeks, which could result in a surge in Covid cases in the district.” Level 4 restrictions continue in rural Pune, which has a stagnant Covid positivity rate of 7% for the last five weeks. “We cannot relax the restrictions until the rate falls below 5%,” said Deshmukh. The rural police identified the tourist destinations and submitted a proposal to the district administration two days ago, said superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh. “We will file first information reports (FIRs) under the relevant sections of the IPC and Disaster Management Act against violators. We have chalked out a comprehensive plan. Our teams will be deployed at vantage points and we will also set up check points to implement the order,” he added. The police have been conducting special drives against violators. Deshmukh said, “We have collected lakhs of rupees in fines from them over the last few weeks. But deterrence is necessary to improve the situation. People gather in large number and violate Covid norms.” Graphic The order will come to the force from July 17. It will be effective till the next order.

The three-day assembly session will commence on July 28. The government intends to pass 16 bills during the session, but did not allow the opposition to move private member bills, including 80% job reservation of Goans in the private sector. The opposition is once again likely to raise the Mhadei issue, mining, Covid mismanagement, three linear projects and coal handling among others. Legislative affairs minister Mauvin Godinho said that they have increased zero hours and calling attention motions so that the opposition has an equal opportunity to raise issues. “We have told the opposition that wherever assembly sessions have been held it was not more than three days and we are following the same procedure,” he said. Godinho said that the chief minister has said that a session can be called in October as the state government doesn’t want to hide anything. “In the election year, the opposition wants to show that the government doesn’t want a lengthy session,” he said. The full budget will be passed during the session, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citing-pandemic-govt-announces-3-day-session-set-to-pass-16-bills/articleshow/84487384.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

I am sure, I can say that on the behalf of all the Goan leaders that his addition to Goa’s political paradigm will be fruitful and advantageous. I have always looked up to him as a mentor,” Tendulkar tweeted.

---||Pune||RT-PCR relief to boost passenger arrivals, say Pune airport officials||PUNE: Kadambari Goswami (28), a working professional in Hinjewadi, can now plan a visit to her family in Kolkata without worrying about a negative RT-PCR report while flying back to Pune. The Maharashtra government issued a circular on Thursday allowing fully-vaccinated passengers and commuters, with 15-day gap from the second dose, to enter the state, without negative RT-PCR report. “It is a relief for many of us. While carrying a RT-PCR report from Pune is much easier but arranging for a report while coming back is a big headache,” she told TOI. Partially-vaccinated travellers, however, will have to carry a report not older than 72 hours, instead of 48 hours. The certificates for both doses need to be shown to airlines and airport authorities Business travellers said that the relaxation has come as a relief. “I travel to Delhi at least four to five times in a fortnight for two or more days and it is extremely stressful to arrange for a report while travelling back to Pune from Delhi. When there are series of meetings to attend, one does not have time for such things. The Delhi government had relaxed the norm early last month,” Pradeep Deshpande, a businessman, said. However, there are states like Goa, Rajasthan Karnataka, Manipur etc which still have the rule of RT-PCR negative report for arriving air passengers. In certain states, exemptions have been given to vaccinated people or arrangements have been made at the airport for swab collection if a traveller isn’t carrying a report. Pune airport officials said that they were expecting an increase of at least 15% to 20% in arriving passengers. “The regulation was causing many problems for business travellers arriving in the city as well as general travellers wishing to come to Pune to meet their families and friends. We are expecting a major increase in number of arriving passengers. The number of departures will also improve as people will be willing to travel more,” an airport official said. “We now expect to see more short trips happening,” said Nilesh Bhansali, director of Travel Agents Association of Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rt-pcr-relief-to-boost-passenger-arrivals-say-pune-airport-officials/articleshow/84487411.cms||Joy Sengupta

Police said all the three had consumed poison and left behind separate notes, saying they had run up “mounting debts” and requesting the authorities to waive their loans and cremate them. While 51-year-old tax consultant Hari Shetty was found dead at a city hotel on July 6, his wife Veena (46) and their daughter Yashika (24) allegedly consumed poison at their rented flat in Sector 67 a week later. The family had moved into the society in January this year and had little interaction with the other residents, police said. In his suicide note, Hari spoke about the family’s financial troubles over the past one year and his failure to cope with them. His wife, who used to work with a private company but lost her job during the Covid pandemic, said in her note that she did not want to live after her husband’s death and urged the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to waive the pending bank loans on their Greater Noida flat and car. Yashika, a law graduate, wrote to the Gurugram police commissioner, listed out the furniture and other belongings of the family, including the flat and the car, and urged him to hand over the same to her maternal aunt who had helped the family in times of crisis. The mother-daughter duo also urged the government to cremate them at the state’s expense. According to police, both Hari and his wife had lost their jobs during the lockdown last year. Over the past one year, the family had exhausted all their savings and was struggling to pay off their utility bills and bank EMIs. “Financial crisis was the main reason behind the tragic turn of events,” said Gurugram police spokesperson Subhash Boken. Police said no FIR had been lodged into the case as they have not received any formal complaint. The bodies have been handed over to their immediate family members after autopsy. “After Hari died, some people had tried to financially help the family. But by then, the mother-daughter duo had gone into depression. They were unable to cope with the financial troubles,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ggn-man-in-debt-ends-life-wife-girl-consume-poison/articleshow/84488111.cms||Bagish Jha

The board declared the results online on Friday at 1pm, But, as soon as the link went live, it crashed as lakhs of students tried to log on to the website within seconds. The technical department of the board finally made available two more links for students to access their results around 7 pm. These too were inaccessible till late on Friday evening. Unlike the past years when the state board had given the data to multiple private players to display the result for a fee, this year, the state board displayed all the results on its own servers, increasing the load. Officials said there were complaints about the data being used for commercial purposes by private entities. Meanwhile, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad tweeted that an inquiry has been ordered to find out the reason behind the technical problem and strict action will be taken against those responsible.“We used to allow private websites to host the data. The new IT Amendment Act of 2018 doesn’t allow us to share personal data with private companies. There were complaints about selling the data obtained from us for commercial purposes such as private classes. We were also concerned about the safety of data of girl students. From this year onwards, only the official website of the board will give links to students for accessing their results. This will be applicable to class XII results too,” Patil said.Patil said there was a load on the server where results were uploaded and it was resolved by diverting the traffic to three different places. “Apart from the main website, there are two other links where the students can access their results now. Almost 60,000 downloads were registered by 7pm,” he added .Meanwhile, the social media was abuzz with students complaining about the website crash. From funny to angry tweets, the students expressed their frustration about the lack of access to the result since 1pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/data-privacy-issues-block-private-websites-from-accessing-result/articleshow/84487407.cms||---

The malls in Pune are closed in accordance with the level 3 curbs imposed by the Maharashtra government to curb the further spread of Covid. “People tend to spend a lot of time in the malls. The malls have been kept closed as we fear crowding there. But there is a demand from fully vaccinated shopkeepers and traders to relax the restrictions. The state is considering whether the fully vaccination criterion can be considered as the condition to provide relaxations,” he said after the weekly Covid review meeting at Council Hall in the city. Pawar said though there has been a slight decline in Covid cases in the district, level 3 restrictions would continue in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits and rural Pune without any changes. “This was decided unanimously by the elected representatives and the administration. The cases need to decline,” he said. Pawar said the Covid positivity rate has come down to almost nil in some districts of the state, but not in Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, Pune, Raigad and Ahmednagar. “The weekly positivity rate of Pune district is 5.7% and the recovery rate is 97.3%,” he said. Pawar said he also met a delegation of industry representatives and told them to conduct vaccination drives for their employees. He said the government was keen on restarting the economy. “When restrictions are eased, we witness crowding in the markets and tourist spots. Citizens should follow Covid protocols. We want to speed up vaccination to restore and revive the economy,” Pawar said, adding that the state was still not receiving adequate vaccine doses as assured by the Centre. Maharashtra is slightly behind Covid vaccination leader Uttar Pradesh in doses administered so far — 3.8 crore vs 3.9 crore — but its second-dose coverage is the highest. However, six months into the nationwide vaccination programme, only 10% of Maharashtra’s target population has been fully inoculated. State health minister Rajesh Tope had on Thursday said the fully vaccinated people following Covid-appropriate behaviour were less likely to be infected and transmit the infection. “There is a demand from fully vaccinated shopkeepers, traders and even individuals to relax restrictions for them, but rather than giving relaxations to individuals, a district-wise decision could be considered,” Tope said. Senior officials said that there was a pressure on the state to lift restrictions, and it was likely that the state government may consider bringing districts to Level 2, which allows for fewer restrictions. Currently, the state was at a minimal Level 3 and above. The state was also considering extending shop timings and timings of restaurants for dine-in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-mulling-relief-for-fully-vaxed-traders-citizens-in-malls/articleshow/84487398.cms||---

The petitioners, who also included a petrol pump owner, approached the HC complaining that their business have suffered for last couple of years because of the excavation being carried out for the metro rail track. They have requested the government authorities for compensation and alternative arrangements to carry out their businesses, but to no avail. After hearing the case, Justice Ashutosh Shastri did not agree with the demand and said, “This Court is of the opinion that whenever there is a work of such a magnitude is undertaken by the respondent authorities, of overall public interest, some inconvenience might cause, but that would not allow few handful persons to make an attempt to thwart the process.” The court further observed, “…private interest to be merged in public interest and public interest always to be given precedence.” The court noted that from the pleadings, it appears that to some extent the petitioners are also not readily accepting this work to be undertaken in smooth manner and under one pretext or the other trying to create a situation to hamper the work. The court also noted that the authorities take every step to see that minimum hardship is caused to residents of the area including the petitioners and it is not in dispute that on account of this project the business of the petitioners have not been shut down.  It further said that some inconvenience has been caused to the petitioners, “but that would not allow the petitioners to over pitch their case to such a extent that their fundamental rights are infringed”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-junks-plea-of-shopkeepers-affected-by-metro-rail-work/articleshow/84486606.cms||---

The gang is managed from Washington DC in the USA and had set up a branch in IT Park in Dehradun as well. According to police officials, the gang members managed to get the details of their victims from their team in the USA. The details would then be passed on to the teams in Delhi and Dehradun. The accused were running a call centre in the name of Trekknow Travel in the city’s IT Park area. The cops have arrested four members of the gang and seized 20 laptops and two desktops and cell phones. The accused confessed to the police that they would call US citizens and tell them that their couriers may have some illegal substance and that they could face legal action. The other members of the gang would then pose as officers from the customs department and border protection office of the US and threaten their targets that a warrant was being issued against them from the office. At this point, their accomplices would step in and suggest legal remedies to avoid the warrant and in the process, extract hefty amounts from the targets. Neelesh Anand, DIG, STF, said that the gang had been paying a rent of Rs 90,000 per month for the office space and the staff was also being given a salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/four-members-of-gang-that-duped-us-citizens-held/articleshow/84484181.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Ahmedabad||Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates multiple development projects in Gujarat||GANDHINAGAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a number of projects in Gujarat on Friday, including the redeveloped Vadnagar railway station via video link. The PM said that many memories were associated with Vadnagar station. “Today, Vadnagar is also associated with the railway expansion work. Many memories are associated with Vadnagar station. It looks very attractive now,” the PM commented on the railway station of his hometown, where in his younger days he helped his father, who had a tea stall there, to sell tea.  The needs of 21st century India won’t be fulfilled with the ways of the 20th century, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, stressing the need for reforms in the railways, as he inaugurated multiple development projects in Gujarat, including the redeveloped Gandhinagar train station.  Modi also inaugurated the newly built five-star hotel atop the redeveloped Gandhinagar railway station and later inaugurated three new attractions at the Science City in Ahmedabad. During the virtual event, Modi also flagged the off Gandhinagar-Varanasi weekly superfast train and Gandhinagar-Varetha train. “We have worked to develop the railways not only as a service but as an asset, the result of which can be clearly seen today,” Modi said, adding that there is a need to develop the railways vertically as much as there is a need to spread its reach horizontally. Stating that he was eager to visit Gujarat at the earliest possible opportunity to personally view the projects he inaugurated virtually, the PM said that better public spaces are a necessity. “Earlier, urban planners considered quality public spaces to be a luxury, and people in our cities were denied quality public spaces. Nobody can forget the condition of the Sabarmati river earlier. Today, it has a riverfront, parks, a seaplane and many other amenities attached to it,” he remarked. The PM also inaugurated the Aquatics and Robotics Gallery and Nature Park in Gujarat Science City via video conferencing. Speaking on the occasion, the PM said, “Science City project is a mix of recreation and creativity. The aquatics gallery is even more interesting. The sight of marine biodiversity from all over the world in one place is a wonderful experience in itself. It is one of the top aquariums not only in the country but also in Asia.” Functions held at train stations: To ensure greater participation in the events, the state government had directed holding of parallel events at all stations through which the Gandhinagar-Varanasi and Gandhinagar Capital–Varetha trains were to pass. At the Ahmedabad station, minister of state for home, Pradipsinh Jadeja, was present on Platform-1. A programme was held even as the train was flagged off from Gandhinagar. The parallel events were organized at Anand, Chhayapuri, and Godhra from where the Ahmedabad-Varanasi train was to pass. Similar events were organized at Mehsana, Vadnagar and Kalol through which the Gandhinagar-Varetha train was to pass. Two trains from capital: Ahmedabad: The Western Railway will be introducing new superfast train services between Gandhinagar Capital and Varanasi stations and Memu services between Gandhinagar Capital and Varetha stations. The Gandhinagar Capital–Varanasi Superfast Special Express will leave Gandhinagar Capital every Thursday at 11.15pm to reach Varanasi at 11.30pm the next day. The Varanasi–Gandhinagar Capital Superfast Special Express will leave Varanasi every Wednesday at 3.15pm to reach Gandhinagar Capital at 3.20pm the next day. The train will halt at Ahmedabad, Anand, Chhayapuri, Godhra, Ratlam, Ujjain, Bina, Jhansi, and Prayagraj stations in both directions.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: CET likely on August 21; online applications from Monday||PUNE: All eyes are now on the optional Common Entrance Test (CET), which will decide admission to Class XI (first year junior college). Dinkar Patil, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) chairman, said that the examination was expected to be held on August 21. The Class X results were declared on Friday. “While CET examination is slated to be held in an offline format, the online application process will start from Monday. The state has already announced that the examination will be based on the board syllabus. We will publish a detailed notification on the main topics which will be covered in the examination by next week. The examination is free for students who have registered for the 2020-21 state board examination. However, students from other boards would need to pay an examination fee of Rs178 to appear for the CET,” said Patil. The decision to take a CET was taken after the state board decided to cancel Class X board exam for the academic year 2020-21. The optical mark recognition (OMR)-based single question paper exam will be of two hours’ duration. Based on the state board syllabus, there will be 100 questions of 25 marks each in English, mathematics, science and social studies. Patil further said that a link would be made available on the MSBSHSE website directing students to a different online portal. “The state board students will be asked about their exam seat numbers and once they submit the data, a window with all their details will open. Students will be asked as to whether they wish to opt for the optional CET examination. Whatever option the student chooses, we will get the data directly. As for the non-state board students, a separate set of instructions will be issued soon,” said Patil. During the Class XI common admission process, junior colleges will give priority to students who have scored well in the CET. This means that in the first phase of the Class XI admission process, students who have appeared for the CET would be given admission on priority according to merit. After that admissions would be given to students who have not opted for the CET, based on their Class X marks. Seema Purohit, principal, Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC), advised students seeking to study in top colleges to appear for the CET. “In most renowned colleges, the seats are filled within the first two rounds. Hence, basing expectations on high Class X marks will not be helpful. I think all students must appear for the CET,” said Purohit. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, however, said that the state education department must take all decisions on time. “The entrance process should not be delayed, and results displayed on time. The centralised admission process should be implemented in a fixed schedule so that at least the next academic year can start on time. There should be multiple teams working on this in cooperation with others so that everything happens within the time limit,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cet-likely-on-aug-21-online-applications-from-monday/articleshow/84487419.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

He has asked us to implement Covid norms and ensure hefty penalties are levied on defaulters,” said an official. Thackeray addressed district collectors after a video conference with PM Narendra Modi. “Many countries are reporting a third wave; the WHO has also announced it.

The drug dealers have found a new method to peddle marijuana. They have come up with marijuana laced peppermint candies. The CID crime in Rajkot on Thursday evening seized 183 kg of marijuana laced peppermint candies worth Rs 80,000 from a house at Kothariya road. The person in possession of the contraband stock was arrested and the samples of candies were sent for forensic testing. The CID crime raided the house of Rajendra Gupta in Tirupati society based on the specific information. They found the peppermint candies hidden in several big plastic bags each containing 40 small bags stacked with peppermint packs. The CID sleuths found 800 such packets weighing 183kg. The police found various addresses of Fatehpur and Allahabad based addresses of the manufacturers on the bags. According to police, accused Gupta, a native of Bhojpur district of Bihar, was living in Rajkot since last few years and was doing labour work. He started bringing in this kind of peppermint in the last few months from Uttar Pradesh and was giving these packets for sale at the ‘paan’ shops. One candy was being sold at the ‘paan’ shop for Rs 10. CID police inspector J J Chohan registered an FIR regarding this offence with Ajidam police station of Rajkot on Friday and handed the investigation to the local police.

---||Delhi||Eid’s Covid story plays on repeat in Delhi: Few goats for sale, buyers fewer||NEW DELHI: Kaiser Ali, who lives in Rani Bagh in northwest Delhi, came all the way to Meena Bazar near Jama Masjid with his wife in search of a goat for Eid-ul-Adha, which falls on July 21. He thought the caprine market that springs up weeks before the festival was the apt place for his special need. But Ali and his wife had a frustrating time trying to find an animal to fulfil their farz, or duty, of sacrificing it on the auspicious occasion.  For the second year running, the annual market for goats has been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing sellers, mostly from Uttar Pradesh, to roam around the Old Delhi localities trying to find customers, who themselves have been financially hit by the pandemic. The grounds at Meena Bazar otherwise teem with goats and sheep for a month in the run-up to the festival.  But Covid has put paid to the aspirations of both sellers and buyers. As goat herder Arkan Ali of UP’s Sambhal district pointed out, “Usually, I brought more than 50 goats and set up a large tent at Meena Bazar and there were enough people clamouring to buy from me. Now, I have to walk the whole day with 3-4 animals to find prospective customers.” Hardware seller Mohammad Saffan provided the other view, that of a customer. “Those who can afford will perhaps buy some animals, but my business has suffered for many months due to the pandemic,” he said. “Also, there are fewer goats available, so the prices are likely to be higher too. I don’t think too many will purchase the sacrificial animals this year.” Veteran goat seller Naushad of Amroha, UP, sat brooding on Urdu Bazar Road. He explained why he will charge more for his goats and sheep this year.  “Since there is no market, I can only bring fewer goats to Delhi but have to recoup the cost of transportation and lodging in Delhi for some time,” he shrugged. Qamruddin, making his maiden goat-selling trip to old Delhi, wasn’t keen on lingering on in the city. He had a goat with him that he claimed weighed 102kg.  “I want to sell it for Rs 1 lakh and return home to run my sweet shop in Loni,” the Ghaziabad resident said. Another debutant seller was Raj Kumari, a 60-year old. She too had just a single goat with her. She said she had raised the caprine for a few years. “I cannot keep him with me any longer,” she said, “and thought that if I sold him off at a time of the Eid-ul-Adha festival, the prices offered would be better than at other times of the year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eids-covid-story-plays-on-repeat-few-goats-for-sale-buyers-fewer/articleshow/84488130.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

---||Mumbai||Final driving test a farce, make it stringent: Experts||MUMBAI: With the learner licence test going completely online and bringing in transparency, transport experts and union leaders have called out the practice of conducting the final driving test on the Regional Transport Office (RTO) track as a farce. Transport union leaders recently approached the RTO complaining of the shoddy manner in which tests are conducted. “The test involves driving for less than 50m with the driving school teacher sitting next to the candidate,” said the parent of a candidate who took the exam on Friday. TimesViewThe driving test should be so stringent that getting a licence in Mumbai should be kind of a privilege and a certificate that you are a good driver. Every RTO should follow proper procedure to create the ideal driving track and test candidates diligently. Else, government should expedite setting up of automated tracks at all state RTOs with sensors to disqualify a bad driver.Insiders say the absurd “aage peeche” (front and reverse) technique of clearing exams is back at city RTOs. This requires driving the car in first gear a few metres ahead, then switching to reverse gear and taking it back a few metres. It takes less than three minutes to clear the test, a source in the RTO said. “I was shocked to see many candidates lined up at the Andheri track to give a test, but hardly any check on driving skills. In many cases, the officials are in cahoots with driving school authorities,” alleged Maqbool Mujawar from Navbharatiya Shiv Vahtuk Sanghatana, a transport union. Transport experts say getting a licence should be a stringent process, just like it’s in many foreign countries. A V Shenoy from Mumbai Mobility Forum said bypassing proper procedures to test the skills of candidates was dangerous. Transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said he was keen to replace manual methods with automated test tracks at 50 RTOs, but the process of appointing agencies which was due in June is now delayed. This will impact setting up of automated tracks planned at all the four RTOs. He said automated tracks will give accurate results, and eliminate the chances of corrupt practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/final-driving-test-a-farce-make-it-stringent-in-mumbai-experts/articleshow/84488616.cms||Somit Sen
---||Ahmedabad||Bids invited for Sola GHB redevelopment||Ahmedabad: After a long wait, Gujarat Housing Board (GHB) has called for redevelopment of the high-income group (HIG) Rameshwar Apartments on Sola Road. The project cost is estimated to be around Rs 54 crore. GHB in its document stated that 75% of residents consent has been obtained as mandated under the new Gujarat Flat Owners Act and the developer has to ensure that the remaining residents agree to the redevelopment, including the cost of the transit accommodation till the new dwellings are ready. The plot size is 20,749 square metres. “The project is being undertaken in the public-private partnership (PPP) model with the extension of the lease period for an additional 99 years. Another important condition in the GHB document submitted to the AMC is that a tripartite agreement has been reached,” said a senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official. To make project viable, the GHB in its 2019 revised redevelopment guidelines stated that after redevelopment of houses, the remaining permissible FSI of Rameshwar Apartments shall be utilized on the plot by the developer for creation of affordable housing stock as well as for the development of the free sale component. If for any reason, the remaining FSI cannot be utilized fully on these two activities, the remaining FSI can be utilized on any other plot under the same Development Plan as Transferable Development Rights (TDR).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bids-invited-for-sola-ghb-redevelopment/articleshow/84486652.cms||---

Speaking to the media on his arrival at the airport, Patel said it wasn’t “suitable” for him to react to the latter’s everyday jibes against alliance partners. Ever since Patole took over the grand old party’s state mantle from revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, his comments have often led to friction between the coalition partners. “We will give more weightage to the All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary HK Patil, who’s in-charge for Maharashtra. It’s because he’s a direct representative of the party’s high command. His comments have more facts. Even their senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge was in Mumbai for a meeting with the MVA leaders and hasn’t endorsed Patole. The NCP’s position on Patole’s remarks has already been clarified by our leader Sharad Pawar. There’s no point in reacting to every comment that he (Patole)makes,” Patel said, while sarcastically calling Congress chief’s jibes as an “everyday media event”. Pawar had earlier played down Patole’s jibes stating that “he (Patole) was a minor leader whose comments should be better ignored”. Refuting speculations about a rift in the MVA government due to Patole’s tirade, the Rajya Sabha MP pointed out that Thorat and PWD minister Ashok Chavan later met with Pawar at his residence along with Patil. “It’s a clear indication about the Congress stand on the entire issue. The MVA government is functioning under the guidance of Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. What others say is hardly of any concern and there’s no need to give any explanation,” said Patel while taking a dig at Patole. On the Parliament’s monsoon session, the former civil aviation minister said the BJP led NDA government needed to explain various issues plaguing the nation like rising inflation and fuel prices, farmers’ issues, border clashes with China and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. On appointments to various state Mahamandals, including NIT, Patel said it was up to the coordination committee of all the three parties whose members needed to devise a formula for filling up the posts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/more-weightage-to-aicc-secy-comments-than-patole-patel/articleshow/84484230.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The party aims to reach out to 20 lakh households in the state in the next 15 days. During the campaign, the party workers will make people register for the free electricity scheme which was announced by Delhi CM and party chief Arvind Kejriwal during his visit to Dehradun recently. Kejriwal had promised that if voted to power, the party will provide 300 units of free electricity to every household and also waive off pending bills, besides ensuring uninterrupted supply and free power to farmers. "As part of the campaign, AAP party workers are going to do the groundwork for the free electricity scheme announced by Arvind Kejriwal, if the party is voted to power in the forthcoming assembly elections," said Naveen Pirshali, spokesperson, AAP Uttarakhand. In the door-to-door campaign, which will run from July 17 to August 1, AAP workers will create awareness about what the pearty is terming its ‘four guarantees’ — free power up to 300 units to each household, free power to farmers, 24x7 power supply and waving off of pending bills. Meanwhile, the state government has also readied a proposal to provide 100 units of electricity free as announced by power minister Harak Singh Rawat a few days ago. On Friday, AAP workers led by Colonel Ajay Kothiyal (retd) also led a protest march towards the CM's residence against a BJP spokesperson's alleged statement made with regard to AAP's free electricity scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/aap-to-launch-free-electricity-drive-from-july-17-in-ukhand/articleshow/84484319.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||DMRC chalks out property development plan for Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake station||NEW DELHI: Located amid picturesque greenery near Sanjay Lake, Delhi Metro’s Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake station of Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) will soon be connected directly to popular markets of south Delhi with the “missing link” at Trilokpuri finally been bridged. With footfall set to rise, the station will boast of a shopping mall, hotel, banks, offices, etc as Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is developing it commercially. Due to a gap between Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake and Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 stations, Pink Line functions as two separate corridors.  However, the viaduct between the two stations is now ready. Soon, trains will start running on trial. What functions like a terminal station now will become a busy one, thanks to direct connectivity with not only south Delhi but also west and north up to Majlis Park. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said 2,526 square metres of area at the station would be leased for commercial development. “The successful bidder will be offered the space for 15 years, which is located on the first floor of the station that is in proximity to Sanjay Lake,” he added. The station is located towards the northeastern periphery of the city and situated in proximity to residential locations such as Vinod Nagar, Kalyanpuri, Trilokpuri, Mayur Vihar Phases 1 & 2, etc.  “Further, a few CGHS group housing projects like Manu Apartments, Maitri Apartments, Una Enclave, Sahyog Apartments, etc are also in the vicinity,” said Dayal. There are limited organised retail or commercial developments in the immediate vicinity of the station, with the nearest organised commercial hub being Mayur Vihar District Centre, which is at a distance of approximately 5km. The station is also close to the proposed Lake View Complex of Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which will come up along Sanjay lake spanning about 27 acres. DDA has signed an MOU with NBCC for developing the integrated complex. “The development will enhance the overall profile of the region in the medium to long term,” Dayal said. “The space will be leased out for specified purposes like retail, organised commercial area, offices, banks, etc. The project site has an excellent opportunity to become an important commercial hub within this locality,” said the DMRC official. DMRC would provide separate access to the commercial area, apart from a prominent and spacious frontage and, once the footfall further increases, a captive commuter base. The primary commercial development expected are shopping mall or complex, departmental stores, discount stores or hypermarkets, showrooms for consumer goods like garments, electronics, general utilities, automobiles, etc, apart from restaurants, fast food stalls, kiosks, food court and even a hotel. The commercial development could also include educational institutes, coaching centres, computer training centres, etc. With the growing popularity of e-commerce, the space can also be partially used for setting up warehouses or stores. DDA’s Sanjay Lake View Complex is one of the city’s Transit Oriented Development projects, which will have highrise apartments, commercial development including hotels, and lake-front development with plazas, promenades and skywalks. A DDA official said, “It will help catalyse change and upgrade the area and, eventually, restore a sense of safety and social pride in the larger Trilokpuri and Kalyanpuri vicinity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/close-to-metro-stn-malls-offices-flats-with-lakeside-view-more/articleshow/84486788.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Luv Jain, 28, a resident of Golden Tulip Bungalows Society in Manekbaug, said he runs his company manufactures tar and petroleum products and has its office near Parimal Garden. The two accused, Ashok Chauhan, a resident of Meghaninagar, and Mitesh Shah, a resident of Anandnagar, were hired in 2016 and 2019 respectively. Jain said he had them company laptops and phones containing the details of clients across the country to them. Chauhan was hired as the sales manager and Shah was the marketing manager.

---||Madurai||Right to be redacted: HC to study status of an acquitted man||MADURAI: As a simple Google-search can make or mar a person’s character, his/her name should be redacted (obscured for legal or security purposes) from judgments if he/she is acquitted in a criminal case, Madras high court has opined. Invoking an individual’s right to privacy and the right to be forgotten, Justice N Anand Venkatesh said a Google-search would bring up court judgments, and a person’s name would be shown against alleged crimes even after he was acquitted of all judgments. However, considering the deep ramifications a redact order would bring along, the high court has chosen to hear the views of members of the Bar, including the prosecution, before passing a detailed order on the issue. A man who was tried for rape and cheating, was convicted and sentenced by a trial court in 2011, but he was acquitted of all charges by the high court in 2014. He has now approached the high court for redacting his name from the judgment. Justice Anand Venkatesh observed that the petitioner is now facing a very peculiar problem as his name gets reflected in the judgment as an accused, though he was acquitted of all charges. “Unfortunately, whoever types the name of the petitioner in Google-search is able to access the judgment of this court. According to the petitioner it causes a serious impact on his reputation in the eyes of the society,” he said. Agreeing with the man’s contention, the court said, “today, the world is literally under the grips of social media,” adding that the background of a person is assessed by everyone through Google-search and the first impression is created depending upon the data that is provided. “It will make or mar the characteristics of a person in the eyes of the society," observed Justice Anand Venkatesh. The existing laws protect the identity of women and child victims, and their names are not reflected in any order passed by a court, the judge said, adding: “This right has not been extended to an accused person who ultimately is acquitted from all charges.” The judge further observed it is also brought to the notice of this court that when a similar issue came up before the Delhi high court recently, interim orders were passed directing the websites concerned to redact the name of the petitioner. “It is also informed to this court that a new right called the 'Right to be Forgotten' is sought to be included in the list of rights that are already available under Article 21 of the Constitution,” he said. The judge requested the assistance of the Bar members in this case and posted the case to July 28 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/right-to-be-redacted-hc-to-study-status-of-an-acquitted-man/articleshow/84486705.cms||Kaushik Kannan

By comparison, last year, with one paper, Geography, cancelled due to the onset of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, 242 students had bagged the perfect score. In pre-pandemic 2019, merely 20 students in the state had managed a 100% result.

Can it be the place where he/she started off – an ancestral home, memory of a place or childhood imagination? These were some of the themes taken up by the tutors Siddharth Singh and Sukhmani Brar from Faculty of Architecture at Cept University for their studio ‘Body, Memory, Architecture’ exhibited at ongoing Summer Exhibition. “Starting with the design of small spaces of solitude, intimacy and congregation in a subterranean site, moving on to transform it into a home and culminating into the transformation of the home into a small institution, students investigated the relationship between the self and the world,” said a faculty official. A total of 14 projects took the theme and designed homes where they first described the family inhabiting it, then a personal space from the perspective of a child, and then expanded it based on their learning of architectural process. The students also created drawings, storyboards, maps, collages and scale models for the same. Experts associated with the project said that the exercise gives an idea of the space, dimensions, intangible aspects such as light and shadow, and how a person sees self in context of the world – first the home, and then the outside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/designing-the-home-of-childhood-memories/articleshow/84486716.cms||---

Notably, the state government has officially marked Kasganj district Covid free, with no new case reported since last week. According to the health department records, a total 745 blood samples of adults and children were collected for sero survey from 25 villages and six urban wards from June 9 to 11. People who had received Covid-19 vaccine, those who were tested positive and the healthy ones who didn’t get the vaccine were covered in the survey. The district health department had claimed that the results of the survey would emerge within 15 days. Sero-survey is an important component of disease surveillance. It provides estimates of antibody levels against infectious diseases and is considered crucial for measuring population immunity due to past infection or vaccination. A senior doctor of SN Medical College in Agra said, “When antibodies are found, it may mean that a person was infected with Covid-19 and their body’s immune system responded to the virus at some point in the past. People develop antibodies when their body’s immune system responds to an infection. These antibodies can be found in the bloodstream of people previously infected with the disease whether or not they had signs or symptoms of illness. Sero-survey provides a clear estimate of the spread of Covid-19 and development of antibodies against the disease.” Chief medical officer of Kasganj district, Dr Anil Kumar, said, “On the orders of the state government, blood samples of 745 people were sent for sero-survey to the Meerut medical college. The survey report has been delayed due to some logistics issues. We are constantly in touch with the lab. The survey results will be released soon."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sero-survey-results-not-declared-yet-in-kasganj-district/articleshow/84481947.cms||---

School education minister Varsha Gaikwad tweeted an inquiry has been ordered to find out the reason behind the technical problem and strict action will be taken against those found responsible for it. Though the board declared the results on Friday at 1pm, as soon as the link went live, it crashed as lakhs tried to log in. The board’s technical department made available two more links around 7pm. These too were inaccessible till late on Friday. “There were complaints of sale of data obtained from us for commercial purposes such as private classes. We were also concerned about the safety of data on girl students.

Her family rushed her to hospital, where she breathed her last on Thursday night. On Friday, the girl’s father alleged that his daughter had taken the extreme step as the neighbourhood youth was harassing her. But preliminary investigation by police revealed that the youngsters were in a relationship. Sankalp Sharma, SSP, Budaun told TOI, “Both families belong to the same community and live in the same locality. After coming to know about the girl’s death, we questioned the youth and his family members. The mobile records and conversation on social media confirmed that the couple was in touch for quite a while. Locals also confirmed that they had often seen the two together but were not aware of any harassment of the girl. It was also confirmed that both families had an argument but no one lodged any complaint.” The SSP said the deceased's father had so far not lodged any official complaint but if he did, an FIR would be registered and an investigation conducted in the matter. “The body of the girl was handed over to her family after autopsy on Friday,” Sharma added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/as-families-quarrel-over-affair-badaun-girl-21-kills-self/articleshow/84484478.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Offline CET for FYJC could be held on August 21, registrations start next week||MUMBAI: The state board is likely to conduct the optional Common Entrance Test (CET) for admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) on August 21. The exam is expected to be conducted in an offline format and the online application process will start from Monday, said board chairman Dinkar Patil on Friday. CET will be given preference during FYJC admissions (first round); CET scores will override SSC results in admissions. A detailed notification on the exam topics will be released by next week. While students from the state board will not be charged for the exam, those from other boards would need to pay an exam fee of Rs 178, said Patil. A link will be made available on the MSBSHSE website which will direct the student to a different online portal. “The state board students would be asked their exam seat numbers and once they submit that data, a window with all their details will open. The window will prompt the student to answer a question on whether he or she wishes to opt for the optional CET examination. Whatever option the student chooses, the board will get the data directly. As for the non-state board students, a separate set of instructions will be issued soon,” said Patil.  Nidhun Nair, a student of Powai English school who scored 93.4% in SSC, said: “As CET gets priority in college admissions, I am focusing on it.” Many high scorers, though, want the state to treat SSC scores on par with CET’s for admissions. “My daughter scored 91.4%. Whether she will do better in CET is our worry,” said Madhurima Rane, whose child studies in a Vasai school. In Mumbai, most seats in get filled top-rung colleges in the first round. Students from international boards who have had physical exams and scored well too said they should be considered on par with CET top scorers. Dr Sangeeta Bhandari, whose daughter secured an aggregate of 97.2% in a Cambridge board school said there is no clarity on part of the state on students who have scored marks after appearing for a physical exam. Students from ICSE schools who have not opted for mathematics and science will also be at a disadvantage, as the 100-mark CET will have 25 questions each from English, maths, science and social science. The state board syllabus will be used as reference. An ICSE student had filed a petition against this. Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College, said even if a section of high scorers opts out of CET for some genuine reason, there will be no uniformity. “How will merit lists be drawn with no uniformity?” she asked. On the assessment methodology, Aparna Roy, principal of BSM English Medium School in Thane, said, “Students may have fared badly in Class IX but many tend to do well in Class X. CET thus is the best option.” Better results across boards may impact cut-offs, say principals. Rajendra Shinde, principal, St Xavier’s College, said admissions, if based on SSC scores alone, will see cut-offs rise 2-3%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-offline-cet-for-fyjc-could-be-held-on-aug-21-registrations-start-next-wk/articleshow/84487497.cms||Yogita Rao

Mumbai took the fourth position in the state with a pass percentage of 99.96%. Konkan topped all nine divisions with a 100% success rate while Nagpur was at the bottom with 99.84%. The results could not be accessed for six hours as the board website crashed and even alternate links were hard to access. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad tweeted that an inquiry has been launched into the crash and strict action will be taken against those found responsible. With no exams, 22,384 or 98% of the schools in the state registered a 100% success rate. Among students, 957 across the state scored a perfect 100%. Last year, with one paper, Geography, cancelled due to the onset of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, 242 students bagged the perfect score. In pre-pandemic 2019, merely 20 students in the state had managed a 100% result. In Mumbai, 32 students secured 100% this academic year compared with the previous year’s two and none in 2019. Latur had the maximum number of students at 278 who got the perfect score this year, followed by Aurangabad with 261. Meanwhile, the optional Common Entrance Test (CET), which will be given preference for Class XI admissions, is expected to be held on August 21. Other boards such as CBSE and CISCE are likely to declare their Class X results by this month-end. On the results, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) chairperson Dinkar Patil said collection of data on students who could not be assessed due to migration or are untraceable will continue at the divisional level. So, while all the 16.6 lakh registered students, both regular and repeat, have been promoted, only the results of 16.5 lakh students were ready till Friday. “Schools can update the students’ assessment criteria and hand it over to the concerned divisional board,” said Patil. Students were assessed on a 50:50 formula for class IX and X. Language papers Hindi, Marathi along with mathematics saw a success rate of 99.8% while English, Science and Social Sciences had a 99.9% pass rate in the state. Distinctions in the state jumped over 100% this year. More than 1 lakh students secured more than 90%. Another 1.3 lakh students got 85-90%. Around 1.85 lakh students got 80-85% and 2.3 lakh 75-80%. In Mumbai, more students (1.6 lakh) students got more than 85% than distinction (1.1 lakh). Mumbai division had the maximum students at 3.5 lakh. Raigad secured the highest spot in Mumbai division with a 99.7% success rate, followed by Mumbai (Suburbs 1) and Mumbai (Suburbs 2) with 99.4% and 99.2%, respectively. Palghar was ahead of Thane (99.3%) with 99.4% Mumbai shared its success with Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik and Latur. Amravati was on number two slot with 99.98% followed by Kolhapur on number three with 99.92%. The SSC results are final and students will not be allowed revaluation. Schools have been told to preserve the tabulated marks for at least 18 months.

The report was released on Friday by Society of Pollution and Environmental Conservation Scientists (SPECS), an organization working for clean water in Doon since 1990, as part of its ‘Jan Jan Ko Sudh Jal Abhiyan’. The hardness of water (measured by the concentration of dissolved minerals like Calcium and Magnesium) at many places in Doon turned out to be between 326 - 538 mg/l, making it unfit for drinking. “While the safe limit for hardness in water according to the government is upto 300, the norms have not been revised in a long time and the limit should ideally be at 180,” said Brij Mohan Sharma, secretary of SPECS. Many localities had excess residual chlorine, the standard value of which is 0.2 mg/l. The area near the district magistrate’s camp office recorded a residual chlorine of 1.2 mg/l, while at Rajpur Road near the secretariat, it was 1 mg/l. Dalanwala and Dilaram Chowk had 1 mg/l residual chlorine while Kaulagarh road and Neshvilla road recorded 0.4 mg/l. Dobhalwala, Indresh Nagar, Tapovan Enclave, Jogiwala, Lakhi Bagh, Bhandari Bagh, Saraswati Vihar and Ajabpur all recorded the standard level of residual chlorine. In 49 of the areas from where samples were collected, like Indra Nagar Colony and Sherbagh Road, residual chlorine was absent altogether. Meanwhile, fecal coliform, the safe concentration of which is 0 MPN or 100 colony forming units per milliliters, was found at 36 stations, including Sapera Basti, Adhoiwala, Nagal, Nagal Hatnala road and Tarla Nagal within safe limits. “While water filters installed at many homes make the quality of drinking water fit to consume, a majority of households cannot afford those,” Sharma added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/water-at-many-localities-in-doon-unfit-for-drinking-report/articleshow/84484457.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||India||PM to CMs: Rise in cases in states cause of grave concern||NEW DELHI: Amid apprehensions of a third wave, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said despite experts giving positive signals due to the downward trend in infections, the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in states like Maharashtra and Kerala are a cause of grave worry. The PM reinforced the need to stay focused on the strategy of "test, track, treat and teeka (vaccination)" while putting special focus on micro-containment zones to prevent the possibility of a third wave in his interaction with CMs of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Kerala. "You all are aware that similar trends were seen in January-February before the second wave as well. Therefore, the apprehension naturally increases that the situation may become difficult if it is not brought under control soon. It is very important that the states where cases are increasing take proactive measures to prevent any possibility of the third wave," Modi said. "We have to remind people repeatedly that corona has not disappeared from among us. The pictures that are emerging from most of the places after unlocking add to this concern even more," the PM said. He asked the authorities to be "alert and strict" to prevent crowding in public places. The PM said during the last week 80% cases as well as 84% deaths were reported from the states present in the meeting. Modi said that initially experts believed that states where the second wave originated will see normalisation first. However, increasing numbers in Kerala and Maharashtra are worrying. Earlier this week, Modi had interacted with CMs from the North-East. "The way the number of cases had come down in most of the states of the country provided some psychological relief. In view of this downward trend, experts were also expecting that the country would be completely out of the second wave soon. But the increasing number of cases in some states still remains worrying," he added. Modi shared that experts say that the possibility of mutation in the coronavirus and the risk of new variants increase if cases continue to rise for a longer time. "Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to take effective steps against corona to prevent the third wave," he asserted. Sharing details of measures to bolster infrastructure, the PM shared with the CMs that out of the 332 PSA oxygen plants that have been allocated in the six states, 53 have been commissioned. He asked the states to get the work on setting up the plants done in a mission mode within 15-20 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-to-cms-rise-in-cases-in-states-cause-of-grave-concern/articleshow/84489121.cms||---
---||Agra||Five sent to jail for ‘pro-Pak’ slogans in Agra||AGRA: Police in Agra on Friday arrested five persons for allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans during a protest rally organised by Samajwadi Party (SP) in the city a day before. Soon after the arrest of Pankaj Singh, Chandra Prakash, Deepak Valmiki, Madhukar Singh and Aarif Khan, the opposition party said that they were never its members. Meanwhile, Yogi Adityanath latched on to the arrests to slam the SP. “One can assume what kind of security blueprint the SP leaders have about the state,” Yogi said while addressing BJP workers in Lucknow. The FIR was filed after videos in which the men were purportedly seen raising Pakistan ‘zindabad’ slogans were shared in social media platforms. Superintendent of police (SP) of Agra, Botre Rohan Pramod, said all the five men have now been sent to jail. Apart from the five men, 25 unidentified people, who were present in the protest meeting, have also been booked. Police have invoked IPC sections 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 147 (rioting), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) against all the 30 accused. They were also booked under the Epidemic and Diseases Act. When contacted, SP’s Agra (city) president Wajid Nisar distanced himself and the party from the alleged incident and claimed that those held were not from his party. “This is an attempt by the opposition to defame the SP,” he said, adding that some anti-social elements had raised the slogans while the protest rally was being taken out. “I wrote a letter to the authorities immediately after the video went viral and urged them to take action against such people,” Nisar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/5-sent-to-jail-for-pro-pak-slogans-in-agra/articleshow/84482017.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: ‘JMB men planned crime for funds’||KOLKATA: Investigators, who had questioned Lalu Sen, the linkman for the JMB members arrested on Thursday, claimed the accused were desperate to “collect funds” and could have been plotting a crime. Sen’s interrogation and the contents of his seized laptop indicated he, along with the three arrested accused, Naziur Rahaman Pavel (22), Mikail Khan (30) Rabiul Islam (22), had taken orders from top JMB leader Anwar Ali alias Ansar Ali Hridoy, suspected to be involved in a string of robberies in Bangladesh. Investigators suspect Hridoy, who was jailed in Bangladesh two years ago, siphoned off a part of the money to India for his business and to run a cross-border human trafficking gang. “Hridoy and Hafizul Sheikh Sakal were JMB’s fund-raisers and their involvement indicated they had some plans to raise funds in Bengal by committing crimes. Sen happened to be Hridoy’s trusted aide. We have found several documents in the seized laptop that indicated his link with Hridoy,” said a STF source. Sen was married to a local woman in Bangladesh. “He failed Class-IX, after which he left studies. He had an import and export business and visited Bangladesh many times,” said an officer. “Lalu visited Hridoy in jail. In Dhaka, Lalu got involved in the trafficking racket. He had an affair with a Bangladeshi national’s wife, whom he later married. Some say she is a lawyer but it’s not confirmed,” an STF officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jmb-men-planned-crime-for-funds/articleshow/84486777.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||After Pawar & Modi meet, NCP clarifies no threat to state government||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A meeting between Sharad Pawar and PM Narendra Modi for an hour on Saturday on the veteran Maratha’s reservations about changes to the Banking Amendments Act set off serious speculation, leading the Nationalist Congress Party to clarify that they can never align with BJP. The closed-door discussion, which came in the wake of squabbling among Maharashtra’s ruling coalition members— Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena —triggered political chatter suggesting hidden motives behind the wily satrap calling on the BJP leader. A recent one-on-one by Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray with Modi had raised a similar storm, and was dubbed an attempt by Sena to send a message to MVA allies about its willingness to explore options. While the PMO tweeted about the meeting with a photograph of the two leaders, Pawar wrote on the micro-blogging site, “Met the Hon’ble Prime Minister of our country Narendra Modi. Had a discussion on various issues of national interest.” The speculations generated by the meeting was serious enough for NCP spokesman Nawab Malik to call a press conference in Mumbai and debunk reports that the Pawar-Modi meet had implications for the state government. Malik said NCP and BJP were like two ends of a river which can never meet because they are ideologically opposite. He also said Pawar had informed CM Thackeray as well as Congress leaders about the proposed meeting a few days ago. “It was a scheduled meeting. CM Uddhav Thackeray and AICC general secretary H K Patil were also aware about the meeting. Prima facie, Pawar knocked at the doors of the PM to express concern over amendments to the banking regulation act and creation of the ministry of cooperation led by Amit Shah. Pawar has written a comprehensive letter to the PM,” Malik said. “First Pawar spoke to the PM on the anti-bank amendments, but then PM felt it will be better if there is personal discussion. Accordingly, Pawar met Modi,” Malik added. Later, Pawar tweeted a letter he wrote to the PM about the amendment in the Banking Act. “I wish to point out certain inconsistencies and the resulting legal inefficacy of normative provisions of the Act that are in conflict, most specifically with the 97th Constitutional Amendment, State Cooperative Societies Acts and with the Cooperative Principles.” “I reiterated in the letter that the aims and objectives of the amended Act are well-intentioned and many provisions are necessary. Erring board and management must definitely be acted upon strictly and the depositors’ interests should be protected, but at the same time it should be ensured that while doing so, the cooperative principles laid down in the Constitution are not sacrificed at the altar of over-zealous regulation,” Pawar tweeted. NCP also said Pawar expressed his reservations about the newly-constituted cooperation ministry headed by Amit Shah, arguing that the cooperatives sector was a state subject. “The NCP can never join hands with BJP because both parties are ideologically different. The BJP and NCP are two ends of a river that cannot come together as long as there is water in the river,” Malik said. In his letter to Modi, Pawar pointed out that while incorporation, regulation and winding up of cooperative societies have been earmarked as state subjects, the RBI on the basis of newly-introduced impugned provisions, can directly intervene into the functioning of the cooperative banks. “In my opinion, the new provisions are unconstitutional and ultra vires, for having been passed without legislative competence,” Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-pawar-modi-meet-ncp-clarifies-no-threat-to-state-govt/articleshow/84513834.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Olympian race-walker headed to Tokyo, this time as coach||DEHRADUN: Ace race walker and Olympian-turned-coach Gurmeet Singh will be part of the Indian contingent to the Tokyo Olympics after an official intimation from the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) brought weeks of uncertainty for the famed athlete to an end. Singh has trained race walkers Priyanka Goswami (UP) and Sandeep Kumar (Haryana) who will compete at the games. Singh’s travel plans remained unconfirmed until earlier this month since he had got delayed in submitting his passport to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), TOI had earlier reported. “My hopes are pinned on my students and I’m sure they will be able to secure a medal for the country,” said the 36-year-old who hails from a village near Bajpur in Udham Singh Nagar. Both Goswami and Kumar are national record holders in the 20-km race walking event which they achieved in the National Open Race Walking Championships held in Ranchi in February 2021. Singh will be heading to the Olympics for the third time. He had earlier participated in the 2012 and 2016 editions of the Summer Olympics where he competed in race-walking. In 2019, he decided to hang his boots and instead focus on upcoming talent. Singh said he knows first-hand how important a coach is in shaping an athlete’s journey. “My coach Dr Ramakrishna Gandhi passed away in 2017. After that, I tried to continue my athletic career with other coaches but it didn’t work out,” said Singh, who is also an athletics coach at SAI (Sports Authority of India) Bengaluru. Singh’s toughest challenge as a coach came during the pandemic. With athletic tracks out of bounds in the country during the pandemic last year and Tokyo Olympics a few months away, keeping the players motivated was an uphill task. “The outbreak last year disrupted our practice and dampened spirits. As a coach, I had to ensure players remained motivated enough. We kept in touch through calls throughout the day so I could keep track of their body weight and practice. Athletes made sure they ran for practise wherever they could, in the fields, on the roads,” Singh told TOI. Recalling Singh’s illustrious career as an athlete, secretary of the Uttarakhand Athletics Association, KJS Kalsi, said, “Singh was an exceptional talent. He missed out on winning a medal at the 2012 London and Rio 2016 Olympics by a small margin. Young athletes are fortunate to have a coach like him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-olympian-race-walker-headed-to-tokyo-this-time-as-coach/articleshow/84484491.cms||Mohammad Anab

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi was hearing a public interest litigation filed by S Saravanan, an advocate from Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district who said that several buildings in the town were constructed with violations due to non-implementation of the circular. The petitioner stated that the circular issued by the commissioner of town and country planning department prescribes the operational guidelines for issuing construction continuance certificate (CCC) and completion certificate (CC) for the buildings. As per Rule 20 of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019, obtaining the above said certificates are mandatory in case of new construction or reconstruction. He stated that several buildings were constructed with violations and no such certificates were issued for buildings constructed in Kovilpatti town. He further stated that pursuant to an earlier order by the principal seat, the commissioner of municipal administration had issued a circular in 2019. Since no steps were taken on his representation, the petitioner moved HC Madurai bench seeking strict implementation of the 2019 circular across the state especially in Kovilpatti town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-implement-2019-circular-on-encroachments/articleshow/84486786.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Salary row at Air India engineering unit||KOLKATA: Trouble is brewing at the aircraft engineering unit of Air India following the management’s decision to slash 20% of the gross salaries in addition to the 40% cut in allowance last year. Neither AI nor any of its subsidiaries other than Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) has been asked to go in for the second pay cut. In the AI engineering unit at Kolkata airport, a section of contractual staff protested on Friday. More are set to join following widespread discontent over being singled out for the pay cut, apparently to make statutory payments like PF, gratuity and TDS through this section of staff not entitled to any benefit. Following the agitation, sources said the management was contemplating restoring the salaries for employees with pay of up to Rs 50,000 a month. The engineering base in Kolkata carries out major aircraft overhaul for Airbus A-319 aircraft including a 12-year check. The auxiliary power unit that is also located in the city is currently non-functional due to the lack of spares. Though the current agitation has not affected service and maintenance schedules, officials fear it could have an impact if the workers resort to work-to-rule or tool-down. AI refused comment on the matter, stating that it was a different company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salary-row-at-ai-engineering-unit/articleshow/84486838.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Ruling herself out, she said her party will not contest the forthcoming bypoll. “What is there to fight in this election? There is no point in fighting an election which is taking place primarily to soften the false pride of some leaders. We will not fight the election where egos and revenge politics are being played,” she said. She said if an election is held, it should benefit people. “Is it going to fetch jobs? Is it going to help farmers,” she wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wont-contest-huzurabad-byelection/articleshow/84487530.cms||---

People have not learned any lesson even after a severe fire accident at Madurai’s Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple a few years back, said a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi.  "The authorities, unmindful of the heritage value of the temples, had licensed and leased out temple property as well as verandas of temples to traders to carry on trading activity by selling articles which are unrelated and unconnected with the temple and the worshipping public. These shops have virtually become shopping centres, if not, shopping malls.” Also, scores of temples in the state do not have enough funds even for one pooja a day, said the judges, adding, “such is the sorry state of affairs.” The HR&CE department alone is not to be blamed for the current status, as there are several persons to be blamed for such a situation, said the judges. Lessees of temple are one of the main persons who are to be blamed for the temples being left without sufficient funds. Several cases are filed before courts by the lessees claiming that they were entitled to continue indefinitely in temple property paying a paltry sum as a rent or license fee, the bench said. The court made the scathing observations while disposing of a public interest writ petition filed by one K Suresh, vice-president of Dharma Sena. He sought daily poojas and rituals as per agamas at Adhikesava Perumal temple in Kanyakumari district. As for his plea that a particular sect of people alone have to perform particular rituals as per the agamas, the judges said the petitioner's remedy lies elsewhere and not by way of a writ petition in the court. The bench said, “therefore, this court cannot issue a direction as sought for by the petitioner,” adding that if he had materials as to how the temple had to be preserved, restored and maintained, he could share the details with authorities. People have not learned any lesson even after a severe fire accident at Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple a few years back, said a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mindless-leases-have-left-tn-temples-in-penury-hc/articleshow/84486843.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The ED is probing the Rs 750-crore loan availed by Jarandeshwar Sahakari Sugar Karkhana (Jarandeshwar SSK) in Satara, controlled by Pawar. Finding questionable transactions involving more sugar factories, it has collected documents for examination. These mills were bought with the loan availed by Jarandeshwar SSK. The agency is already examining some other auctions similar to Jarandeshwar SSK, which had defaulted on a Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) loan, after which the bank had auctioned it to recover the loan money. Pawar was then holding an influential position in MSCB, and the mill was auctioned below market rate to a company controlled by him. Later, four banks, including the Pune District Central Cooperative Bank ( DCCB), gave Rs 750 crore to the mill without examining its ownership details and then the loan money was allegedly diverted for purposes other than those declared to the banks. Ajit Pawar was one of the directors in the Pune DCCB. During the investigation of the loan money trail, the ED learnt that part of the money was used to purchase some other mills. It is examining these details and may summon those connected with these sugar mills. In the MSCB money laundering case, the ED is probing the Rs 750 crore loan granted by the banks to Jarandeshwar SSK. The Jarandeshwar SSK was purchased by Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd. It immediately leased Jarandeshwar SSK to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd. A part of the funds utilized towards purchase of the mill was received from Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd, a company related to Ajit Pawar and his wife, the ED had said. The ED stated that Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd and Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd are only a proxy owner of Jarandeshwar SSK, and actual control is with Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd. The ED summoned the office-bearers of the four banks for their statements. It will also soon summon the office- bearer of the sugar mills which were purchased after diverting the loan money. It was alleged that MSCB officials sanctioned loans to sick sugar mills or karkhanas and on default auctioned these assets. The MSCB officials ensured that their relatives or close associates managed to buy the mills at auctions at throwaway prices. Recently, the ED attached the Jarandeshwar SSK sugar mill of Ajit Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-expands-ajit-sugar-co-probe-to-more-mills/articleshow/84513844.cms||Vijay V Singh

They were promised jobs near Jammu by their contractor. But, when the bus screeched to a halt in the morning of July 7, the workers found themselves standing at a height of 12,000ft amid mountains, some laden with snow while others barren-- way past Jammu. Their contractor told the stunned lot that they were near a power plant in Padum, about 250-km ahead of Kargil. He left with a promise of work, accommodation and food at the under-construction power plant, but never came back. The 30 men -- six of them above 60 years -- spent the next 10 days doing menial jobs to arrange food and slept in a dharamshala in freezing weather, made lethal by icy winds. In between, they continued to make appeals to the administration for rescue. They were finally rescued on Friday. But as they reached Delhi in a flight, some of them had fallen ill and were taken to a hospital. Most others complained of shortness of breath. One of the workers, Santram, 60, said, “We had left Bijnor for Jammu on July 6. Our local contractor had hired us from Ravali village. He assured us jobs in Jammu, but took us to Padum city. “When we got up, we were 20km ahead of Padum city close to an under-construction power house. Weather conditions were extreme. Contractor dumped us there and fled as he couldn’t arrange the jobs. We started falling sick. Arranging food was very difficult there too. Later on we contacted Bijnor MLA and authorities. They helped us out.” Another rescued labourer, Deepak, said, “We were brought to Leh from Padum city with the help of a travel agency. Later we reached Delhi through flight on Friday. We are happy and feeling safe now.” From Delhi, they were sent back to their villages in Bijnor. According to BJP leader Aishwarya Chaudhary, who played a key role in the rescue, “These men contacted us and narrated their ordeal. We spoke to the administration and arranged the rescue.” “One labourer is still missing. Efforts are going on to search for him in Jammu,” said Chaudhary. Bijnor’s district magistrate Umesh Mishra confirmed that the labourers have reached their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/stranded-for-10-days-in-kargil-hills-30-up-labourers-rescued-brought-to-delhi-in-a-flight/articleshow/84484577.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Ahmedabad||Congress has fair chance of gaining power in Gujarat: Manish Tewari||GANDHINAGAR: Senior Congress leader Manish Tewari on Friday said the NDA government at the Centre has gone “bankrupt” due to the massive “accumulated fiscal deficit” of Rs 32 lakh crore for the fiscals 2019-20 and 2020-21. He also alleged “gross mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic by the central government and the BJP government in Gujarat,” which led to the loss of lives in large numbers from the coronavirus. On Gujarat politics, Tewari said his party had a fair chance in the 2022 assembly elections here due to the mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent vaccination campaign. He said the appointment of the state in-charge, unit chief and leader of opposition in Gujarat is the prerogative of the Congress chief. While state in-charge Rajiv Satav died of post-Covid complications, Gujarat Congress chief Amit Chavda and leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani resigned from their posts after the party was drubbed in the local elections in February this year. “The UPA government, in its 10 years of rule, worked hard to reduce the fiscal deficit. However, the accumulated fiscal deficit for the NDA regime in 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 is Rs 32 lakh crore. This means the government has gone bankrupt. This government is on the verge of bankruptcy. The UPA government took 27 crore people out of poverty in 10 years, and the NDA in seven years forced 23 crore of these to sink back into poverty,” he said. Tewari said the Union government, which has collected Rs 25 lakh crore as excise duty on petrol and diesel, is trying to run the government from this money as it failed to expand the economy. “During the UPA government, the average price of crude oil was around Rs 100 per barrel while petrol used to sell at Rs 50. However, under NDA rule, the average price of crude oil has been Rs 50 per barrel but petrol is selling at Rs 100. Inflation has broken the back of citizens. This (economy in tatters) is not just due to Covid-19, but it started with demonetization and faulty implementation of GST,” the Congress leader said. He also attacked the Centre over the sedition law, the need for which was questioned by the Supreme Court recently, alleging that the Modi dispensation was labelling legitimate dissenters “anti-national”, “seditious” and even “downright traitors”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tewari-congress-has-fair-chance-of-gaining-power-in-gujarat/articleshow/84486849.cms||---
---||Pune||87% breakthrough cases test +ve for Delta variant, finds NIV study||MUMBAI/PUNE: In the largest study done so far in India to understand why people got Covid-19 despite taking one or two vaccine shots, scientists from Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) found a simple answer: B.1.617.2 (Delta variant). Genomic analysis found Delta in 87% of the 677 throat and nasal swabs of patients from 17 states and UTs. While 592 of them had taken two doses, 85 had taken only one dose before getting infected with the SARS2 virus. The study, led by director Dr Priya Abraham and senior scientists Dr Pragya Yadav, also found that less than 10% of the 677 patients needed hospitalisation, alluding to the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing a severe infection. Three patients, who had taken both the shots, died, but their age and existing medical conditions were not mentioned. Over 20% of these patients had comorbidities such as diabetes, hyptertension or chronic lung, heart or kidney conditions. The genomic analysis showed the Delta variant’s presence in the majority of the samples, but there also were other variants such as Alpha, Kappa, Delta AY.1 (known as the Delta-plus variant in samples from MP and Rajasthan) and Delta AY.2. The occurrence of Covid in vaccinated people is called a ‘breakthrough infection.’ The NIV study, which is in the preprint stage of publication, proves that the Delta variant -- first isolated in Vidarbha in October 2020 and now acknowledged as the cause for the massive second wave -- caused breakthrough infections. Dr Yadav said, “At the moment, the Delta variant is causing infections throughout the world, but the most important point of our study is that vaccination offers more than 99% protection against death even in the presence of the highly transmissible and more virulent Delta strain.” While 53 samples for the study, conducted between March and June, were collected from Maharashtra, the highest number was 181 from Karnataka and the lowest number was 10, from West Bengal. Genetic sequencing was performed on each positive sample to find the Delta variant. “This study indicated that a majority of the clinical cases in the breakthrough were infected with the Delta variant and only 9.8% cases required hospitalization, while fatality was observed in only 0.4% cases. This clearly suggests that the vaccination does provide reduction in hospital admission and mortality,” concluded the study. Most patients in this study were young -- the median age was 44 (31-56), more were men (65.1%) and 71% of them were symptomatic, with one or more symptoms. Fever (69%) was the most common symptom, followed by bodyache, including headache and nausea (56%), cough (45%) and sore throat (37%). The researchers said breakthrough Covid-19 infections have been reported from various countries. “It appears the current Covid-19 vaccines are disease-modifying in nature wherein mild or less severe infections are expected to occur in vaccinated individuals,” said the study. Vaccination prevents severe disease, hospitalization and death, as is being seen in the UK, Israel and Canada. The NIV doctors said continuous monitoring of breakthrough infections is important. “Such monitoring will help us understand the need to adequately tweak the available vaccines and also develop new vaccines with enhanced potential to protect against variant strains of SARS-CoV-2,” said Dr Yadav||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/87-breakthrough-cases-test-ve-for-delta-variant-finds-niv-study/articleshow/84487545.cms||Malathy Iyer

Kings who ruled from Rachakonda patronised Bhoginis, royal courtesans, who were talented in singing and dancing. Nehru Tribal Museum director Dyavanapalli Satyanarayana said, “Bhoga Mandapam, which survived till date atop a hill in Rachakonda, was constructed by Sarvagna Singa Bhupala, the Padmanayaka king of Rachakonda who ruled almost whole of Telangana during the last decades of 14th century.” He added, “Bhoginis performed dances in Rachakonda on the occasion of Vasantotsavam festival, similar to Holi. A jaali (window) sculpted in black basalt stone is still found strewn in the premises of the temple of Venu Gopaala on Gurraalagutta in Rachakonda. Narratives of Bammera Potana and Singa Bhupala make it clear that Singa patronised Bhogini, constructed Bhogini Mandapam in her honour in Rachakonda and deputed her to perform several dance forms in the Mandapam.” Singa Bhupala’s figure was engraved, in regard, in a cavern on the back wall of the Mandapam built abutting a cave formed under huge rocks on a hillock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/conserve-14th-century-mandapam-experts/articleshow/84487547.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Dehradun||Kumbh fake test ‘scam’: No probe team has completed its probe||HARIDWAR: More than a month after the Kumbh fake test scam was unveiled, not a single probe team has managed to complete its investigation in the multi-crore scam. TOI had first reported on June 14 how a third-party agency, Max Corporate Services along with its associates Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lalchandani Labs, were found to have conducted over a lakh fake tests in Kumbh. A week before the TOI’s report, the then CM Tirath Singh Rawat had asked DM Haridwar to investigate the matter. Soon after TOI’s report, the chief development officer (CDO) of Haridwar was also asked to share a detailed investigation report with the government in 15 days’ time. A special investigation team (SIT) was also constituted. However, despite multiple agencies probing the multi-crore scam, not a single agency has so far submitted its report in the matter. While the SIT officials claim that every time they call anyone for interrogation, a new name emerges in the case and hence, the interrogation is still going on, CDO’s office said that they have sought 10 more days to wind up the probe. Saurabh Gaharwar, CDO Haridwar, who is conducting a probe in the fake covid testing 'scam', told TOI, “Initially, we were to complete the probe report within 15 days but during the investigation, we came across several crucial findings that took time to cross-check. Around 25,000 test reports are yet to be confirmed and we intend to verify all the numbers within a few days, following which, a report will be submitted to the district magistrate.” On the other hand, the SIT officials claim that every time they call anyone for interrogation, a new name emerges in the case. Rakesh Rawat, circle officer, SIT head, told TOI, “We are recording the statements of all people related to the case before making any arrest. We are trying to collect concrete evidence against the accused.” According to Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar’s office, his team has made calls to more than 60,000 people whose contact numbers were shared by the labs. Meanwhile, the CDO’s team has interrogated staff of the third party agencies to labs and two other firms — Delphia Laboratories and Invex Health Private Limited — whose involvement was found in the case. “We have also interrogated over seven senior officials from district administration, health department and the Kumbh Mela health administration. Our investigation is still underway,” said an official on the condition of anonymity. Earlier, a detailed investigation — running into 1,600 pages — had revealed that at least 1 lakh test reports were forged by a private agency. In one instance, a single phone number was used to register over 50 people while one antigen test kit (which has an exclusive number and is meant for single use) was shown to have tested 700 samples. “Addresses and names were fictional. Almost 530 samples were taken from ‘House Number 5’ in Haridwar. Is it possible for a house to have over 500 residents? Bizarre addresses have been given — House number 56 Aligarh, House number 76 Mumbai,” an official, who is part of the investigation, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-fake-test-scam-no-probe-team-has-completed-its-probe/articleshow/84484612.cms||Ishita Mishra

It has decided to increase the freight on board (FOB) price for skimmed milk powder by Rs 20 per kg to Rs 200 per kg from the existing Rs 180 per kg given to the GCMMF, the state government said in a statement. The decision came following the requests of assistance made by the milk unions associated with GCMMF. Terming the decision ‘timely’ and ‘sensitive’ GCMMF chairman Shamalbhai Patel said that the move would maintain the price of skimmed milk powder across India and stop Gujarat milk producers from losing an estimated Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 crore. He also said that the step taken by the state government would help member unions to maintain the procurement price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-to-provide-export-assistance-to-gcmmf-for-smp/articleshow/84486864.cms||---

It asked the Centre to take steps to quickly vaccinate those below 18 years of age once the trials are over. “Let the trials be done, otherwise it would be a disaster if vaccines are administered without trials, that too in case of children. Once trials are over, you quickly apply (vaccines) to children. The whole country is waiting,” a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh remarked after the Centre said clinical trials for this group were on the verge of completion and that a policy would be formed and children would be vaccinated when experts give permission. The court is hearing a PIL seeking immediate vaccination of those in the 12-17 age group on the ground that there are fears a likely third wave of Covid could affect them more. Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, said pharmaceutical company Zydus Cadila, which was developing DNA vaccines, had concluded its clinical trial for the 12-18 years age group and, subject to the statutory permission, the same might be available for use in near future. The Centre submitted in its affidavit that vaccination was the top-most priority of the government and all efforts were being made to achieve 100% vaccination in the shortest possible time, keeping the available resources in mind. It added that on May 12, Drug Controller General of India had permitted Bharat Biotech to conduct clinical trials on the healthy volunteers between 2 and 18 years for Covaxin. Senior advocate Kailash Vasudev, representing the petitioner, said vaccines were being administered to the children of 8-18 years in various countries and the court might ask the authorities to conclude the process in a time-bound manner. The bench, however, said there couldn’t be a time-bound schedule for a research and posted the matter for September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/disastrous-to-give-covid-vax-to-children-without-trials-hc/articleshow/84486881.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The bullet was lodged between the patient’s urinary bladder and rectum. The surgery was done laparoscopically since an open surgery, doctors said, could have been risky due to his obesity. Nepal Chowdhury (53), a Malda resident, is recuperating well after the three-hour surgery was conducted on Friday. Chowdhury was chatting near a temple near his English Bazar home on July 11 evening, when two motorcycle-borne men shot at him from a close range. He was taken to Malda Medical College, from where he was referred to IPGMER (SSKM Hospital). “The bullet had pierced through the patient’s seventh segment of the liver, the right kidney and large bowl before settling between the rectum and the urinary bladder above the terminal part of the spinal cord,” said general surgery assistant professor Seraj Ahmed. Three doctors from the general surgery department — Shamita Chatterjee (professor), Pritin Bera (RMO) and Ahmed — conducted the surgery to remove the bullet. “My brother’s condition was so critical that we thought that we might lose him. The care and medical attention that he received at SSKM Hospital has renewed our trust in medical institutes,” said his elder brother, Gopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bullet-removed-from-140kg-malda-man-at-city-hospital/articleshow/84486855.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi was hearing a public interest litigation filed by M Jothi Basu, a resident of Madurai district. The petitioner stated that the Supreme Court in a verdict directed all the states in the country to constitute state-level and district-level police complaints authority in order to look into complaints against the higher officials in the police department. As per the directions, the head of the state level complaints authority shall be chosen by the state government out of the panel of names proposed by the chief justice. However, the state had constituted the authority under the leadership of secretary to the home department with director general of police and additional director general of police (law and order) as the members. Similarly, the state had constituted the authority with the district collector as a chairperson and the superintendent of police and senior most additional superintendent of police as its members. Hence, he moved the HC Madurai bench challenging the constitution of the authorities and sought to reconstitute the same in lines with Supreme Court directions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/petition-in-hc-challenges-police-plaints-authority/articleshow/84486851.cms||---

Two women who were at home at the time of the incident escaped unhurt. If the tenants in the ground floor of the building had not vacated the house a few weeks ago, the mishap would have turned into a major disaster. The incident occurred at the house of Hamza at Koonamthai in Kalamassery. His wife Khairunnisa and her daughter Shabna were in the first floor of the building when the incident occurred. The ground floor collapsed with a loud noise around 7am on Friday and the rest of the structure slanted onto the adjacent building. Residents rushed to the spot and rescued the women using a ladder through the adjacent building. Fire force personnel were alerted and skilled workers were brought in to scientifically demolish the building. Two adjacent buildings have also reportedly sustained severe damage. Fire force personal said that building was around 20 years old. Officials said that though the foundation of the building was weak, the rain seems to have triggered the collapse. Building was constructed with laterite stones and it must have got soaked in the continuous rain, sources said. Priya Babu, councillor of Kalamassery municipality, said that Hamza had gone to his shop in the early morning. “He and his wife were the only occupants of the house and their daughter who stays with her husband had come for a visit, a couple of days ago. The women in the house sustained superficial injuries as they fell when the building shook. They were moved to a relative’s house. Those who were living in the adjacent houses have been moved to the anganwadi here,” said Babu. Station officer of Eloor fire and rescue station Ranjith Kumar said that the team had installed a supporting mechanism to the collapsed structure to avoid an immediate danger and later skilled workers were brought in to demolish the building. Meanwhile, water level increased in Muvattupuzha River as rains lashed across the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ground-floor-of-3-storey-house-collapses/articleshow/84484626.cms||---

Three other accused had to deposit a fine recently. According to police, Shekhawat's scuffle with other locals during the election campaign "disturbed the peace in the area". He was already served a notice under 107/116 CrPC by the city's Kotwali police. Notably, police in Muzaffarnagar had asked the local administration to impose a penalty on several people a few days ago after issuing notices under section 107/116 CrPC. Over a dozen suspects were then slapped notices with Rs 1 lakh each. Police sources said in every election hundreds of trouble-makers are identified and given notices, but never slapped with a fine. This is the first time that police have collected a fine from the offenders. A few weeks ago, three people had paid Rs 2 lakh each. They were also booked and sent to jail. On Friday, the accused had to deposit Rs 1 lakh at SDM's office. Senior superintendent of police, Abhishek Yadav, said, "The penalty was recovered under section 122-B CrPC from the offenders who were given notices under section 107/116 CrPC. More such offenders are yet to deposit fines. Action is being taken against them."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mnagar-admin-imposes-rs-1l-fine-on-locals-for-poll-violence/articleshow/84484615.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The deployment of the carrier group marks a significant step up in UK’s presence in the Indo-Pacific region with Britain’s foreign Secretary Dominic Raab describing it as the “start of a new era of defence cooperation with allies in India and the Indo-Pacific” region. The British High Commission in a statement said that the UK remains committed to “deepening diplomatic, economic and security ties with India and in the Indo-Pacific region. “It demonstrates both the UK’s support for the freedom of passage through vital trading routes and for a free, open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific,” the statement said. The UK is already investing significantly in the region by seeking ASEAN Dialogue Partner status, kicking off negotiations to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and rapidly progressing trade talks with Australia, New Zealand and India. This is the HMS Queen Elizabeth’s maiden operational deployment and the largest expeditionary force to depart from the UK in recent times. The strike group comprises six Royal Navy ships, a Royal Navy submarine, a US Navy destroyer and a frigate from the Netherlands aside from 32 aircraft and is manned by 3,700 sailors, aviators and marines. “The Carrier Strike Group deployment marks the start of a new era of defence cooperation with allies in India and the Indo-Pacific. By visiting 40 countries and working alongside our partners, the UK is standing up for democratic values, seizing new trading opportunities and tackling the shared threats we face together,” said foreign secretary Dominic Raab. Defence secretary Ben Wallace said that the UK carrier strike group deployment is a “major moment” for UK defence. “The group is sailing the Indian Ocean and will shortly conduct exercises with the Indian Navy, building on our already strong partnership with an important ally and friend,” said Wallace. The arrival of the carrier strike group follows the UK’s first International Liaison Officer joining the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region in Gurugram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/uk-carrier-group-to-hold-maritime-games-with-navy/articleshow/84487557.cms||---

Speaking at a meeting in Nirmal on Thursday, the minister said: “There will be no hesitation in dealing sternly with such people if they continue to repeatedly speak lies without recognising development the government has done.” What angered the minister was the speech that Revanth Reddy gave during his visit to Nirmal on July 12. Revanth particularly targeted Indrakaran, who is a TRS legislator from Nirmal, while speaking at a dharna organised against rising fuel prices. Without taking Revanth’s name, Indrakaran said some leaders were not able to see the development that had taken place. “They are deliberately spreading misinformation and telling lies to people. We know how to deal with such people,” he said. He said irresponsible statements were being made to derive political mileage. “We will give an appropriate answer at right time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-cut-off-tonguesspreading-lies-min/articleshow/84487550.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

District collector S Aneesh Sekhar presided over the meeting at which joint director of agriculture T Vivekanandan and other participated. TN Sugarcane Farmers Association president N Palanisamy said paddy was being procured at Rs 19.58 per kg at the TN Civil Supply Corporation’s procurement centres, but the wholesale mandis were selling at Rs 10 per kg. Hence, traders were purchasing it wholesale and selling it at TNCSC procurement centres, he said. As most of the paddy procurement centres were operated by people appointed during the previous government, the misappropriations continued, he said. The staff were receiving commissions of up to Rs 200 a bag, he alleged. In places like Kokilankulam, the VAO had certified that 10,000 bags had been harvested when not even a single grain was cultivated. Many VAOs had given multiple certificates to the same beneficiary, he said. Palanisamy said a committee comprising officials and leaders of farmers associations should be constituted to investigate. Meanwhile, JD agriculture Vivekanandan said the district had received 428 mm of rainfall and that the area of paddy cultivation would be enhanced in the district this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/farmers-allege-scam-in-paddy-procurement/articleshow/84486865.cms||---

The present market worth of the assets is over Rs 300 crore, sources said. The flat is in the name of Deshmukh’s wife Aarti, and 25 land parcels in Uran taluka, worth Rs 2.67 crore, are in the name of Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd. TOI was the first to report that the Deshmukh family controls Premier Port Links company that had purchased land from villagers in 2004, mostly by paying cash. The ED probe follows allegations that Deshmukh had asked now-dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month. The ED has also found a trail where tainted money (Rs 4.7 crore) was routed via a series of questionable transactions before it was shown as a donation to Deshmukh’s trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/laundering-case-ed-attaches-deshmukhs-worli-flat-uran-land/articleshow/84488190.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand high court nixes bail of man accused of abetting wife’s suicide||NAINITAL: The bail application of a man, who was booked for abetting the suicide of his wife in February, was on Friday nixed by the Uttarakhand high court. The accused, Sitarganj resident Arun Bairagi, is a drug addict, who, police claimed had forced his wife to have “sex chats” with others. The single judge bench of justice Ravindra Maithani, after taking into account the audio recording submitted by police asked, “Is it not a case wherein the deceased felt totally frustrated and found it difficult to continue existence? She ended her life.” The bench added that even though the credibility of the recording is to be tested, the facts before the court show that “it is not a fit case for bail, application needs to be dismissed”. An FIR was registered against Bairagi in February this year accusing him of abetting the suicide of his wife and of criminal intimidation. The couple was married for 11 years. The investigation revealed that Bairagi is a drug addict who used to beat his wife. This forced the woman to leave him and go to her parents’ house. However, a panchayat was later held where Bairagi apologized and his wife came to live with him. However, she committed suicide in February. During the probe, the investigating officer got hold of audio recording which allegedly revealed that the trauma and torture the woman went through. The deceased’s sister-in-law also gave a statement to the police alleging that Bairagi forced her to make the vulgar calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-nixes-bail-of-man-accused-of-abetting-wifes-suicide/articleshow/84484647.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Madurai||Open Madurai Maiya mandapam to public||MADURAI: The Mariamman teppakulam in Madurai, which is now brimming with water for the second consecutive year, has become a major attraction for people. Most people come here for leisure or for exercising and they said that that it would be attract more footfall if the district administration and HR and CE allowed people to visit the Maiya mandapam at the centre of the tank. The construction of a check dam across the Vaigai river bed in Madurai city enabled water to flow into the tank from the river in early 2019 and the supply has since been constant. This has resulted in the tank holding water throughout the year that attracts people in the evenings. S Thiagarajan of Anna Nagar said that he remembers going to the Maiya mandapam inside the tank where there is a Ganesha temple and a garden about two decades ago. “It used to be open to the public then. It has good architecture and can be promoted as a tourism spot along with the boating in the teppakulam,” he said. Former MLA of Madurai East, N Nanmaran, said that it was the misuse of the place by anti-social elements that led to it being closed off to the public. But, still it is something that should be showcased for its architectural excellence, he said. The garden in this mandapam has some rare trees and can even be used for educational purposes and if security personnel are posted and if visitation timings are specified, it could work, said Baskaran, a resident of Anupanadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/open-madurai-maiya-mandapam-to-public/articleshow/84486878.cms||---

---||Meerut||Dalit groom in Uttar Pradesh rides horse amid police security||MEERUT: A Dalit groom in Meerut who had alleged threats from upper caste men in his village was able to ride a horse during his wedding procession on Friday after police provided him security. The family breathed a sigh of relief as the 'ghudchadi' ceremony — in which the groom initiates the baraat on his horse — passed without incident and the procession made its way to the bride’s village nearby. Earlier on Thursday, Mangeram, father of the groom, had approached Sardhana thana in his village of Maanpuri and alleged that an upper caste family had threatened “to kill his son, Sooraj, if he dared to ride a horse”. The family had then sought police cover, citing previous incidents where Dalit youths had been stopped from riding a horse in their village. Following the complaint, a police team led by station house officer (Sardhana) Brijesh Kumar visited the accused Thakur family on Friday. “The family told us that they had not objected to the groom riding a horse, but had asked them to switch off the music while passing their house as they were in mourning after a family member passed away recently,” said the SHO. While initially police seemed to have downplayed the conflict, by evening three policemen were deployed at the groom’s house. At the time of filing this report, the groom’s wedding procession was moving towards the wedding venue in the nearby village. Brother of the groom, Ankit, told TOI that caste-based violence had happened in the region previously. “The same family had thrashed us earlier when we were building our house and were using the road to keep construction material. The upper castes have objected to our festivities many times,” he said. Dalit weddings have often been interrupted by upper castes over grooms from the community riding a horse or taking their baraat through public spaces. In 2018, a 27-year-old Dalit man had fought a two-month battle to take his baraat through the Thakur-dominated village in Kasganj district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/fending-off-threats-dalit-groom-in-up-rides-horse-amid-police-cover/articleshow/84484733.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Madurai||Over 100 streets in this panchayat in Virudhunagar now have Tamil names||MADURAI: A panchayat in Virudhunagar district has named 105 of its streets with Tamil words drawn from the seasons, flowers and even the dialects of language so as to redeem them from being known merely by numbers. Aathipatti panchayat president V Rajeswari, who is behind this move, has now got them loaded onto google maps to make it easy to identify addresses. Aathipatti which borders Virudhunagar municipality had only two main areas earlier — Aathipatti and Kattakanjampatti, but now it has many extension areas including Narayanapuram, Lakshmi Nagar, Pethammal Nagar, NGO colony and Jayaram Nagar. Former panchayat president Yoga Vasudevan said that since it was a vast area, postal services and visitors found it difficult to identify addresses among the numerous streets which were known more by their directions and numbers. That was when panchayat president V Rajeswari decided to give them proper Tamil names. Some streets were named after flowers such as Malli, Mullai, Thamarai, others after seasons such as Chittirai, Vaikasi, Avani Masi, Panguni, or after rivers such as Vaigai, Gangai, Thenpennai, Kauvery, Adayar, Krishna etc. Even Tamil’s various dialects like Senthamizh, Muthamizh, Painthamizh have got into the names of streets. ``People used to say the fourth street on the north of Narayanapuram, which caused a lot of confusion and delay. Now, even online deliveries are made to their homes without much problem,’’ said Santhi, a resident. Many streets have been named after each stage of the moon’s cycle, like Paal nila, Ilampirai, Niraimathi and Pournami. She said names coming under one category were given in a specific area for easy identification. For example, there are 20 streets each on the right and left of Sempatti and road all of them have been named after flowers. Narayananapuram has street named after seasons such as Vaigarai, Karmuhuil, Elavenil, Vasantham. One region where there are many farmers has streets named as Sevalai, Senkarumbu, Sennel, Pasumai and Arumbu, names of agricultural crops. Naming the streets in pure Tamil was also to prevent disputes as no one disagreed and many took pride in the name of their streets, said Rajeswari. She says that she now has an additional job of authorising the change of address in the Aadhaar card of her 11,000 residents with the new street names.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/over-100-streets-in-this-panchayat-now-have-tamil-names/articleshow/84486883.cms||---

The district chief education officer (CEO) T Vijayalakshmi said that the numbers are expected to go up in the coming days. This year, government and aided schools across the state are witnessing an increase in number of admissions. While Covid-19 second wave has impacted the livelihood of many families, parents are finding it difficult to pay fee of private schools. Meanwhile, government schools offer free education including textbooks and stationery items that is attracting more parents to opt for these schools. As per the data furnished by the office of the CEO, total 5,933 students have joined 1,966 government and aided schools in the district. The migration from private schools to government schools was highest in Pudukottai educational district than Aranthangi and Iluppur educational districts. “Some of the schools have witnessed exponential increase in the admissions this year. For instance, over 700 students have joined the government elementary school in north Raja Street in Pudukottai municipality this year,” said Vijayalakshmi. A government school teacher said many parents who could afford private schools, too, opted for govt school. “Since there are no offline classes during the pandemic, many parents are not in favour of spending money,” said the teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/5933-students-join-government-schools-this-year-in-pudukottai/articleshow/84484708.cms||---

The decision was taken by the aerodrome committee of the airport, headed by police commissioner A Arun, at the meeting on Thursday. The relocation of houses from Ambedkar Nagar for the airport expansion was taken up during the meeting. It was decided to take necessary steps through the district administration to allocate houses for those residing in Ambedkar Nagar to smoothen acquisition of land. As NH-210 is close to the airport, an underpass was suggested on the stretch close to the runway. Airport director S Dharmaraj said they have submitted a proposal to the NHAI in this regard. The meeting also discussed the need to reduce the height of the road by at least one metre for smooth take-off and landing of aircrafts as the road’s height has increased owing to relaying of the road over the last many years. Besides increasing patrolling around the airport, it was decided to increase CCTV cameras outside the airport.

You were permitting phone calls. You have to upgrade,” justice Rekha Palli asked, while hearing a petition for prison reforms by two JNU students and Delhi riots accused, Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita. Advocate Gautam Narayan, appearing for director general, prisons, said that further assistance on this aspect and reasons behind the policy could be best explained by the officer concerned. Taking note of the submission, the court said on the next date September 10, an officer conversant with the facts of the case be present on behalf of the respondent. Narwal and Kalita submitted that while several grievances raised in the matter have been addressed by the authorities, certain issues still needed to be looked into. But the court pointed out that the authorities have done “a lot of things.” However, the two contended that foreign inmates are still not allowed video conferencing, physical mulaqaat (meeting) and sought a permanent solution to dietary needs of prisoners. The court granted him time to file his short response on the surviving issues. Narwal and Kalita were arrested last year in May in connection with the communal riots in north east Delhi. On June 15, the high court granted bail to them in the Delhi riots case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

---||Trichy||Axing of 27 tamarind trees for road work kicks up row||Trichy: The state highways department has drawn flak for axing 27 tamarind trees in Pudukottai for road expansion as the over 40-year-old trees play a key role in maintaining the microclimatic conditions of the region. The department has planned to widen the 1-km stretch of Viralimalai – Kalamavur road near Sithambur.The road which is an intermediate lane with a width of 5.5 metres is being widened to 7 metres as a two-way stretch under Comprehensive Road Infrastructure Development Programme (CRIDP). Based on the request of the state highways department, Illupur revenue divisional officer Dhandapani inspected the road and gave permission for removing 26 green and one dry tamarind trees on the stretch.Tender was issued for axing the trees and the work is being carried over the last two days. Dhandapani said that only the trees that come in the way of the expansion are being axed which was unavoidable. Despite Pudukottai district being one of the dry regions of the state, official sources say they have not explored any alternative options to save the trees.When asked about it, Dhandapani gave examples of more trees having been cut for road expansion and that the number of trees axed in this case is less. “It is unfortunate that these flowering trees inviting honey bees and other living beings are cut down in the name of road expansion. Micro climate of this region will be affected because of habitat destruction,” said conservation scientist A Kumaraguru of Biodiversity Conservation Foundation (BCF).He said these trees could have been saved by having them translocated a few metres away from the road. “Alternative options are available but officials need to explore the possibilities from a conservation point of view. It is high time that officials of the concerned department are sensitised adequately so that they can be sensitive towards such issues,” he said. Another state highways department official cited hard clay in the region for ruling out translocation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/axing-of-27-tamarind-trees-for-road-work-kicks-up-row/articleshow/84484730.cms||Sampath Kumar

The petitioners had questioned implementation of a notification issued by the district authorities that either all shopkeepers and street vendors should get themselves vaccinated or they should produce Covid report obtained in last 10 days. Their advocate argued that it was high-handedness on part of the police officers that they pick anybody from the markets and make him sit in the police station for entire day and book him under Section 188 of the IPC for violation of notification, once the person fails to produce Covid-19 test report. The state government informed the HC that the notification was issued in April on account of a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases and it was effective till May 9. The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav questioned why the notification was still being implemented, once its application was to end on May 9. To the court’s query, the state government submitted that the cops will not act on the notification. The HC disposed the PIL after the state government gave the assurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/police-high-handedness-over-covid-rules-sparks-pil/articleshow/84486887.cms||---

Since Covid-19 has affected people’s purchasing power, the pre-Bakrid buzz and enthusiasm among community members is missing this year. “I used to sacrifice five or six goats on Bakrid but this year I will sacrifice just two since my income has diminished in the past one year,” said Amin Parekh who resides near Minara Masjid at Mohammed Ali Road. The closure of the Deonar mandi or market for goat buyers has resulted in a spike of goat prices. “We impressed upon the ministers and authorities that if Deonar market was closed due to fear of violation of Covid protocols, small mandis should be allowed to operate at different places. Goats may be expensive but unlike last year, there is no huge shortage of goats,” said Saleem Sarang, NCP member and a leader of Qurbani Coordination Committee. The coordination committee has met several ministers to resolve the issue of qurbani. Since dozens of goats had died last year as several trucks carrying sheep and goats were not allowed entry into Mumbai, many farmers and breeders did not breed goats in sufficient numbers. “The farmers and breeders had incurred huge losses as their trucks were kept stranded at Mumbai’s borders and many goats had died. They didn’t want to take a risk this year. The spike in diesel and petrol has also increased the transportation cost of animals and this has also fuelled the price of goats and sheep,” said Mohammed Aslam Qureishi, president, All India Sheep and Goats Breeders and Dealers Association. Shahnawaz Thanawala, vice-president, Bombay Mutton Dealers’ Association, said apart robbing Bakrid festivities of its usual gaiety, Covid curbs have also affected several farmers and breeders. “It is not that only consumers of mutton are affected. Even farmers are in a crisis as they would wait for this festival to earn good money from the sale of goats. Sale is down and everyone is glum,” said Thanawala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-low-key-bakrid-likely-in-pandemic-prices-high-due-to-shut-deonar-mkt/articleshow/84488210.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

A medical store was inaugurated at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahemdabad on Friday at the domestic terminal i.e. Terminal-1. Two such stores have been set up – one at the departures area of the domestic terminal and other in the arrivals area. According to airport authorities, the medical stores, even though situated within the terminal building will provide medicines to any point in the airport. “For instance, if someone is in the parking and requires medicine, one can call and the medical store manager will make it available,” said a well-placed source at the city airport. This means that even if a passenger transiting through the international terminal requires a medicine, one will be provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-airport-gets-a-medical-store/articleshow/84486895.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi government asked to explain steps taken to update kin of Covid-19 patients||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday asked the AAP government to explain steps taken to update family members or attendants of Covid-19 patients about their condition and treatment being provided in hospitals, since no one is allowed inside a Covid ward. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh granted some more time to the government to file its response, on a petition filed in this regard by an NGO. The court said the government’s affidavit should include all the steps taken by it in this regard and the future road map and listed the matter for hearing on August 31. It had, in May, issued notice and sought responses of the ministry of health and Delhi government on the plea by NGO Manav Awaaj Trust, which argued that at present families only receive news about the death of a patient or demand for deposit of hospital charges. It said that providing daily updates about patients’ condition would “develop confidence and trust in the system of governance”. The NGO has sought a direction to Delhi government “to frame a policy and/or guideline for communication of status report” every 24 hours to family or attendants of patients about their condition, treatment provided and details of attending doctors. It said the status reports can be communicated via WhatsApp, SMS, email or any other mode or an option can be given to family members or attendants to collect the report from the hospital daily at a specified time. The NGO submitted that there are no guidelines and/or directions to ensure that the attendant of a Covid-19 patient is updated about the condition or status of the patient on a daily basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-asked-to-explain-steps-taken-to-update-kin-of-covid-19-patients/articleshow/84486902.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The management approached the Kevadia police late on Friday night to file a complaint against a Surat-based travel agent who had duped many tourists. “Security guard checking the entry tickets found some tourists’ tickets with anomalies on Friday. He drew our attention to the tickets following which we inquired with the tourist about where he had purchased these. The ticket price was tampered with and the tourist was overcharged,” said a SoU spokesperson. “We found 23 tickets that were sold at a higher price,” the spokesperson added. Tickets for adult visitors that costs Rs 380 was sold at Rs 430 and those for children’s entry costing Rs 200 was sold for Rs 250. The agent tampered with the ticket price to pocket the extra amount. In February last year, Kevadia police had arrested another travel agent for selling SoU entry tickets at higher price to tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/surat-agent-caught-selling-23-sou-tickets-at-higher-prices/articleshow/84485360.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Vidarbha Covid cases cross 11 lakh after reconciliation in Nagpur||NAGPUR: The reconciliation of Covid-19 cases, recoveries and deaths done in Nagpur district on Friday added more than 15,000 new cases, 14,000+ recoveries and 1,075 deaths to Vidarbha’s total. However, despite this, the recovery rate of the region remained at 98% mark. With the addition of 1,075 deaths, which were reported but not considered as Covid-19 deaths in the district, Vidarbha’s Covid toll has reached 21,308 now. The case fatality rate, which was around 1.84% for the last two weeks, has increased to 1.91% due to this. With the sudden addition of 15,000+ cases, Vidarbha’s caseload has surpassed 11 lakh mark on Friday and reached 11,14,059. According to officials, these cases were reported and treated in Nagpur, but were not taken into Nagpur’s account as their domicile addresses were of other districts. Total 14,022 of such patients recovered, while 1,075 died. These cases were reported right from the beginning of the pandemic. So, these were not added into any specific month or wave. What is reassuring is the fact that Vidarbha’s recovery rate is still good, and the number of under-treatment patients is still at 1,007, which means most of the hospital beds are vacant. Though officials claim that the death data was updated with the central portal, such reconciliation is not new for Vidarbha. Earlier to this, Washim and Bhandara had seen similar reconciliation exercises due to which more than 450 cases and 190 deaths were added to the tally of these two districts. As far as last 24 hours are concerned, over 20,000 tests were conducted in Vidarbha and 76 of them turned out to be positive. With 102 recoveries and 2 deaths in the day, now 1,007 patients are under-treatment. Bhandara and Gondia districts reported zero new cases on Friday, while all other districts reported less than 20 cases each. The number of under-treatment patients increased in Nagpur to 313.

Prime minister Narendra Modi flagged off the ferry via video conference in the presence of ministry of defence officials and officers of the UP government. The contract for the ferry was signed in February 2019 under the Centre’s ‘PRASAD’ scheme to promote tourism and as a mode of transit at Varanasi. “This passenger ferry has been designed and built taking into consideration the unique role it has to play in promoting tourism across the river Ganga,” a GSL official said. It has been customised to carry 80 passengers. The defence public sector unit designed the ferry in line with classification rules of the Indian Register of Shipping (IRS). While the hull is built from steel, the composite superstructure provides weight advantage and better corrosion resistance characteristics. The vessel sailed from Goa to Varanasi, transiting through coastal waters and inland waterways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/boat-built-in-goa-to-ferry-devotees-at-varanasis-ghats/articleshow/84487656.cms||---

Friday marked the 17th anniversary of the tragedy. The parents paid homage to the departed souls in their homes by offering their preferred things. The kin visited the Krishna school at Kasiraman street where the 94 children were consigned to flames and 18 were injured after a fire broke out in the thatched roof 17 years ago. They offered floral tributes to the pictures of the children put up in the school before moving to the pillar constructed in their memory by the state government. They appealed to the state government to declare July 16 as Child Protection Day and a local holiday. It may be recalled that the parents have been making this demand for the past few years. They also demanded the state to provide government job to the injured children who completed their college education now. Tamil Nadu government chief whip and Thiruvidaimarudhur constituency MLA Govi Chezhian also paid homage and assured to take up the demands to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/observe-july-16-as-child-protection-day/articleshow/84484798.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat: Manager returns Rs 20 lakh worth roughs forgotten by diamantaire||SURAT: A small diamond unit owner heaved a sigh of relief when he got back his rough diamonds worth Rs 20 lakh that he had accidentally forgotten on top of his locker at a safe deposit vault in Kartargam area of Surat. Rahul Moradiya, who runs a unit in Bambawadi, had come to keep diamonds and other valuables in Katargam Safe on Wednesday. While he was adjusting the contents inside his locker to make space for the diamonds he had brought with him, Moradiya placed the box containing rough diamonds on top of the locker and forgot about it. On Wednesday evening, the manager of the safe Dhiru Golani noticed the box and informed the owner of the safe deposit vault Nayna Thummar. They placed Moradiya’s box in a locker in presence of two witnesses. The next day, when Moradiya came to inquire about his missing box of rough diamonds, Thummar checked the CCTV footage to confirm his claim. Moradiya was further questioned to double-check his claim and once the safe owners were convinced they returned the box to Moradiya. “I would have suffered a huge loss if I had lost the roughs. I am not in position to bear more losses,” said Moradiya. “It is our responsibility to keep the valuables of our customers safe. It has happened in the past too where people have forgotten their valuables outside the locker. But we return it when they come to inquire,” said Golani. Later, Golani was felicitated by office bearers of Surat Diamond Association (SDA) for his sincerity and loyalty towards customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/unit-manager-returns-rough-diamondsworth-rs-20l-forgotten-on-top-of-vault/articleshow/84485700.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Veterinarians create history with canine blood transfusion in Aravalli||PALANPUR: An ailing Labrador dog suffering from kidney and liver problems received a new lease of life after three doctors gave him a rare blood transfusion in Modasa town of Aravalli district late on Wednesday evening. But it wasn’t easy at all. Even though significant steps have been taken by veterinary and animal sciences researchers in Universities for canine blood transfusions, lack of adequate donors continues to remain a challenge. Thanks to the three pathfinders — doctors Jitendra Bhutadia, Nehal Rathod and Priyanshi Patel — of 1962 Helpline Veterinary, the unique initiative to save the canine’s life was successful and a record of sorts was also created in the district. “We were looking for a healthy dog to save the life of a Labrador dog owned by Digvijaybhai Parmar of Dadaliya village and after long search reached the mahant, who was kind enough to help,” said Dr Nehal Rathod. The trio approached the mahant of Gebinath mandir in Gebinath in Sayra village in Modasa taluka who has adopted around 15 stray dogs. They sought blood of a healthy dog for their operation and the mahant readily agreed for the noble cause. His permission saved not only Parmar’s pet’s life, but restored the owner’s joys too. According to the doctors, the dog’s owner and some of his family members have suffered from Covid-19 infection, which made them incapable of looking after the dog in time. The pet had developed liver problems, which took a turn for the worse on Monday. While the owners were consulting the vets and fighting for its life, they were also bracing themselves for the worst and were getting prepared to bid the dog farewell. The docs told the family about the risks involved in canine blood transfusion and also that this was a novel treatment for the entire district. After the medical procedure was done, both the dogs are healthy and fine, said doctors at Shymalaji Veterinary hospital. “The Labrador is recovering after the transfusion and on Friday it regained consciousness and also stood up on its legs. It has also started moving and eating. We, however, feel it may need more transfusion and are observing it,” said Dr Jitendra Bhutadia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/veterinarians-create-history-with-canine-blood-transfusion/articleshow/84485822.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rub of green: When all it takes is a laptop, high-speed internet...||NEW DELHI: In the last one month, several clandestine call centres running from residential buildings or small shops have been broken up. Sleuths from Delhi Police’s Cyber Crime Cell said the technology used by cybercrooks had become more advanced. These days, they often use cloud servers to run their applications, thus avoiding the need to be at a specific location. In most of the fraudulent call centres, women played a major role in the belief that people responded more to women’s call than to men’s. Till date this year, the cops have busted 34 fake call centres and arrested around 464 people, while the Cyber Cell has brought down eight call centres and arresting 186 people involved in cheating people of around Rs 260 crore. Anvyesh Roy, DCP (Cyber Cell), explained the two kinds of call centres that were raided in the recent past. “The first type is one where people impersonate technical executives/customer care executives of multinational companies based abroad. In this sort, people usually get a pop-up message saying their personal account has been hacked or infected by a virus. The second kind has people posing as drug controllers, border and immigration department, etc, and they target people who have recently moved abroad,” said Roy. “Despite police cracking down on them, English-speaking youngsters in the city are vulnerable and work with such call centres.” Investigating officers claimed that Delhi is no long a hub for such call centres, however, with the base having now moved to Salt Lake City in West Bengal. Even two-tier cities like Kanpur, Indore and some Gujarat cities haven’t remained immune to the menace. The ease of working on cloud servers makes it easy for a person to carry out operations from anywhere in India. Recently the South district police brought down two call centres, one running clandestinely from a closed shop, the other operating out of a residential space. The trend of targeting foreign nationals has seen a slight increase as many of such victims neglect filing police complaints or informing the Indian law enforcement agencies. Some of the call centres that were busted had been put under technical surveillance and monitoring by the cops. In one instance, it was noticed that there was a centralised server that was being used to receive/send calls from/to victims. Also, it was from that server that calls were being routed to several scam centres in various locations in Delhi. At one centre, the scammers used state-of-the-art security system to ensure that raids were not easily carried out by the cops, and in case the raid was successful, that they would get sufficient time to destroy incriminating materials. The security system included CCTV cameras for monitoring and digital locks operated through a numeric pin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rub-of-green-when-all-it-takes-is-a-laptop-high-speed-internet-/articleshow/84486933.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Couple booked for duping e-commerce company||AURANGABAD: A city-based couple has been booked by police on the charges of duping an e-commerce company by replacing a high-tech watch and a mobile phone, received in two parcels, with soaps, repacking and returning it back. The two parcels contained an Apple watch costing Rs 49, 900 and a mobile phone worth Rs 48,000 and were scheduled for cash on delivery. The parcels were returned citing that they are unable make online payment on receiving the products. Based on the complaint lodged by 22-year old Shaikh Aatir Sultan, a delivery boy with the E-commerce company, City Chowk police station has registered a case of cheating and criminal breach of trust against the couple. City Chowk inspector Sambhaji Pawar said, “The probe has revealed that the suspects gave false address while placing the order for the two high-end products.” The delivery boy contacted on the given number on July 8 for delivering the parcel but the suspect asked him to reschedule it for next day. Unable to find the given address on the next day, suspect asked him to wait at the Rauza Baugh cross-road. Aatir Sultan, in his complaint, has stated that the suspect reached the spot in sometime and offered to pay in cash for one parcel and make online payment for the second one. Suspect collected both the parcels by handing over a bundle of currency notes to the delivery boy and kept him busy. Despite the delivery boy insisting on making the complete payments before collecting the products, the suspect handed over the parcels to his partner who left the spot in a car. After online payment could not be made, the suspect called his partner over the phone and asked her to return back the parcels. The delivery boy deposited the same with his office which, on July 11, found that the products have been replaced by soaps. After carrying out an internal probe, the offence was registered on late Thursday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/couple-booked-for-duping-e-commerce-company/articleshow/84482342.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad industrial court rejects workman’s plea against industrial house||AURANGABAD: The industrial court at Aurangabad has rejected the plea filed by a workman against his employer industrial house — ‘Endurance Technologies Ltd’ — one of the leading die-casting manufacturers in the country. The aluminium die-casting manufacturing unit in Waluj floated a Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) under the name Samman Yojana on October 15, 2020, for its permanent workmen. In all, 87 staffers of the said company had applied for getting voluntary retirement, of which, 86 were sanctioned and the one by workman Ashok Tikkal was turned down. In the meantime, the complainant workman was suspended pending enquiry on the charges that he has been running a separate die-casting manufacturing unit in the name of his wife. Aggrieved by the action, he moved to the industrial court alleging ‘he has been subjected to fake disciplinary action to avoid the grant of VSS which is discriminatory and colorable exercise of powers by the employer management’ and sought compensation of Rs 5 lakh. Industrial court member Vimalnath Tiwari, while turning down the workman’s plea, cited, “The indulgence of this court to stay the suspension order or to direct the respondent not to act upon the chargesheet would amount to interfering into the domain of the rights of the respondent given to it under the Model Standing Order.” Representing the industrial house, lawyer Yugant Marlapalle contested that the management took an exception to the allegation of the complainant and emphasized that the VSS scheme is not an offer but an invitation to workmen to offer themselves for voluntary retirement. He vehemently contested “Unless such offer by the workmen is accepted by the employer, a contract does not come into existence and, hence, violation of such non-existent contract cannot be alleged.” According to Marlapalle, the workman has filed to guard himself from the disciplinary action by the management. The management has a right to suspend a workman pending enquiry and unless vagueness of the charge-sheet, as alleged, is established, the court cannot quash the charge-sheet. On hearing both the sides, industrial court member concluded, “Any interim order passed against the respondent (industry) would lead to indulgence of this court on the rights of the respondent to deal with the subject that touches the secrets and integrity of its organisation, given to under law.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/industrial-court-rejects-workmans-plea-against-industrial-house/articleshow/84482398.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Panel to study issue of exorbitant fee charged by unaided private colleges||MUMBAI: The state higher and technical education department has set up a five-member committee to study the issue of exorbitant fees charged by unaided private colleges during the Covid pandemic. The committee will study the fees charged by the universities, government-run, aided-unaided colleges for conventional as well as professional courses. This is over and above the relief extended to students in some fee components last month. The decision has been taken based on the report submitted by the Fees Regulatory Authority (FRA) to the department in March 2021. The FRA regulates the fees of private unaided professional colleges based on the balance sheets submitted by the institutes. However, there are several components that are not utilised in the pandemic, including hostel, library, laboratory, said a department official. But many of these components are part of the overall tuition fees and there is no break-up given, said an official. “While almost 65% students in professional colleges get some kind of scholarships from the government, this concession will benefit the remaining 35% students,” added the official. The department has issued a government resolution (GR) in this regard and asked the committee, headed by Chintamani Joshi, secretary to the FRA, to study and submit a report with recommendations in a month. The GR stated, as the Covid-19 pandemic hit every sector in the state, various organisations, parents and teachers, public representatives demanded to reduce fees of college-going students. At the same time, the state received memorandums by many educational institutions about not reducing fees. Hence, the committee should find an amicable solution and submit its report with recommendations, which will give some relief to students and parents, without hurting educational institutions, mentioned the GR. The GR further stated that the decision to set up the committee had been taken in March in a meeting held by the minister for state higher and technical education Uday Samant with vice-chancellors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaipanel-to-study-issue-of-exorbitant-fee-charged-by-unaided-pvt-colleges/articleshow/84488258.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Aurangabad||Dismissed MSRTC officer told to vacate quarters, pay seven years rent||AURANGABAD: Upholding Maharashtra State Road Transportation Corporation’s (MSRTC) plea, resident deputy collector of Aurangabad has issued directives asking dismissed assistant security inspector to not only vacate the illegally possessed officers’ quarters but also ordered recovery of seven years of rent for illegally occupying the space. Following the hearing, RDC Sanjeev Jadhvar concluded that ASI Ramesh Jogdand has been illegally staying at the Samarthnagar area-based quarter since May 1, 2014, and ordered recovery of seven years and one month rent from him and to vacate the residential quarter within a fortnight. Dismissed staffer Ramesh Jogdand, while serving in Aurangabad, was allotted the residential quarter in 2009. It was after he was transferred to Chandrapur in 2013 that Jogdand sought extension of quarter for a year citing that his son is pursuing education. However, during this period, he allegedly defaulted on electricity bill as well as rent to MSRTC. Around the same time, MSRTC headquarters at Mumbai granted him extension to hold possession of the quarter for further three years on the grounds of his posting at Chandrapur, a Naxal-infested area. In the meantime, citing integrity issues, senior security and vigilance officer of MSRTC Amravati dismissed the employee on January 20 this year but still he continued to possess the residential quarters. It was in February this year that the MSRTC, through its lawyer Akshay Radikar, approached court of RDC and made an application under section 4 of the Bombay government premises eviction act 1955. On receiving the notice, though Jogdand through his lawyer appeared before the RDC in multiple hearings, each time he sought more time to file reply to the notice. Failing to get any reply, RDC held final hearing on July 8 before allowing petition filed by MSRTC. As per Bombay government premises eviction act 1955, deputy collector is the competent authority having the power to get government premises vacated from the illegal possession of government employees who do not have any authority to be in possession of the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dismissed-msrtc-officer-told-to-vacate-quarters-pay-7-years-rent/articleshow/84482429.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Results unrealistic, say educationists; students start preparing for entrance||MUMBAI: While the SSC results announced on Friday did generate nervousness and excitement among students, educationists termed the scores as “unrealistic”. A junior college professor said, “Several students would have secured marks way beyond their expectations due to the assessment method used.” Basanti Roy, former Mumbai divisional secretary, state board, said though the state had adopted the best evaluation methodology, the results are nothing to be happy about. “The results are just an annual ritual that has to be undertaken by the board. If anything, the data provided by schools should be used by the state to track down students who may have fallen out of the education system during the pandemic,” said Roy. Unlike results of the previous years, this time schools knew in advance about their students’ scores. “The marking process was tedious. We are still chasing students to get their assessment done,” said the principal of a Chembur school. At Fatima Devi English High school in Malad (East), teachers and staff said all of the 184 registered students were adequately assessed. A maximum of 109 students secured Grade 1 while 44 candidates got distinction. Dhananjay Kulkarni, a retired professor from Pune who had petitioned Bombay high court challenging the state’s decision to cancel SSC exams, said, “If without exams more than 900 students can score a perfect 100%, then the state board should make such marks public.” Students, on their part, spent most of Friday trying to access their results. Celebrations across homes of SSC students remained low-key in the backdrop of the pandemic. “The results without an exam do not feel too good. I wanted my son to write the exams as he had done his preparation,” said a parent, Anila Shukla from Jogeshwari whose son secured 91% said her son’s Class IX scores went against him. Rashi Gupta, a student of Thane’s Vasant Vihar School who secured 93%, said, “I was hoping for 96%.

---||Delhi||...Court rejects bail plea of 21, says such incidents hurt India’s image||New Delhi: A Delhi court has dismissed the bail pleas of 21 people arrested for allegedly running a fake call centre and cheating foreign nationals saying that such incidents demean the image of our nation. Metropolitan magistrate Ashwani Panwar said augmentation of cyber crimes, particularly cases where a bunch of people operate a network to lure gullible people into fake schemes and thereby cheat them of their hard-earned money was a serious threat to the society. Police had alleged that the accused used to contact foreigners on the pretext of providing customer services claiming that suspicious transactions were taking place on their Amazon ID. The court noted that the accused were young people, who allegedly consciously agreed with one another to run a spurious call centre. “Moreover, such incidents demean the image of our nation as the fraud was allegedly committed with foreign nationals, mostly from the US,” it added. According to police, the accused allegedly duped many by gaining remote access to their computer systems and then cheated them by redeeming Amazon coupons/gift cards, which they made the victims purchase in lieu of having provided fake repair services. The court dismissed the bail pleas of Saurav Sharma, Shubham Verma, Akash Panwar, Girish Kumar, Ritik Singh, Dheeraj, Akash Kumar, Mohd. Ataulla Alam, Jahid, Yogesh Soni, Ranjeet Rasaily, Dheeraj Mishra, Prince Kumar, Devraj, Suraj, Sanchit Sikri, Jitender, Sanjay, Jatin Mehra, Harshwardhan Singh and Rahul Tanwar, who were arrested on July 13. The court also noted that the investigation was at a nascent stage and the co-accused persons were yet to be arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-21-says-such-incidents-hurt-indias-image/articleshow/84486936.cms||Usha Das
---||Nagpur||NMC starts vax of vulnerable groups, begins with pregnant women||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Friday started Covid-19 vaccination of vulnerable groups, beginning with pregnant women, as part of preparations for the third wave. To encourage inoculation and contain spread, the civic body is likely to explore possibility of giving some preference to fully vaccinated people in operating essential, non-essential shops, restaurants etc. NMC started a vaccination centre in the name of Pachpaoli ANC Centre at its Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital on Friday. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “This centre will be specially for vaccination of pregnant women. Later, lactating women will be added to the centre.” Only three pregnant women were brought to the centre and vaccinated on the first day. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “We have a list of over 11,000 pregnant women under the government scheme. We will send teams aware about the importance and benefits of vaccination to these pregnant women. These teams will bring pregnant women to the centre and ensure their vaccination. Similarly, the list of pregnant women registered or taking treatment at government and private hospitals will be collected and encouraged to get vaccinated.” Dr Chilkar said special preference is being given to pregnant and lactating women as they are vulnerable to Covid-19. “Also, the government has directed measures to protect children. This drive will also ensure safety of children,” he said. NMC will open similar special vaccination centres for pregnant and lactating women at Daga Maternity Hospital and IGGMCH too. Dr Chilkar added, “More vulnerable people like co-morbid and 45+ age group who are yet to be vaccinated will be identified in phased manner and encouraged to get vaccinated.” The Zilla Parishad (ZP) had started identifying mothers of 0-13-year-old children and started their vaccination. Radhakrishnan added special vaccination drive will be conducted for the third gender from Monday onwards. “We have received a request from some NGOs in this regard. Representatives of the NGOs said there is some hesitancy related to vaccination in third gender people. Therefore, we will facilitate special centres for them,” he said. A day ago, the government had announced relaxation in producing RT-PCR negative report to fully vaccinated people while entering the state from other states or foreign countries. Radhakrishnan said, “We are exploring the possibility of giving special preference to fully vaccinated people in running commercial activities during restrictions. It will ensure vaccination of people engaged in commercial activities, who could be superspreaders in case they contract the disease, as they meet people in large numbers on daily basis.” Radhakrishnan also said, “We will request some industries and corporates to come forward and sponsor vaccination for their staffers and family members. We are not getting sufficient doses on daily basis. Some people cannot afford private centres. Such people can be covered if sponsored by their establishments.” Affected a day ago due to lack of Covishield doses, NMC resumed inoculation at Covishield centres on Friday. Vaccination continued in Covaxin centres. Some 33,235 people took the jab at NMC centres, while 1,266 were vaccinated in 13 private centres. Thus, 34,501 took the jab in the city on Friday. The ZP completed record vaccination of 27,353 in 182 centres in rural parts of the district on Friday. Previous highest in a day was 26,901 on July 7. Total vaccination in the district was 61,854 on Friday. Orange City Hospital and Research Institute (OCHRI) became the first private centre to get doses of Covishield by placing an order in Co-Win application. Earlier, private hospitals used to place order directly with manufacturers and get the doses. Director of OCHRI Dr Anup Marar said, “Government started option of placing order to manufacturer or state in Co-Win application. Accordingly, we paid and placed order for 6,000 doses on Monday and received it directly from manufacturer on Friday. Minimum order is 6,000 doses if have to place order directly with manufacturers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-starts-vax-of-vulnerable-groups-begins-with-pregnant-women/articleshow/84502066.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Dehradun||Civilisations judged by how they treat minorities: Uttarakhand high court||NAINITAL: Democracy means the protection of minorities, the Uttarakhand high court said on Friday while hearing two petitions against a meat ban in Haridwar. A civilisation, the division bench added, is judged only by how it treats its minorities and a ban like the one in Haridwar calls into question the extent to which the state can determine a citizen’s choices. “The issue is whether a citizen has the right to decide his own diet or will that be decided by the state,” chief justice RS Chauhan said. “If we say that it will be decided by the state because the state is permitted to impose a total ban on a particular type of non-veg food...then can that power be extended to include meat of all sorts?” In March, the state had declared all areas in Haridwar “slaughterhouse-free” and cancelled no objection certificates issued to slaughterhouses. The petitions challenged this on two grounds — a blanket ban on meat of any type is unconstitutional, as was the section the Uttarakhand government had inserted into the UP Municipalities Act, 237A, to give itself power to declare an area under a municipal corporation, council or nagar panchayat as a “slaughter-free” zone. On Friday, advocate general (AG) SN Babulkar cited several judgments supporting the ban, including the 2004 Supreme Court verdict upholding a ban on meat and eggs in the municipal areas of Haridwar, Rishikesh and Muni Ki Reti. He also played back Article 48 in the directive principles, “The state shall … take steps for ... prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.” The division bench of chief justice Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma said, “Democracy does not only mean rule by majority but, most importantly, democracy means the protection of the minority.” It added, “The greatness of all civilisations is judged only on one yardstick and that is how it treats its minorities.” The court further said it would not go into the religious aspects of the issue and, instead, focus on whether the Constitution protects the privacy of a citizen. The petitioners had raised this, saying that the ban goes against the right to privacy, right to life and right to freely practise religion. The order, they added, was discriminatory of Muslims in Haridwar, where localities like Manglaur have a substantial Muslim population. The court said the petition had raised “serious fundamental issues” and would involve constitutional interpretation. It would not, however, be able to give its verdict before Bakr-Eid, on July 21. The next hearing is on July 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/civilisations-judged-by-how-they-treat-minorities-ukhand-hc/articleshow/84484947.cms||Prashant Jha

Officials of the ministry said the Rajpath redevelopment project involves largescale stonework, construction of underpasses, underground amenities blocks and horticulture work and sufficient space for parking. “Twelve bridges on artificial canal are being built, which are expected to be selfie points for visitors,” an official said. The government has maintained that there will be more public space and increase in the green cover after the project gets completed. Redevelopment of Rajpath is the first project to be completed under the mega Central Vista redevelopment scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/puri-to-monitor-central-vista-project-every-month/articleshow/84486940.cms||---

---||Kolkata||To bridge gap, KMC units slot 70% jabs for second dose||KOLKATA: KMC has decided to reserve 70% of the vaccine doses that the state has allocated to it for those who are due for their second jabs. This, civic officials hope, would help clear the backlog that crossed 50,000 shots a couple of days ago. On Thursday, a message was sent to medical officers at the 195 KMC-run Covid vaccination clinics (CVC), asking them to make sure the reservation policy was strictly followed. In addition, the KMC brass have decided to reserve half the doses at mega vaccine centres for second-dose recipients. These mega centres set up in auditoriums, ceremonial houses, theatres and academic institutes have primarily been administering the first dose to priority groups in the 18-44 age category. “After the backlog ballooned due to poor supply in the past two weeks, we at the clinics and mega centres decided to ramp up vaccination for those who received the first dose at least 84 days ago. They are now due for their second doses,” a KMC health department official said. The decision to prioritize second doses followed complaints from citizens whose 84-day gap had passed, leading to trepidation and anxiety among them. A section of civic officials posted at KMC-run vaccination centres conceded the situation had turned “embarrassing for them with senior citizens turning up at clinics only to learn that they would not get the dose as supplies had got exhausted”. The situation was particularly bad on Tuesday when civic clinics reopened after a gap of two days. “The daily allocation had dipped to 75 on an average. This supply was grossly inadequate for those who had been patiently waiting for their turn,” said a medical officer at a KMC clinic. The allocation for each centre rose to 100 for each clinic on Wednesday and it jumped to 200 on Thursday and Friday. But KMC officials in charge of vaccination said the number needed to be ramped up further to clear the backlog. While the situation was manageable now, officials said pendency needed to be cleared before the numbers escalated. Around May, KMC had gradually increased the daily vaccination target from 10,000 a day to 15,000 and then 20,000. In June-end, it had administered the vaccine to 62,000 people on a single day, followed by 50,000 the following day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/to-bridge-gap-kmc-units-slot-70-jabs-for-2nd-dose/articleshow/84486953.cms||Saikat Ray
---||India||Can’t allow kanwar yatra when next wave is looming: SC to UP||NEW DELHI: With the Centre strongly opposing holding of kanwar yatra, the Supreme Court on Friday said such movement of devotees cannot be allowed at a time when the danger of the third wave of Covid-19 is looming large, and asked the Uttar Pradesh government to reconsider its decision and not allow the yatra, even a symbolic one. A bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai said Covid affects every Indian citizen and their health and right to life guaranteed under the Constitution could not be compromised. The court made it clear to the state that either it reconsidered its decision and call off the yatra, failing which the court will pass an order. As the UP government responded “positively” to the court’s suggestion to reconsider the decision, the bench appreciated the stand and adjourned the hearing for July 19 and asked the state to file a fresh affidavit informing the court about its decision on that day. “We are of the view that this is a matter which concerns everyone of us as citizens of India, and goes to the very heart of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which has a pride of place in the Fundamental Rights chapter of our Constitution. The health of the citizenry of India and their right to “life” are paramount. All other sentiments, albeit religious, are subservient to this most basic fundamental right,” the bench said. The Centre and the state filed their affidavits after the apex court took suo motu cognisance of a media report pertaining to the state’s decision to allow kanwar yatra. The court had also noted that the state’s stand was contrary to PM Modi’s recent statement that “we cannot compromise even a bit” on the pandemic. Senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan, appearing for the state, told the bench that the government intended to hold only symbolic physical Kanwar Yatra and only a minimum number of devotees, who are fully vaccinated with a negative report RTPCR test conducted in the preceding last three days, would be allowed to participate. He assured the court that strict compliance of Covid protocol would be followed. But the bench said even symbolic Yatra should not be allowed and the Centre also contended that the state governments must not permit movement of Kanwariyas for bringing Gangajal from Haridwar to the Shiva temples of their choice. The Centre, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, said some alternative arrangement should be made for devotees considering the age-old customs and religious sentiments attached to the Yatra. Mehta said the state must develop a system to make holy Gangajal available through tankers at various places across the state which devotees can take and use to do “ABHISHEK” in their nearest Shiva temples. "The state governments must also ensure that this exercise of distribution of Gangajal amongst devotees and the rituals to be performed by such devotees in the nearby Shiva temples take place mandatorily ensuring social distancing, wearing of masks and adherence to all steps required for Covid- appropriate behaviour and health protocols," the Centre said in its response. As the UP government responded "positively" to the court’s suggestion to reconsider the decision to hold Kanwar Yatra, the bench appreciated its stand and adjourned the hearing for July 19 and asked the state to file a fresh affidavit informing the court about its decision on that day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-allow-kanwar-yatra-when-next-wave-is-looming-sc-to-up/articleshow/84489152.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The order has been issued against the school for violation of land norms and changing the trust’s ownership without approval from the education department. The school was purportedly functioning without recognition since November 29, 2017. The school cannot accept fresh admissions and has been asked to display on the notice board information regarding the closure for parents. Earlier, a derecognition notice was issued to the school in 2013. The school later made an appeal to the lieutenant governor in 2014. Taking note of the future of the children studying in the school, its recognition was extended till 2015. However, the LG’s report also found violation of land clause and other norms. “...The society has neither shifted nor proposed shifting of the school on any other land and not submitted any document of land regularization on which the school is presently running. Therefore, the orders dated 29.05.2014 and 22.10.2014 passed by the then director of education have now attainted finality and nothing survives with the SD Public School run by Shree Sanatan Dharam Sabha,” the DoE order stated. About 720 students are enrolled in the school from pre-school to Class X. Pawan Kumar, executive chairman of the school, told TOI, “The land issue has been sorted out. We have made the payment and submitted the document to the department as well. Till now, the department was cooperating with us and now all of a sudden, they want to close the school in the middle of a session. They have not bothered about the future of 600 children and 50 staff working at the school. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that the school doesn’t close.

A trial run with an electric vehicle, which was held at Big Bazaar street in Srirangam zone, was found satisfactory. The electric vehicles (EV) will replace mini-trucks, which are unable to approach these streets in several areas of old Trichy, and pushcarts, which are time-consuming and laborious. The introduction of EVs will also cut down a significant sum of the civic body’s maintenance cost, considering the surging fuel price, a source said. The civic body has identified two models - a narrow body vehicle with limited capacity and a vehicle with a wider body and higher capacity. At least 15 wards in the city including Rockfort, Woraiyur, Palakkarai and Bhima Nagar with less than 8ft-wide roads, are to be covered by the EVs. While the narrow body vehicle has a capacity between 120kg and 150kg, the other vehicle can accommodate up to 750kg of waste. A corporation official said that their objective is to ensure at least 150 to 225 houses are covered by one vehicle. “The time to mobilise the waste to the nearest micro compost centre (MCC) will come down,” said a sanitary official. The vehicles are likely to be purchased through the support of the smart cities mission programme. “The electric vehicle can cover at least 100km with a full charge. The MCCs will be equipped with charging points. We are yet to arrive at the total number of vehicles required,” corporation commissioner P M N Mujibur Rehman told TOI. The civic body has suggested modifications with the manufacturer to suit Trichy streets after which an order will be placed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/battery-run-tricycles-to-collect-waste-from-trichys-small-streets/articleshow/84485066.cms||Deepak Karthik

The research centre has been chosen for the award from among 104 institutes across the nation for its achievement in the past five years. Breaking the news to reporters, NRCB director S Uma said, “It is a great honour to receive the award. Being a small institute, the path we have crossed in the five years was not easy. We have achieved this despite financial burdens.” The award was received from Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on the Foundation Day of ICAR in Delhi through virtual mode. The director exuded confidence of pushing banana to the menu of noon meal scheme in schools. She said they had tried a lot in this regard during the previous government’s term. “I feel it didn’t work out in the last leg of the period. Now, we are appealing to the government to take banana as fresh fruit and also banana fig,” she said. Listing out NRCB’s achievements, she said they maintained Asia’s largest field gene bank of 374 indigenous and 124 exotic varieties along with in-vitro and cryo gene bank. The centre has released six climate-resilient varieties – Udhayam, Kaveri Saba, Kaveri Kalki, Kaveri Sugantham, Kaveri Haritha and Kaveri Kanya with unique characteristics for different agro-climatic zones. She said the centre planned to come out with a list of banana varieties with low glycaemic index for diabetics.

According to the Karnal education department, there are 176 high and senior secondary schools in the district and each saw hardly 10 to 15% attendance. Attendance of students also remained thin in government schools in Rohtak district. The students and teachers took all preventive measure like wearing face masks and maintaining distance. Following the government’s guidelines, one student was seated on a marked bench and they were taught for three hours from 9 am to 12 pm. Mohinder Singh, principal, Girl Model Sanskrit Senior Secondary School, railway road, Karnal, said, “The students were given entry as per the SOP. The school witnessed less attendance on the first day. Teachers are motivating parents and we hope that the strength will increase in the coming days.” He said teachers and students were allowed entry after thermal screening and sanitising hands. The students also brought written consent from their parents to attend classes. Preeti, a Class XII student, said, “It is much better to have face-to-face interaction in a classroom than online classes. Some students have limited resources due to which their study was getting affected.” However, some parents are reluctant to send their wards to school amid the prediction of the Covid-19 third wave. Munish, a parent, said, “Experts have already predicted a third wave which may impact children the most. It is very difficult for us to take the decision in this situation.” Karnal district education officer Rajpal said, “On the first day, 10 to 15% students turned up in the district’s government-run schools. All school heads have been directed to ensure the SOPs. Even, all schools have formed a committee, which will ensure compliance of the guidelines.” He said classes for students of Class VI to VIII would start on July 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/schools-reopen-in-haryana-for-classes-ix-xii-students/articleshow/84487016.cms||---

The alumni requested the Indian government to support his family and help bring his remains back home. Professor Sohail Akbar, who teaches photography at MCRC, said that the news was “hard to process”.  Describing Siddiqui as a very dedicated individual who never shirked responsibility, Akbar said, “Much of Danish’s work has the capacity to go down in history as iconic images of the era he lived in. ” He added that the photojournalist was so attached to MCRC that even when overworked covering the second Covid wave, he spared two hours to interact with Jamia students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jamia-remembers-danish-as-one-of-brightest-stars-in-hall-of-fame/articleshow/84487024.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Good progress in Elcot IT park work as public works department takes care of guest workers||TRICHY: Construction work for the second phase of Elcot IT park in Navalpattu has made a significant progress despite the lockdown restrictions mainly due to guest workers involved in the project staying back as they were taken care of at the construction site itself by the public works department (PWD), which is executing the project. PWD officials said that roofing work was completed for the ground floor of the four-floor office space near the Trichy International Airport. “The progress of the construction work was slightly slowed down. The needs of the guest workers were addressed at the worksite itself,” a senior PWD official said. “The raw materials were mobilised at the site in advance to continue the work. Around 40 workers are continuously employed,” the official added. In the next three months, the roofing work for the other floors would be completed after which subsequent civil work to create 1.13 lakh sqft office space will be initiated. With over 15% of the civil work completed, PWD said that the project will be completed in June 2022 as per schedule. The civil work on the Rs 48 crore project had commenced in December 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/good-progress-in-elcot-it-park-work-as-pwd-takes-care-of-guest-workers/articleshow/84485312.cms||Deepak Karthik

There are more than 70 schools of Jaipur who have been served these notices. All the schools have been now asked to re-assess the marks and submit them by July 17. According to information, all the top schools in the city have been served these notices because they have increased the number of students who were given high marks in range of 96-100. CBSE central office has issued a circular to all the CBSE schools stating that "the cases of all the candidates who have been rewarded 96 or more marks should be reviewed and revised in such a manner that number of students scoring 96 and above marks in a subject this year is not more than the number of students scoring more marks in that subject as per the historic performance of last three years." Ashok Vaid, secretary of Sahodaya Complex (association of private schools), said, "Schools have been asked to re-check their marks which have been moderated by them, especially marks given between 96-100. Schools will definitely comply with the process and submit the marks as per the policy of the board." It is still not clear whether the schools have inflated the marks to show good performance of their students or the marking criteria wasn’t understood properly. CBSE has said that if by July 17, marks are not uploaded as per the policy, then before preparation of the result CBSE will moderate the marks as per the policy and also initiate action against such schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/70-schools-in-city-get-cbse-notice-over-inflated-grades/articleshow/84487827.cms||---
---||Delhi||Kiwi vlogger Karl Edward Rice blacklisted for visa norm violations, Centre tells Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday asked the Centre to respond to a plea by the wife of a foreign YouTube vlogger who has been blacklisted from entering India. Manisha Malik has challenged the Centre’s ‘arbitrary and unreasonable’ decision to deny visa to her husband to enter India and sought its quashing. On its part, the Centre contended that Karl Edward Rice had been blacklisted for violation of visa conditions. “He has been blacklisted for visa violation. Let me file a status report. He was conducting business on a spouse visa,” the counsel for the Centre told justice Rekha Palli. The court pointed out that though grant of visa is the prerogative of the government, it has to be a reasonable order that must be communicated to the affected party. “You may be justified but they have to know. It is the prerogative of the government but they have to be justifiable,” the court said while issuing notice to the Centre on the petition and granted three weeks’ time to it to file its response. If there is any confidential information, it is open to the Centre to furnish the same in a sealed cover, the court said. The plea said the petitioner’s wife received no word from the government on the denial of visa and while exiting India in October last year, Rice’s visa was simply stamped 'cancelled without prejudice'. When the New Zealand-born Rice sought an extension, he was handed an exit permit, the plea told HC. The matter will be heard next on September 23. In her petition, Malik has submitted that her husband visited most of India to capture its beauty and contribute to the promotion of tourism. Since their marriage in 2019, the couple has been living in Delhi and Rice has not been able to return to India from New Zealand since October 10 last year. “The petitioner’s husband, Karl Edward Rice, has a dual nationality New Zealand and Netherlands and has been visiting India since 2013 strictly abiding by the laws of the country and the conditions of visa. During the entire period since 2013, while the petitioner’s husband has been granted Indian visa on various occasions, there hasn’t been even a single allegation against the petitioner’s husband,” the plea said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kiwi-vlogger-blacklisted-for-visa-norm-violations-centre-tells-hc/articleshow/84487053.cms||---

It is now ranked seven in the country, while Haryana’s both power utilities have improved their performance and are placed at fifth and sixth position. Union power minister R K Singh released the 9th Annual Integrated Rating of state discoms on Friday during the online meeting of Power Finance Corporation, which prepared the rating report by ICRA and CARE of 41 discoms (power utilities) in 22 states. The performance of state power distribution utilities was guaged on covering operational, financial, regulatory and reform parameters. The key concerns about the PSPCL performance include absolute subsidy dependence coupled with delay in receipt of subsidy, high cost of power purchase and low cost efficiency on account of high employee costs among others. In ‘A+’ grade, Gujarat’s all four discoms retained their top ranking in integrated ratings with Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam coming fifth. ‘A’ grade utilities included Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, PSPCL and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (in same order). Ten utilities placed in ‘B+’ grade include four from Karnataka and one each from Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Kerala, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/pspcl-slips-from-grade-a-to-a-ranking-behind-haryana-power-utilities/articleshow/84487038.cms||Bharat Khanna

Trichy district on Thursday received 22,000 doses of Covishield and 3,040 doses of Covaxin. Eight locations were chosen for the vaccination drive of which Kalaiarangam hall vaccinated only Covaxin while Thennur corporation school vaccinated only antenatal and postnatal mothers. Since the corporation had conducted an exclusive Covaxin vaccination camp for 18-44 years age group on multiple days in June, the number of people who surpassed their due date for the second dose, crossed 3,000 in the last few days. Desperate to take the second dose, people, including those from rural are thronged the Kalaiarangam hall. “My mother feels that Covaxin has fewer side effects, so she was determined to get that particular vaccine only,” T Suresh, a resident of Kallukuzhi said. The special camp at Thennur corporation school, however witnessed a poor response. Of the 48 vials, only two were used. An official said that the civic body could have arranged the vaccination camp in the nearest UPHCs as pregnant and lactating women refrain from travelling to faraway centres. In Seventh Day Adventist School on Heber Road, the allotted vials were exhausted before noon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/demand-for-covaxin-stays-high-in-trichy/articleshow/84485357.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||MC to pay Rs 10,000 a month to RWAs to run libraries in parks||MOHALI: The municipal corporation (MC) has decided to pay Rs 10,000 as monthly expense to resident welfare associations (RWA) to manage libraries. The MC will refurbish libraries in various parks before handing them over to interested RWAs. Apart from paying Rs 10,000 as monthly expense, MC will buy books, magazines and newspapers for libraries, said deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi. Recently, Mohali Municipal Corporation decided to hand over operations and maintenance of various libraries to the resident welfare associations (RWAs) set up in parks. RWAs and senior citizens’ associations (SCA) had been demanding control of libraries for the past several years. Deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi said, “We believe in results, not talk. This issue of libraries was a longstanding one. The previous house failed to make them operational but the Congress-led house is going to make it a reality. MC will fund each library with Rs 10,000 per month as expenses to pay salaries to librarian, peon and caretaker. Also, MC will refurbish the libraries before handing them over to the interested RWA or SCA. The libraries will be maintained and operated by the associations.” Bedi said applications to operate libraries have been received from interested RWAs and SCAs and operations will be handed over by next week. He said that the libraries set up in various parks of Mohali are currently closed. In view of this, a resolution has been passed to hand over their management to the resident welfare association for their commissioning. One library each is situated at Silvi Park, phase X, Rose Garden, phase 3B1, Phase IV, sectors 70, 69, 65 and 56. These libraries have been a bone of contention in the past. In June 2020, since the attempt of the Mohali municipal corporation to purchase 1,100 books worth Rs 12 lakh for six libraries, bypassing the library committee, was stalled, the libraries have been on the verge of closure. The libraries, an ambitious project of the MC, have been popular among senior citizens, for whom they are the sole places of recreation. They had volunteered to manage and operate the libraries but the proposal was rejected by the MC. At present, these libraries have few books and fewer visitors. In January last year, the MC sacked employees managing libraries with immediate effect on payment of partial salary for three months against pending dues for six months. Some of the libraries have no furniture, drinking water or sign board. Students have limited options when it comes to libraries in Mohali and they have to go to public libraries of Chandigarh in sectors 17 and 34. The libraries also faced a series of controversies and credit war between Congress and SAD-BJP councillors. Former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra alleged that cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu inaugurated four libraries in Mohali, which were already inaugurated months ago by him. On June 21, high drama was witnessed at the Phase IV community library, when SAD councillors laid siege to it as cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu demanded sharing its books for inauguration of other libraries across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-pay-rs-10k-a-month-to-rwas-to-run-libraries-in-parks/articleshow/84485419.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Anand Teltumbde prima facie linked to Elgar, says order nixing bail||MUMBAI: The special NIA court rejected Elgar Parishad accused Anand Teltumbde’s claim that he was in Pune for a wedding and went to the venue of the rally only to meet his wife’s nephew while rejecting his bail plea on Monday. In the 40-page reasoned order made available on Friday, special judge Dinesh Kothalikar said while it was true that the 70-year-old had been invited to a marriage on December 31, 2017, in Pune, the fact that he went to Shaniwarwada, venue of the Elgar Parishad (EP), “goes to prima facie suggest that he was also connected with the EP”. The court said Teltumbde has “not explained” how his name appeared as a convener on a pamphlet, ‘Bhima Koregaon Shauryadin Prerana Abhiyan’, printed before the programme. It thus found “no merit’’ in his claims that he was in no way connected with the event. Teltumbde’s advocate Sudeep Pasbola had stressed that he was not associated with the Parishad and there was no evidence to link him to any banned CPI (Maoist) organisation or anti-terror offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty argued Teltumbde’s presence in Pune and at Shaniwarwada are crucial, and cited documents recovered from co-accused Rona Wilson’s laptop that said “Anand T had received (Rs) 90,000 from… (through Milind — his brother)” to argue that he was a “recipient of funds from the banned terrorist organisations’’ and “actively involved in criminal activities along with his brother”. The court said it has “independently considered the material’’ collected during investigation and it shows “allegations made against the applicant are prima facie true”. Given the bar placed by section 43-D-5 of UAPA, once a court finds a prima facie case, bail is not granted. “Upon perusal of the documents... there is no hitch to record prima facie satisfaction that there is material against the applicant to show his complicity in the crime,”said the court. The judge also said the fact that a chargesheet is filed, cannot be used in Teltumbde’s favour, “rather it would go against him”. Though his name was not in the original January 8 FIR, it was “revealed” during investigation, said the chargesheet. The order said Teltumbde had allegedly received a letter referring to his visit to Paris for a human rights convention in April 2018 and mentioning “intellectual comrades must strive to keep fire ablaze”. The court said, “It is to be noted that the prosecution has claimed that during said period, domestic chaos related to Dalit issue was only the incident relating to Bhima Koregaon incident. The very statement… goes to prima facie indicate the applicant was involved in furthering activities of banned organisation.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiteltumbde-prima-facie-linked-to-elgar-says-order-nixing-bail/articleshow/84488348.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||Court orders provisional attachment of Sumedh Singh Saini house in Chandigarh||MOHALI: There was more trouble for Punjab former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini on Friday as a court here has issued orders for provisionally attaching a house in Chandigarh’s Sector 20 where Saini is residing at present. Special public prosecutor Sartej Singh Narula said the orders were issued by additional district and session judge P S Grewal. It has been alleged that the said property was purchased using tainted money at the behest of Saini. The allegations were probed by the state vigilance department, after which the department filed an application in court for attaching the property. According to allegations Nimrat Deep Singh, a serving executive engineer (XEN) of Punjab government, had obtained bribe and tainted money for Saini in the name of his father, Surinder Jeet Singh Jaspal. Using this money, Surinder Jeet bought the house, it has been alleged. It has been alleged that Saini was shown to be living in the house after it was renovated in October 2018. The application reads the house was meant for Saini. It added no money in the shape of rent had ever been received and instead Rs 6.4 crore was paid by Saini to a man idenified as Surinder G Singh Jaspal without any agreement to sell. Later, a fabricated agreement to sell had been placed on record which was neither on stamp paper, nor attested by any witness and was signed only by Sumeet Singh Sani and Surinder G Singh Jaspal. The investigating officer, in the application, prayed for attaching the property under provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944, as per Section 18 A of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, as amended by the act of 2018. Saini is already facing a murder case in connection with the December 1991 disappearance of CITCO junior engineer Balwant Singh Multani, who was son of former IAS officer Balwant Singh Multani. On December 22, 2020, the Mohali police had filed a charge sheet against him in connection with the murder case. Saini has been charged with 302 (murder), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 219 (Public servant corruptly or maliciously makes a report in contrary to law), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to extort confession or to compel), 364 (Kidnapping) and 120-B (conspiracy).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/court-orders-provisional-attachment-of-saini-house/articleshow/84487056.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Nagpur||Covid growth at 0% in Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia||NAGPUR: The growth rate of Covid cases is down to zero in Nagpur, Bhandara, and Gondia districts of Vidarbha while all other districts in the region have less than 0.05% as per the latest comparative data released by the department of public health, Maharashtra. The updated information is up to July 13. The weekly growth rate measures the percentage change in the number of new confirmed cases over the last seven days relative to the number in the previous seven days. In Nagpur, Bhandara and Gondia, it was zero on July 13. Gadchiroli had the highest, 0.05% growth rate, in Vidarbha while all the other districts have less than that. The state average growth rate is 0.14% and all Vidarbha districts have less than half of this average which makes them eligible for further relaxations. Kolhapur has the highest (0.86% growth rate). As per the WHO standards, restrictions and lockdown measures are advisable only if the growth rate is above 1%. The second important parameter is the test positivity rate. TPR is the percentage of positive results out of total samples tested in a week. The formula used is to divide the number of positive tests (numerator) by the total number of tests done (denominator) and multiply this result by 100. At present, Bhandara, Gondia and Nagpur have the lowest TPR in Vidarbha. Gadchiroli, once again has the highest, nearly 3% test positivity in Vidarbha. But, this is quite less compared to the state’s 4.36%. The current scenario in Vidarbha has set the stage for further relaxations in restrictions. As per WHO, if TPR is under 5%, infection is well under control. Third parameter is under-treatment patients as compared to the number of highest patients in the first wave. All the 11 districts in Vidarbha have at least 75% less patients under treatment at present as compared to the highest number of patients in the second wave. Yavatmal has more than 99% less number of under-treatment patients as compared to the first wave while Nagpur also has a nearly 90% decrease in the number of new cases. Amravati, Akola, Chandrapur also have more than 90% less patients under treatment as compared to the peak of the first wave. This indicates that hospitalization has gone down significantly. Secondly, all districts have ramped up medical facilities as compared to the first wave. So, more than 90% of the hospital beds are presently unoccupied in the region. As per the state’s own old guidelines, if 75% beds are vacant, such districts may go for full unlock. With near-zero growth of cases, under control test positivity rate and a huge percentage of hospital beds unoccupied for more than threee weeks at a stretch, technically, Vidarbha qualifies for a full unlock by all international parameters and guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-growth-at-0-in-nagpur-bhandara-gondia/articleshow/84487044.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Two out of eight smart roads are complete, while plans for others have been scrapped. In the original plan, eight market roads were to be renovated under Smart City projects — Kishanpole, Chandpole, Hawa Mahal, Johari Market, Bapu Bazaar, Gangauri market, Sanjay market and Tripoliya market. However, after Kishanpole and Chandpole market, JSCL has decided to call off the work because it was really expensive for them. Awdhesh Meena, chief executive officer of JSCL said, “The total cost of the eight roads was Rs 145 crore, but in just these two roads, we had to spend Rs 45 crore. Due to political interference, market association problems and local residents’ opposition, it was found as not being feasible to continue with the work. Hence, we decided to stop the work after two roads.” Market associations of the Walled City, however, are ready to adjust for the construction of the smart roads. Subhash Goyal, president of Jaipur Vyapaar Mahasangh said, “We are in favour of constructing smart roads in the entire Walled City but the work should be done on time. When road was constructed in Chandpole market, we shut our shops for six months to co-operate with the officials. We want this work to be done in other parts of the markets as well.” There are many works started by the JSCL, which are now pending for months and shopkeepers are facing problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nodal-agency-stops-building-roads-says-not-cost-effective/articleshow/84487872.cms||---

A total of 21 traffic rule violators paid their longstanding dues online under the drive. Police personnel found locked or wrong addresses at 24 places and 26 violators were given date and time to pay their fines. The traffic police started the door to door drive to collect pending challans running into thousands from traffic violators on Thursday. Police teams are only accepting fines through e-challan machines and not in cash. Two teams of two policemen have been constituted for the purpose. They have been equipped with body cameras to ensure transparency while collecting fines and to prevent harassment. The drive was launched to get the people to follow traffic rules and to make them understand that not paying fines was not an option. Initially, designated traffic police teams will identify habitual offenders with the highest number of pending challans against them. According to data available, the traffic police department issued as many as 1,05,794 Traffic Violation Information Slips (TVIS) between March 1, 2020 and June 15, 2021. However, only 34,329 violators paid their challan dues while 71,465 challans are yet to be paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/traffic-cops-visit-71-houses-to-collect-fine/articleshow/84485460.cms||---

In Kullu, DC Ashutosh Garg and SP Gurdev Chand Sharma on Friday visited tourist places of Kullu-Manali to take stock of the situation and asked tourists to wear mask and maintain physical distancing. They also took stock of traffic and law and order. “Photos of tourists not following Covid-19 safety protocols at some places have gone viral on social media. To enforce strict compliance, it has become mandatory to personally keep an eye on situation. It is great that a majority of tourists are wearing mask after strictness by police. Crowding has also almost finished following rains,” the DC said. Kullu SP Gurdev Chand Sharma said 200 additional police personnel have been deployed to ensure compliance with Covid protocols and to make traffic movement smooth. “Police are not hesitating in challaning those who are not wearing mask. However, we give them one warning before challan,” he said. In Lahaul, DC and SP have been meeting tourists and advising them to adopt all safety measures to keep themselves and other safe from Covid-19. They also distributed masks among tourists who were not wearing mask on the pretext of unavailability.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Madhyamik results to be declared on Tuesday, higher secondary on Thursday||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education will declare the results of Madhyamik 2021 on Tuesday. There would be no merit list because the examination had been cancelled and the marks have been calculated on the basis of a formula that was earlier announced. More than 11 lakh examinees are expecting their Madhyamik results this time. The results of the higher secondary (HS) examinations will be out on Thursday. After the board formally announces the results at 9am on Tuesday, candidates will be able to see their individual scores on 12 websites from 10am. The details of the websites were announced by board president Kalyanmoy Ganguly on Friday. Since the exam was cancelled this year, no admit cards were issued. However, these will be given along with mark sheets from 49 distribution centres from where schools will have to collect them on Tuesday itself. Students will, however, not be allowed to come to school to collect their mark sheets. Only parents will be allowed. Once candidates log on to any of the 12 websites, they will be asked to fill in their registration number and date of birth to see their results. To arrive at individual results, the board has used the annual exam marks of Class IX and the internal formative assessment marks of Class X exams. Equal weightage (50% to both IX and X performance) has been given to both. However, if a candidate is not satisfied with the marks, he or she will be allowed to write a test after the Covid situation improves. “For Class X, there is no reason for children to be tense because they are still within the school system and have already started their class XI studies. They should understand that this is the best that could have been done in a pandemic,” said Sunita Sen, principal of Ballygunj Shiksha Sadan. Rijula Chakraborty, a Class X student, did not hide the fact that despite assurances from every quarter, she was extremely tense. “With our Class IX marks coming into consideration and the internal formative assessments gaining a lot of weightage, we are all nerves because we really don’t know how we will fare,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/madhyamik-results-to-be-declared-on-tuesday-hs-on-thursday/articleshow/84485464.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

This year, 92,695 examinees will be writing this entrance test for engineering colleges. This will also be the first public exam since the second Covid wave that led to the cancellation of board examinations. The state will run special buses for examinees. The Railways will also allow candidates to board trains if they show their admit cards. Candidates and their guardians will be able to board staff special Metro trains by showing admit cards on Saturday. “At the centres, enough masks, gloves and sanitisers will be available for staff and other service providers,” said a statement issued by education minister Bratya Basu. “If we find anyone whose temperature is higher than what is allowed, we will allow them to wait in a room to see if the temperature comes down. If it remains high, they will have to take the test in rooms reserved for this purpose,” said Parimal Bhattacharya, headmaster of Jadavpur Vidyapith, which is an exam centre. Parents, however, will not be allowed to crowd outside exam centres. Most schools said the number of examinees has dwindled this year. “In my school, just one candidate has registered for the exam,” said Sucharita Roychowdhury, principal of Silver Point School. “With the Covid scare still looming, only those who are sure about pursuing engineering want to take the test.

Many of them staged protests outside the university’s College Street campus on Friday while others floated online petitions to create pressure on the university authorities to review the time table. Till late Friday evening, CU authorities did not hint at any change in the schedule. According to them, two honours papers have been conducted in a day earlier too. The authorities said they have to wrap up the tests by the end of July and publish results by August 31, complying with UGC guidelines so the PG admission process can be started soon. Students said that with no entrance examinations for PG, their UG marks will matter a lot and rushing exams might impact their performance. “Four honours papers for the sixth semester are scheduled on July 29 and July 30. Two tests mean we will have to write for six hours every day. This is inhuman. Students are being made to suffer for the short-sightedness of the university authorities,” said Ritwik Ghosh, a third-year student of a south Kolkata College. “In many cyclone-affected places of the state, net connection has not been restored. We have requested the university authorities to review their decision,” said Abu Sayed, district secretary, All India Democratic Students’ Organisation. “We must declare results by August 31. On many occasions, two honours examinations have been conducted on the same day,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stir-against-4-cu-hons-tests-in-2-days/articleshow/84485479.cms||---

The Central Park Sangharsh Samiti (CPBSS) on Friday decided to hold a signature campaign in the city on Sunday against the demolition drive ordered by the state. “It is not only unjust but also illegal to demolish a building for another building. The court order 2010 clearly says that land has been acquired for the garden/park. Therefore, it cannot be utilised for any other purposes. Thus, when it is clear that hotel Laxmi Vilas has to be utilised for garden or park how can the government construct any other building,” said Yogesh Yadav of CPBSS. The CPBSS has also served a notice to the principal secretary of the department of urban development and housing, and the commissioner of Jaipur Development Authority for complying with the judgement dated October 27, 2010, passed by the division bench of the high court on Friday. Gaurav Goyal, Commissioner, JDA, said not even an inch of parkland is being used for the museum. “The step has been taken after legally examining all documents related to the land. The court order permits us to use the land commercially but instead, it is chosen for a novel cause of introducing life sketch of Mahatma Gandhi for present and coming generations,” he said.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/laxmi-vilas-civil-society-serves-notice-to-officials/articleshow/84487877.cms||---

During the meeting, the mayor raised multiple issues related to finances of the municipal corporation. During the discussion, the mayor asked for release of the remaining grant of Rs 40 crore for developmental works to be done in 13 villages. The mayor said since the Chandigarh administration had earlier released Rs 50 crore grant from the total budget sanctioned, amounting to Rs 90 crore for 13 villages, the remaining amount was significant. Sharma also discussed the issue of the 4th Delhi Finance Commission recommendations and requested the adviser to follow up with the ministry of home affairs on implementation of release of grant to the MC according to recommendations. The mayor discussed handing over the Registering and Licensing Authority (RLA) to the civic body authority. Since this department is quite crucial from the revenue point of view, the MC has been eyeing it for many years, but there has been no progress so far. The mayor requested the adviser to settle the issues of Chandigarh Housing Board on the Delhi Pattern and the adviser assured him that he would take up the matter with MHA on priority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mayor-meets-adviser-seeks-grant-for-devp-works/articleshow/84485473.cms||---

He said some well-known examples are not convening parliament for as long as possible and not meeting the media. Speaking at a seminar on "Global Pandemic and Challenges to Democracy" in the Rajasthan Assembly, the Rajya Sabha MP said, “ In a true parliamentary democracy system, the prime minister is responsible every day to the Parliament and to the people. But in a corroded diminished democracy, the rulers will find diverse ways to evade accountability," he said. Chidambaram highlighted seven challenges, including perils of centralisation, widening income disparity and poverty among people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pandemic-exposed-chinks-in-political-system-says-pc/articleshow/84487878.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Capt: AAP criticism of debt waiver shows anti-farmer stance||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday slammed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for its criticism of his government’s decision on debt waiver for farm labourers and landless farmers. Capt Amarinder claimed it exposed the party’s anti-farmer stance. “The AAP reaction was on expected lines, considering that the party has never shown any interest in doing anything for the farming community,” he said and noted that the Kejriwal government in Delhi was among the first to notify one of the controversial and draconian farm laws of the central government. “The fact is that AAP does not care for the welfare of the agricultural community and is opposed to any decision that is in favour of the farmers,” said Amarinder. “Unlike AAP, whose pre-poll promises are nothing but mere theatrics to woo the voters, the Congress government believes in implementing its promises,” said the chief minister, reminding AAP that the debt waiver for farm labourers and landless farmers was not an announcement made on the eve of the 2022 assembly polls but a promise contained in the Punjab Congress manifesto. Despite the severe financial constraints faced by his government and compounded by the Covid pandemic, he was committed to the implementation of each of the 2017 election promises, he asserted. Ridiculing Kejriwal’s promise of free power units in every state he is visiting to kick off the party’s poll campaign, Capt Amarinder dubbed the AAP leader as a master of manipulation. Even in Delhi, where AAP government claims to be giving free power, an analysis of the data shows that what the citizens of the national capital are getting in terms of relief in power costs was actually less than in Punjab, apart from the fact that the farmers of Delhi had got not a paisa worth of support or relief from the Kejriwal government, he added. It was evident, said the chief minister, that AAP had manipulated the figures to spread misinformation – an art they have mastered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-aap-criticism-of-debt-waiver-shows-anti-farmer-stance/articleshow/84487069.cms||---

AAP leaders said that on the one hand, the civic body, run by BJP, planned to take a loan of Rs 500 crore to provide 24-hour water supply to the city and on the other, the MC had suspended water supply to save money. AAP leader Chander Mukhi Sharma said BJP leaders lacked acumen and were confused about what to do. “If the Municipal Corporation only wants to save money, then why are crores being spent on 24- hour water supply, that too by taking a loan from another country?” Sharma alleged that the faulty policies of the BJP had increased burden on the common man. “The MC is putting the burden of tax on the public to meet its wasteful expenditure. From the MP to the administration and the corporation, its BJP-led people are everywhere, but there is lack of coordination among themselves. The MP too has completely failed,” he alleged. Sharma said that the municipal corporation had decided to stop afternoon water supply only to save money, which is why APP demanded the resignation of mayor Ravikant Sharma and BJP state president Arun Sood. “BJP, very tactfully, keeping in mind the coming municipal corporation elections, has deferred increased water tariff rates till March next year. The administration has also refused to give this fund to the municipal corporation. Therefore, the municipal corporation suspended afternoon water supply. The corporation's reasoning is that by discontinuing afternoon supply, Rs 14 crore will be saved annually,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/water-woes-aap-demands-mayor-bjp-city-chiefs-resignation/articleshow/84485516.cms||---

The woman also claimed that her father was Soumen Mitra, the commissioner of Kolkata Police. One of her fans — that the girl claimed was her ‘rival who could not handle the fame that she got as a TikTok performer’ — moved the cyber cell and lodged a complaint. The woman alleged that her account had been hacked. A resident of Bikramgarh in south Kolkata, the woman posed both as a Kolkata Police sergeant and a sub-inspector in Kolkata Police. Police said they were ‘considerate’ about the incident, given the age of the woman and the fact that she is a student. “We decided against any coercive action. However, she is now an adult and knows the consequences of her act. We have decided to counsel and warn her. We have already spoken to her and her family. We have told her that this mistake should not be repeated even if she had no mala fide intention,” said an officer from the detective department. “We do hold counselling sessions for those who do not post authentic information. Following the same process, we both warned and counselled her,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The woman that she had no intention to hurt anyone. “I had taken the police uniform on rent to prepare a YouTube video. I have not done anything wrong. I respect the police commissioner and he is a good man. I admire him as an IPS officer. Hence, I addressed him as ‘Bapi’. But I have not made any tall claims. Everyone knows that there are no female sergeants in the Kolkata Police force,” she said. She alleged that her social media account was hacked by someone, adding that a common friend had introduced her to the complainant several years ago. Her mother claimed that her daughter had been set up. “People who were jealous of her success and popularity are making a mountain out of a molehill,” claimed her mother. Police though said that the woman had so far refused to state from where she hired the uniform. “We are ascertaining the place from where she hired the uniform to know if she is speaking the truth. She has deleted all her objectionable posts though,” said an investigating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-warned-for-posing-as-police-in-tiktok-video/articleshow/84485545.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Ludhiana||How Congress complicated its internal crisis in Punjab||JALANDHAR: An inordinate delay by party high command in offering a solution to internal crisis of Punjab Congress has not only complicated the issue but is also damaging the perception of the party at ground level. Congress insiders are apprehensive that any dip in the party’s popularity can be direct gain for AAP. After missing out on quite a few occasions to intervene and take corrective measures even as there were enough indications of trouble brewing within the Congress Punjab unit around two years back, party leaders further complicated the crisis in the last three months. Read AlsoPunjab Congress tussle: Amarinder meets Rawat, Sidhu calls on JakharNEW DELHI: Amid escalating tensions in the Punjab Congress unit, state party in charge Harish Rawat on Saturday called on chief minister Amarinder Singh at his residence in Chandigarh. The meeting comes amid speculations that Sidhu would be appointed as state Congress head despite Amarinder'sThe crisis in Punjab Congress is a story of delays and failure of the party high command intervene timely. After CBI had filed closure report in the trial court in Bargari sacrilege case in July 2019, the Congress faced heat on the issue, as state government failed to withdraw case from the central agency despite a resolution passed by the state assembly in August 2018, and a subsequent notification issued by the Punjab government. The first indications of discontentment brewing within the party had started in first week of August 2019, when during a meeting of Congress Legislature Party, the party MLAs pointed out to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh different flaws and failures of his government. Biggest issues at that time were also sacrilege and drugs, while a few MLAs also underlined other issues like illegal sand mining and Badals’ alleged dominance in private bus transport sector. Just ahead of the monsoon session at that time, MLAs had told the CM that feedback about his government was not positive. As a group of unhappy MLAs had started organising themselves and they even held a meeting, the CM, after coming to know about their activities, diffused the discontentment by inducting half dozen of them as his advisors. Later, when Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar started getting feedback from ground in December 2019, it was mostly negative and he had to discontinue the exercise to save his party’s government from embarrassment. In third week of January 2020, party national president Sonia Gandhi appointed two separate committees — Manifesto Implementation Committee and PPCC Coordination Committee. Even as discontentment within the party and among people was written on the wall, AICC party affairs in-charge Asha Kumari did not convene meetings any of the two committees. By the time Harish Rawat took charge from her, the situation had already worsened. The district Congress committees and PPCC once dissolved have not been formed till now and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar remained without any team. With the Punjab and Haryana High Court order on Kotkapura firing case, the trouble spilled over and then IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh, who later joined AAP, precipitated the crisis for the Congress with his claims before the media. However, now he is also facing questions on a few issues, but damage to the Congress has already been done. When the issues were about performance of the state government and MLAs Navjot Singh Sidhu and Pargat Singh questioned the CM and other MLAs were also unhappy about the performance, issues like caste and communal balance, which had never emerged before the current phase of crisis, were brought up. These issues, though originally brought in to deflect the focus from questions on performance of the government, have added one more layer of complexity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/how-congress-complicated-its-internal-crisis-in-punjab/articleshow/84487078.cms||IP Singh

The PIL filed by Nagrik Upbhokta Manch's P G Najpande contended that the cave paintings found in jungles of Buxwaha are the priceless treasure of our culture. The Archeological Survey of India has been duly informed about discovery of the rock paintings in Buxwaha but it has taken no step to declare the area a preserved area. Diamond mining in the jungles of Buxwaha could start anytime, therefore the court must intervene urgently to protect the site of prehistoric cave paintings in the Buxwaha jungles. Following preliminary arguments over the petition, the division bench of Chief Kustice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice V K Shukla issued notices to the respondents seeking a response in four weeks. Advocate Surendra Verma appeared in the case on behalf of the petitioner. The case will now come up for hearing on August 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/hc-notices-to-centre-state-over-buxwaha-mining/articleshow/84487075.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops quell fears after fake WhatsApp audio clip goes viral||KOLKATA: Police have issued an advisory assuring that no resident needs to panic about their security after a WhatsApp audio clip claimed that robbers dressed as cops were striking at Mukundapur-Ajoy Nagar-Sonarpur-Rajpur areas. The audio, cops claimed, was found to be fake and warned that anyone found circulating it would be liable to face legal action. The clip — lasting close to a minute and talking of “robbers posing as cops and knocking on the doors of a central government employee at 2am” — had gone viral across a large part of south and south suburban Kolkata in a span of few hours. A few residents’ associations also started thinking of convening emergency meeting to discuss security issues. According to Lalbazar sources, the audio was created to spread unnecessary panic based on a fictitious account. “One audio clip is getting circulated wherein one individual is heard claiming that he had learnt from a central government employee that some people in police uniform were trying to enter a person’s house at Ajoy Nagar in the middle of the night. The audio also claimed that later Mukundapur police station confirmed that they were not policemen. “However, here are the facts. Firstly, there is nothing called Mukundapur police station. Ajoy Nagar falls under Purba Jadavpur police station and this police station has not received any such communication. Local enquiry in Ajoy Nagar by police has also not substantiated what is being claimed in the audio message. In all probability, the audio clip is fake and is being circulated for creating panic among people,” said joint CP (Crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Both the Sonarpur and the Narendrapur police from Baruipur police division denied getting any such complaints from anyone. “Just like Mukundapur, there is no Rajpur police station as mentioned in the video,” said an officer from the Baruipur police division. Police sources said even the Baruipur cyber cell is trying to trace the origin of the message,” said an officer. The police said that they will also block the WhatsApp numbers of those found to be indiscriminately sharing the WhatsApp forward. “We are asking everyone to be a bit more vigilant. If you ever come across anything of this sort and have doubts, contact the local police station,” said an officer at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-quell-fears-after-fake-whatsapp-audio-clip-goes-viral/articleshow/84485501.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: No Eid prayer to be held on Red Road this year||KOLKATA: There will be no prayers for Eid-ul-Azha on Red Road this year. Earlier this week, the organisers of the biggest livestock market in the city, in Narkeldanga, decided not to set up shop this year due to the pandemic. Close to 3 lakh people congregate on Red Road on Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Azha every year to offer special prayers. But since 2020, prayers have not been held there as a safety measure to keep the virus in check. Even though cases have declined — after a surge due to the second wave — Calcutta Khilafat Committee, which organises the prayers every year, has decided not to hold the prayers on July 21. “The pandemic is not over and restrictions by the government are still in place. Our priority is the safety of everyone, so we do not want to take any chance. Health workers have warned of a third wave if we are not careful about social distancing and wearing masks. In view of the prevailing situation, we have decided not to hold prayers on Red Road on July 21,” said Nasir Ahmed, general secretary of Calcutta Khilafat Committee. The committee has urged people to offer prayers in small batches in their local mosques following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Many mosques are planning to hold multiple prayer sessions to prevent crowding. “People must either pray at home or at their local mosques following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said a member of the committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-eid-prayer-to-be-held-on-red-road-this-year/articleshow/84485560.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh cops exhume Chhatarpur woman’s body in Jhansi||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh police with the help of UP cops on Friday exhumed the body of a woman in Jhansi who died under mysterious circumstances in Chhatarpur last week. There were allegations of love jihad in the death which was denied by the local police. But the cops continued investigations and were bewildered when they learnt that the woman was buried in a Christian graveyard in Jhansi. Neither the woman nor the man to whom she was married were Christian. “Now the whole case will be investigated afresh with all the possible angles," a spokesman of Chhatarpur police said. Father of the woman Kishorilal Ahirwar asked, “According to the theory of police, the family of the man to whom she was married is Hindu. Then why did they bury our daughter.” “Even if they are followers if Islam, burying a dead in a Christian graveyard raises questions”, he said. “The truth must come out”, he told the local media. Exactly days ago, the Kishorilal had alleged that “it was a case of love jihad.” His theory was supported by members of right wing brigade who staged demonstrations in Chhatarpur demanding a probe. Police denied the allegations. A police spokesman said that it is not “correct” to link the issue with love jihad. The girl had said that she did not want to live with her parents because of her “step mother”. Her father Kishorilal Ahirwar said,"My daughter called me on July 5 pleading to save her, but when I reached her house, I found it was locked and there was no one around. Neighbours told me that she had died,” he said. She got married to a man in Chhatarpur where he lived with his family. Daughter of a small businessman resident of Chhatarpur, she had two kids. After the body was exhumed, a post mortem was conducted and her body was brought to Chhatarpur for funeral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-cops-exhume-chhatarpur-womans-body-in-jhansi-probe-cause-of-death/articleshow/84487079.cms||---

The ministry issued a gazette notification late Thursday night handing over powers of water release, granting approvals for construction of projects and hydel power generation to the two boards - the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB). While the state governments have to stop all ongoing projects immediately, the jurisdiction and powers of the boards will come into force from October 14. The decision, which was pending for the past few years, has been taken reportedly by the central ministry as both states are at loggerheads over water sharing and hydel power generation for the past few months. While Telangana has objected to the Rayalseema Lift Irrigation Project in AP, AP has opposed the manner in which Telangana is producing power from the irrigation projects. Stunned by the decision, Telangana has reportedly decided to take both legal and political action to stall the notification. The government is believed to have decided to approach Supreme Court and hold protests in Parliament. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held a meeting with irrigation department special chief secretary and engineer-in-chief on the notification on Friday evening. He also met TRS MPs and discussed how to protest in the upcoming Parliament session beginning on July 19. The government is planning to insist that the Centre finalise water allocations between Telangana and AP before implementing the notification. The Telangana government fears the new notification will have serious implications for the state projects as the Centre has taken over 107 major and medium irrigation projects, including 36 projects on Krishna and 71 on Godavari river in both the states. With the notification defining the jurisdiction of the boards, Telangana and AP will have no powers over irrigation projects (both completed and ongoing) in their respective states. However, the Centre did not touch minor irrigation projects. “Both governments should stop all ongoing works on unapproved projects as on the date of publication of this notification until the said projects are appraised and approved. If approvals are not obtained within six months after the publication of this notification, full or partial operation if any of the said ongoing unapproved projects shall cease to operate,” the notification said. The Union ministry said if there is any dispute relating to KRMB’s jurisdiction, it would be referred to the Centre and its decision would be final. Similarly matters relating to power generation, transmission, and distribution should be implemented by the states as per the directions of the boards, the notification added. To make the boards’ functioning neutral, the notification said, no person from Telangana and AP would be appointed as chairman, member-secretary, members and chief engineers of the KRMB and GRMB. At the same time, for the functioning of the boards, both the states have been asked to deposit Rs 200 crore to each board by each government. The ministry said instead of the state police, central forces would take over and protect the project sites. The Telangana government had withdrawn the case in Supreme Court on water sharing issue following the assurance given by the Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekawat during second Apex Council meeting in October 2020. While the decision on referring the water sharing issue to a new tribunal is pending, the Centre issued notification. The other problem is, according to the notification, the governments have to obtain approvals within six months from the date of notification which is impossible as every process takes several months. KCR had recently directed officials to generate hydel power at its full capacity to meet the power demand for lift irrigation projects. Now, Telangana has to take permission from the boards to generate hydel power. KCR reportedly told his MPs that the Centre was taking over all state subjects such as agriculture, education and now irrigation, which needs to be opposed both inside and outside Parliament.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-t-ap-war-centre-takes-over-projects-on-krishna-and-godavari/articleshow/84488364.cms||Koride Mahesh

The operators had asked for tax relief but as yet there has been no order for exemption. The operators stated that they will park their buses which within state and hand over the keys to the officials. Anil Jain, president, bus operator association, Rajasthan said, “Due to lockdown, we had been as it is facing losses but when the price of diesel went over Rs 100, even the maintenance of the buses had become a herculean task.

On Friday, Softbank-backed One97 Communications, the parent of digital payments startup Paytm, filed the draft prospectus with markets regulator Sebi that showed the total planned mobilisation through the offer will be shared equally by the existing shareholders who are selling through the offer (Rs 8,300 crore) and the company, which will issue new shares (Rs 8,300 crore). Till now, the Rs 15,475-crore IPO for government-run coal mining major Coal India, which closed in October 2010, is the biggest IPO in Indian history. Of the top five Indian IPOs ever, three -- Coal India, GIC (Rs 11,176 crore in 2017) and New India Assurance (Rs 9,600 crore in 2017) -- were the government's offer for divestment. The other two are Reliance Power (Rs 11,700 crore in 2008) and SBI Cards (Rs 10,355 crore in 2020. The biggest fund raising by an Indian company through the stock market route was a rights offer: In June 2020, Reliance Industries had successfully closed its Rs 53,125-crore rights offer. According to the draft prospectus, Noida-headquartered Paytm, which was last valued at $16 billion, will use Rs 4,300 crore of IPO proceeds to acquire consumers and merchants to strengthen its ecosystem. It will use another Rs 2,000 crore to invest in new business initiates and acquisitions. The startup, which counts China’s Ant Group and Alibaba, Japan’s Softbank, Elevation Capital (formerly SAIF Partners) and Warren Buffet-led Berkshire Hathaway among its backers, will also see most of these early investors selling parts of their stakes in the company. Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of the Tata Group, too, is expected to sell his stake, which accounts for less than 0.5% of the company, while founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma will dilute his holding as well. Paytm’s largest shareholder, Ant Group, along with its parent Alibaba group holds around 37%. The two entities together are expected to bring down their stake to less than 25% to enable Paytm to become a “professionally managed company” under Sebi guidelines. Sharma, who holds around 14% stake in Paytm, has also transferred 5% of his stake to VSS Holding, a company that he fully owns. The holding entity has received a nod to borrow a Rs 492-crore loan from One97 Communications. The funds will be put into Paytm Insuretech, an associate company of One97 Communications, which will in turn use them to acquire Raheja QBE General Insurance. Paytm had entered into an agreement in July 2020 to buy Raheja QBE General Insurance. The proposed deal is awaiting regulatory approvals. Paytm, however, clarified that there is no certainty whether the transaction will go ahead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-eyes-largest-indian-ipo-to-raise-rs-16600-crore/articleshow/84489201.cms||John Sarkar

Thirty five persons tested positive for Covid in the state, bringing its overall tally to 9,53,297. No death was reported due to Covid and the state’s overall toll remained at 8,947. Officials of the health department however said that as a minor spike in the Covid cases has been seen in states like Maharashtra and Kerala, people in the state who are now enjoying relaxations should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. “This is a crucial time when the cases are down. It is our responsibility to continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour as negligence can cost us,” Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent, RUHS, state’s biggest Covid care centre told TOI. Health minister Raghu Sharma too had cautioned people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Since new variants are cropping up, we should be careful and act responsibly by following Covid norms,” Sharma said. Senior officers of the health department said that fast-paced vaccination is the key to avoid the impact of third wave. “Centre should focus on providing timely vaccines to the state. We have a capacity to administer vaccines to 15 lakh people per day. Thus, Centre should send us good number of vaccines. In this month, we have 75 lakh people in the 18+ category who are due to get their second dose,” Sharma added. 11 districts in the state reported Covid infections: Udaipur (8), Jaipur (7), Alwar (4), Bikaner (4), Jodhpur (3), Tonk (2), Nagaur (2), Ajmer (2), Churu (1), Sriganganagar (1) and Jhalawar (1). The state’s active cases are now 503 while 54 persons got discharged from the hospital. “Best part is, out of these 503 active cases, those who are hospitalised are not in a very critical condition,” said an officer with the health department. Since July 5, the number of active cases in the state has reduced by 54%. On July 5, the state had 1,092 active cases which has decreased to 503.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/covid-loosens-grip-35-test-positive-no-fresh-deaths/articleshow/84497373.cms||---

Till 6pm 1,07,547 got the jab at various vaccination centres. However, health department after receiving 7.77 lakh fresh lot of doses is hopeful to have good vaccination on Saturday and Sunday when they are expecting vaccination to gain momentum. With this the state is now left with nearly 10 lakh doses. On Friday, long queues of beneficiaries were seen at the districts including Jaipur, Sikar, Dausa, Jodhpur and Jhunjhunu but the people coming to get vaccine were largely disappointed. “They asked us to get vaccine and while we are trying there are either lesser vaccines or they are into making the records,” said Anupriya Singh an 18-year-old girl who was trying to get her second dose at a vaccination centre at Jhotwara. “With some more doses left, we are expecting to give at least 10 lakh doses in next two days. As 7.77 lakh vaccines were received by late evening we started sending it to various districts including the far flung districts in the state,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer vaccination. In this month at least 75 lakh beneficiaries of 18+ are eligible to get their second dose and the state government has been pursuing this issue with the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vaccination-to-pick-up-speed-today/articleshow/84487917.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court blow to Transstroy, banks’ heat on directors||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday withdrew a protection order issued earlier in favour of directors of Transstroy India Ltd company founded by TDP’s former MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao and said lender banks were free to proceed against the personal guarantors-cum-directors of the company which allegedly duped banks to the tune of Rs 9,000 crore. The court made it clear that promoter-directors of companies, who stand as personal guarantors for thousands of crores of loans generated, cannot escape the punitive consequences that flow from the aggrieved lenders. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave this interim direction while hearing an application filed by Canara Bank. Appearing for the bank, senior counsel Deepak Bhattacharjee informed the court that Transstroy came to court challenging the RBI’s circular asking all banks to declare suspicious bank accounts as fraud accounts to prevent other banks from being duped by the same defaulters. A division bench had earlier stayed the circular on the ground that it would be unfair to unilaterally declare loan accounts as fraud accounts without hearing the borrowers. “Taking advantage of this protection, Transstroy is preventing the proceedings against it before the National Company Law Tribunal and Debt Recovery Tribunal, etc. The Supreme Court recently gave a ruling that personal guarantors cannot escape responsibilty in such matters,” Bhattacharjee said. Agreeing with Canara Bank’s argument that personal guarantors should not be allowed to make use of the interim protection given to the companies, the bench recalled its earlier order and gave liberty to the banks to proceed against the personal guarantors-cum-directors. The petition in Transstroy case was filed by Cherukuri Sridhar, chairman and managing director of Transstroy, which is currently under liquidation. The bench, it can be recalled, had earlier granted similar freedom to the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate to continue their probe into the loan fraud and diversion of money, etc. The bench also heard petitions from Sabbineni Surendra of Coastal Projects, whose borrowings have been categorised as fraud account, after his firm evaded repayment of Rs 5,000 crore and Hima Bindu of VMC Projects for defaulting on Rs 1,700 crore loans. It also heard disgruntled YSRC MP Raghu Rama Krishna Raju’s Ind-Barath Thermal Power Ltd company which challenged the decision of the banks to declare its Rs 826 crore loan as a fraud account. All these cases were adjourned to September 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-blow-to-transstroy-banks-heat-on-directors/articleshow/84488385.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Waterman’ backs Centre’s intervention||HYDERABAD: Water conservationist, Magsaysay and 2015 Stockholm Water Prize laureate Rajendra Singh on Friday supported the decision of the Union government to intervene in the water war between Telangana and AP. He told TOI that Centre’s intervention was always necessary in such matters. “The Constitution too says that all such disputes should be resolved through legal network,” he said. “Our constitution asks Parliament to intervene when disputes persist between states.” He also welcomed the Centre’s move that the tribunals have the jurisdiction to preside over and resolve inter-state disputes. “The intervention through tribunals is very much justified,” Rajendra, known as the ‘Water man of India’, said. He said tribunals are part of judiciary and introducing intervention through tribunals was justified. Senior counsel and Telangana state’s first advocate general K Ramakrishna Reddy said the Krishna and Godavari river water management tribunals were created as per sections 84 and 85 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act for the purpose of resolving disputes between the two successor states of Telangana and AP. He said asking these tribunals to preside over the affairs of water distribution and power generation was not wrong. On the Centre’s decision to entrust the river water issues, irrigation projects and power generation to these tribunals, Reddy said it was the mandate of the law. “The AP Reorganisation Act is not an ordinary piece of legislation. It was made in tune with Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. Its sections 84 and 85 ask both the states to resolve the disputes through the Centre and tribunals,” he said. He further said: “The notification issued by the central government in this regard is valid. The senior counsel said the Centre has got powers to do so under Article 262 of the Constitution. Water conservationist Rajendra Singh welcomed the Centre’s move that the tribunals have the jurisdiction to preside over and resolve inter-state disputes||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/waterman-backs-centres-intervention/articleshow/84487104.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Centre cannot usurp Telangana powers’: Minister T Harish Rao||The actions of the jal shakti ministry by declaring the jurisdictions of KRMB and GRMB and taking over all the major and medium irrigation projects are nothing but encroaching upon the powers of Telangana. Irrigation is a state subject and is not in the concurrent list. The Centre cannot take over all the powers of the state. The Telangana government has been fighting for its rightful share in Krishna waters seeking rectification of injustice meted out to Telangana region in unified AP. But, the Centre has done injustice to Telangana once again by issuing a gazette notification on Krishna and Godavari basins’ jurisdictions unilaterally. The ministry of jal shakti should have consulted the Telangana government and taken the opinion before finalising the jurisdiction. There are no disputes on the irrigation projects built on Godavari river and there are no common projects also. Yet, the ministry chose to include 71 projects in Godavari basin under the purview of GRMB. Presently, of the total 811 tmcft of Krishna water, Telangana got only 299 tmcft in temporary allocation while 512 tmcft was allotted to AP. Telangana should have got 565 tmcft and the balance should go to AP. CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had written several letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the jal shakti ministry to resolve the water issues. On the assurances given by Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat during the second apex council meeting held in October 2020, the state government had withdrawn cases in the Supreme Court and written a letter to the Centre. But, there was no response from the Centre. It seems the Centre has acted upon letters written by AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy who wanted the jal shakti ministry to take over all the projects on Krishna and Godavari rivers. BJP Telangana president Bandi Sanjay also sought a similar action from the Centre. Going by this, both Jagan and Sanjay influenced the Centre on issuing this gazette notification. The writer is finance minister of Telangana. (As told to Mahesh Koride)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-cannot-usurp-powers/articleshow/84487099.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Over four lakh Maharashtra students back in classrooms||NAGPUR: As Maharashtra allowed schools in rural area to reopen from July 15 onwards, subject to various conditions, over four lakh students were back in classrooms on day one. As per data shared by the state education department, these student numbers accounted for around 9% of those eligible. Reopening permission has been granted only to schools in rural areas and that too for students in Std VIII-XII. Last year when schools reopened, the broader permission was for every geographical area, which meant the high population density areas like Pune, Nagpur saw their students streaming back to school. Sharad Bhandarkar, extension officer with the local education department, said this time the reopening procedure is a bit more complicated. “Now, the final decision rests with a special committee headed by the village sarpanch. Then other members like gram sewaks and education officials join in. So this is an extra layer of bureaucracy which prolongs the process of reopening,” said Bhandarkar. In 2020, the school reopening decision was left to the school management and parents. In Nagpur, almost a thousand students attended school Thursday. This number is likely to go up as schools start getting permission from village sarpanch and intimate the education department. Nagpur zilla parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbejkar said, “We are updating the school reopening figures daily.” District education officer Chintaman Vanjari said, “Our officials are coordinating with schools and committee officials. All help needed to restart schools will be provided.” Last year when the state government allowed schools to reopen in November, the attendance figures kept on rising steadily. At one point almost 50 lakh students were back in classrooms. A senior education official who retired recently said that those figures need to be looked at in a different way. “In fact, almost one crore students were back in classrooms. Only 50% of the students were allowed to attend on any given day, so schools were calling them on alternate days. If you are looking at how many individuals attended schools, then it will definitely be near the one crore-mark,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-4-lakh-maha-students-back-in-classrooms/articleshow/84485658.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

New cases were reported in single digits from all the districts of the state. Maximum cases were reported from Bhopal where 6 people tested positive, followed by Sagar where 2 new cases were reported. And on Friday positivity rate fell further to 0.01% in the state. Positivity rate is the number of people testing positive out every 100 samples tested. On July 16, 78,898 samples were tested and of it, 15 were found positive, thus on an average 1 person out of every around 5,000 who were tested was found to be positive.

---||Nagpur||SSC batch of 2021: ‘Real’ exam still two years away||NAGPUR: The SSC batch of 2021 will not only go down as the first ever which cleared this landmark without appearing for the board exam but will also have the longest wait for a ‘real’ exam - one in which they can actually fail. An English subject teacher, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Till Std VIII, these students cannot be failed anyway due to provisions of Right To Education Act. So, landing in Std IX is guaranteed for everyone.” Here, they would have appeared for their first test where getting promoted is not guaranteed. “Their Std IX second term exam was due in April 2020, but due to the national-level lockdown it got cancelled. So, based on internal unit tests and first term, all these students were promoted,” the teacher said. SSC 2021 was supposed to be their first real exam but the deadly second wave of Covid-19 led to cancellation of this too. For no fault of theirs, the batch of 2021 now finds themselves heading towards their 11th academic year in formal schooling without having to face a major exam. A junior college principal said, “In Std XI you can fail, there’s no law to prevent that. But since it’s an internal exam every college ensures that borderline marks are given and the student moves on to HSC level.” The principal said not having the fear of failure is not good. “No school or junior college wants to fail their students, hence it is so vital for children to go through SSC board exams. Here they too get an idea of where they stand at the state-level, and maybe even face failure. This actually helps them to prepare for Std XII in a better way. By directly landing up in Std XII, many of these students might find themselves struggling post-exams,” the principal said. Last year too, Covid-19 pandemic hit the state when SSC exams were underway. However, just one theory paper was cancelled because exams had started well before the first case was reported in the state. HSC exams had already wrapped up by that time, hence it was a completely regular year for them too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ssc-batch-of-2021-real-exam-still-two-years-away/articleshow/84485691.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Jaipur||No relaxations for kanwar yatra in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The state government on Friday issued fresh guidelines maintaining a ban on all religious processions and functions, including kanwar yatra in Rajasthan. The new guidelines prohibit large gatherings at public and religious places for prayers on Eid al-Adha. Similarly, large congregations at public and religious places for Chaturmas, which is observed every year for four months by Jain devotees, will not be permitted as per new norms. All other religious events also remain strictly prohibited in Rajasthan as per the Covid protocol. The government, however, has allowed the opening up of public parks from 5am to 4pm for all. But those who have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine can visit the park till 8pm. The fresh guidelines will come into effect from Saturday morning. Several devotees were hoping for some relaxation for kanwar yatra this year. There are over 3,000 people who participate every year in the yatra in Jaipur alone. Jaipur has over 12,000 temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. People every year come to Galta Kund to take the water and walk across faraway temples “As per my estimate, sometimes the number of yatris go beyond 3,000. This does not include people who travel to Haridwar and other places. Kanwar yatra has one major rule-one it starts, a devotee can not stop anywhere and have to keep the water on the shoulder at all times,” said Bharat Sharma, who runs dharohar Bachao Samiti and participates in the yatra. Advocate Akshaya Sharma, who participated in kanwar yatras said that due to the Covid-19, many devotees themselves do not wish to go on the yatra this time. “People themselves shied away from participating in the yatra because of the pandemic last year, and because many people have recovered from the illness, they are unlikely to go on yatra this year too,” he further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-relaxations-for-kanwar-yatra-in-raj/articleshow/84487927.cms||---

Congress criticized this, pointing out that even PM Modi had gone to a hospital to get vaccinated. A video has gone viral showing Pragya Thakur, the Bhopal MP, receiving her first vaccine in her home. State Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja tweeted, “Just a few days ago, our Bhopal MP Pragya Singh Thakur who was playing basketball and dancing to the rhythm of the drum, called a team to her home and got vaccinated.” “From Modiji to Shivrajji, all BJP leaders went to the hospital to get the vaccine shot, but why and on what grounds did our MP qualify for the exemption?” he asked. Pragya, 51, took her jab earlier this week. The state immunization office told reporters that the MP is eligible for vaccination at her home under special rules applicable to the elderly and disabled persons.

Samastha Kerala Sunni Students Federation (SKSSF) said that the state government handled the issue of minority scholarship in an irresponsible manner taking cover under the court order. The state secretariat of the organization has said that the government has taken a stand that neglects the Muslim community. “The basic flaw in the whole matter was that the welfare scheme which should have been wholly-granted to the Muslim community was linked with the minorities’ welfare department. The state government should now explain how it is going to take action as per the Paloli committee recommendations,” said the SKSSF state secretariat statement. SKSSF added that it is denial of justice to cut the budget outlay for minority welfare schemes and to distribute to others schemes wholly meant for Muslim community. The meeting was presided over by SKSSF state president Panakkad Syed Hameedali Shihab Thangal. Kerala Muslim Jamaat said that the authorities should desist from scuttling the guidelines issued to overcome the backwardness of the Muslim community. The state government should give serious consideration to safeguarding scholarships for Muslim students, said the Muslim Jamaat district committee statement issued on Friday. Asking the government not to disregard the Sachar and Paloli committee reports, the organization asked the government to fully implement the Paloli Commission report and stand by justice. Popular Front of India said that the decision of the government to rejig the reservation ratio was not a right step. The government’s assessment of the issue being a dispute between two communities was flawed, it added. Solidarity Youth Movement said that the state government should take steps to resolve the backwardness of Muslim community rather than implement a court order which was wrong. Meanwhile, INL leader and ports minister Ahmed Devarkovil said that the state government can take a decision by taking all sections into confidence and it has acted in that manner only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/muslim-outfits-flay-govt-for-rejig-of-minority-scholarship-ratio/articleshow/84485802.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Dinshaw’s launches Gir cow milk, no claims on A2 yet||Nagpur: Dinshaw’s, one of the major milk brands in the city, is now eyeing a niche market out of the rising popularity of Gir cow. The company has come up with a brand of exclusive Gir cow milk. At the same time, it is also not being marketed as A2 milk — the tag which is given by a number groups pushing milk of indigenous bovine.It’s being claimed by independent groups that the Indian breeds have A2 milk, which is beneficial as against the ‘harmful’ A1 milk of foreign breeds like Jersey and Holstein. “However, there is no lab available to certify A2 or A1. So, it is just being marketed as Gir cow milk,” Ajay Upadhyaya, vice-president of Dinshaw’s Dairy Foods Private Limited.The push for indigenous breed of cow by enthusiasts has made the Gir cow from Saurashtra region of Gujarat famous. Much before it was promoted in India, Brazil had imported the breed and after the selection it has developed high milk yielding animals.“The plan was under consideration for almost a year. We had been getting inquiries for cow milk. Finally, the new product was launched,” said Upadhyaya.There are company’s chilling centres in pockets of Wardha and Nagpur districts where the Gir cow’s milk is available. It was decided to buy it separately and market it as an independent brand, said Upadhyaya. The milk is stored in separate tanks.Initially, around 10,000 litres of Gir cow milk is being procured. As against this, Dinshaw’s on the whole buys nearly 2 lakh litres daily. The demand for Gir cow milk at present is at 2,000 to 2,500 litres. The milk price is slightly higher than the other varieties, he said.Gir cow is not new to the region. There are settlements of ethnic herdsmen from Gujarat, who have been living here for at least four decades after droughts in their home state forced their migration. The herdsmen have been the traditional breeders of the Gir cow as they belong to Saurashtra where the breed belongs to.In Vidarbha, the herdsmen have been selling the milk to local dairy processing units, including some major brands. “The milk is poured at the collections centres and fetches the same rate as others,” said Ramabhai Jograna, a herder from Katol.Jograna said according data collected by his community, there are 20,000 Gir cows in Nagpur district alone. The milk yield would be around 1.5 lakh litres a day. The herder also said his people, who have been supplying Gir milk for years, should also get the recognition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dinshaws-launches-gir-cow-milk-no-claims-on-a2-yet/articleshow/84485710.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Agra||Proposed changes in NCERT textbooks ‘political, biased, misinformed’, says Indian History Congress||AGRA: The largest body of historians in the country, the Indian History Congress (IHC), has objected to the proposed overhaul of school textbooks across the country, saying that it is being done for political, not academic, reasons. At the beginning of the year, the Rajya Sabha secretariat had notified that a change in school textbook curriculum would be discussed by a parliamentary standing committee. In what it called a “reform”, it said the focus would be on removing “unhistorical facts” and “distortions about our national heroes”, and on ensuring “equal or proportionate references to all periods of Indian history”. Public responses were invited till June 30 and the deadline was later extended till July 15, when the IHC sent its response. The IHC, established in 1935, has over 35,000 members. “The IHC is much disturbed at the misinformation and biased view that is being projected in the name of bringing reforms in the existing NCERT textbooks,” the letter, a copy of which is with TOI, said. “The critique of the existing textbooks implicit in the ‘reforms’ being contemplated is not emerging from any expert body of nationally and internationally recognised historians but from a political position favoured by non-academic votaries of prejudice.” The reason, the IHC said, it feared a “distortion” is because there is a precedent. “School textbooks written for the NCERT by some of the tallest scholars in the country … were actually removed, and in their places books with a clear sectarian, majoritarian bias were introduced in 2002,” the letter said. After significant blowback, the books were withdrawn a year later. IHC members told TOI that books must be constantly reviewed and scrutinised. “But this should be done involving recognised scholars, with attention to academic content, derived from a research-based understanding of historical periods,” IHC secretary Prof Mahalaxmi Ramakrishnan said. “What we oppose is any attempt to present a distorted understanding of the historical past,” IHC president Amiya Bagchi added. Besides, the IHC said, the reasons cited for the proposed change are unfounded. “The claim that there are ‘unhistorical facts and distortions’ with regard to national heroes is completely false,” the letter said. “Further, the claim regarding lack of equal space accorded to various periods of Indian history is not borne out by the books currently in use by the NCERT,” it added. In an accompanying note to establish what it said, the IHC listed primary sources, proportion of representation of each period of history, “national heroes” and “historical female figures” in the NCERT textbooks in use by students of classes VI to XII. What added to the fears, IHC members said, was how the undergraduate history course was redesigned this year. The first paper proposed, for instance, is ‘Idea of Bharat’. “As if the concept of Bharat was there since time immemorial,” said IHC executive committee member Prof Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, who teaches at the Aligarh Muslim University’s history department. “Also, in the name of balancing, most aspects of the medieval period have been removed. What has, however, been emphasised is communal strife — so, most Sultans of Delhi Sultanate are out, Akbar is out, but Aurangzeb and Shivaji are retained.” A day before the IHC sent out its letter, the Archaeological Survey of India had announced it was going to remove plaques at Rakta Talai in Rajasthan which say Maharana Pratap’s forces retreated from the battle at Haldighati, fought against Akbar in 1576. New plaques will be put up soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/proposed-changes-in-ncert-textbooks-political-biased-misinformed-says-ihc/articleshow/84483196.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Hyderabad||Two states torn apart by ‘lifeline’ Krishna||HYDERABAD: Sharing of Krishna river water has long been a serious bone of contention between Telangana and Andhra regions even before a separate Telangana state came into existence in 2014. The simmering dispute over sharing of river water escalated and even led to a strained relationship between Telangana and AP.  For both Telugu states, the mighty Krishna is a lifeline — for irrigation and drinking water needs. Telangana says Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda and Rangareddy districts, which are considered drought-prone areas, depend heavily on Krishna water. AP says it cannot do without Krishna water to parch Rayalaseema region, a drought-prone and water scarce region, especially Prakasam and Nellore districts. To meet their requirements, Telangana took up Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Scheme (PRLIS) to meet the needs of erstwhile Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda and RR districts, while AP launched Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) and Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS) works last year. The trigger was when AP proposed RLIS across the Krishna and RDS. Telangana not only called RLIS and RDS illegal but also announced it will not agree to 66:34 water allocation between AP and Telangana. It went on generating hydel power from various projects, which caused more tension at the dam sites. Senior irrigation officials said it all started in 2005 when former CM of united AP YS Rajasekhara Reddy enhanced the capacity of Pothireddypadu head regulator to draw 3 tmcft of water through Srisailam backwaters instead of originally decided 1 tmcft. At that time, leaders from Telangana region opposed the move. For that matter, both states have been at each other’s throat complaining that irrigation projects are being taken up without approval from the Centre and KRMB. The only time both states exhibited camaraderie was when Telangana CM KCR invited his AP counterpart Jagan Mohan Reddy for inauguration of Kaleshwaram project. But, that was in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-states-torn-apart-by-lifeline-krishna/articleshow/84487109.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||Don’t reveal applicant’s caste during interviews, minister writes to UPSC||New Delhi: Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam on Friday wrote a letter to the chairman of Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), suggesting ways of ensuring that no candidate faces any caste-based discrimination. In his letter, Gautam suggested that the possibility of caste-based discrimination can be eliminated by keeping the caste of the candidate hidden. He also suggested that interviewers should be chosen randomly instead of “clubbing reserved and general category candidates separately”.. The minister said he has received several representations from candidates from reserved communities who appear in various job interviews conducted by UPSC. “Many of these candidates have alleged that there is a systematic discrimination in awarding the interview marks to reserved category candidates. Further, they have suggested that the possibility of this discrimination can be eliminated if the interview board members are not made aware of the caste of the candidate and the interviewees are chosen randomly, instead of clubbing reserved and general category candidates separately,” he has written. Gautam has written that these suggestions have merit and can be easily acted upon by the UPSC.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 11 bodies found in well collapse, search will be on for 2 more days||BHOPAL: Eleven bodies were pulled out of the collapsed well in Madhya Pradesh’s Vidisha on Friday. The dead include a father and son, who were among those who had rushed to rescue a 13-year-old boy from the well, which caved in under their weight on Thursday night. The body of the teenager, Ravi Ahirwar, was among the last to be found. “After 24 hours, the rescue operation is over, but we will barricade it and continue searching for two more days,” CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted around 11pm on Friday. Chouhan announced an ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each for the kin of those killed, and a compensation of Rs 50,000 each to the injured. He monitored the rescue operation from the situation room at Mantralaya, and interacted virtually with officials who were on the site. He has ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too expressed anguish, over the loss of life and announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of the dead. In a hamlet of barely 50-60 families, not a house has been left untouched by the tragedy. Amid the wails of the kin of those dead, was the cry of the boy’s father. Rescuers arrived three hours late, said an anguished Omkar Ahirwar on Friday even as rescuers frantically tried to pump out the water. The perennial well, which proved a boon for the village in summer, turned out to be a major hurdle in rescue operations. Barely 200m from a pond and 400m from a river, it filled up faster than pumps could drain it. Rescuers came after 3 hrs: Father of boy killed in VidishaOmkar hadn’t left the site in nearly 24 hours. He collapsed in sobs as his son’s body was finally pulled out. “My boys Ravi and Sanjay had come here to fetch water around 6pm. Ravi lost his footing and fell into the well. Sanjay screamed for help and two villagers, who were nearby, immediately jumped in but they couldn’t find my son,” said Omkar. Meanwhile, Sanjay ran from house to house shouting for help. In the close-knit community, a crowd of around 50 gathered quickly at the well to look for him. The concrete slab that ringed it couldn’t take the load and caved in, pulling the rescuers into the water. “I tried calling dial 100 and the CM helpline but network was poor. They didn't give a proper response. Then, the well caved in,” said Omkar, adding that a rescue team arrived after 3 hours. By then, villagers had pulled out nine persons with ropes. NDRF and SDRF personnel rescued around 20 people. The village, in Ganjbasoda area, is around 100km from Bhopal. DGP Vivek Johri said earlier on Friday all possible efforts are being made to trace those missing. Policemen, NDRF and administrative officials spent a sleepless night in the rescue effort, he said, adding: “The continuous natural flow of water into the well made our operations difficult.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/11-bodies-found-in-well-collapse-search-will-be-on-for-2-more-days/articleshow/84487113.cms||---

The Perur all-woman police identified the accused as V Palanisamy, a resident of Valaiyapalayam near Karumathampatti. He was separated from his wife, with whom he has a 16-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter. An investigation officer said the victim, a Class IX student, was daughter of Palanisamy’s friend, who was also his co-worker. “Palanisamy used to visit the girl’s house often. When her parents were away at work, he visited her at her house on July 13 and kidnapped her. When her parents failed to trace her after returning home from work, they lodged a complaint with the Karumathampatti police, who registered a missing person case.” Preliminary inquiry revealed that Palanisamy had kidnapped the minor girl and married her. Police secured Palanisamy on Thursday and rescued the minor girl. “He had raped the girl on several occasions in the past few days. We have booked him under Sections 5(l) and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act,” the officer said. Palanisamy was produced before the special court for Pocso cases and lodged in Udumalpet sub-jail under judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/45-yr-old-man-arrested-for-kidnapping-and-marrying-15-yr-old-girl/articleshow/84487116.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Std XI admissions likely to see rush due to bumper results||NAGPUR: Std XI admissions are likely to see an unprecedented rush this time, particularly for the leading colleges, thanks to nearly cent percent Std X results where marks were awarded on the basis of past performance due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, over 24,000 seats were vacant in city colleges out of 59,250 after the centralized admissions process (CAP). With a big improvement in the results this time, all these seats are expected to be filled up, as per deputy directorate of education officials here. After the seats weren’t filled up last year post CAP, multiple rounds were arranged for the students, yet the seats remained vacant. The officials attributed this trend that emerged in the last few years due to the mushrooming of new colleges on the city's outskirts which didn’t come under the CAP jurisdiction. Many of them allegedly have nexus with coaching classes and provide facilities for students to skip college lectures. In some cases, even the college’s biometric attendance machine was installed on the premises of coaching classes, as per the officials. A case was filed by some city-based colleges against this unethical practice in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, where it’s pending. Dr Ambedkar Junior College vice-principal Kabir Rawalkar said, “The vacancies are increasing due to colleges which deliberately open their campuses outside the city limits to avoid monitoring by the state education department. They are the ultimate beneficiaries of vacancies in the city, as they attract most of the lot due to leeway offered to them of skipping the college lectures.” Rawalkar added, “Even commerce and arts streams witnessed huge vacancies. We’re expecting a better position this time in view of bumper results.” The officials said that the demand would increase not only for Std 11 admissions, but also for diploma and certificate courses offered by various polytechnics and Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in the city and outskirts, due to the jump in the results. Even polytechnics have witnessed big vacancies in the last few years. The officials added that students shouldn’t worry as the government would grant permission to increase seats if they are filled up in the CAP. “The colleges can apply to increase 20% seats through the education department, which then sends the proposal to Mumbai for clearance. Except for the last couple of years, the colleges used to apply for increasing seats due to the high number of admissions,” they said.

---||Hyderabad||Stunned Telangana to move apex court, hold protests in Parliament||HYDERABAD: Stunned by the Union Jal Shakti ministry’s decision to take over all major and medium irrigation projects on the Krishna and Godavari basins in both Telugu states, Telangana has reportedly decided to take both legal and political action to stall the notification. The government is believed to have decided to approach Supreme Court and hold protests in Parliament. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held a meeting with irrigation department special chief secretary and engineer-in-chief on the notification on Friday evening. He also met TRS MPs and discussed how to protest in the upcoming Parliament session beginning on July 19. The government is planning to insist that the Centre finalise water allocations between Telangana and AP before implementing the notification. The Telangana government fears the new notification will have serious implications for the state projects as the Centre has taken over 107 major and medium irrigation projects, including 36 projects on Krishna and 71 on Godavari river in both the states. With the notification defining the jurisdiction of the boards, Telangana and AP will have no powers over irrigation projects (both completed and ongoing) in their respective states. However, the Centre did not touch minor irrigation projects. “Both governments should stop all ongoing works on unapproved projects as on the date of publication of this notification until the said projects are appraised and approved. If approvals are not obtained within six months after the publication of this notification, full or partial operation if any of the said ongoing unapproved projects shall cease to operate,” the notification said. The Union ministry said if there is any dispute relating to KRMB’s jurisdiction, it would be referred to the Centre and its decision would be final. Similarly matters relating to power generation, transmission, and distribution should be implemented by the states as per the directions of the boards, the notification added. To make the boards’ functioning neutral, the notification said, no person from Telangana and AP would be appointed as chairman, member-secretary, members and chief engineers of the KRMB and GRMB. At the same time, for the functioning of the boards, both the states have been asked to deposit Rs 200 crore to each board by each government. The ministry said instead of the state police, central forces would take over and protect the project sites. The Telangana government had withdrawn the case in Supreme Court on water sharing issue following the assurance given by the Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekawat during second Apex Council meeting in October 2020. While the decision on referring the water sharing issue to a new tribunal is pending, the Centre issued notification. The other problem is, according to the notification, the governments have to obtain approvals within six months from the date of notification which is impossible as every process takes several months. KCR had recently directed officials to generate hydel power at its full capacity to meet the power demand for lift irrigation projects. Now, Telangana has to take permission from the boards to generate hydel power. KCR reportedly told his MPs that the Centre was taking over all state subjects such as agriculture, education and now irrigation, which needs to be opposed both inside and outside Parliament.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stunned-t-to-move-apex-court-hold-protests-in-parl/articleshow/84487115.cms||Koride Mahesh

Earlier, the curfew was supposed to be imposed between July 17 and July 25. However, owing to objections raised by the traders, stating they will lose business if the curfew remains for nine days. So, Solapur district collector Milind Shambharkar has decided to impose curfew for different locations on different days. The longest curfew of eight days will be in place surrounding the Vitthal-Rukhmini temple, starting from July 18. The curfew in Pandharpur town and neighbouring Gopalpur village will be of seven days from July 18 to 24. While curfew in the rest of the eight villages surrounding Pandharpur town will for five days till July 22.

---||Nagpur||At 99.84%, Nagpur division at bottom in SSC results due to ‘clerical errors’||NAGPUR: Even after a record 99.84 passing percentage, Nagpur division languished at the bottom of the statewide SSC results ranking due to what board officials claim are “clerical errors”. SSC results, which were declared on Friday without even a single exam being held this summer due to the Covid-19 pandemic, saw 99.95% of registered students in the state pass. And Nagpur division is almost certain to touch that level, if not breach it, once these errors are rectified. Due to exams being cancelled because of the devastating Covid-19 second wave, SSC students were assessed based on internal assessments done in Std IX and X with 50% weightage to each class. Hence, it was not really surprising that Maharashtra witnessed a massive surge in passing percentages. Konkan recorded a 100% pass rate while every other division, except Nagpur, was near the 99.95% mark. Neighbouring Amravati division clocked an astounding 99.98% pass rate and was placed second in the division-wise ranking in Maharashtra. With almost the same number of students as Nagpur division, Amravati’s performance is quite notable. In Nagpur division comprising six districts, there was just one student who did not “appear for exams”. Technically, this means he/she was unavailable for assessment which could have been done online, offline or over the phone too. Around 1.6 lakh fresh students registered in Nagpur division for SSC, of which only this one student was not assessed. This single student has become an enigma, because it’s not known why he/she did not get in touch with the school. Board officials say due to student confidentiality they cannot retrieve information regarding the same. Though Nagpur division finds itself in an embarrassing position, board secretary Madhuri Savarkar told TOI that the situation is “temporary”. "Our numbers got affected because results of just over a thousand students have been reserved, which does not mean failed. We have noticed clerical errors made by schools while tabulating their marks, which is why we have put them in reserve category (SEE BOX). We are rectifying these mistakes on a war-footing and it will be reflected in the official record within a week or two.” From today itself the staff has started punching in rectified details, she said. “It shall be sent to our Pune HQ. For the other students we have started collating data and will identify the specific errors and update those as well. Once Pune office approves the changes, it shall reflect in the official records,” she said. The first batch of data that’s being rectified relates to students who were given ‘zero’ by their teachers, even though it should have been ‘absent’. Savarkar said, “This time marks are being entered in database by schools itself and zero means failure.” But schools could have conducted exams online too, so the absent factor does not make immediate sense. The only explanation could be that the student did not respond at all to the school’s call. Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh), said, “The onus was definitely on schools when it came to marks tabulation. 50% of weightage was to Std IX score while the rest we had to collate from internal assessments. Even I am surprised why anyone would mark a student as absent, as the same online test or oral exam could have been conducted later.” Another principal, who did not wish to be identified, said that at the state-level too the board must enquire as to why students have failed. “How can you fail in a year when exams are not being held. Schools are marking on internal assignments and oral exams or a projects type of test. It’s impossible to fail if the student has attempted internal assignments,” said the principal. Still Savarkar does not rule out the chances of a few students failing. “It may happen but they all will be able to proceed to Std XI because in Maharashtra we have the ATKT rule. So, even if a student has been unable to clear two subjects, s/he can continue to Std XI without any problem,” said Savarkar.

In a press conference, Bharadwaj claimed that BJP chief Adesh Gupta has admitted that the municipal corporations are dens of corruption. “Interestingly, many of the people who have started this mission are the same people against whom we have proofs of graft presented in similar press conferences. We want Adesh Gupta to investigate these issues,” said Bharadwaj. Gupta in a tweet in Hindi on Thursday urged people to make video films if anyone from municipal corporations seeks bribes for doing any work and hand it to the Delhi BJP for taking required action.  He stated that irrespective of the stature of the person seeking bribe, strict action will be taken against them because BJP has always been intolerant towards corruption and is working with a zero tolerance policy in the corporations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-must-investigate-all-corpn-graft-cases-aap/articleshow/84487955.cms||---
---||Kochi||HC orders audit of facilities at outlets||Kochi: State government should conduct an audit of the facilities at each of the liquor retail outlets in the state, the high court said on Friday. The directive was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran after the government, excise commissioner, and Bevco informed the court that steps are being taken to decrease crowding in front of liquor retail outlets. In the interim order, the court said it certainly is a welcome step but the battle has only begun. The excise commissioner and Bevco will certainly have to ensure that every retail counter is accounted for and steps should be taken to protect the collective dignity of the society and the dignity of the customers as is required under the constitutional mandate. The court’s order of Friday said, “Even though some steps appears to have been now taken, albeit, after four years since the judgment of this Court, I am certain that a lasting solution can be obtained only if the Excise Commissioner and the Managing Director, Bevco launch a comprehensive audit of the facilities and suitability of each retail liquor outlet in Kerala.” Directing the authorities to inform the steps being taken in the matter, the court has scheduled further hearing in the case on July 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-orders-audit-of-facilities-at-outlets/articleshow/84485863.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Aarey floods, Mithi swells after overnight downpour soaks Mumbai||MUMBAI: A steady spell of hard, driving rain that shook people from their slumber after midnight Thursday went on to inundate the city on Friday. For the first time, an undeveloped open space like Aarey Colony flooded over, causing concern among residents and environmentalists. Mithi river swelled its banks in Kurla, prompting the BMC to evacuate 250 residents to safety. The downpour in the early morning hours overwhelmed Mumbai’s suburbs in particular. IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded 253mm of rainfall between July 15-16, the second highest 24-hour shower in a decade. Aarey Colony resident Tabrez Sayed said the road near Unit no. 22, close to Powai check naka, was flooded till 11am. “This is the first time ever that this area has flooded,” he said. Aarey Conservation Group activists blamed the construction of retaining walls along Oshiwara river, that flows through the colony, for the flooding in the open areas. “Aarey Colony never flood-ed till two years ago. The walls along Mithi river and Oshiwara river must be demolished so that there is exchange of water between the forest and river,” said activist D Stalin. Activist Zoru Bathena said the waterlogging had occurred on a day when the tide did not even cross the 4.5-metre level. “In fact, at 9am, there was a low tide of 1.3m. Flooding no longer has any relation with the tide. It is connected with the destruction of existing flood control systems,” he said. Activist Amrita Bhattacharjee said massive amounts of debris have been dumped along the Mithi on JVLR, contributing to the inundation. The BMC’s claims of having carried out “104% desilting” evoked criticism. “They spent crores of rupees on making Gandhi Market area flood-free, but there is no visible impact,” said Congress corporator Ravi Raja, Opposition leader in the BMC. Waterlogging was reported citywide, especially Sion, Kurla, Hindmata, King’s Circle, Dadar TT, Matunga, Andheri Subway and market, Linking Road in Bandra, Siddharth Nagar in Goregaon and Kranti Nagar in Kurla. Assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s L ward Manish Walunju said they started evacuating 250 residents of Kranti Nagar to nearby Bail Bazar municipal school after the water reached knee level. “Early in the morning, Mithi river swelled above 3m, which is the danger mark. We informed police to start making announcements and the evacuation began,” he said. Rail and road transport came to a crawl. Traffic moved in fits and starts along Western and Eastern Express Highways and JVLR. Due to waterlogging at Kurla and Sion stations, railway services on the fast line between Matunga-Mulund were suspended for an hour. On the Harbour line, trains briefly halted between Wadala and Mankhurd. BEST buses were diverted on 87 routes, but restored by 5.30pm. Over 60 buses were either stranded or broke down. Power outage was reported from Chembur, Ghatkopar, Kurla and Santacruz. Flight operations at Mumbai airport were not affected, though.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aarey-floods-mithi-swells-after-overnight-downpour-soaks-city/articleshow/84487149.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Latur, Aurangabad top the 100% club||AURANGABAD: Latur division of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHE) has the highest share (278) of students who have scored perfect 100% mark in SSC result, which was out on Friday. Aurangabad division came in next with 261 such students. Sanjay Panchakalle, assistant secretary with Latur division of MSBSHE said conscious efforts by schools to groom students reflect in terms of many students scoring 100% marks. “Many schools from Latur division prepare students for National Talent Search Examination and Maharashtra Talent Search Examination from early stages. Such preparation helps students score very well in SSC examination,” he said. Panchakalle said his predecessors, including Audumbar Ukirde, who served as an acting secretary of Latur division in the recent past, had encouraged a large number of schools to ensure their students appear for NTSE and MTSE. Around 151 SSC students from Latur had scored perfect 100% marks during the board examination held last year. MSBSHSE, Aurangabad division secretary Sugata Punne said conscious efforts by schools to ensure their students get marks for different quotas, including arts and sports also bring heavy scoring. “The internal evaluation coupled with these marks have resulted in many students from Aurangabad division scoring 100%. The feat is achieved due to hard work by students,” she said. The students who could secure 100% marks could not be identified till evening due to delay in accessing SSC results due to technical issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/latur-aurangabad-top-the-100-club/articleshow/84483306.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2nd highest 24-hour rain for July in a decade, but only in suburbs||MUMBAI: At 253 mm, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Santacruz observatory recorded the second-highest 24-hour rainfall for July in a decade between July 15 and 16 (8.30 am-8.30 am). Previously, between July 1 and 2, 2019, the Santacruz observatory had reported 375.2 mm of rainfall, which has been the highest one-day July rain recorded so far in the past ten years. The rain recorded by the Santacruz observatory falls in the extremely heavy category, as per IMD’s classification. However, no warning of extremely heavy rain was issued, and experts said it was because it was a localized phenomenon, with rain restricted only to the northern suburbs of Mumbai. Colaba observatory recorded a meagre 12.8 mm of rainfall. Following the overnight and early morning downpour, the IMD, which had also given a yellow alert for Mumbai for July 16, went on to upgrade it to orange, indicating heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places. Dr Jayanta Sarkar, scientist and head, IMD Mumbai, giving a forecast for the next five days, said, “For Friday we have given an orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain), while for Saturday, a yellow alert has been issued for Mumbai.” Rainfall data showed that rain started building up from 2.30 am on Friday, with the maximum rainfall recorded in the window between 5.30 am and 8.30 am of over 150 mm. With the heavy overnight rain, the month of July has so far recorded 583 mm of rainfall, making it 70% of the average monthly rainfall, i.e., 827.5 mm. Meanwhile, the total rainfall recorded so far for the season is also 70% of the average July rain. In the 12 hours ending 8.30 pm on Friday, however, the IMD Santacruz observatory recorded light rain of 15.7 mm and the Colaba observatory recorded 4.8 mm. Officials at private forecasting agency Skymet attributed the heavy rain to the fact that the monsoon surge was very strong. “Weather is not likely to go completely dry, even though the surge will weaken over the weekend. While such massive rainfall of 253 mm was not anticipated, conditions appear to have become conducive for it. We expect the next heavy spell around July 21, with a low-pressure area likely to form over the northwest Bay of Bengal and the neighborhood around that period,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change at Skymet. A few experts said current operational weather models would not have been able to forecast an event like this. Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist who is a PhD student at the department of meteorology, University of Reading, UK, said existing large-scale weather conditions were not favorable for heavy, widespread and sustained rainfall. He said a strong thunderstorm got triggered over suburbs early in the morning and as it matured, winds from the east pushed it away from the city, resulting in very little rainfall over Colaba and south Mumbai. “Such thunderstorms are more common in June before the monsoon arrives. There could be many factors responsible for formation of the thunderstorm only over suburbs, but the role of mountains (in areas of suburbs, namely Sanjay Gandhi National Park), cannot be ruled out. Whilst weather models can well predict large-scale rainfall events, they have limitations in simulating such localised and transient rainfall events,” Deoras said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2nd-highest-24-hr-rain-for-july-in-a-decade-but-only-in-suburbs/articleshow/84487166.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Want of past data stalls repeaters’ SSC results||AURANGABAD: The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHE) Aurangabad division has withheld results of around 1,063 repeater candidates of SSC for want of past records. MSBSHSE, Aurangabad division secretary Sugata Punne said respective schools are expected to arrange Class IX and Class X related academic records of these students for preparation of results. “As board examination could not take place this year due to the pandemic situation, the internal evaluation carried out by schools formed the only basis for the preparation of result. As such data could not get produced, we have withheld results of over 1,000 repeater candidates,” she said. A total of 8,849 repeater candidates had appeared for SSC examination this year from Aurangabad division of MSBSHE, of which 7,172 have been declared pass as per internal evaluation submitted by respective schools. The passing percentage among repeater candidates was 81.04%, official data shows. Among successful repeater candidates, 59 have passed with distinction (above 75% marks), followed by 340 and 333 candidates who have secured the first-class and the second-class, respectively. Student activist Tukaram Saraf said MSBSHSE has to swing into action for the benefit of repeater candidates, whose results are withheld. “The State Board should prevail upon such schools to submit necessary data at the earliest. The technical issues being faced in compiling necessary data can be addressed by schools with the help of parents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/want-of-past-data-stalls-repeaters-ssc-results/articleshow/84483350.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad only metro city to be dropped from CAP||AURANGABAD: Aurangabad has been excluded from the centralised admission process (CAP) for Class XI, sparking mixed reactions from stakeholders. Deputy director of education for Aurangabad division, Anil Sable, on Friday said the state government has decided to carry out the admissions at college-level in Aurangabad as per earlier procedure taking into consideration the demand from a section of colleges. “The collective intake capacity in junior colleges from Aurangabad was found to be more than the demand and therefore a section of college principals questioned the need for CAP. There were also complaints related to the admission process getting protracted over a long span of time due to CAP,” he said. While excluding Aurangabad from CAP, the state directorate of education has decided to carry out Class XI admission in a centralized manner at Mumbai, Pune- Pimpri Chinchwad, Nagpur, Amravati and Nashik. The move has sparked mixed reactions from colleges and parents. “It is surprising that only Aurangabad has been omitted from CAP, while other metro cities from Maharashtra will continue to follow the centralized process. The CAP was introduced as a reform measure and such a selective roll-back has raised many doubts in minds of parents,” said Sarika Washikar, a parent. Rajanikant Garud, vice-principal of Deogiri College, said leading junior colleges were facing the issue of vacant seats due to CAP. “The CAP used to get extended for a considerable period and many parents used to secure admission in other than preferred colleges fearing that their ward would not get admission at all after early rounds of admissions. The future admission process in junior colleges will be merit-based only and would benefit all stakeholders, including students,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-only-metro-city-to-be-dropped-from-cap/articleshow/84483315.cms||Prasad Joshi

Holding a regional meeting with adidravida welfare department officials of Coimbatore, Erode, Tirupur and the Nilgiris here on Friday, she said that a crucial part of the effort to get them complete education is to ensure that schemes chalked out by the state government for their welfare like giving free bicycles, scholarships and free books are implemented properly. She said that hostels in schools and colleges meant for advidravida students should be maintained properly. “Proper drinking water, toilet and electricity supply should be ensured for the hostels,” she said adding that places where new hostels are required should identified and efforts must be taken to build them there. Likewise, Advidravida colonies should be provided with all basic infrastructure like roads, streetlights and drinking water. Noting that there are several petitions seeking free land pattas for adidravidas and tribals, Kayalvizhi said that officials have to conduct field inspections to verify if the petitoners are genuine and then provide land pattas. Similarly, for tribals, officials should check those living in the same place for three generations or more than 75 years and provide land pattas within legal framework. “To ensure that adidravida and tribals get all government benefits, they should be given community certificates without any delay,’’ she said. Instructing the officials to clear the petitions seeking government benefit like land patta, scholarship, marriage assistance to those eligible without delay, she said meetings of district level awareness and monitoring committee of the department should be conducted at regular intervals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/min-ensure-adidravida-students-dont-drop-out/articleshow/84487139.cms||---

A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi, Rekha Palli and Talwant Singh also noted that presently there are no Covid cases reported in any of the jails premises in Delhi and also asked the government to file a report on this aspect. “Newspaper reports show crime rate has increased. Let the state file a report with regard to the impact of interim orders being extended and interim bails being extended in view of our order of April 20, 2021,” the bench said. The court extended till July 27 all interim orders which were to expire on July 16 in cases before it as also the district courts. The court listed the matter for further hearing on July 27. The court took up the matter suo motu as it had done in March last year when the lockdown was in place in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. In its order on April 20, the bench had made it clear that the interim orders were being extended till July 16 or further orders except where the Supreme Court may have passed any contrary orders in any such matter during this period. It had also said if the extension of interim measures causes hardship to a party to such proceeding, “they would be at liberty to seek appropriate relief, as may be advised”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rising-crime-hc-seeks-report-on-impact-of-interim-bail-orders/articleshow/84487978.cms||---

The arrested officer, Suresh Babu, 49, of Pannimadai near Thudiyalur, was produced before the special court for DVAC cases on Friday and later remanded in judicial custody. In April 2021, Jayanthi, 35, of Anaikatti, approached Suresh Babu to shift an electricity line crossing her 1.5 cents of patta land as she was not able to construct a house on the land due to the electricity line. However, Suresh Babu demanded Rs 80,000 as bribe from her. On July 7, he agreed to receive Rs 55,000 from Jayanthi. He explained to her that he would spend Rs 40,000 for shifting the electricity line from her land to a nearby place and take the rest of Rs 15,000 as bribe. Meanwhile, Jayanthi approached DVAC additional superintendent of police MP Dhivya who laid a trap. On July 15, Suresh Babu was caught red-handed by DVAC officials while receiving Rs 55,000 from Jayanthi near a petrol bunk at Thanneerpandal area in Chinna Thadagam. DVAC officials registered an FIR against Suresh Babu under section 7 (a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. He was lodged at the Udumalpet sub-jail.

The officials have been given just two days to clear heaps of garbage from inside and outside the drain or face action. On Saturday, the staff will check waste segregation around the drain and at other dumps. The MC had launched the drive to rid the drain of garbage in December last. It continued for about three months and came to a halt when Covid cases started rising. However, on Friday, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal was furious over its discontinuation. He asked the staff to consider their duties seriously, if they expect salaries in time. The health branch and other officials were asked to ensure piles of garbage were removed from inside and outside the drain. Crackdown on illegal colonies The building branch officials have been given three days to survey the city for illegal colonies, building and other violations. “Next week, a demolition drive will start,” Sabharwal told officials of all branches in a meeting on Friday. The officials were told to get FIRs registered against developers or those trying to interfere in their work. Boards on MC works The officials were directed to install boards, informing about ongoing road, water, sewer supply or any other MC works. The officials were directed to remain in field. The commissioner also checked the flood control room number of MC. ‘Staff to face action’ The MC commissioner said, “On Monday, I will check cleaning work around the drain. Action will be taken against employees if there are any shortcomings. Besides, next week we will act against illegal colonies and buildings.

Even as the number of persons getting the second dose is low, there are other districts in the state that have even worse rate than Ludhiana. As per the state government report on vaccination coverage, of the 100 persons in Ludhiana, 32.7 had got the first dose till Thursday evening. Ludhiana is at fifth position in Punjab so far. SAS Nagar has vaccinated 61.1 persons out of 100 with first dose, Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar 41.4 and 34, respectively. Mansa has the lowest of 14.1 jabbed with the first dose. In Ludhiana, only seven persons per 100 had received the second dose till Thursday evening. Six districts have better score. SAS Nagar has 10.1 fully vaccinated people, Hoshiarpur 8.5, Jalandhar and Gurdaspur 7.6. In Mansa again, only 1.8 persons per 100 have received the second dose. The state figure for fully vaccinated is 4.9 and those who have received first dose is 24.4. The authorities, however, said the department should have taken data of eligible persons. District immunization officer Dr Puneet Juneja said number of vaccinated persons per 100 eligible was the proper way to calculate data. He added that of the 24 lakh persons in the district (eligible for vaccination who are above 18 years of age), they have given first dose to 11.5 lakh and second dose to around 2.5 lakh. The officer said, “Whatever stock we get is used and the state government cannot do much when there is shortage of supply.” Health experts said vaccination was important to prevent the third wave. “As there are chances of third wave between August and September-end, it is important to vaccinate maximum eligible persons. The government should make necessary arrangements to supply vaccines,” said Ludhiana IMA president Dr Saroj Aggarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/of-100-only-7-fully-vaccinated-in-dist-32-got-first-dose/articleshow/84483347.cms||Shariq Majeed

The fraudster transferred money using ‘Trojan Horse’ malware and fraudulently transferred Rs 20 lakh to different accounts at Kanpur, Kolkata, Lucknow and Noida. The MIDC police team after camping for eight days in Noida managed to nab the duo--Pradeep Sharma (30) and Tejveer Singh (30) on July 12. Both arrested are school dropouts--who are the middlemen between the bank account holders and the Nigerian fraudsters. Using the malware, the fraudster managed to get hold of the letterhead of the victim’s company and used the same to apply for a New SIM with the same number after submitting a request for deactivation of the SIM that has been lost. The case was registered after MSJPL Jewellery’s additional director, Rajesh Vora, noticed the fraudulent fund transfers on June 21. “Soon after the case was registered, the police team got in touch with the bank and managed to stop Rs 7.85 lakh and reverse the transactions back to the company’s account. However, balance Rs12.15 lakh was credited to four different accounts at different locations,” said DCP (Zone X) Maheshwar Reddy. The team--MIDC senior inspector Jagdish Shinde, inspector Dipak Surve, sub-inspectors Abhishek Patil, Swapnil Ghat and detection staff--through technical assistance tracked the two middlemen who identify people and lures them with a commission for opening a bank account in their name and makes them to handover the ATM and banking kits soon after it is opened. Explaining the modus operandi, the investigation team said, “It is a case of SIM Swap Fraud where the fraudster obtained the victim’s bank account details and registered mobile number via social engineering tactics such as sending trojan virus through email. The fraudster then makes their aides visit the mobile operator’s retail outlet posing as the victim with a fake ID proof to get the original SIM blocked. Post verification, the operator deactivates the genuine customer’s (victim’s) SIM and issues a new SIM card to the fake customer (fraudster). Now, the fraudster can obtain OTPs with the new SIM.” The arrested duo is in police custody till July 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sim-fraud-case-2-held-from-noida-for-siphoning-off-rs-rs-20l-in-mumbai/articleshow/84488439.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

While schools said that they were aware of the overall result as the evaluation was done at their end, students and their parents were at their wit’s end till Friday evening. Pranav Mule, an SSC student, said he made umpteen attempts to access results but failed. “I had scored very good marks in internal examinations carried out by the school and was hoping to get more than 95% marks. The result is a mystery,” he said. Nagesh Joshi, a teacher from Omkar Vidyalaya, Aurangabad, said the excitement was less about SSC result this year as the board examinations could not take place due to the pandemic situation. “The SSC students, who had prepared hard since the beginning of the academic year, were most dismayed,” he said.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur Covid deaths cross 10,000 post reconciliation||NAGPUR: The number of Covid deaths in the district has gone up by a whopping 1,075 to take the total fatality count beyond 10,000 after the reconciliation of data by the civil surgeon on Friday. Similarly, the number of total Covid patients and recoveries has also increased by 15,305 and 14,022, respectively. Due to the reconciliation, the number of Covid deaths in the district has now reached 10,115. The reconciled data pertains to last eight months — from November last year till date. Most of the reconciled numbers are from the city. However, majority of the reconciled deaths, cases and recoveries are of the second wave, which was witnessed from the second week of February to June second week. TOI had reported about discrepancies in the data released by civil surgeon and state’s public health department (PHD). On November 2 last year, TOI had also reported about Covid deaths, cases and recoveries of patients from other districts and states not being added to the district’s tally by the civil surgeon. Civil surgeon Dr VD Paturkar did not respond to TOI’s call and message. Commenting on the reconciliation of overall Covid figures, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “We did not want to hide or miss a single death or case and hence this exercise. There was mismatch in the numbers displayed on Covid-19 and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portals, both developed and controlled by the central government. Now, we have ensured no discrepancies remain.” “Earlier, we were not adding Covid patients from other districts and states, but detected in the city, to the tally of the district. We have done the reconciliation of these cases,” he said. “We were taking into account death of patients from other districts and states who had tested positive and died here, but not adding those who died here but had tested positive in their respective districts. We used to send the details to the respective districts for addition in their tallies. However, the government has directed us to count such fatalities in our district itself,” he said. Radhakrishnan added, “Government as well as private hospitals did not upload the data of deaths and cases on time and also missed reporting some cases. We have done the reconciliation of such fatalities and cases.” Dr Paturkar, while releasing Covid-19 data through a press release, said, “Details of many patients were not with the district, but the numbers were reflected in the Covid-19 portal. Such cases have also been reconciled.” This is the third reconciliation of data since the outbreak of the pandemic and major one compared to the previous two exercises. Last reconciliation was done on October 31 when 275 Covid deaths, 7,357 cases and 7,007 recoveries were added to the district’s tally. This had happened after the peak of the first wave. The latest reconciliation was carried out after the peak of the second wave. Meanwhile, the district on Friday registered 10 Covid cases, lowest in a day after June 6 last year. Of these, city saw five, four in rural areas and one from other district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-covid-deaths-cross-10k-post-reconciliation/articleshow/84487183.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Sebastian complained that office-bearers of ‘independent’ Catholic Church (Emperor Emmanuel Church) based at Muriyad near Chalakudy had hatched a conspiracy and fabricated documents to file a fake rape case against Johnson, a former church trustee. Sabu claimed church’s office-bearers, including present chief Nisha Sebastian, forged evidence and made Mayookha hold a news conference about fake rape charges. She also alleged that Sabu had delivered a ‘threatening note’ with the neighbour of the victim as per the complaint filed before JFCM, Chalakudy. Sabu’s advocate Syriac Varghese said several documents, including voice clips of conference calls and videos, were submitted in court to support the allegations of fabrication of evidence and criminal conspiracy against the office-bearers. He said that the magistrate has directed the police to register a case based on Sabu’s complaint. Deputy SP (CB) Shaj Jose C, who is probing the case, said a detailed probe will be necessary and veracity of video and audio clips, submitted by the accused will be ascertained after a forensic analysis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-file-case-against-mayookha-nine-others/articleshow/84486014.cms||T Ramavarman
---||India||IHC: Changes mooted in NCERT textbooks biased||AGRA: The largest body of historians in the country, the Indian History Congress (IHC), has objected to the proposed changes of school textbooks, saying that it is being done for political, not academic, reasons. At the beginning of the year, the Rajya Sabha secretariat had notified that a change in school textbook curriculum would be discussed by a parliamentary standing committee. In what it called a “reform”, it said the focus would be on removing “unhistorical facts” and “distortions about our national heroes”, and on ensuring “equal or proportionate references to all periods of Indian history”. Public responses were invited till June 30 and the deadline was later extended till July 15, when the IHC sent its response. The IHC, established in 1935, has over 35,000 members. “The IHC is much disturbed at the misinformation and biased view that is being projected in the name of bringing reforms in the existing NCERT textbooks,” the letter, a copy of which is with TOI, said. “The critique of the existing textbooks implicit in the ‘reforms’ being contemplated is not emerging from any expert body of nationally and internationally recognised historians but from a political position favoured by non-academic votaries of prejudice.” The reason, the IHC said, it feared a “distortion” is because there is a precedent. “School textbooks written for the NCERT by some of the tallest scholars in the country … were actually removed, and in their places books with a clear sectarian, majoritarian bias were introduced in 2002,” the letter said. After significant blowback, the books were withdrawn a year later. IHC members told TOI that books must be constantly reviewed and scrutinised. “But this should be done involving recognised scholars, with attention to academic content, derived from a research-based understanding of historical periods,” IHC secretary Prof Mahalaxmi Ramakrishnan said. “What we oppose is any attempt to present a distorted understanding of the historical past,” IHC president Amiya Bagchi added. Besides, the IHC said, the reasons cited for the proposed change are unfounded. “The claim that there are ‘unhistorical facts and distortions’ with regard to national heroes is completely false,” the letter said. “Further, the claim regarding lack of equal space accorded to various periods of Indian history is not borne out by the books currently in use by the NCERT,” it added. In an accompanying note to establish what it said, the IHC listed primary sources, proportion of representation of each period of history, “national heroes” and “historical female figures” in the NCERT textbooks in use by students of classes VI to XII. What added to the fears, IHC members said, was how the undergraduate history course was redesigned this year. The first paper proposed, for instance, is ‘Idea of Bharat’. “As if the concept of Bharat was there since time immemorial,” said IHC executive committee member Prof Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, who teaches at the Aligarh Muslim University’s history department. “Also, in the name of balancing, most aspects of the medieval period have been removed. What has, however, been emphasised is communal strife — so, most Sultans of Delhi Sultanate are out, Akbar is out, but Aurangzeb and Shivaji are retained.” A day before the IHC sent out its letter, the Archaeological Survey of India had announced it was going to remove plaques at Rakta Talai in Rajasthan, which say Maharana Pratap’s forces retreated from the battle at Haldighati, fought against Akbar in 1576. New plaques will be put up soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ihc-changes-mooted-in-ncert-textbooks-biased/articleshow/84489233.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

But overall cases are reducing in Nashik rural, he said. The district registered a total of 2,422 cases in the last 15 days, Of them, Nashik rural recorded 53% of the cases. In April, the number of active cases in Nashik district had increased to 48,000 cases, including 28,000 cases in Nashik city, 17,760 in Nashik rural and the rest in Malegaon city.

Bapusaheb Nagargoje, NMC’s medical superintendent, said there has been a huge drop in the number of active cases in the city. The Covid restrictions imposed by the state government since April have yielded good results. “But we are concerned about a section of people who are not following the Covid safety norms. We want people to follow the norms to prevent the spread of the infection,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rural-nashik-records-more-cases-than-city/articleshow/84483603.cms||Tushar Pawar

While the ambulances had ferried 785 patients in May and 1,484 patients in April. when the infection rate was at its peak during the second wave. However, as the positivity rate started reducing, the load on the ambulance to ferry Covid patients also reduced steadily after May 15. Ashwin Raghamwar, the zonal manager of Bharat Vikas Group (BVG), Nashik zone, that operates the fleet of 47 ambulances in the district, said, “We have kept aside 17 ambulances only to ferry Covid patients. The doctors and drivers of the ambulances took all the necessary precautions to ensure they did not contract the infection while ferrying the passengers.” Ambulances were increased in places where the infection rate was more. Raghamwar said even if the infection rate has reduced over the past two months, they have continued to retain the 17 ambulances. Meanwhile, the calls to ferry non-Covid patients increased in June. As against 2,776 non-Covid patients ferried in May, in June, the 108 ambulances ferried 3,071 non-Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-drop-in-coronavirus-cases-significantly-reduces-load-on-ambulances-in-past-2-months/articleshow/84483560.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Kochi||Parents must give anti-dowry bond during admissions: Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan||KOCHI/T’PURAM: Two days after suggesting an anti-dowry bond from college students before awarding them degrees or diploma, governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday mooted the plan to collect similar bonds signed by parents too at the time of their children’s admission in higher educational institutions. Khan said that it was the vice-chancellors who suggested the idea during a meeting convened by him in Kochi. Khan said faculties appointed in universities should also give a similar undertaking on dowry. “I am so happy that VCs suggested that parents will have to sign the anti-dowry bond at the time of admission. Demanding dowry is repugnant not only to womanhood, but to human dignity too. The suggestions made by VCs will be compiled after another round of meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on July 21,” he said. Khan said that whatever a father wants to do for his daughter at the time of her marriage shouldn’t have anything to do with the bridegroom and his family. Earlier, while inaugurating Platinum Jubilee celebrations of St Albert’s College, Khan requested students to not give, receive or demand dowry in marriage. “Education is supposed to give one a sense of right and wrong and the degrees a person secures are not for increasing his or her price in the marriage market,” he said. Khan added that elected representatives should ensure that dowry is not demanded or accepted if they get an invitation for marriage. Dowry prohibition officers in all districts Meanwhile, the government appointed dowry prohibition officers in all districts as part of the initiatives adopted by the government to prevent the practice of dowry, said Veena George, health and women and child development minister. The appointment has been made after amending the dowry prohibition rules, the minister said. Earlier, dowry prohibition officers were present only in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode zones. The number of posts of dowry prohibition officers have been raised to 14 by amending the rules, and re-designating district officers of women and child development as dowry prohibition officers, the minister said. The director of the women and child development department will be the chief dowry prohibition officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/parents-must-give-anti-dowry-bond-during-admissions-guv/articleshow/84486078.cms||---

Later, we had a meeting with Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate on the subject, but the matter is still pending,” Almeida said. This year, the bus stand seems to be facing bigger problems owing to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae and the subsequent heavy showers. Leaking sheds and uneven pavements apart, even the bus stand building is facing issues of inundation and frequent power cuts. “The structure of the building is weak. We have made a proposal for the repair of all the bus stands in Goa, not just Panaji. We can come up with temporary solutions, but there is little we can do if there is a cyclone,” Almeida said. Some shop owners operating at KTC Panaji pointed out the issues of illegal hawking and parking among others that are plaguing the bus stand. “We pay rent to KTC, but as shop owners we have no security,” a shop owner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-chairman-moots-new-bus-stand-at-panaji/articleshow/84487188.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Coastal police station lacks amenities||Thiruvananthapuram: A region which records the highest number of fishermen deaths due to drowning, Anchuthengu lacks a coastal police station that is capable of carrying out successful rescue operations.  Inaugurated nearly three years ago, the inadequacies of the coastal police station here are plenty. Lack of proper communication systems, rescue boats that are capable of cruising through the dangerously strong waves and lack of a proper docking yard close to the station are some of these. These inadequacies become all the more important as unfavourable weather conditions exist along the state’s coast owing to the threat of strong winds of speed ranging from 40 to 45 km/hour are expected to lash the coastal region. During the past six weeks, there have been four cases of drowning reported under Anchuthengu coastal police station limits. Vizhinjam grama panchayat president V Laiju has submitted a memorandum before fisheries minister Saji Cherian urging immediate intervention of the state government to improve the conditions of the police station here. Incidentally, all the recent drowning deaths occurred here after this memorandum was submitted before the minister in the first week of June. The station currently has only one boat, which was in fact acquired by the police department in 2014, said an officer of the station on condition of anonymity. The station does not have a docking yard of its own despite being located close to the lake here. The boat is currently docked in the Anchuthengu fishing harbour, which is over 50maway from the station. This has put the boat under the risk of being harmed by antisocial elements.  Laiju said that the station requires at least two boats to carry out effective search operations. “A water ambulance is also an urgent requirement here,” the panchayat president said.  He added that forming a volunteer force with young local fishermen could help improve the efficiency of search operations as they are more aware of the sea than police officers. Another problem the station faces is the lack of a properly working land phone connection. The phone at the station often stops working when there is heavy rain or strong winds.  “This becomes a problem for the common people when the station house officer is out on patrol duty and is out of network coverage, said an officer adding that the landline number and SHO’s number are the two contacts people often dial to report accidents. Two weeks ago, the special branch personnel had forwarded a letter to the Coastal IG recommending to issue a new mobile phone connection for the station as an alternative for the landline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/coastal-police-station-lacks-amenities/articleshow/84486092.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In June 2020, a woman identified as Shabnam Bano was admitted to IGGMC in labour pain but doctors allegedly refused to provide services to her as her Covid-19 report was pending. The woman lost her child due to this medical negligence. As hospital authorities failed to take any action against the doctors, social worker Sachin Khobragade took this matter to the NHRC. After more than a year since the incidence, and a series of notices, reminders and correspondents during this period, the NHRC has finally issued summon to Health Secretary for not preparing any report on this incident. “The victim was pregnant and suffered a miscarriage because she was ailing in extreme pain but the hospital authorities of Mayo hospital refused to provide any treatment till the reports of her Covid-19 and other tests came,” said Khobragade. After repeated requests to the hospital and authorities for about 2 months, Khobragade filed a complaint with NHRC in September 2020. As mentioned in NHRC summon, “The Commission took cognizance on 04.09.2020 and directed the Principal Secretary, Department of Public Health and Family Welfare, Government of Maharashtra, Mumbai, to submit an action taken report in the matter within four weeks. However, no response has been received till date despite a reminder on April 9, 2021.” The NHRC has issued the summon to the Additional Chief Secretary/ Principal Secretary, Department of Public Health and Family Welfare, Government of Maharashtra, under section 13 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. They have been asked to appear before the Commission on September 28 this year along with the requisite report. They have been asked to submit the action taken to report a week before this date or to face criminal proceedings under sections 175/176 of the Indian Penal Code. TOI tried to speak to the authorities at Mayo Hospital but they refused to comment on record. A senior official, who doesn’t want to be named, said that the report is to be prepared by the health secretary through the department of medical education and research and the hospital will cooperate in the preparation of the report sought by the NHRC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nhrc-summons-state-health-secretary-after-woman-loses-child-due-to-alleged-negligence/articleshow/84487191.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The QR code is being displayed at KTC bus stands across the state and in KTC buses. “People in Goa must take advantage of this system and move towards digital transactions,” KTC chairman Carlos Almeida said. Though only smartphone owners will be able to use this platform currently, the KTC will soon roll out a national common mobility card (NCMC) aimed at helping non- smartphone users. “With the advent of electric buses in the state, it only makes sense to move towards digital transactions,” KTC vice-chairman Deepak Naik said. “Goa is the first state transport corporation to start this cashless system.

Ravat said that Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is damaging the ecology of the river by removing trees and shrubs randomly on the river bank. “When I objected, the civic officials stopped the cleaning work on Friday. The drive is not just damaging the river’s ecology but also disturbing the crocodiles that are a protected species. Why is the VMC cleaning up the river in this period of the year? It’s all a hogwash,” Ravat who is the opposition leader in the VMC said. She added that the VMC isn’t removing the encroachments that are actually obstructing the river flow. “The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered to remove all the encroachments and debris from the river bank but the VMC isn’t acting on it. The civic body should immediately start work on demarcating the river and its tributaries Bhuki Kaans, Masia Kaans and Ruparel Kaans as per instructions from the NGT,” said Ravat who has also written a letter to the chief secretary. The VMC had started cleaning Vishwamitri riverbank some days ago under the monitoring of the forest department. Wildlife activists had protested against the move citing damage to the crocodile dens and other aquatic life in the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cong-opposes-vishwamitri-cleaning-drive/articleshow/84485439.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand government: Contact helpline in case of Co-WIN glitch in tracking jabs||RANCHI: To ensure a hassle-free inoculation of beneficiaries at Covid vaccination centres (CVCs), the state health department has directed the vaccinators and verifiers to track details of those who received their first dose if their names do not appear on the search engine for administering the second dose. The department has also appealed to people to report any grievance related to their registration on the Union health ministry helpline numbers within 24 hours. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said, “We already have a system in place to identify people who turn up at CVCs for their second dose and complained that their registration isn’t reflecting on the Co-WIN portal. Our verifiers and vaccinators have been trained to track such details and no one will face any trouble.” A technical expert working with the department said case studies have shown two types of problems where beneficiaries face difficulties in locating their data on the portal. In the first case, details of the beneficiary who has received the first dose could not be located on the portal for the second jab. In such a situation, the verifier should use the add button on the Co-WIN portal and do an on-the-spot registration, the technical expert said. “Soon after the option is made, the portal can start a verification process through Aadhaar number, mobile number or the date of the first dose. The verifier will be able to access all the details and can provide the jab after checking the validation gap between the two doses,” he said. However, this facility is only for government-run CVCs and private CVCs do not have an option of making changes on the portal. In the second case, details of the beneficiary who has already received the second dose could not find his or her updated details. “In that case, the beneficiary must contact the helpline numbers 1075 or 104 which will collect the required information and address the grievance,” the expert added. When TOI contacted the 1075 helpline number, the executive at the other end collected all relevant information like district, block, beneficiary name and mobile number and assured that it will be updated by the state health department concerned. On being asked about the probable reasons behind such problems faced by the beneficiaries, the additional chief secretary said, “Many a time it occurs because of technical snags as everything is working through the internet. We have had examples where people registered themselves at the CVC and left without taking the jab. So, I would like to request the beneficiaries to take the jab after they get themselves verified at the centre and if they face any problem with their data at centres, call the helpline number immediately or the following day as changes are allowed till that time,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-contact-helpline-in-case-of-co-win-glitch-in-tracking-jabs/articleshow/84486042.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The department has also appealed to people to report any grievance related to their registration on the Union health ministry helpline numbers within 24 hours. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said, “We already have a system in place to identify people who turn up at CVCs for their second dose and complained that their registration isn’t reflecting on the Co-WIN portal.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Singing Simdega cop draws people to vaccination centres||RANCHI: Even as the authorities in Simdega are beating their brains out on how to encourage villagers to maintain Covid-control measures and dispel myths regarding vaccination and are taking help from NGOs and local religious leaders to do that, a sub-inspector in the district is banking on Bollywood actors Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan to help him in this regard. To be more accurate, Ravi Shankar Singh is relying on the two stars’ chartbusters to encourage Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination in the district. Since April 16, the 42-year-old police official, who is in-charge of Simdega district police line, has been roaming around local markets, blocks headquarters, urban centres, roundabouts and urban colonies with a microphone crooning the two stars’ popular songs, reworked and re-recorded with new lyrics in Hindi and in Nagpuri penned by him. The new lyrics encourage everyone to take the jab, wear masks, maintain social distancing, stay indoors, educate his/her neighbours on Covid-prevention measures and protect children from being infected. When asked what prompted him to take such an ingenious step, Singh said, “I have had an inclination towards music since childhood. When I was asked to use my talent in promoting Covid-prevention measures, I decided to use music to do this and I stayed awake all night for several days to write down the lyrics. I am mainly focusing on spreading the message through songs and speeches in rural areas.” And his effort has borne fruit, according to SP Shams Tabrez, who upon seeing Singh’s penchant for music and witnessing the positive results, encouraged him to write more songs and till now, Singh has written the lyrics of around a dozen songs. Lauding Singh’s efforts, Tabrez said, “We decided to use music to encourage Covid-appropriate behaviour among the villagers when Covid cases crossed the 200-mark in the district. The villagers were unwilling to follow the norms and were indifferent towards the vaccination drive, so much so that many would flee as soon as they spotted mobile vaccination teams. However, Singh’s unique initiative has made a positive impact and after his recent performance in Bano, there was a rush at the vaccination centre. Even the local official invited him to perform again.” Singh’s efforts has even come in for a lot of praise from Simdega MLA Bhushan Bara who said, “There was apprehension among people regarding vaccination in some pockets of rural areas but Singh’s performance the situation has changed for the better.” Singh has also been praised by Simdega deputy commissioner Sushant Gaurav and the elected representatives of the panchayat. Till date, 56,984 persons have taken their first dose while 21,143 persons have taken both the doses in Simdega. The district has recorded 12,981 Covid cases, of which 133 have succumbed to the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/singing-simdega-cop-draws-people-to-vax-centres/articleshow/84486108.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The district surveillance officer of Seraikela-Kharsawan, Jhujhar Majhi, said the deceased, Puja Sahu, a resident of Rajnagar block, was tested positive for dengue at the Tata Main Hospital (TMH) where she was undergoing treatment since July 6. She died on Thursday night. “As an immediate measure, fogging and spraying of larvicide and bleaching power was done at the house of the deceased and in the vicinity. Besides, door-to-door surveillance has been launched to detect potential breeding ground of mosquitoes and destroy them,” Majhi said. In Steel City, an 18-year-old girl, who is a resident of ECC flats in Kadma, was diagnosed with dengue on Thursday and is undergoing treatment at TMH, said East Singhbhum district additional chief medical officer, Sahir Pall. Pall did not disclose the identity of the patient and said a meeting will be convened shortly with officials of the three urban civic bodies — Jamshedpur, Jugsalai and Mango — along with representatives of companies operating in the city to work out a joint mechanism to carry out an anti-dengue drive. “Our health volunteers will visit every house with the dual purpose of detecting and destroying the breeding ground and also spread awareness among the residents to keep their surrounding areas clean to stop mosquitoes from breeding," Pall added. The sub-health centres, community health centres and public health centres will coordinate with the volunteers in carrying out the awareness drives on containing vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya in the blocks, an official of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program office said. Recently, dengue larva was found at 1,550 houses in the command area of Tata Steel following which measures were taken by the Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Ltd to destroy them. "Stagnant water is a potential source of breeding of the mosquitoes. Hence, residents should make regular cleaning of refrigerators, water coolers, empty pots, water tanks, dustbins and discarded tyres," Pall added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dengue-claims-1-in-seraikela/articleshow/84485910.cms||B Sridhar
---||Goa||AAP’s power sop aimed at Delhiites’ 2nd & 3rd homes in Goa, says Cabral||Panaji: Power minister Nilesh Cabral on Friday said AAP’s poll sop of 300 units of free monthly electricity to domestic consumers was probably intended for people from Delhi who have second, third and fourth homes in Goa, and not for the benefit of Goans. Cabral, who was reacting to the statements made by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal during the latter’s recent visit to Goa, also said he could sit across the AAP leader to discuss power issues. “Everyone knows that there are second, third and fourth homes in Goa, and we cannot stop that as we are one nation. People of these second and third homes visit Goa once a year to stay for 10-15 days, or for a month. Most of the time, these homes remain shut. Most are likely to belong to people from Delhi and this scheme is probably created for these people. As these flats and bungalows in Goa are usually shut, the 300-unit free power scheme would be enough for them. Externally, he (Kejriwal) must be making the scheme for them (Delhiites) only,” Cabral said.  He also said that the government provides subsidised power to all and that it does not seek to take loans to provide free power. “Kejriwal is trying to mislead the people of the state by announcing free electricity for Goans. They (AAP) cannot do what is required by Goans.” Power tariffs in Goa begin at Rs 1.4 per unit, Cabral said, and go to a maximum of Rs 4 per unit. “A subsidy of Rs 300-400 crore is provided to the entire population of the state,” he said, adding that the government does not have pending payments with power generating companies, which is why it receives a subsidy. “As far as Delhi is concerned, the government is supposed to pay Rs 2,000 crore to power generating companies. If it fails to pay up, the companies will cut electricity supply. This is not the case with Goa,” he said. The state creates schemes for deserving people, Cabral said and pointed out that Goa is the only state to see an increase in power consumption by five per cent. He also said the Delhi government has been receiving a lot of flak on social media platforms over its performance. “First, Kejriwal should see what is happening in Delhi and then come to Goa,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aaps-power-sop-aimed-at-delhiites-2nd-3rd-homes-in-goa-says-cabral/articleshow/84487299.cms||---

---||India||Uttarakhand HC: Civilisation judged by how it treats minorities||NANITAL: Democracy means the protection of minorities, the Uttarakhand high court said on Friday while hearing two petitions against a meat ban in Haridwar. A civilisation, the division bench added, is judged only by how it treats its minorities and a ban like the one in Haridwar calls into question the extent to which the state can determine a citizen’s choices. “The issue is whether a citizen has the right to decide his own diet or will that be decided by the state,” Chief Justice RS Chauhan said. “If we say that it will be decided by the state because the state is permitted to impose a total ban on a particular type of non-veg food... then can that power be extended to include meat of all sorts?” In March, the state had declared all areas in Haridwar “slaughterhouse-free” and cancelled no objection certificates issued to slaughterhouses. The petitions challenged this on two grounds — a blanket ban on meat of any type is unconstitutional, as was the section the Uttarakhand government had inserted into the UP Municipalities Act, 237A, to give itself power to declare an area under a municipal corporation, council or nagar panchayat as a “slaughter-free” zone. On Friday, advocate general (AG) SN Babulkar cited several judgments supporting the ban, including the 2004 Supreme Court verdict upholding a ban on meat and eggs in the municipal areas of Haridwar, Rishikesh and Muni Ki Reti. He also played back Article 48 in the directive principles, “The State shall … take steps for ... prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.” The division bench of Chief Justice Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said, “Democracy does not only mean rule by majority but, most importantly, democracy means the protection of the minority.” It added, “The greatness of all civilisations is judged only on one yardstick and that is how it treats its minorities.” The court further said it would not go into the religious aspects of the issue and, instead, focus on whether the Constitution protects the privacy of a citizen. The petitioners had raised this, saying that the ban goes against the right to privacy, right to life and right to freely practise religion. The order, they added, was discriminatory of Muslims in Haridwar, where localities like Manglaur have a substantial Muslim population. The court said the petition had raised “serious fundamental issues” and would involve constitutional interpretation. It would not, however, be able to give its verdict before Bakr-Eid, on July 21. The next hearing is on July 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttarakhand-hc-civilisation-judged-by-how-it-treats-minorities/articleshow/84489289.cms||Prashant Jha

AAP said Goa police has failed to take any action against the supporters of BJP MLA Wilfred ‘Babashan’ D’Sa, who abused and assaulted its volunteers. “AAP volunteers had gone on the first day just to offer cake to the turncoat MLA. However, we were met with violence. Even on the second day, despite police being there, the violence was repeated in the presence of the police and media,” AAP spokesperson Valmiki Naik said. Questioning the double standards of Goa police, Naik said that while AAP Goa convener Rahul Mhambre and AAP Goa vice-president Pratima Coutinho received summons, no action has been initiated against D’Sa or his supporters. “We are completely confident that we have nothing to fear.We have all the evidence that it was Babashan’s followers who were violent,” said Naik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stop-misusing-police-force-to-silence-voices/articleshow/84487410.cms||---

BJP general secretary Damodar Naik on Thursday had questioned the political credentials of a woman Congress spokesperson who, in a press statement, had accused BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade of having “lost his mental balance”. The salvo of accusations and counter accusations began after Tanavade accused Kamat of “leaving a stain” on BJP by deserting it to join Congress in 2005. Congress spokesperson Pallavi Bhagat on Thursday reacted to Tanavade’s statement terming Manohar Parrikar as “master of defections”. This had prompted an angry riposte from Naik. Goa Pradesh Mahila Congress president Beena Naik on Friday, taking exception to Naik’s statement belittling Bhagat said that his “insulting” remark was a “reflection of BJP’s anti-women culture.” “Naik has tried to showcase women as backward, illiterate and incapable. This is not only insulting to Pallavi Bhagat, but the entire women community,” she said. BJP mahila morcha general secretary Ranjita Pai said that BJP accorded the highest respect to women’s dignity. “The various schemes of the government have been designed with a focus on women’s welfare. There’s no question of BJP disrespecting women.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-bjp-get-into-heated-row-over-dignity-of-women/articleshow/84487426.cms||---

Afghan forces were fighting to retake Spin Boldak in Kandahar province when Siddiqui and a senior officer were killed in Taliban crossfire, the commander said. Siddiqui was embedded with Afghan special forces in the former Taliban bastion of Kandahar since this week. Siddiqui, 38, who grew up in New Delhi, is survived by his wife Rike and two young children. He was part of a team that was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography in 2018 for documenting Myanmar’s Rohingya refugee crisis, a series that judges described as “shocking photographs that exposed the world to the violence Rohingya refugees faced in fleeing Myanmar.” In recent months, Siddiqui’s searing photographs captured the coronavirus pandemic in India. His haunting photos of crowded cremation grounds were widely seen around the world as the gauge of the devastation.

Afghan forces were fighting to retake Spin Boldak in Kandahar“Ninety percent of the photography I have learnt has come from experimentation in the field,” Siddiqui once wrote. Early last year, Siddiqui’s photograph of a teenage activist brandishing a pistol at anti-CAA protesters, and opening fire as a row of police officers stood behind him, was widely circulated around the globe. Ahmad Danish Siddiqui was born on May 19, 1983. He became a journalist after a Master’s degree in Mass Communications from Delhi’s Jamia Milia Islamia University. He joined Reuters after stints at Hindustan Times and TV Today. Friends and colleagues described a man who cared deeply about the stories he covered, carrying out meticulous research before embarking on assignments and always focusing on the people caught up in the news. “Even in breaking news cycles he would think about humanising a story, and you see that so often in his pictures, including those that won the Pulitzer and stories we have done in the last few years,” said Devjyot Ghoshal, a Reuters correspondent based in New Delhi and a neighbour of Siddiqui. “Covering the Delhi riots together and the Covid-19 pandemic more recently — his most compelling images were about people, isolating the human element,” he said. A Reuters photographer since 2010, Siddiqui’s work has spanned wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Rohingya crisis, pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and unrest in India.“What I enjoy most is capturing the human face of a breaking story. I shoot for the common man who wants to see and feel a story from a place where he can’t be present himself,” Siddiqui had written. Last year, while covering riots in a Delhi suburb, Siddiqui and Ghoshal saw a man being beaten by a frenzied mob. The images were widely featured in international media. Siddiqui had a narrow escape when the mob turned their attention on him. Those photographs were part of a selection of Reuters pictures of the year in 2020. Earlier this week, as an embedded journalist, he was travelling with a convoy of commandos when it came under heavy fire from Taliban militants on the outskirts of Kandahar. He captured the drama in pictures, film and words. Siddiqui had told Reuters that he had been wounded in the arm by shrapnel while reporting on the clash. He was treated and had been recovering when Taliban fighters retreated from the fighting in Spin Boldak. His body has been handed over by Taliban to the International Committee of Red Cross, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indian-journalist-a-pulitzer-winner-killed-in-afghan-crossfire/articleshow/84489331.cms||---

The court said the accused’s speech was “itself a form of violence” and such acts could not be “tolerated in any civilised society”. This is the second time in two years that the youth, now believed to be 19 years old, has been booked and taken into custody. He had faced the law as a juvenile after firing at Citizenship Amendment Act protesters near Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi on January 30 last year. The court observed that every citizen has the right to express thoughts but not in a manner targeting a community and promoting enmity. “He seems to be very proud of his antecedents. He even instigated people to kill persons of a particular community and chanted slogans in this regard… Such activities cannot be tolerated in any civilised society. Hate speech based on religion and caste has become fashionable these days,” the court said, adding the accused’s speech was “itself a form of violence and such people and their inflammatory speeches are obstacles to the growth of a true democratic spirit”. “Religious tolerance is the need of the time and not intolerance. It is necessary for individuals within the society to get along, especially when a variety of cultures and people with different religious beliefs live in one community or nation,” the court observed. Kulbhushan Bharadwaj, the counsel for the accused, argued that his client had been made a scapegoat and those who were the real culprits were being protected by the cops. “He was not the organizer, nor was he responsible for the entire episode. He delivered a speech after the orators addressed the crowd. Why was only his recording given in court and not of others too?” Bharadwaj argued. “Even before my client spoke, there were several other orators who used very offensive language and hate speech but only my client has been accused and arrested. There were other orators who were powerful persons and they gave inflammatory speeches, but no action has been taken against them,” the counsel told the court. The youth had made the remarks at the mahapanchayat that was called to discuss “love jihad” and religious conversions, among other things. The organisers had denied inviting the boy, claiming he had turned up on his own. The mahapanchayat was held at the Ramleela Ground in Pataudi on July 4. A video clip of the youth’s speech was widely shared on social media, leading to calls for legal action against the gathering and the speakers there. “If they can abduct our sisters, why can’t we abduct theirs? From Pataudi, I want to warn people with a ‘terrorist mindset’ that if I can go to Jamia in support of CAA, Pataudi is not very far,” he had purportedly said. The mahapanchayat was organised under the banner of Hindu Dharm Raksha Manch, led by its president Master Om Singh. It was attended by members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Karni Sena chief and BJP spokesperson Suraj Pal Amu and had participants from 90 adjoining villages. The pamphlets distributed before the gathering read, ‘mahapanchayat against love jihad, market jihad, land jihad and religious conversion’. About 500-600 people participated, according to police. The Greater Noida youth has been charged under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc, and engaging in acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hate-speech-itself-a-form-of-violence-says-court-denies-jamia-gunman-bail/articleshow/84487117.cms||Bagish Jha

They have been rounded up by Pachpaoli cops. Police sources said the video was shot a couple of days ago. At least a dozen youths on motorcycles were seen moving in Pachpaoli area with swords, sticks and iron rods.

Uke had claimed that the former chief minister had filed an intervention application in his petition based on “stolen documents”. A division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar clarified that the petitioner’s contentions didn’t disclose any cognizable offence. “On consideration of overall facts and circumstances, we’re of the view that there’s no necessity of conducting any inquiry to ascertain whether the cognizable offence is disclosed or not. We don’t find that the allegations in the complaint satisfy ingredients of any of the offences under the Official Secrets Act, 1923.” The bench added that merely because Fadnavis used the documents’ copies in judicial proceedings, it can’t be said that he removed the documents with “dishonest” intention. “The copies are produced in support of Fadnavis's case to enable HC to effectively adjudicate his rights in a judicial proceeding involving alleged commission of the offence. He has used those only to vindicate his stand in the writ petition. Therefore, there is no ‘dishonest intention’ on his part causing ‘wrongful loss’ to the petitioner or the GP office and getting ‘wrongful gain’ for himself,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-dismisses-documents-stealing-case-against-fadnavis/articleshow/84487132.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||India||Next 100-125 days critical for averting 3rd wave, says govt||NEW DELHI: The next 100-125 days are very critical to avert a surge in Covid-19 cases that may lead to a third wave, health officials said on Friday underlining that the rise in cases globally and the slow pace of decline in India should be considered as “warning” that an outbreak may happen here too. “Virus is still around. Some localities, districts and states have more burden. So, we need to be careful in this direction because any additional outbreak may happen. Our decline is slow. This is a warning for us. The situation is as of now under control but it may worsen in future. However, it is in our hand to maintain the situation,” Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said. While officials stressed on the need for states to focus on containment measures, particularly in micro-containment zones, and also ramp up vaccination, they also urged people to not become complacent and continue with Covidappropriate behaviour. “Waves are a post-facto evaluation of how we are managing the situation. The intensity of the waves is more important than the number of waves. So it does not matter whether it is the third wave or fourth wave, as this is the natural interaction between virus and human being,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said. Agarwal said the focus should be to prepare health infrastructure and ramp up vaccination to ensure that even if next wave arrives, its intensity is low and the country is prepared to tackle it. Highlighting the rising trajectory of cases in many neighbouring countries, including Bangladesh, Mayanmar, Indonesia and Malaysia, officials said though overall cases in India are declining, there is a significant vulnerable population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/next-100-125-days-critical-for-averting-3rd-wave-says-govt/articleshow/84489523.cms||Sushmi Dey

---||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh urges PM Narendra Modi to resume dialogue with agitating farmers||CHANDIGARH: Citing heightened cross-border threat and increased drone and other terrorist activities by ISI-backed groups, including plans by Khalistani outfits to target certain farm leaders, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately resume dialogue with agitating farmers and make concerted efforts to resolve their issues. Amarinder has proposed to lead an all-party delegation from Punjab for discussion with the Prime Minister to find a durable and amicable solution to the farmers’s protests, “which are threatening the social fabric of the state and impacting the economic activities as well”. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Amarinder warned that powers across the border “may try to play upon the charged emotions of our proud, sincere, and hard-working farmers” of Punjab, which has a long and live international border. “The situation is presently under control but I fear that provocative statements and conduct of some political parties and the emotional backlash might create law and order problems and also lead to irreversible damage to the hard-earned peace in the state,” the chief minister said while underscoring the need for the Centre to address the genuine concerns of farmers. Amarinder’s letter comes amid rising resentment in Punjab on account of the farm laws, which he said he had asked to be reviewed even in his demi-official letters of June and December 2020. It comes in the backdrop of increase in drone activity along the villages falling with 5-6 kms of Indo-Pak border in Punjab, with consignments of weapons and heroin being delivered into India by Pakistan. Intelligence reports also suggest that with the assembly elections in Punjab just a few months away, ISI-led Khalistani and Kashmiri terror outfits are planning terrorist actions in the state in the near future. The chief minister pointed out that farmers have been agitating for the past seven months on Delhi-Haryana borders, and also in the state, demanding repeal of these laws and their protests have been more or less peaceful so far. “It is a little unfortunate that multiple rounds of engagement between the Union ministers and representatives of farmers’ groups have not been successful,” he said. Highlighting some other issues and concerns of farmers, Amarinder referred to his letter written to Modi on September 28, 2020, through which he sought to compensate farmers for the additional cost of managing crop residues at the rate of Rs 100 per quintal of paddy, apart from minimum support price as residue burning always remains a no-cost option for them. Noting that it was extremely important to prevent stubble burning in view of the anticipated third wave of Covid-19, the chief minister said farmers needed to be categorically reassured about their concerns regarding the provisioning of MSP and continued public procurement of wheat and paddy. Their immediate fears about hike in prices of fertilisers after October 31, 2021, also needed to be addressed, as nearly 60% of DAP consumed in the state would be during November and December for the sowing of wheat, the letter reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-urges-pm-to-resume-dialogue-with-agitating-farmers-amid-growing-cross-border-threat/articleshow/84487985.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Trinamool Congress to press for re-introduction of women’s reservation bill in Lok Sabha||KOLKATA: Buoyed by its success in the Bengal polls, largely attributed to women voters, Trinamool Congress will press for re-introduction of the women’s reservation bill in Lok Sabha during Parliament’s monsoon session starting July 19. TMC national secretary Abhishek Banerjee is expected to reach Delhi on July 21 after the party’s Martyrs’ Day rally in Kolkata. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is expected to be in Delhi on July 25. In the all-party meetings over the weekend, Trinamool is likely to press for re-introduction of the bill to corner the BJP and coalesce the opposition. The party has already received informal opposition backing on this, including, significantly, from Naveen Pattanaik’s BJD. TMC Rajya Sabha leader and spokesperson Derek O’Brien said: “Enough of false promises. They should put their money where their mouth is. Mamata Banerjee leads by example, it is time India follows the example.” TMC pointed out how the women’s reservation bill never saw the light of day after the Rajya Sabha passed it and sent it to the Lok Sabha in 2011. The BJP twice promised in its manifesto to bring the now-shelved bill and President Ram Nath Kovind also mentioned this in his speech, TMC leaders said. Against BJP’s 14% women MPs in Lok Sabha and 11% in Rajya Sabha, TMC said party women MPs comprised 41% in Lok Sabha and 36% in the Rajya Sabha. “CM Banerjee is the only woman chief minister in India,” a leader pointed out. Another leader said in Bengal 50% reservation for women in all local bodies has already been introduced by law. “This bill was first introduced in 2008. In 2009, a parliamentary committee scrutinised the recommendations. In 2010, the Upper House passed it. Since then, political parties have only spoken on it, never did anything,” said a leader. CM Banerjee had on Thursday indicated that she may call on President Kovind and PM Narendra Modi during her Delhi stay. According to sources, she is also likely to meet Sonia Gandhi. Mamata has said she is likely to be in Parliament’s central hall, where she is expected to meet other senior MPs. “With no elections now, the party national secretary (Abhishek) and all party MPs will be spending a considerable time in Delhi. In addition to this bill, TMC will also press for slashing fuel price hike and raise the economic turmoil, vaccination and Covid mishandling in the Parliament session,” a source said. Ahead of the party’s showpiece July 21 Martyrs’ Day rally, a lot of speculation arose on Friday with TMC’s reported talks with Shatrughan Sinha. Party leaders did not deny or confirm the speculations. Interest was also triggered by TMC’s July 21 posters seen even in Tamil Nadu referring to “Mamata Amma”. The party will also have a meeting on its Tripura state poll strategy on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-to-press-for-re-introduction-of-womens-reservation-bill-in-ls/articleshow/84487737.cms||Saibal Sen
---||Kolkata||2 Trinamool MPs get anti-defection notice||Kolkata: The Lok Sabha secretariat has issued notices to two Trinamool MPs from West Bengal — Sisir Adhikari from Contai and Sunil Mandal from East Burdwan — under the anti-defection law. The Speaker wants the MPs to reply to the notice within a fortnight. Trinamool’s Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay had submitted written complaints against the two, seeking their disqualification as members of Parliament on grounds that they had joined BJP. The notice reached Sisir, father of Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari, when the latter had made the same complaint against Krishnanagar Uttar MLA Mukul Roy to assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee. The two MPs have to send their replies to the Lok Sabha secretariat ahead of Parliament’s monsoon session when Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee will be holding parleys with opposition leaders in Delhi. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Ray on Friday said the notice was issued two days ago. “We had submitted a detailed report against the two MPs to our Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay. Bandyopadhyay submitted the complaints to the Lok Sabha speaker. Now it is up to the speaker to decide,” he added. Under the procedure, the Lok Sabha speaker, after receiving replies from the two MPs, will refer the matter to Privileges Committee that will hear the matter. Unlike in the Lok Sabha, the assembly speaker has been holding the hearing of the complaint against Mukul Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-trinamool-mps-get-anti-defection-notice/articleshow/84487817.cms||---

Just walk into the Sayajibaug zoo which is all set to offer a close view of wild animals and exotic birds. The zoo spread over 45 acres in Sayajibaug is undergoing a major revamp. “We are preparing to offer one of the most thrilling experiences to Barodians right in the middle of the city. The lion and tiger couple has already been released in the open enclosures so that the visitors can watch them from up close,” said Pratyush Patankar,” Sayajibaug zoo curator.  People can walk through the road and watch the big cats including leopards on either side. “Plans are afoot to have a White Bengal Tiger couple in the zoo within the next couple of months. The Central Zoo Authority has already given us permission for bringing in these tigers. We will also be getting sloth bears,” Patankar told TOI.  Also on the cards is the addition of wild animals like jackals and hyenas along with some apes. The zoo authorities are in the process of preparing a separate enclosure for snakes and lizards. “We will be making a ‘serpentorium’ and bring in about 16 to 18 species of snakes and reptiles. Sayajibaug zoo will for the first time have a separate section for the reptiles,” Patankar said.  Soon, the winged wonders in the zoo too would also be set free from the dingy cages that they had to live in for years. The birds will be released in a huge aviary that has been built inside the zoo.  Visitors can walk in the aviary and enjoy the sight of birds flying around freely. “In the next couple of years, we will add nocturnal animals and a variety of cats. We have made a proposal to the CZA to shift the herbivorous animals to Ajwa,” Patankar added.  Sayajibaug garden is one of the most popular attractions in the city as it is home to a sprawling zoo, a toy train, a museum, an amphitheatre and lush green surroundings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/enjoy-thrill-of-jungle-safari-in-the-heart-of-vadodara-city/articleshow/84485530.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Kolkata||As defection hearing starts, TMC fills up 8 House posts||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress on Friday raised the ante by packing all posts of chairpersons of the eight assembly committees vacated BJP MLAs with its party MLAs even as BJP threatened to take Mukul Roy’s appointment as the assembly Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairperson to court and the President. Trinamool MLAs and members, namely Madan Mitra, Sudipto Roy, Pannalal Haldar, Humayun Kabir, Abdul Khalek Molla and Rukbanur Rahman are among the eight members who replaced BJP chief whip Manoj Tigga and MLAs Mihir Goswami, Anandamoy Burman, Ashok Kirtania, Krishna Kalyani and others. Emerging out of the first hearing in Bengal assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee’s chamber after the two-and-a-half minute hearing on his 64-page complaint seeking disqualification of Roy as MLA, opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari said: “There have been 50 cases of party switching in the West Bengal Assembly over the last 10 years. The anti-defection law was not invoked in a single case. The Speaker held 23 hearings on the Left Front’s defection complaint against MLA Dipali Biswas. But he didn’t reach a conclusion. We will move court urging for a time-bound hearing of the Mukul Roy complaint.” The Speaker has fixed the second hearing on July 30. A BJP legislative delegation will also call on the President and the Lok Sabha Speaker to complain against the “denial” of the post of PAC chairman to the opposition. At Friday’s hearing, Adhikari was accompanied by BJP Kalyani MLA Ambika Roy and BJP Purulia MLA Sudip Mukherjee. “We will place the audio-video clips of Mukul Roy’s joining Trinamool, snapshots of messages from his official Twitter account to court,” the leader of opposition said. Adhikari challenged the Speaker’s ruling making Roy the PAC chairman. “It is a direct violation of Rule 309 of the rules and procedures of the conduct of business in the West Bengal Assembly,” he said. Mukul was unfazed with BJP’s move. “They (BJP) are free to go wherever they want,” he said. State parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee refused to enter into what he called was the Speaker’s domain. “The Speaker has held the hearing. We leave it to him to pass ruling on the BJP complaint,” Chatterjee said. Trinamool seniors didn’t give much importance to the BJP complaint on the ground that Roy was elected on a BJP ticket and had been the MLA on the day when the Speaker made him the PAC chairman as an opposition member experienced in parliamentary affairs. The parliamentary affairs minister instead packed the posts of chairpersons of the eight assembly committees BJP MLAs had vacated in protest against Roy’s election. Adhikari clarified that BJP MLAs would participate in the assembly standing committees. “We are not going to boycott the committees. We will reflect the voices of the people in the assembly forums and also in the House. But we have decided against taking the chairman posts after what the Speaker did with the PAC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-defection-hearing-starts-tmc-fills-up-8-house-posts/articleshow/84487741.cms||Rohit Khanna

Justice Shampa Sarkar, while noting the powers of the state cooperation department to do any act to prevent “misuse, misappropriation of funds” in the interests of the depositors, ruled that the special audit was not required at the moment when the bank authorities were partly complying with the queries of the statutory audit authorities the state had appointed since 2016. “It is seen prima facie that some audit compliances have been done and some have not. The audited balance sheets have been deposited with the Reserve Bank of India... However, as it appears that notices of non-compliance which are disputed by the petitioners, the court is inclined to allow the inspection,” Justice Sarkar observed. The court allowed inspection on the basis of the audit requisitions as mentioned in the letters dated December 6, 2020, and June 3, 2021. “The special audit shall not be conducted without the leave of the court,” the judge ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-stays-special-audit-at-contai-coop-bank/articleshow/84487486.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP MLAs to take plaint to Prez during Didi’s Delhi visit||Kolkata: A Bengal BJP legislature team would be knocking on the doors of Rashtrapati Bhavan by July-end when chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee would be meeting opposition leaders in Delhi with an eye on an anti-Modi front. The BJP brass has worked out a two-pronged campaign against Bengal’s Trinamool government that would culminate in a court of law. On Friday, BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia launched a national campaign on the “law of the ruler instead of rule of law” in Bengal based on the NHRC panel’s report to Calcutta High Court while leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari accused the state government of not complying with the HC order. “Calcutta High Court in its order directed the state administration to convert each and every complaint on post-poll violence into FIRs. The NHRC report shows it was not done. The high court also directed to provide rations to victim families. Not a single family has got rations till date. None of the victims got medical assistance as the court had ordered,” Adhikari said. He also cited news of violence and political vengeance pouring in from Jadavpur, Bolpur, Durgapur and Udaynarayanpur even on Friday. “The mother of a school student in Bolpur had to lodge a complaint with the district magistrate today, saying her son was denied midday meal because he belonged to a BJP supporter family,” Adhikari said. Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said the NHRC panel report vindicated the “breakdown of constitutional machinery” in Bengal that BJP had been flagging for long. Bhattacharya clarified that the party was not going to follow Congress’ “beaten track” and urge imposition of President’s rule in Bengal. “We say this despite the fact that there is no rule of law in Bengal. We leave it to the Supreme Court to give justice to the people of Bengal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-mlas-to-take-plaint-to-prez-during-didis-delhi-visit/articleshow/84487783.cms||Rohit Khanna
