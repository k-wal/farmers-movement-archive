OneWeb -- where Bharti earlier this week announced that it will invest additional Rs 3,700 crore to become the largest shareholder -- may also raise some additional funding soon, its executive chairman, Sunil Bharti Mittal told reporters at a virtual briefing. OneWeb also announced the successful lift-off of another 36 satellites to mark the completion of its 'Five to 50' mission. With this milestone, the company is on the way to deliver connectivity across the United Kingdom, Canada, Alaska, Northern Europe, Greenland, and the Arctic Region. The company is on track for full global coverage in 2022 with a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation of 648 satellites. By May 2022, OneWeb's services will be fully available in India. "By May next year, there will be 100 per cent global coverage. We are less than ten months away from global coverage. We are working feverishly in major markets like India, Russia, Kazakhstan...to ensure that ground networks are in place," Mittal said. Early results of trials are "very satisfying", he said. "Our strategy from day one is to collaborate. We are not here to substitute telecom companies, we are not here to substitute fibre or terrestrial radio. We are not even here to substitute geostationary satellites. We are even talking to them to have a joint go-to-market strategy because there are areas of complimentary services that can be offered," Mittal said. Asked if Airtel will be the only beneficiary of OneWeb's connectivity and services, Mittal said, "No. This is open to every operator in the country, we will love to give this to Jio, to Vodafone...My philosophy has been to build infrastructure, share liberally and lower cost for everyone". OneWeb may raise some more capital in the coming weeks, and 2-3 active conversations are on in this regard. "Our services complement the telecom industry. There are areas in India where broadband connectivity is not available, despite BharatNet, Jio, Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and BSNL, a lot of areas where providing broadband be it fibre or radio is not possible. With this, it will be achieved," Mittal promised. He said the company is in active discussion with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), for also launching its satellites using both PSLV and SSLV.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/oneweb-on-track-to-offer-services-in-india-from-may-2022-sunil-mittal/articleshow/84047131.cms||---

---||World||Trump Organization, CFO indicted on tax fraud charges||NEW YORK: Donald Trump's company and its longtime finance chief were charged Thursday in what a prosecutor called a "sweeping and audacious" tax fraud scheme that saw the Trump executive allegedly receive more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation, including apartment rent, car payments and school tuition. It is the first criminal case New York authorities' two-year investigation into the former president has yielded. According to the indictment filed Wednesday and unveiled Thursday, from 2005 through this year, CFO Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization cheated the state and city out of taxes by conspiring to pay senior executives off the books. Both Weisselberg and lawyers for the Trump Organization pleaded not guilty. Prosecutor Carey Dunne described a 15-year scheme "orchestrated by the most senior executives." Trump himself was not charged at this stage of the investigation, jointly pursued by Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and New York attorney general Letitia James, both Democrats. Weiiselberg, 73, was photographed walking into a building that houses both the criminal courts and the Manhattan district attorney's office around 6:20 am Thursday. He was led into court in the afternoon with his hands cuffed behind his back. Weisselberg's lawyers, Mary Mulligan and Bryan Skarlatos, said in a statement before his appearance that the executive would "fight these charges in court." Skarlatos later said Dunne's remarks were misleading in regard to his client. Weisselberg was ordered to surrender his passport after prosecutors called him a flight risk with access to private jets for foreign travel. He was released without bail, however, and left the courthouse without commenting to assembled reporters. A lieutenant to generations of Trumps, Weisselberg has intimate knowledge of the former president's business dealings and the case could give prosecutors the means to pressure him into cooperating with an ongoing probe into other aspects of the company's business. So far, though, there's no sign that the man regarded by Trump's daughter Ivanka as a "fiercely loyal" deputy who's "stood alongside my father and our family" for decades will suddenly turn on them. In a Thursday statement before the charges were unveiled, the Trump Organization defended Weisselberg, saying the 48-year employee was being used by Vance's office as "a pawn in a scorched-earth attempt to harm the former president." Trump, a Republican, did not respond to reporters' shouted questions about the case as he visited Texas on Wednesday. Earlier in the week, he blasted New York prosecutors as "rude, nasty, and totally biased" and said his company's actions were "standard practice throughout the US business community, and in no way a crime." He issued a press release after the not guilty pleas, once again excoriating the probe as a "political Witch Hunt." Dunne asserted politics played no role in the decision to bring charges. "Politics has no role in the jury chamber and I can assure you it had no role here," Dunne said. In court, Trump Organization lawyer Alan Futerfas said Dunne's remarks sounded like a "press release." "If the name of the company was something else, these charges would not have been brought," Futerfas added outside court. Vance declined to comment on the case as he arrived at the courthouse Thursday. He remained silent as he and James departed in the afternoon. James' office later released a statement calling the indictment "an important marker in the ongoing criminal investigation" into Trump's company and its CFO. "This investigation will continue, and we will follow the facts and the law wherever they may lead," the statement read. Vance, who leaves office at the end of the year, has been conducting a wide-ranging investigation into a variety of matters involving Trump and the Trump Organization, such as hush-money payments paid to women on Trump's behalf and truthfulness in property valuations and tax assessments, among other matters. Vance fought a long battle to get Trump's tax records and has been subpoenaing documents and interviewing company executives and other Trump insiders. James assigned two lawyers from her office to work with Vance's team on the criminal probe while continuing her own civil investigation. Weisselberg came under scrutiny of Vance's investigators, in part, because of questions about his son's use of a Trump apartment at little or no cost. Weisselberg's son Barry - who managed a Trump-operated ice rink in Central Park - paid no reported rent while living in a Trump-owned apartment in 2018 and was charged just $1,000 per month - far below typical Manhattan prices - while living in a Trump apartment from 2005 to 2012, the indictment said. Allen Weisselberg himself, an intensely private man who lived for years in a modest home on Long Island, continued to claim residency there despite living in a company-paid Manhattan apartment, prosecutors said. By doing so, Weisselberg concealed that he was a New York City resident and avoided paying more than $900,000 in federal, state and city income taxes and collected about $133,000 in refunds to which he was not entitled, prosecutors said. According to the indictment, Weisselberg paid for rent on his Manhattan apartment with company checks and directed the company to pay for his utility bills and parking. The company also paid for private school tuition for Weisselberg's grandchildren with checks bearing Donald Trump's signature, for Mercedes-Benz cars driven by Weisselberg and his wife, and gave him cash to hand out tips around Christmas. Such perks were listed on internal Trump company documents as part of Weisselberg's employee compensation, but were not included on his W-2 forms or otherwise reported and the company did not withhold taxes on their value, prosecutors said. Trump's company also issued checks, at Weisselberg's request, to pay for personal expenses and upgrades to his homes and an apartment used by one of his sons, such as new beds, flat-screen TVs, carpeting, and furniture for his Florida residence, prosecutors said. Barry Weisselberg's ex-wife, Jen Weisselberg, has been cooperating with both inquiries and given investigators reams of tax records and other documents. In March, she told The New Yorker that some compensation for Trump Organization executives came in the form of apartments and other items and that "only a small part of your salary is reported." The Trump Organization is the business entity through which the former president manages his many entrepreneurial affairs, including his investments in office towers, hotels and golf courses, his many marketing deals and his television pursuits. Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric have been in charge of the company's day-to-day operations since he became president. Two other Trump executives who were not identified by name also received substantial under-the-table compensation, including lodging and the payment of automobile leases, the indictment said. James Repetti, a tax lawyer and professor at Boston College Law School, said a company like the Trump Organization would generally have a responsibility to withhold taxes not just on salary, but other forms of compensation. Such perks wouldn't be considered taxable income if they were required as a condition of employment, Repetti said, such as providing an apartment for the convenience of an employee who is required to be at the office or worksite at odd or frequent hours, or allowing the use of a car for business purposes. Another prominent New York City real estate figure, the late Leona Helmsley, was convicted of tax fraud in a federal case that arose from her company paying to remodel her home without her reporting that as income. "The IRS routinely looks for abuse of fringe benefits when auditing closely held businesses," Repetti said. "The temptation for the business is that it claims a tax deduction for the expense, while the recipient does not report it in income." Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who's been cooperating with Vance's investigation, wrote in his book "Disloyal," that Trump and Weisselberg were "past masters at allocating expenses that related to non-business matters and finding a way to categorize them so they weren't taxed." Weisselberg first started working for Trump's real estate-developer father, Fred, after answering a newspaper ad for a staff accountant in 1973, working his way up. Keeping a low profile - aside from a 2004 appearance as a guest judge on Trump's reality TV show "The Apprentice" - Weisselberg was barely mentioned in news articles before Trump started running for president and questions arose about the boss' finances and charity. Cohen said Weisselberg was the one who decided how to secretly reimburse him for a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels. The finance chief made headlines again when it was revealed that his signature appeared on one of the reimbursement checks. Barbara Res, who oversaw the construction of Manhattan's Trump Tower, says she was surprised to learn about the seemingly large role Weisselberg has played in Trump's business. She recalls him years ago just collecting rent, paying bills and doing Trump's taxes. "He was the chief accountant, but he wasn't in the inner circle. He would come in with his head down, `Yes, Mr. Trump. No, Mr. Trump,"' Res said. "He's the only person I knew who would call him Mr. Trump. Now he's a big shot."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-organization-cfo-indicted-on-tax-fraud-charges/articleshow/84047575.cms||---

Mayor Jan Polderman of Lytton issued the evacuation order Wednesday, saying on Twitter that the fire was threatening structures and the safety of residents of the community, which is 95 miles (153 km) northeast of Vancouver.  "All residents are advised to leave the community and go to a safe location," Polderman said. In an interview with CBC News, the mayor said the situation was dire for the community of 250 people.  “The whole town is on fire,” he said. “It took, like, a whole 15 minutes from the first sign of smoke to, all of a sudden, there being fire everywhere.”  Erica Berg, a provincial fire information officer, said the evacuation order was issued about an hour after the blaze began but she did not know the size of it.  Highways north and south of the village reported were closed as firefighters also dealt with two other wildfires in the area.  Lytton's temperature hovered around 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 Celsius) Wednesday. That was down from Tuesday, when the village recorded a new Canadian high of 121.2 F (49.6 C), breaking the previous highs of 118.2 F (47.9 C) it reached Monday and 115 F (46.1 C) on Sunday.  Roughly 15 km (10 miles) to the south in the First Nations community of Kanaka Bar, Jean McKay said she and her 22-year-old daughter, Deirdre McKay, started to panic as the smell of smoke grew stronger.  “I was still sitting there and wondering what to pack, emotionally walking out my door but thinking I'm leaving all this behind.' It's hard. Very hard. When my girlfriend told me her house was burning it really hit home,” McKay said.  “My daughter phoned before we lost services and stuff, she's telling us, Get out of there, get out of there.” There was one memento her daughter couldn't leave behind: “She grabbed my dad's picture off the wall,” McKay said. “I'm telling her, We're walking out and this is the home we built forever and that you guys grew up in.' It's harsh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/wildfire-threatens-british-columbia-village-that-hit-121-f/articleshow/84047603.cms||---

The explosion took place in front of Askari Park on Quetta's airport road.  Balochistan Home Minister Mir Zia Langove said a convoy of six Pakistan Army vehicles were passing through the route when a bomb planted on a motorcycle parked on the roadside was detonated.  He said initial investigations suggested that four to five kg explosives were used in the blast.  According to Langove, five security officials were injured in the blast and they were sent to a military hospital for treatment.  But a spokesperson for the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said the injured included one soldier of the Frontier Corps.  The exact nature of the blast is yet to be determined.  In recent days terrorists and separatists have carried out a number of attacks on security forces and in public places, which the spokesperson said, were clearly aimed at destabilizing peace in the province.  Last week, five Frontier Corps soldiers were gunned down by terrorists in Sibi district's Sangan area.  Earlier in June, four FC soldiers, including a junior commissioned officer, were killed in a bomb blast on Margat-Quetta road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/6-injured-in-blast-in-pakistans-balochistan-province/articleshow/84048527.cms||---

The White House said the report - which includes the salaries of all political appointees - showed that the Biden administration was the most diverse in US history, in line with the Democratic president's commitment to build an administration that looks like America. It said the administration had hired 1,500 presidential appointees across the federal government in the first 100 days in office, double the number hired by any prior administration in that time period. Of those, more than half are women, and half identify as racially and/or ethnically diverse, it said. "In alignment with the president’s commitment to diversity and pay equity, the White House has taken significant steps to ensure the White House staff reflects the diversity of the country and the highest standards of economic and social justice for all," it said. The percentages for women and people of color are slightly smaller for the 59 senior staff members at the White House, with women accounting for 56%, and people from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds accounting for 36%. The report also showed a pay gap between men and women of just under one percent, with the women earning $93,752 on average, while men earn $94,639.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/women-make-up-60-of-white-house-staff-diversity-total-at-44/articleshow/84048502.cms||---
---||World||Biden consoles Florida families as search of collapse site on pause due to safety concerns||SURFSIDE: President Joe Biden on Thursday pledged federal assistance and offered comfort to the families of those killed and missing in last week's Florida condominium collapse, as the search-and-rescue operation was temporarily suspended due to concerns about the stability of the remaining structure.  Biden, whose personal experience with tragedy has marked his political career, traveled to Florida to reprise the role of "consoler-in-chief" a week after the 12-story Champlain Towers South partially caved in as residents slept.  The confirmed death toll remained at 18, after the discovery of six more bodies in the ruins of the condo, including two children, aged 4 and 10. Another 145 people are missing and feared trapped in the rubble, with hopes of finding any survivors dimming with each passing day.  After arriving in Miami, Biden attended a briefing with local officials, including Governor Ron DeSantis, who is widely seen as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2024.  Biden, a Democrat, told them he would deliver "whatever you need" and said he expected the federal government would cover the full costs for the county and state.  "We're not going anywhere," he said. "This is life or death."  Following the briefing, Biden met with firefighters and other first responders who have been searching for victims at the site.  "I just wanted to say: thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you," said Biden, who also appeared to refer to the people who rescued his two sons from a car crash that killed his first wife and infant daughter in 1972.  Biden later met in private with some families of the victims at the St. Regis hotel, not far from the collapsed condo, where he made brief remarks before speaking with each family individually, according to a senior White House official. DeSantis and other officials joined him. Rescue Effort Paused Rescue workers at the site were instructed to stop just after 2 am on Thursday when movement in the debris raised concerns that the part of the building still standing could collapse, officials said.  "The search-and-rescue operation will continue as soon as it is safe to do so," Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said at a news briefing. Officials said they were unsure when that would happen.  Authorities said they have not given up on locating survivors. But nobody has been pulled alive from the wreckage since the early hours of the disaster in the oceanfront town of Surfside, adjacent to Miami Beach.  Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said rescuers did hear signs of life during their initial efforts last week.  "They were searching for a female voice, is what we heard for several hours," he said. "Eventually, we didn't hear her voice anymore."  Officials are also keeping a watchful eye on Tropical Storm Elsa, which formed over the Atlantic and could reach south Florida by Monday, potentially hampering search operations.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency has dispatched five urban search-and-rescue teams - each comprised of 80 members - to assist in sifting through the rubble, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One.  DeSantis said workers have removed some 1,400 tons of material from the collapse site.  Biden had delayed his visit to Florida to avoid interrupting rescue efforts.  Thursday's trip is Biden's second visit to the scene of a disaster since he became president in January. In February, he traveled to Texas after a winter storm left millions without power or clean water for days and killed several people.  Investigators have not determined what caused nearly half of the 40-year-old condo complex to crumble in one of the deadliest building collapses in US history.  But a 2018 report prepared by engineering firm Morabito Consultants ahead of a building safety recertification process found structural deficiencies in the 136-unit complex that are now the focus of inquiries.  The Washington Post reported late on Wednesday that the majority of the board of the Surfside condominium, including its president, resigned in 2019, partly in frustration over what was seen as the sluggish response to the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-consoles-florida-families-as-search-of-collapse-site-on-pause-due-to-safety-concerns/articleshow/84049147.cms||---

---||Business||June petrol sales rebound to 90% of pre-virus level, diesel 18% short||NEW DELHI: Fuel consumption recovered smartly in June to almost pre-pandemic level as economic activities picked up and holidaymakers took to the highways in large numbers after states lifted curbs on the back of declining Covid-19 cases across the country. Petrol consumption posted a monthly jump of nearly 30% and diesel more than 18% in June to reach 90% and 81%, respectively, of sales in the same month of 2019, when consumption was ‘normal’. Compared to last year, the volume of petrol sold in June is nearly 6% higher and diesel is short by just about 2%. Demand was drastically curtailed in June 2019 due to the countrywide lockdown to check the Coronavirus from spreading. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan expects demand to be back to pre-pandemic level by the end of this year. “There are signs of demand resurgence… We are confident by the end of the year, we will be in a very robust position to restore our original consumption behaviour,” he told an industry function on Tuesday. Petrol consumption had dropped 17% and diesel sales, a proxy for economic activities, had slid 16% in May, the lowest since August 2020, as the second Covid wave prompted lockdowns in states, especially the industrialised ones. Jet fuel consumption too recovered sequentially in June, falling just 4% short of May and 10% less than June 2020. But compared to 2019, demand was still down 61% as summer holidaymakers largely preferred to drive to nearby destinations rather than fly to distant places. Demand for LPG, or household cooking gas, posted a monthly rise of more than 6%, marking 26% growth over June 2019 and 9.5% higher than the year-ago period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/june-petrol-sales-rebound-to-90-of-pre-virus-level-diesel-18-short/articleshow/84049696.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Colombian law already includes jail sentences of around eight years for obstructing public highways, violence against public servants and property, but Duque did not say by how much he was looking to increase prison time. "We've seen some acts of vandalism that have destroyed public infrastructure, that have burned municipal courthouses, that have also attacked commercial premises and clearly we need to toughen penalties," Duque told reporters. Since the end of April, the Andean country has seen anti-government protests across the country, the majority of which have been peaceful. Although protests began in opposition to a now-withdrawn tax reform - which prompted the resignation of the former finance minister - demonstrators have since widened their demands to include calls for a basic income, opportunities for youth and an end to police violence. Almost all blockades have been lifted from highways, but smaller protests continue in cities such as Bogota, the capital, with clashes reported between police and demonstrators. The attorney general's office has so far linked 24 deaths to the protests, with another 11 under investigation. However, rights groups accuse security forces of killing dozens more protesters. Opposition politicians accused Duque of working to criminalize protests. "The anti-vandalism law proposed by Duque will surely go in the direction of becoming an instrument to criminalize demonstrations and restrict the right to peaceful protest", said Sergio Marin, a congressman for Comunes, the political party of the now-demobilized FARC guerrillas. "Peaceful protest is a constitutional right that we all have, and peaceful means without violence and without violating the rights of others," Duque said, adding that vandalism was not part of the protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/colombias-duque-looks-to-get-tough-on-vandalism-critics-decry-attack-on-protests/articleshow/84049589.cms||---

Registering 48.1 in June, below May’s 50.8, the IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) was below the critical no-change mark of 50 for the first time since July 2020. The latest results highlighted renewed contractions in factory orders, production, exports and quantities of purchases. With business optimism fading over the month, job shedding continued, the survey results showed. The PMI averaged 51.5 in the opening quarter of 2021-22, the lowest three-month figure since the same period one year ago. Several economists, agencies and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are of the view that impact of the second wave would be muted and confined to the first quarter of the current financial year, which ends in March 2022, with possibility of some spillover to July. Majority of them have reduced GDP growth projections from strong double-digit expansion projected earlier for 2021-22, citing the impact of the second Covid-19 wave. The survey is compiled from responses from questionnaires sent to purchasing managers of about 400 manufacturers. “The intensification of the Covid-19 crisis in India had a detrimental impact on the manufacturing economy. Growth of new orders, production, exports and input purchasing was interrupted in June as containment measures aimed at bringing the pandemic under control restrained demand,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. “In all cases, however, rates of contraction were softer than during the first lockdown. Companies became increasingly worried about when the pandemic will end, which resulted in downward revisions to output growth projections. As a result of subdued optimism, jobs were shed again in June,” said De Lima. Some economists said the PMI data was at variance with other data, which displayed some improvement. “The dip in the June PMI is somewhat at odds with the mostly positive high frequency data available so far. Following the phased unlocking, GST e-way bills, vehicle registration, electricity demand and petrol consumption have all reported a sequential improvement over May 2021 and a YoY growth in June 2021. While diesel consumption has contracted on a year-on-year basis in June 2021, this is likely to be on account of high prices diverting some freight to the railways,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA. The survey showed that the stretch of new order growth that started in August 2020 came to an end in June, with firms linking the deterioration in demand to the pandemic. Despite being solid, the pace of contraction was much softer than those registered at the onset of Covid-19 last year. Covid-19 restrictions also curtailed international demand for Indian goods. New export orders decreased for the first time in ten months, albeit modestly, the survey showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mfg-activity-contracts-for-first-time-in-11-months-pmi-survey/articleshow/84049936.cms||---

In a foreword to the financial stability report (FSR) released on Thursday, Das said the hit on banks’ balance sheets and performance due to the pandemic has been much less than what was projected earlier. According to the stress tests conducted by the RBI, the banking sector’s bad loans or gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) may increase from 7.48% in March 2021 to 9.8% by March 2022 under the baseline scenario, and to 11.22% under a severe stress scenario. In January, the RBI had said that GNPAs in September 2021 would be around 13.5% under the baseline scenario and 14.8% under a severe stress situation. The RBI has cautioned banks on the risks arising out of loans to small businesses and retail. “While banks’ exposures to better rated large borrowers are declining, there are incipient signs of stress in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and retail segments,” the report said. The central bank has explained the difference between the January projection and the current report, stating that the earlier FSR was based on an estimate of bad loans as there was a standstill order against loans being classified as NPAs. In March 2021, the Supreme Court lifted the bar on loans being classified as NPAs and the actual data became available, enabling the RBI to do stress tests based on the regular methodology.

Despite the improved outlook, the RBI called for continuing policy stimulus as supply constraints, rising commodity prices and large swings in global capital flows pose challenges. “Hasty withdrawal of policy stimulus to support growth before sufficient coverage of the vaccination drive can sap macro-financial resilience and have adverse unintended consequences,” the FSR said. It also highlighted cyber attacks and data breaches as those among the emerging risks.

This is a significant turnaround compared to a net loss of nearly Rs 5,000 crore for the industry in FY19.Pointing out that banks have enough capital to meet challenges arising out of the pandemic, the RBI said that the stability indicator for banks with respect to soundness, profitability and liquidity improved in March 2021 as compared to the previous year. Even in a worst-case scenario, banks would still have capital adequacy of 10.7%, the RBI said. In the report, the central bank highlighted the risks posed by big tech financial firms, which also straddle non-financial lines of businesses with opaque overreaching governance structures. These companies have the potential to become dominant players and can overcome limits to scale by exploiting network effects. The RBI has said that one way to deal with this was to use a blend of entity-based and activity-based regulation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-19-2nd-wave-has-dented-recovery-rbi/articleshow/84050085.cms||---
---||World||Fugitive Greek neo-Nazi deputy leader caught: police||ATHENS: Police in Greece on Thursday arrested the deputy leader of neo-Nazi group Golden Dawn who had evaded justice since he was sentenced to over 13 years in jail in October, a police source said. Christos Pappas had been on the run since a landmark trial handed down sentences to more than 50 Golden Dawn defendants on charges including running a criminal organisation, murder and assault and illegal weapons possession. Sentenced to over 13 years in prison, the 59-year-old Pappas was arrested at a home in the Athens district of Zografou, a police source told AFP. The mustachioed former furniture store owner, whose lieutenant general father helped install dictator Georgios Papadopoulos in 1967, is a noted fan of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and collector of fascist memorabilia. He was the last Golden Dawn cadre to evade justice, after former senior member Ioannis Lagos, a member of the European Parliament, was extradited from Belgium in May. Pappas had also evaded arrest in 2013, when senior Golden Dawn members had been rounded up following the murder of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas, the crime that led to the organisation's undoing. The Golden Dawn trial, which began in 2015, has been described as one of the most significant in Greek political history. The organisation's founder and longterm leader Nikos Michaloliakos has also been sentenced to over 13 years in prison, alongside several senior party members. The former fringe party won 18 seats in parliament in 2012 after tapping into anti-austerity and anti-migrant anger during Greece's decade-long debt crisis. It failed to win a single seat in the last parliamentary election in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/fugitive-greek-neo-nazi-deputy-leader-caught-police/articleshow/84050147.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM meets Shah, Nadda as buzz about likely exit grows||DEHRADUN: In what seemed to be a repeat of the scenario that unfolded in the political landscape of Uttarakhand in March, when Trivendra Singh Rawat was replaced by Tirath Singh Rawat, political circles were abuzz on Thursday with talk of another change of guard at the top in the state. What fuelled the speculation was the fact that chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, who was urgently summoned to Delhi a day before and met party chief JP Nadda and home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday night -- just as Trivendra was hastily called in the middle of the assembly session in March and met the party leadership prior to his removal -- was asked to stay back though he was scheduled to return to Dehradun on Thursday evening. This, sources said, hinted that the party leadership had perhaps made up its mind to replace Rawat with another MLA for the top post. This was necessitated, sources added, as the BJP was not keen to press for bypolls in Uttarakhand. Rawat, who is Lok Sabha MP from Pauri Garhwal, has to get elected to the assembly before September 10 in order to remain in the CM’s chair. “Even though the decision to conduct bypolls is the Election Commission’s, the BJP is not too keen on it as holding bypolls in Uttarakhand would mean having to organise it in other states too where seats are vacant,” sources added. IANS quoted top sources in BJP as saying that Rawat might be asked to step down as CM and work to strengthen the party on the ground. “In an hour-long meeting, all the possibilities were discussed and Rawat was explained about Section 151 of Act which says that by-election must be held within six months of a vacancy occurring. Nadda also explained that the section also provided two exceptions for not holding by-elections -- if the remainder of the term in relation to the vacancy is less than a year or if the Election Commission, in consultation with the Centre, certifies that it is difficult to hold the by-election within the said period,” a party insider was quoted as saying by IANS. Speculation was also rife in Dehradun on possible contenders for the CM’s post if Tirath were to make way for another MLA. A few MLAs including tourism minister Satpal Maharaj had already left for the national capital from Ramnagar, where the BJP’s three-day Chintan Shivir was held earlier this week. Amid the unfolding political developments in Delhi, former CM Trivendra Rawat, too, on Wednesday met Juna akhada chief Avdheshanand Giri in Haridwar. The meeting was seen by political observers as an attempt to pacify the seer community that was reportedly upset with Trivendra over his decision to hold the Kumbh Mela in a curtailed manner. State government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal, when asked about the unfolding political developments, said, “The CM had a meeting with the party chief in Delhi and they had an extensive discussion related to the 2022 assembly polls and the preparations required. For any national party leader, going to Delhi is not a big affair, and therefore the CM’s visit should be regarded as a routine visit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-cm-meets-shah-nadda-as-buzz-about-likely-exit-grows/articleshow/84050289.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||World||Parts of sweeping new Georgia election law debated in court||ATLANTA: Voting integrity activists argue that several parts of Georgia's new election law criminalize normal election observation activities, while the state asserts that those provisions reinforce previous protections and are necessary for election integrity.  US District Judge J.P. Boulee heard arguments Thursday on the activists' request that he bar election officials from enforcing those provisions, but did not immediately rule on the request.  Georgia's overhaul of election rules, like similar measures enacted this year in other GOP-controlled states, has received broad criticism from Democrats and others who say it makes it harder to vote, particularly for voters of color.  There are eight federal lawsuits challenging aspects of Georgia's new law, including one filed last week by the U.S. Department of Justice. They mostly target parts of the law that critics say threaten voting rights. The hearing Thursday focused narrowly on a handful of provisions and didn't address the most commonly criticized parts of the law.  Boulee is overseeing all eight of the lawsuits challenging the law. The reason he heard arguments on this narrow request is that the activists had asked for an emergency temporary hold on those parts of the law. There have been no similar requests for immediate action in the other lawsuits.  The challenged provisions mostly have to do with monitoring or photographing parts of the election process.  Bruce Brown, a lawyer for the activists and others who filed the suit, said the state misrepresents the law as promoting transparency and election integrity.  "They say that, but what they mean by transparency is a fake transparency," Brown said during the online hearing. "It's transparency theater. It's integrity theater."  Instead, Brown said, the challenged provisions of the law effectively obstruct election transparency and intimidate voters and members of the news media who provide citizen oversight for the way elections are run.  Bryan Tyson, a lawyer for the state, argued that the challenged provisions are necessary to protect ballot secrecy and the integrity of the state's elections. He also noted that none of the activists have said that they intend to violate the challenged provisions, and that they face no harm unless they violate these provisions.  The Georgia First Amendment Foundation has filed a brief in the case, saying the new law "has imposed new and dangerous restrictions on news gathering that threaten the ability of the public and press to remain informed about Georgia elections."  One challenged provision makes it a felony to intentionally observe a voter "in a manner that would allow such person to see for whom or what the elector is voting." Brown showed photos of the large, upright touchscreen voting machines, noting that it's nearly impossible for anyone in the polling place not to see how someone's voting.  Tyson argued that the new provision applies to intentional efforts to see someone's votes, not accidental observation.  A second provision prohibits monitors and observers from communicating any information they see during absentee ballot processing "to anyone other than an election official who needs such information to lawfully carry out his or her official duties." Another makes it a misdemeanor for monitors and observers to estimate the number of absentee ballots cast or any votes on the absentee ballots cast. These two provisions are attempts to silence critics and limit unfavorable press coverage of how elections are run, Brown said.  Tyson said it was necessary to make sure no vote counts would be disclosed before the polls close since the new law allows absentee ballots to be scanned in the weeks before an election.  A provision that prohibits the photographing of the face of a touchscreen voting machine "while a ballot is being voted or while an elector's votes are displayed on such electronic marker" or the photographing of a voted ballot would prevent routine news coverage of voting and counting of ballots, Brown argued. He showed the judge well-known news photos of notable public figures voting and of election workers counting ballots during the 2020 election.  Photography was already restricted inside polling places, with some narrow exceptions, Tyson said. He raised the possibility of a vote-buying scheme requiring voters to show photographic proof of how they voted.  The activists are also challenging an absentee ballot application deadline 11 days before an election. The deadline for the certification of election results can fall 11 days before a runoff, meaning people may not be able to get an absentee ballot for a runoff election, Brown argued.  Tyson said it's often clear as early as election night that there will be a runoff and that voters don't have to wait for results to be certified to request an absentee ballot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/parts-of-sweeping-new-georgia-election-law-debated-in-court/articleshow/84050613.cms||---

Four other construction workers were removed from the debris shortly after the building in the US capital came down at about 3:30 pm (1930 GMT), said John Donnelly, assistant chief of DC Fire and EMS. The rescued workers were taken from the scene about 5 miles (8 km) north of the Capitol building to a local hospital. They had non-life-threatening injuries, Donnelly said. The trapped worker was conscious and in contact with fire crews as they sought to free him from the rubble, Donnelly said, adding: "We are talking to him and I view that as a good thing." Images showed dozens of firefighters swarming over piles of wood left behind by the collapse, using saws and heavy equipment to move large pieces. Last week, a condominium tower collapsed in Surfside, Florida as most residents slept. Searchers there have recovered 18 bodies and say another 145 people remain missing. President Joe Biden traveled to the scene of the 12-story Champlain Towers South in Florida on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/one-trapped-several-hurt-in-washington-dc-building-collapse/articleshow/84050109.cms||---

Nineteen-year-old Anissa Weier asked Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren this year to release her from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute, arguing she was no longer a threat to anyone. Bohren agreed during a hearing Thursday, though she won't be released immediately. Bohren ordered the state to prepare a release plan. He gave state officials 60 days. Meanwhile, Weier will return to the mental health facility. A hearing is set for September 10. Weier and her friend Morgan Geyser lured classmate Payton Leutner into a Waukesha park in May 2014 following a sleepover. Geyser stabbed Leutner multiple times as Weier encouraged Geyser to inflict the injuries. All three girls were 12 years old at the time. Leutner barely survived her wounds. Bohren sentenced Weier in December 2017 to 25 years at Winnebago. Geyser is serving a maximum 40-year-old sentence at a mental health facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/judge-orders-release-of-wisconsin-woman-in-slender-man-case/articleshow/84050527.cms||---
---||World||In Florida, Biden woos Trump ally DeSantis in unity pitch||BAL HARBOUR: Sitting next to one of his fiercest critics on Thursday, President Joe Biden managed to find a silver lining in the grave tragedy that brought them together.  "You know what's good about this?" Biden asked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, not waiting for an answer. "We're letting the nation know we can cooperate."  DeSantis, a Republican rising star closely tied to former President Donald Trump, is at the forefront of partisan fights across the country over anti-coronavirus lockdowns, racial justice protests and efforts to restrict voter access.  Yet in recent days the two rivals have come together over the collapse of a 12-story building in Surfside, Florida, more than a week ago that has killed at least 18 people, with another 145 missing and feared dead.  Biden has sent millions of federal dollars and scores of search-and-rescue personnel to assist local officials in combing the rubble of the Champlain Towers South for survivors, capped by the visit on Thursday.  As he spoke about unity during the brief portion of their meeting that was open to reporters, Biden looked DeSantis squarely in the eyes and the governor nodded in agreement.  "Thank you, Mr President," DeSantis said. "You recognized the severity of this tragedy from day one and you've been very supportive."  "We've had no bureaucracy" and no delays in getting federal resources to Florida, he continued.  The encounter may be important to the Biden White House as it pursues a "reach across the aisle" strategy to build and showcase support for his presidency, particularly with a small group of "swing" voters. That's an uphill battle with many Republicans, some of whom believe Trump's repeated false claims that voter fraud led to Biden's victory.  The effort seemed to impress at least one observer, Moshe Horowitz, who was staying at the hotel where Biden and DeSantis met.  "There should always be dialogue between both sides," the New Yorker told Reuters as he tried to get a glimpse of the president outside the hotel. He said he opposes Biden's policies so far but supported the show of bipartisanship.  "DeSantis and Biden meeting each other is a wonderful thing, and they should continue to do that," he said.  In his January inaugural address, Biden pledged to "fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did." He pushes for Republican support in Congress for his massive spending plans, and has made a point of visiting Republican-voting states to push infrastructure and Covid-19 vaccines. In Texas, following a deadly winter storm, he worked closely with Governor Greg Abbott, another Trump-tied Republican who did not initially acknowledge the Democrat's election win.  DeSantis, who is widely seen as weighing a potential 2024 challenge for the presidency, has refused to comment on whether the 2020 election was rigged as Trump claims, but has complained about the Biden administration's policies.  His office has declined to say whether he will attend a campaign-style rally Trump plans for Saturday in Sarasota.  Although Trump no longer holds public office and has only hinted at another presidential run, he continues to cast a long shadow over Republican politics. Officials close to the former president say he has instructed his team to collect relief aid for Surfside families at the rally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/in-florida-biden-woos-trump-ally-desantis-in-unity-pitch/articleshow/84051096.cms||---

While partly allowing a revision application filed by the biological and adoptive parents of a girl, Justice Manish Pitale quashed the Yavatmal district court’s order rejecting their adoption plea. The district court held that provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, weren’t applicable in this case since the child wasn’t abandoned, orphaned or surrendered, or in conflict with law and in need of care and protection. “A perusal of the JJ Act shows that an elaborate procedure is laid down and contemplated for adoption of a child by relatives, who are also specified under the said enactment. If adoption was to be restrictively applicable only to children in conflict with law or those in need of care and protection, such elaborate provisions governing the procedure for adoption by relatives or step-parents wouldn’t have been provided,” the HC said. Justice Pitale directed the Yavatmal judge to hear the application once again on merit, while considering the new provisions of the legislation. After both set of parents knocked the judiciary’s doors through counsel Ira Khisti, the HC had appointed Firdos Mirza as amicus curiae to assist it. The latter informed that if the JJ Act, 2015, is compared to the earlier enactment, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, it becomes evident that various new provisions have been enacted in the law, thereby broadening the scope of legislation and including in its fold specific procedure for adoption of children. Pointing out to Chapter VIII of the JJ Act, 2015, he contended that no such chapter existed in the earlier Act and that this is a significant departure. He also stated Section 2(3) defines ‘adoption regulations’, 2(12) defines ‘child’, 2(52) defines ‘relative’ and 2(57) defines ‘Specialized Adoption Agency’ to contend there was a conscious departure from JJ Act, 2000. Quoting adoption regulations of 2017, Justice Pitale said those have been framed by exercising powers under the JJ Act, 2015. “...The JJ Act, 2015, not only intends to take care of children, who are in conflict with law and those in need of care and protection, but also to provide for and regulate adoption of children from relatives and step-parents”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/adoption-cant-be-restricted-to-those-in-need-of-care-hc/articleshow/84050504.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||World||Trump-era law on surprise medical bills advances under Biden||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration on Thursday began putting in place consumer protections against ``surprise'' medical bills enacted in bipartisan legislation signed last year by former President Donald Trump.  Regulations jointly issued by four federal agencies spell out protections for insured patients against surprise billing in medical emergencies, and unexpected charges from out-of-network doctors at an in-network facility. Out-of-network clinicians and service providers would also be barred from billing patients for the difference between their charges and what insurance paid.  Surprise medical bills are a common and frustrating problem for people with health insurance, even if they thought they were protected. Charges that can run from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars come from doctors and hospitals outside the network of a patient's health insurance plan. It's estimated that about 1 in 5 emergency visits and 1 in 6 inpatient admissions triggers a surprise bill.  Thursday's action signaled that the Biden administration is committed to having the new protections in place for consumers by Jan. 1, as the law requires. Work continues on another major piece of the new framework, a process to resolve billing disputes between insurers and medical providers without dragging patients into the middle. It's a rare demonstration of bipartisanship on health care, one of the most politically polarized issues of the past decade, as Republicans repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. "It's about getting good health care at a good price for all Americans - it's a bipartisan effort,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, whose department is working on the issue with Treasury, Labor and the federal government's personnel agency. "You will no longer be stuck in the middle of a payments dispute because you were blindsided by a charge you weren't expecting.''  Consumer advocates, insurers and medical and hospital associations will pore over the complicated fine print of the Biden administration's rule. Arcane definitions pertaining to such issues as pricing can translate to millions of dollars of economic impact. It may take days to identify all the winners and losers. "They are clearly pulling out the stops to get this implemented in a timely manner,'' said Karen Pollitz, a health insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ``We know this has been a problem that people put at the top of their list of worries.''  Pollitz said it could take until well into next year to see how the new system works in real life. Currently millions of surprise bills are sent every year. ``Even if 90% of them are handled perfectly the first year, you could still have hundreds of thousands that go through to the patient,'' she said.  Although many states have passed curbs on surprise billing, federal action was needed to protect patients covered by large employer plans regulated at the national level. The Biden administration is allowing 60 days for public comment on its rule.  The surprise billing law passed by Congress last year takes patients and their families out of the financial equation by limiting what they can be billed for out-of-network services to a fee that's based on in-network charges. That amount gets counted toward their in-network annual deductible.  Insurers and medical services providers would work out billing disputes between themselves or submit them to an independent dispute resolution system, yet to be set up. The central provisions of the legislation include: Holding patients harmless from surprise bills resulting from emergency medical care. Protections apply if the patient is seen at an out-of-network facility, or if they are treated by an out-of-network clinician at an in-network hospital. In either case, the patient can only be billed based on their plan's in-network rate. Protecting patients admitted to an in-network hospital for a planned procedure when an out-of-network clinician gets involved and submits. This can happen when a surgeon is called in to assist in the operating room, or if the anesthesiologist on duty is not part of the patient's plan. Requiring out-of-network service providers to give patients 72-hour notice of their estimated charges. Patients would have to agree to receive out-of-network care for the hospital or doctor to then bill them. This exception is not available for emergency departments or certain kinds of medical professionals, such as radiologists. Barring air ambulance services from sending patients surprise bills for more than the in-network cost sharing amount. According to the Kaiser Foundation, 18% of emergency visits lead to at least one out-of-network charge for people covered by large employers, as do 16% of in-network inpatient admissions. New York and Texas have among the highest rates.  The problem is a direct of result of high health care costs. To try to keep premiums in check, insurers set up networks of hospitals and doctors who agree in advance on payment levels. But some high-demand clinicians, such as emergency room doctors and anesthesiologists, have an incentive to stay out of at least some networks, to maximize their earnings. That dynamic has grown more complicated as profit-seeking investors buy out medical practices that have greater billing leverage.  Public programs like Medicare and Medicaid prohibit or restrict such billing practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-era-law-on-surprise-medical-bills-advances-under-biden/articleshow/84051085.cms||---

After a brief argument from counsel Hari Shankar Jain, a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari issued notices to the three respondents - Centre, WB government and EC, but refused to seek the response from chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is also made a party in the PIL. The PIL by Ranjana Agnihotri, Hindu Front for Justice and Jitendra Singh said the TMC fought the elections on communal lines and after its victory in the Assembly polls, an emboldened supporters belonging to the minority indulged in wanton violence, looting, arson and sexual assault of women and targeted members of Hindu community who had supported BJP. The SC has already entertained petitions seeking SC-appointed SIT or CBI probe into the post-poll violence in the state. The petitioners said that the Election Commission remained a mute spectator to complaints against TMC and Mamata Banerjee making appeals on the communal lines, an offence under the Representation of People Act, to garner votes of the Muslim community. "TMC Party contested the election purely on communal basis arousing the feelings of the Muslims and appealing to them to remain united and vote for the party for their better future as well as indulging in communal rhetoric. A complaint was made to the EC against the communal appeal made by the TMC. But, the EC failed to hold free and fair elections conforming to the democratic norms," they alleged. The PIL alleged that a section of Muslims is humiliating Hindus after the victory of TMC. "Celebrating victory is part of democracy but creating an atmosphere of terror, turmoil, fear, unrest and intention to suppress Hindus is a very serious and sensitive matter and the Union government must take action in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. But unfortunately the Centre ritually summoned a report in the matter without any follow up action, due to which thousands of men and women are weeping and are left in the lurch." "As a result of violence, loot, killings and terror, enmasse Hindus have been forced to leave their native place and to migrate to Assam, like Hindus who were forced to do the same thing in the year 1990 in Kashmir. There is every possibility that Muslims will try to forcibly convert Hindus to have their stronghold on future elections and TMC being the beneficiary may push for that move. If such an action is resorted to the same will be against the sovereignty and integrity of India giving rise to Kashmir like situation. There is every possibility that those Hindus who do not succumb to Muslim pressure will be forced to leave their native place," the PIL claimed. It requested the SC to direct the WB government to ensure protection to the life, liberty and dignity of Hindus and their religious places. Seeking a Sc-monitored inquiry into the post-poll violence, the PIL said, "The SC may also direct the central government to take appropriate action under Article 355 and 356 of the Constitution at the appropriate time to protect the citizen’s life, liberty and dignity."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-entertains-pil-seeking-protection-of-hindus-in-west-bengal/articleshow/84051401.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

"An estimated 25 percent of all reported SARS-COV-2 sequences nationwide are the Delta variants, and in some regions of the country, nearly one in two sequences is a Delta variant," Walensky added, as quoted by Sputnik.  Speaking at a press briefing, Walensky also underscored the correlation that exists between the low vaccination rates and the spread of the Delta variant. According to reports, the Delta strain is believed to be the fastest spreading and most contagious coronavirus variant.  On Thursday, Dr Hans Henri Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe said that a 10-week decline in the number of Covid-19 cases in the 53 countries in the WHO European Region has come to an end.  "This is taking place in the context of a rapidly evolving situation; a new variant of concern - the Delta variant; and in a Region where despite tremendous efforts by the Member States, millions remain unvaccinated," he added.  With cases now doubling in Africa every three weeks, the Delta variant of Covid-19 has spread to 16 countries and it is present in three of the five nations reporting the highest caseloads, UN News reported. The variant is the most contagious yet - up to 60 percent more transmissible than other variants.  Along with Alpha and Beta, Delta is fuelling an aggressive third wave across Africa, with case numbers climbing faster than all earlier peaks, according to the WHO.  On Thursday, WHO experts warned that the numbers have increased for six consecutive weeks, up by 25 per cent last week, reaching 202,000 positive cases. Deaths also rose by 15 per cent across 38 African countries, to nearly 3,000.

An administration official said Biden would use the moment to call for the option of citizenship for immigrants who were brought to the US illegally as children, for foreign-born people who have temporary protected status due to strife in their birth countries and for farm workers. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the upcoming ceremony and insisted on anonymity. Immigration has been a political flashpoint as Biden has sought to renew visa and refugee programs that were cut or suspended during the Trump administration. In February, Biden and congressional Democrats proposed a major immigration overhaul that included an eight-year pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million people living in the United States illegally. Republican lawmakers blocked the effort and have criticized the administration for the rise in people attempting to cross the southern border without visas. The immigration debate involves fundamental issues of national security and economic growth. Republican lawmakers seeking to limit immigration say it will help keep the US safe and protect jobs for native-born citizens. But economists - many associated with Democrats - say increased immigration would boost economic growth that is currently weighed down by falling fertility rates. On Friday, the president will also recognize Sandra Lindsay as an "Outstanding American by Choice," a US Citizenship and Immigration Services program that recognizes citizens who have been naturalized. Lindsay is believed to be the first American to be vaccinated against Covid-19 outside of a clinical trial. She works as director of nursing for critical care at Northwell Health's Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, New York.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-to-host-naturalization-event-push-path-to-citizenship/articleshow/84051658.cms||---
---||World||New Mexico gives most US funding to child care of any state||SANTA FE: New Mexico is directing the nation's biggest chunk of federal coronavirus relief money to helping middle-class families pay for child care, a vast expansion aimed at getting parents back to work in one of the poorest states in America.  Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Thursday that the state will subsidize child care at 350% of the federal poverty line, or about $93,000 for a family of four. That's up from about $54,000.  "We're going to double the subsidies for child care," said the Democratic governor, who was flanked by balloons and overlooked a gaggle of young children wearing party hats. She added that the state could one day go even further: "Why don't we have universal access for child care?"  New Mexico's two-year spending commitment will expand eligibility to the highest income levels of any state. It's the largest and latest example of states using pandemic relief aid to subsidize child care. Others include Georgia and Montana, while California is debating a child care funding package.  Some states, like New Jersey, offer subsidies at 350% of the federal poverty line but only when relatives are providing care.  New Mexico also will be the first state to increase payments to child care providers by using a reimbursement formula that focuses on the local cost of running child care businesses, instead of the market rate of what parents can pay.  State Early Childhood Secretary Elizabeth Groginsky called the announcement an "important landmark on our journey towards creating a true cradle-to-career education system that helps all New Mexicans thrive."  Groginsky was pivotal for winning federal approval of the new formula in Washington, D.C., where she served as assistant superintendent of early learning for the District of Columbia before taking the job in New Mexico. While the formulas are not identical, the experience there provides an idea of how much child care providers will benefit.  Child care providers in Washington got a 24% to 57% increase in reimbursement during the transition in 2019, according to officials there. No providers saw a decrease.  Early childhood advocates say the new rules will lead to increased pay for child care workers, who often make just above minimum wage. They also expect improvements in worker-to-child ratios, the main benchmark of child care center quality.  "So for your child what that means is that there's a lower ratio between (staff) and children," said Katherine Freeman, CEO at Growing Up New Mexico. "Why is that the most significant thing? Because children need individual attention."  Parents should see immediate benefits, especially those who earned too much to qualify for past subsidies but too little to pay for child care without spending half their paycheck.  The expansion is paid for in part by $300 million in federal awards that expire in 2024.  Democratic state lawmakers already have a plan in motion to increase child care funding long term by tapping into a unique $20 billion state endowment funded by resource extraction royalties and market investments.  A ballot initiative before voters next year could increase the amount of funding from the endowment to the state's Early Childhood Education and Care Department and possibly replace the federal funding when it expires.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-mexico-gives-most-us-funding-to-child-care-of-any-state/articleshow/84051808.cms||---
---||World||US Supreme Court Justice Breyer mum on his future||WASHINGTON: Justice Stephen Breyer, the US Supreme Court's oldest member, remained mum about his future on Thursday after it issued the final two rulings of a nine-month term during which some liberal activists had urged him to retire.  Breyer, 82, has served on the court for 27 years. These activists want him to step aside to give Democratic President Joe Biden the chance to name a replacement who could serve in the lifetime post for decades.  The court has a 6-3 conservative majority after Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump was able to name three justices during his four years in office, most recently appointing Amy Coney Barrett last year after the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan make up the court's liberal bloc.  Breyer has given no public indication that he plans to retire. In an April speech, he said it was important for the justices not to appear driven by political considerations. Justices often announce their retirements soon after the court issues its final rulings.  Biden during the 2020 presidential election campaign pledged to nominate a Black woman to fill any Supreme Court vacancy, which would be a historic first. Democrats hold a slim majority in the US Senate, which under the US Constitution has the power to confirm Supreme Court nominees.  Some liberal activists are concerned that if Breyer does not retire while the Democrats control the Senate, Republicans could block confirmation of his successor or a future Republican president could name his replacement and shift the court even further to the right.  Breyer authored the court's major June 17 ruling rejecting a Republican bid to invalidate Obamacare, preserving the landmark healthcare law formally called the Affordable Care Act for the third time since its 2010 enactment. He also wrote the June 23 ruling in a major free speech case that sided with a cheerleader who had been punished by her high school for a profanity-laced social media post.  In the past, Breyer has written important rulings upholding abortion rights and has become a persistent critic of the death penalty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-supreme-court-justice-breyer-mum-on-his-future/articleshow/84051839.cms||---

The man walked up to the workers near Cleveland Park in Spartanburg about 3 pm, asked them what they were doing, then started shooting, Spartanburg Water spokeswoman Jennifer Candler told news outlets.  Candler did not release any information on the conditions of the workers. A Spartanburg County deputy also was shot by the man, but Sheriff Chuck Wright told news outlets that the officer is all right. He did not give any other details about the shooting or whether they have a suspect.

---||World||UN Security Council likely to meet next week on Ethiopia dam||UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations Security Council will likely meet next week to discuss a dispute between Sudan, Ethiopia, and Egypt over a giant dam built by Ethiopia on the Blue Nile, French UN Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said on Thursday.  Arab states last month called on the 15-member council to meet to discuss the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and Ethiopia's plans to fill the dam for a second time this summer without an agreement with Sudan and Egypt.  Ethiopia is not keen on security council involvement and instead asked the body to defer the issue to the African Union. Ethiopia previously rejected calls from Egypt and Sudan to involve mediators outside the African Union.  De Riviere, council president for July, pointed out that there was little the security council could do other than bring the parties together to express their concerns and then encourage them to return to negotiations to reach a solution.  "I don't think the council can do much more than that," he told reporters.  Ethiopia is pinning its hopes of economic development and power generation on the dam, while the two downstream countries - Egypt and Sudan - are concerned about it and seeking a binding agreement on the filling and operation of the dam.  Egypt relies on the Nile River for as much as 90% of its fresh water and sees the dam as an existential threat. Sudan is concerned about the operation of its own Nile dams and water stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/un-security-council-likely-to-meet-next-week-on-ethiopia-dam/articleshow/84052135.cms||---

Coast Guard petty officer 2nd class Michael Himes said it was hard to estimate how much oil leaked, but it has affected marsh grass along the shoreline. Crews noticed the leak around 8 am while cutting away a fifth section of the Golden Ray, which capsized in September 2019 with about 4,200 automobiles in its cargo decks. Roughly half the ship remains partially submerged off St. Simons Island, about 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Savannah. Himes said changing currents can push oil past the barrier surrounding the ship. "This is an unfortunate consequence of removing a wreck in this kind of environment," Himes said. Demolition crews began working in November to remove the ship by cutting it into eight giant chunks and placing them on barges. Officials had hoped to have the work finished by last January, but numerous problems have caused delays. Most of the fuel onboard the ship was siphoned from its tanks long before demolition began, but Himes said officials knew there was the potential for additional leaks. Crews in June also cleaned up oil from the ship that escaped the environmental protection barrier. This leak appears worse, said Fletcher Sams, with the environmental group, Altamaha Riverkeeper. "We are seeing sheen everywhere," he said. "It's a lot of fuel."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/coast-guard-large-oil-leak-during-georgia-ship-demolition/articleshow/84051944.cms||---
---||World||Los Angeles passes measure limiting homeless encampments||LOS ANGELES: The Los Angeles City Council passed a sweeping anti-camping measure Thursday that will severely limit widespread homeless encampments that have become an eyesore across the city.  The measure was billed as a compassionate approach to get people off streets and restore access to public spaces in the city with nation's second-largest homeless population, though critics said it would criminalize the problem. It wouldn't be enforced until someone has turned down an offer of shelter.  "I can't think of any reason why we would not unite in support of what the people of Los Angeles want us to do," said Councilman Paul Krekorian, coauthor of the measure. "Restore order to our streets, while also uplifting and providing services to those in need."  Among other limits, the ordinance that passed 13-2 would ban sitting, lying, sleeping or storing personal property on sidewalks that block handicap access, near driveways and within 500 feet (152 meters) of schools, day care centers, libraries or parks.  The measure, which won't take effect until a second vote next month, replaces a more punitive anti-camping proposal that had stalled in a committee. Police would only get involved if there's a crime, and people who resist leaving would be cited for an infraction instead of getting arrested for a misdemeanor.  The majority of callers during a limited public comment period spoke in support of the measure, describing homeless encounters that included assaults, break-ins and one explaining how children walking to school are forced into a busy street to avoid tents that crowd sidewalks.  People who opposed the measure, including a couple who used profanity, said it lacked compassion and would criminalize a problem the city has failed to solve.  An advocate for the homeless said the measure is loosely written to allow broad interpretation for enforcement and will make most of the city off-limits to people living on the street.  "Draconian is definitely the correct word," said Pete White of the LA Community Action Network. "I think it's impossible to comply."  White said that an ordinance that limited where people could park RVs and sleep in cars overnight left little more than 5% of streets available for parking. Homelessness has become a crisis of "epic proportions," the measure says. It remains near the top of political agendas across the state.  California is home to more than a quarter of the nation's homeless people, according to federal data. The city of Los Angeles has an estimated homeless population of more than 40,000, which is second only to New York's.  A federal judge directed the city of LA to offer housing to thousands of homeless people on notorious Skid Row by this fall, though an appeals court put that on hold.  Two Republican candidates seeking to replace Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in a recall election came to LA County this week to announce their plans to address the statewide problem.  While the crisis is widespread across Los Angeles, a dispute about how to solve the problem has become a flashpoint on Venice Beach, where an encampment exploded in size during the coronavirus pandemic.  The situation has left residents weary and worried for their safety - and for the wellbeing of those living in tents - after several violent incidents, including a killing last week of a person living on the beach. A homeless person was arrested in the case.  Sheriff Alex Villanueva, whose deputies patrol unincorporated parts of the county, entered city turf with a homeless outreach team to announce a plan to get people into housing by July 4.  His lofty overture, which has moved some people off the boardwalk but is unlikely to meet his goal by this weekend, was met with resistance from much of LA's political establishment, particularly Councilmember Mike Bonin, whose district includes Venice.  Bonin, who criticized an approach that could lead to housing at the jail Villanueva runs if people don't leave, launched his own plan days later. That effort, which has moved 64 people indoors, is being rolled out in several phases into August and promises to eventually provide permanent housing.  Bonin was among councilmembers opposing the measure Thursday, saying the city doesn't have tens of thousands of beds needed for the homeless and criticizing the plan for not showing where sleeping and camping would be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/los-angeles-passes-measure-limiting-homeless-encampments/articleshow/84052302.cms||---

The court also made scathing observations about the legislature, saying no lessons had been learned from the Nirbhaya case "as the age of a child is still kept below 16 years in heinous offences under Section 15 of the act of 2015, giving a free hand to delinquents under the age of 16 to commit heinous offences". It wondered "how many such sacrifices would be needed". "Thus, apparently, despite committing a heinous offence, the petitioner (15-year-old boy) will be tried as a juvenile only because he is less than 16 years old," Justice Subodh Abhyankar said. He made the observations on June 25 while dismissing a criminal revision petition regarding bail sought by a 15-year-old boy accused of raping a 10-year-old girl in Jhabua. He was taken into custody on January 21 and has since been in a remand home. The boy’s bail plea was denied by the Juvenile Justice Board on February 2. He appealed in the sessions court, which upheld the JJ Board’s decision on March 2, after which the boy’s counsel filed a criminal revision petition in the HC. The judge said that if the accused gets bail, the survivor will not be safe as he will be protected under the JJ Act. The court rejected the boy’s petition, saying that he had on January 10 raped a girl aged 10 years and four months, leaving her bleeding profusely. She required a blood transfusion and surgical correction at Indore’s MY Hospital. The petitioner had allegedly raped her and threatened her against revealing the crime to anyone, the judge said, pointing out that his conduct "clearly reveals that he committed the offence with full consciousness and it cannot be said that it was committed in ignorance". "An offence of rape, being carnal in nature, cannot be committed unless a person has specific knowledge of the same," Justice Abhyankar said, observing that the girl can’t be said to be safe and secure if he is set free on bail, "especially when he is enjoying the protection of the Juvenile Justice Act".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jj-act-inadequate-to-deal-with-heinous-crimes-by-juveniles-under-16-madhya-pradesh-hc/articleshow/84052308.cms||---

---||World||Jeff Bezos picks female aerospace pioneer to launch with him||CAPE CANAVERAL: Sixty years after acing astronaut tests but barred because she was a woman, Wally Funk will rocket into space alongside Jeff Bezos in just three weeks.  Bezos' company Blue Origin announced Thursday that the pioneering pilot will be aboard the July 20 launch from West Texas, flying in the capsule as an "honored guest." She'll join Bezos, his brother and the winner of a $28 million charity auction, as the first people to ride a New Shepard rocket.  At 82, she'll be the oldest person to launch into space.  Funk was the youngest of the so-called Mercury 13 women who went through astronaut testing in the early 1960s, but never made it to space - or even NASA's astronaut corps - because they were female. Back then, all of NASA's astronauts were male military test pilots.  Funk said she feels "fabulous" about finally getting the chance to go to space.  "I'll love every second of it. Whoooo! Ha-ha. I can hardly wait," Funk said in an Instagram video posted by Bezos.  "Nothing has ever gotten in my way," she added. "They said, 'Well, you're a girl, you can't do that.' I said, 'Guess what, doesn't matter what you are. You can still do it if you want to do it and I like to do things that nobody has ever done."  In a cosmic twist, she'll beat the late John Glenn, who set a record at age 77 when flying aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998. Glenn pooh-poohed the idea of women flying in space, shortly after he became the first American to orbit the world in 1962.  "No one has waited longer," Bezos said via Instagram. "It's time. Welcome to the crew, Wally."  The Amazon founder is stepping down as the company's CEO on Monday.  The upcoming launch - which follows 15 successful test flights - will open the door to paying customers. Blue Origin has yet to announce ticket prices or when the public might strap into the spacious six-seat capsule, which reaches an altitude of about 65 miles, just beyond the edge of space. The up-and-down flights last 10 minutes.  The reusable rocket is named for Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American in space, and July 20 is the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.  Funk, who lives near Dallas, was the first female inspector for the Federal Aviation Administration and the first female air safety investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. In the posted video, she said she has 19,600 flying hours and has taught more than 3,000 people to fly.  She was among two dozen female pilots who underwent six days of rigorous physical tests - the same ones administered to the Mercury astronaut candidates - in 1960 and 1961. The doctor who had tested the Mercury 7 men had heard the Soviets planned to send a woman to space and he wanted to see if women could endure the effects of weightlessness.  The candidates had to spend hours in an isolation water tank, swallow rubber hose, and get needles stuck in their heads, among other things.  Thirteen of the women - including Funk - passed. But the program was abruptly canceled, and the Soviets went on to launch the first woman into space - Valentina Tereshkova - in 1963.  "They told me that I had done better and completed the work faster than any of the guys," Funk recalled. "So I got hold of NASA four times. I said I want to become an astronaut, but nobody would take me. I didn't think that I would ever get to go up."  It wasn't until 1983 that the first American woman soared into space - Sally Ride, who died in 2012. And it wasn't until 1995 that an American woman piloted a spaceship - Eileen Collins aboard shuttle Discovery. Many of the Mercury 13 women gathered at Cape Canaveral for that launch.  Keen to get to space, Funk reserved a seat years ago on Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic rocket ship. She remains on the passenger list; the company plans three more test flights from New Mexico, one of them with Branson on board, before launching customers.  In the video, Bezos describes to Funk how the four Blue Origin passengers will experience zero gravity for a few minutes, then land gently on the desert surface and open the hatch.  "You step outside. What's the first thing you say?" he asked her.  "I will say, 'Honey, that was the best thing that ever happened to me!" Funk replied, embracing Bezos in a big bear hug.  ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

In an important decision, the SC had on May 5 declared by majority that only the President (read Centre) can take decisions for declaring socially and educationally backward communities for granting reservation and upheld the 102nd constitutional amendment denuding the power of states in this regard. As the verdict could have wider ramifications on a sensitive issue of reservation, the Centre also filed review petition seeking re-examination of the SC’s interpretation of 102nd constitutional amendment. But a five-judge bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, which had delivered the verdict on the legality of Maratha reservation, refused to re-examine the issue. “We have gone through the review petition filed against the judgment. The grounds taken in the review petition do not fall within the limited ground on which review petition can be considered. The grounds have already been dealt with in the main judgment. We do not find any sufficient ground to entertain this review petition. The review petition is dismissed,” the bench said in its order on June 28, which was uploaded on the SC’s website on Thursday. While delivering the verdict, the five-judge constitution bench was unanimous on the validity of the 102nd constitutional amendment but they differed on the implication of the amendment for recognising socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs). While Justices Rao, Gupta and Bhat concluded that the amendment has taken away the power of states to decide on SEBC and only the President can take a decision, Justices Bhushan and Nazeer held that states can also identify SEBC for granting reservation in their territory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-junks-govt-plea-wont-review-maratha-ruling/articleshow/84052788.cms||---

Dealing with a PIL which sought a direction to Speakers to expeditiously dispose of disqualification petitions, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy said, “How can we make a law providing timeframe for Speakers to decide disqualification petitions? It is a matter for Parliament to deliberate and decide.” The petitioner had argued that delayed decisions negated the mandate of the Constitution’s anti-defection provisions. The Supreme Court has from time to time expressed its displeasure over the inordinate delay on the part of Speakers to decide such petitions. In January 2020, an SC bench headed by Justice R F Nariman had fixed a three-month timeline for the Manipur assembly Speaker to decide a disqualification petition. On Thursday, petitioner Ranajit Mukherjee told the SC that the actions of Speakers of different states, and their failure to take timely action in the face of recent political defections, were arbitrary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/its-for-parliament-to-rein-in-partisan-speakers-supreme-court/articleshow/84052864.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Business||130 nations clear min tax rate plan for MNCs||NEW DELHI: The world took a big step toward sweeping changes to global taxation as 130 countries and jurisdictions endorsed setting a minimum rate for corporations along with rules to share the spoils from multinational firms like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. After years of missteps and setbacks, the deal brokered in negotiations at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development sets the stage for Group of 20 finance ministers to sign off on an agreement in principle at a meeting in Venice next week. That could mean implementation as soon as 2023 of rules that would curtail tax avoidance by making multinational companies pay an effective rate of “at least 15%” and give smaller countries more tax revenue from foreign firms. A “small group” of nations “have not yet joined” the plan, the Paris-based OECD said in a statement Thursday. That includes Hungary and Ireland, which has attracted some of the world’s big businesses with low taxes. Several key countries that had been question marks agreed to the terms, including India, China and Turkey, according to the OECD. The technical details may leave room for further concessions to developing economies. The broad agreement Thursday averts another stumble that could have proved fatal for efforts to rework tax rules, given only a short window of opportunity to get a global deal approved by the US Congress and other national parliaments. ‘Fair Share’US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen lauded the news, saying it was “an historic day for economic diplomacy.” Yellen, in a statement Thursday, declared that an international “race to the bottom” on corporate tax rates that robbed countries of revenue needed for infrastructure, education and other needs had moved a step closer to ending. “In the United States, this agreement will ensure that corporations shoulder a fair share of that burden,” she said. “We have a chance now to build a global and domestic tax system that lets American workers and businesses compete and win in the world economy.” The absence of Ireland and Hungary from the deal could yet create problems for the European Union to implement the plans. Ireland’s finance minister Paschal Donohoe said last month that any deal on a minimum rate must meet the needs of “small and large countries, developed and developing.” French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said he would spend the coming week before the G-20 meeting redoubling his efforts to convince reluctant European countries to “make the necessary efforts to join an historic agreement that very broadly brings together the states of the planet.” Resolving the issue has become increasingly urgent for the world economy after disagreements over taxing tech firms and setting a minimum rate spiraled into trade tensions last year. The promise of nearly $150 billion in extra revenue for governments also helped get a deal over the line as most countries face massive budget shortfalls in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The difficulty the deal’s advocates have faced is getting developing nations to sign up wholesale to something initially brokered by the Group of Seven. The small club of rich economies, including the US, UK and France, agreed in London last month on a broad outline for the two pillars of the OECD negotiations: a mechanism to share rights to tax “at least 20%” of the profits above a 10% margin of the largest multinationals; and a minimum corporate tax of at least 15%. As it is, the OECD document released Thursday made some changes to those proposals, saying that the amount of profit to be reallocated should be between 20% to 30% of residual profit above a 10% margin, potentially increasing gains for smaller economies. It also specifies that companies with revenue above 20 billion euros ($24 billion) will be subject to the new rules on where they are taxed. In a concession to smaller economies, the Inclusive Framework agreed to review the terms after seven years and reduce the threshold to 10 billion euros. The smallest economies will also benefit from a lower threshold to enable them to tax multinationals, according to the OECD terms. The deal resolves another issue by ensuring that Amazon.com Inc. will be subject to tax in local jurisdictions, Le Maire said, even as the company posts profit margins below 10%. That means the online retail giant’s more-profitable cloud services business would be subject to the new rules under what the OECD is calling “segmentation” that may be applied in “exceptional circumstances” when company units meet the revenue and profit thresholds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/130-nations-clear-min-tax-rate-plan-for-mncs/articleshow/84053002.cms||---

Credit for those goes to hard-working doctors, healthcare workers, frontline workers for saving many lives,” Modi said while addressing an event organised by the Indian Medical Association. Times ViewDoctors and health workers have worked tirelessly during the Covid-19 crisis. Many have fallen to the killer virus. The nation owes them a deep gratitude. But appreciation for those engaged in battling the virus would be more meaningful if we created better work conditions for them. That’s what is urgently needed.Over the first and second wave of the pandemic, IMA said they have lost 1,500 doctors. The Prime Minister said the sheer number of patients served by doctors in India put them ahead of the rest of the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/despite-infra-handicap-our-docs-saved-lakhs-of-lives-pm/articleshow/84052885.cms||---

Apart from these, Mexico is the only other country to have registered more than 2 lakh deaths. There are ten countries where more than one lakh people have succumbed to Covid or related complications. With 6 lakh deaths, the US is at the top of this list and is followed by Brazil (5.2 lakh), India (4.0 lakh), Mexico (2.3 lakh) and Peru with 1.9 lakh deaths. The others with five figure death tolls are Russia, the UK, Italy, France and Colombia. Among these countries, India’s deaths per million population is by far the lowest at 287. It’s 916 in Russia and between 1,000 and 2,000 for France, Mexico, the US, and UK. Among these countries, the ratio is highest for Peru, which has seen 5,765 deaths for every million of its population. For Colombia, Italy and Brazil, the other three countries that have seen over a lakh deaths so far, the death per million ratio is over 2,000 but less than 3,000. India’s case fatality rate (deaths per 100 infections) is 1.3, which again is the lowest among these countries. When compared to other large Asian countries (both economy and population) and its neighbourhood, however, India’s death per million ratio is among the highest. Except for Nepal, which has seen 308 deaths per million of its population, most of these countries have a lower ratio than India. The Philippines and Indonesia are the only other countries where this ratio exceeded 200. The ratio is 160 for Malaysia, 143 for Sri Lanka and 122 for Afghanistan. It is less than 100 for Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand. In case fatality rate, India is better than most of these countries, but Sri Lanka, Thailand and Malaysia have even lower CFR. The latest data from Johns Hopkins University’s Covid dashboard and UN population estimates for 2021 shows that among 121 countries with a population of more than 5 million, there are 54 that have reported higher deaths per million as compared to India. The ratio is lower than India for 66 of these countries.

After getting the nod from the state government, a case was registered on Wednesday, besides a notice was also served to both the accused in Mati Jail of Kanpur Dehat district. With this, the total number of accused of Bikru massacre against whom NSA has been slapped has risen to three. Inspector Chaubeypur Krishna Mohan Rai said, “After the approval of the report sent by the DM to the government, a case has been registered against Bablu Muslim and Ramesh Chandra under NSA.” “There is an allegation against both of them of resorting to indiscriminate firing along with gangster Vikas Dubey and that had claimed lives of eight policemen including deputy superintendent of police Devendra Kumar Mishra on the July 2 & 3 2020 night. We had served notice to Bablu Muslim and Ramesh Chandra under the National Security Act,” he added. Earlier, in the third week of June, the Kanpur police had invoked NSA against one Shivam Dubey (25), an aide and cousin of Vikas Dubey, who along with the gangster was also allegedly involved in gunning down eight cops, who had gone to arrest them in connection with an attempt to murder case lodged at Chaubeypur police station by a local Rahul Tiwari. Under the NSA, a person can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if the authorities feel he or she is a threat to national security or law and order. To recall, eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were ambushed in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur when they were going to arrest Dubey and fell to bullets fired from rooftops shortly after midnight on July 2 & 3, 2020. Dubey was killed in an encounter in the morning of July 10 when a police vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur met with an accident and he tried to escape from the spot in Bhauti area in Sachendi, the police had said. Prior to Dubey’s encounter, five of his alleged associates were killed in separate encounters, while 36 including two cops and four women were arrested and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/nsa-invoked-against-2-moreaccused-of-bikru-massacre/articleshow/84046589.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Covid second wave hurls sex workers into debt trap, says study||VIJAYAWADA: The situation of sex workers has worsened in the wake of Covid-19, said a study conducted by Tafteesh and Help organisation recently. On an average, 70 per cent of sex workers from AP have taken loans in May at an interest rate of 20 per cent and above, which has wrecked their financial standing. The analysis of income and loan information of 335 survivors of human trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation and sex workers from West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh has found that 201 or 60 per cent of them have taken some loan at a time of this study in May to cope with financial difficulties created by the pandemic and lockdown. “We have conducted a similar study after the first wave of Covid-19. The situation was somehow under control then. Government and many voluntary organisations supplied ration and essential commodities to vulnerable groups. But the government focused on strengthening the health care system during the second wave and no one has come forward to help sex workers. It forced them to take loans at high interest,” N Rammohan Rao, chief of Help a NGO working for the welfare of trafficking victims. A total of 120,000 sex workers in Andhra Pradesh are living on starvation diet for the past two years. To overcome the situation, they were depending on private loans and were stuck in debts for the past two years, he added. Meharunnisa, state convener of Vimukti, a forum working for sex workers, said, “We have interacted with sex workers from Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam districts. Many sex workers who took loans during the first wave of Covid-19 are still paying high interests. Covid-19 second wave has worsened the situation with 70 per cent of them having taken from private money lenders at high interest for medical expenses in May.” “I am worried about the increasing amount of debt at a time when I am unable to afford rations for my family. I have weathered many storms. But this time, I do not see any solution to the distress that we are in,” said Pushpha (name changed), a Vimukthi member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-second-wave-hurls-sex-workers-into-debt-trap-study/articleshow/84045975.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Patna||'Supremacy of bureaucracy': Fed up with officials, Bihar minister offers to quit||PATNA: State social welfare minister Madan Sahni on Thursday offered to resign from his post, citing supremacy of bureaucracy in the state government. The move created a stir in political circles as Sahni is a minister from JD(U) quota and considered close to CM Nitish Kumar. “I have decided to resign from the post as a mark of protest over the way a minister is being treated by the state bureaucracy. What’s the purpose of being a minister if I can’t serve the people. The officers don’t listen to ministers. Hence, the work of the people is getting hampered,” he told mediapersons. Sahni added, “I am not here to have a spacious bungalow or a car. I am here to serve the people who have elected me. The CM will have to take a final call on the matter. A minister has now no role in transfer and posting of the employees of the department.” The minister also demanded a probe into the assets of a senior bureaucrat who was serving on a particular post for the past several years. “We have been facing such an adverse situation for long,” he added. Sahni said several ministers were facing similar situation. He, however, clarified that he would remain in the JD(U) and serve the party as a dedicated worker. Sahni is the JD(U) MLA from Bahadurpur in Darbhanga district. He had also served as minister during the earlier stint of Nitish Kumar. “This had happened during my earliest stint too, but I remained quite. It is enough now,” he told this newspaper over phone. Sources said social welfare department’s secretary Pankaj Kumar was earlier shifted following a tug of war between the minister and him. Sahni’s case is not an isolated one. Earlier, a senior BJP leader, Gyanendra Gyanu, had expressed similar views on the senior officers’ role in the transfer and posting of the public servants in different government departments. Reacting to Sahni’s move, Congress spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari said the minister’s statements hinted at unbridled bureaucracy in the state. “This is not a good sign for the state,” he added. Former CM and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi also took a swipe at the state’s bureaucracy. “The babus are calling the shots, which demean the minister's position,” he said. RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said despite Sahni being a senior minister, he is getting humiliated by the bureaucrats. The JD(U) leaders, however, avoided to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fed-up-with-officials-minister-offers-to-quit/articleshow/84046123.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Most of MPs from Bihar vaccinated||PATNA: Most of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members from Bihar have taken the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccines, as they brace up to participate in the monsoon session of Parliament, that will be a “normal session”. Earlier, the three sessions were truncated due to the coronavirus pandemic. Reports said the monsoon session of Parliament is likely to begin from July 19 to August 13. The Lok Sabha has 540 MPs and the Rajya Sabha 232 members. Reports also said the Covid-19 vaccination was not pre-requisite as 75% of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members have taken the second dose of the vaccine and the rest have got the first dose. When contacted on phone, a section of the Lok Sabha members from Bihar across parties said that they have taken “both the doses.” In the cases of a few others, their staff maintained the same about their respective MPs. From Bihar, the Lok Sabha has 40 MPs, including 17 from BJP, 16 from JD(U) and one from the Congress. Six other MPs were elected from the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which, however, has split with five MPs going with its rebel Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras, abandoning his nephew Chirag Paswan, who was elected from Jamui. The Rajya Sabha has 15 members from the state. Among the five Union ministers from the state are Ravi Shankar Prasad, Giriraj Singh, Raj Kumar Singh, Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Nityanand Rai. While Prasad was among the first of the Union ministers from the state who took the first jab a day after PM Narendra Modi, President Ramnath Kovind and Union home minister Amit Shah had their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at AIIMS- Delhi on March 1, marking the start of the second vaccination drive that was meant to cover persons above 60 years of age. Prasad took his first dose at AIIMS Patna on March 2 and second dose on April 2 at AIIMS-Delhi. Giriraj had his first dose on March 3 at Sadar Hospital, Begusarai. Choubeytook his second dose on June 24. JD(U) MP Dinesh Chandra Yadav, who took the first dose in the Parliament annexe building and second dose at a vaccination centre in his Madhepura parliamentary constituency, said, “Even in Delhi, the MPs from Bihar were telling each other to take the vaccines. As far as I know, most of the MPs have taken both their doses. You cannot ask people to take the vaccine, unless you yourself take it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/most-of-mps-from-bihar-vaccinated/articleshow/84045311.cms||Abhay Singh

The dome, touted to be the first of its kind project, is erected on a road within the city. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) had envisaged the project in July 2014 soon after the Akota-Dandiabazaar road was inaugurated in February 2014. But work began on the project only a year later. Besides a solar power generation unit, the dome was planned as a structure that would be an attraction on the road that has emerged as a place where many spend time or go for a drive. It is also popular amongst walkers, runners and cyclists. The project was delayed due to several roadblocks. The progress on the project remained slow. Several reasons including accidents during work, VMC’s reluctance to close traffic completely on the road as well as the lockdown led to the tardy progress of the project. The VMC was initially looking to install solar panels on a public-private partnership mode so that it did not have to spend much on the project. However, it had to do away with the idea as there were not many takers for it. “The project was delayed due to situations we had not expected. But it still remains a novel project,” said an official. Speaking at the inauguration, energy minister Saurabh Patel said that the project was located in the heart of the city and would lead to saving lakhs of rupees. A memorandum of understanding for the project was also exchanged by the VMC and Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/solar-panel-dome-sees-light-of-the-day-after-seven-years/articleshow/84045310.cms||---
---||Patna||Sales in automobile sector down by over 60% in Patna||PATNA: The automobile sector in Bihar has been severely hit by the Covid-induced lockdown. It has been almost five weeks since the state government allowed the automobile showrooms to open on alternate days, but the footfall is still low. All major automobile dealers in the state capital report consistent losses and difficulties in making recovery. “The pandemic has hit the sales by more than 60%. Customers are slightly hesitant and scared to visit showrooms and take test drives. Covid also affected their financial conditions whereas there is also a hike in vehicle prices,” an authorised dealer of a company in Patna said in its statement. The pandemic has forced the industry to get digitised. Customers are taking reviews and demos on video calls. The automobile sector is providing home service, such as test drives and delivery at home with all the precautions. Sunil Kumar, senior relationship manager of an automobile dealer at Patliputra Colony, said the response is very disheartening, compared to last year. “In June last, we were making a profit of around 50%. this year, we have suffered 35% loss. There is minimal enquiry, online as well. Even when our selected customers enquire, we are short on supply, as the manufacturing sector is also at its low. We struggle to meet even low demands. July-August is considered a sluggish period in the industry. So, we are looking forward to the festive season in October,” he said. Industry experts say people, especially of the middle and the lower-middle class, have become more judicious with their expenditure. It has been reflecting in the steep fall in sales of lower and mid-range vehicles. Sandeep Saras, the owner of a two-wheeler auto dealership at Kankarbagh, said: “We are unable to even meet the minimum target. Last year, we managed to recover mainly because May was open. This year, May was entirely closed. The wedding season in April, May and June could not be utilised as many people postponed the marriage to October and November. Akhlaqur Rahman, the sales manager at a four-wheeler dealership on Bhattacharya Road, said the walk-in is down by over 50%. “The situation after the reopening has not even been close to satisfactory. Online enquiry is rarely convertible. We are facing a loss of over 40% since the reopening. Last year, people thought that the virus is gone, so they didn’t postpone weddings and spent freely. But this year, the fear of getting infected as well as the return of another wave haunted most of the people,” he said. Sales manager of another showroom at Bhattacharya Road said: “Sales of lower priced cars have reduced to minimal. Whatever we are making is by selling our luxury models. The walk-in is down by 50%. There was hardly any attendance for the launch of our new car on Friday.” Many small businesses like the autoparts and auto repair stores, which depend on the automobile industry, have been affected as well. Rambabu, who has a two-wheeler auto spare parts store at Kankarbagh, said he has four branches. Paying rents and bills during the lockdown was especially difficult for him. “Business after reopening is down by 50%. Even supply of genuine parts has been reduced,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sales-in-automobile-sector-down-by-over-60-in-patna/articleshow/84045386.cms||---

The minister, who inaugurated an RT-PCR lab at Siwan sadar hospital, said Siwan was the 10th district in the state to get the facility. “At least 96 samples can be tested at a time and 1,000 samples in a day at the lab. While there was just one virology lab in the country before Covid-19 pandemic, it has crossed 2,500-mark now,” he said. Pandey said a CT scan machine would also be installed at the Siwan sadar hospital for which tender process has been completed. He added, “Along with all these facilities, oxygen plants at Maharajganj Anumandal Hospital and Siwan sadar hospital are also being established.” The minister said health facilities in the state were being strengthened to face any upcoming challenges. “Apart from medical colleges and hospitals, modern equipment are being installed even at public health centres in the state,” the minister said. Meanwhile, 58 doctors have been posted to the places where their spouses are working. State health department had earlier sought applications from such doctor couples who are posted at different places in. It had received 60 such applications. Among the applicants, 38 were female and 23 male doctors. The transfer involved civil surgeons, additional chief medical officers and district immunisation officers along with doctors working in various health institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rt-pcr-labs-at-all-sadar-hospitals-in-bihar-soon-minister/articleshow/84045151.cms||Sheezan Nezami

He also paid tributes to 157 health experts, who had lost their lives due to coronavirus. National Doctors’ Day marks the birth and death anniversary of former West Bengal chief minister, Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy, who was also a renowned medical practitioner. The minister inaugurated the IMA event by garlanding a statue of Dr Roy at his birth place in Khazanchi Road area of Patna. “The state government is providing an ex gratia payment of Rs 4 lakh to the doctors, who lost their lives due to Covid-19,” he said and promised to solve all the problems related to doctors. The acting president of the IMA-Bihar, Dr Ajay Kumar, however, urged the health minister to also pay ex gratia compensation to the doctors of private hospitals and clinics, whose lives Covid had claimed. The IMA members also planted 157 saplings in memory of the doctors at Netaji Subhas Medical College and Hospital near Bihta. Recalling the contributions of Dr Roy, the president-elect of the IMA, Dr Sahjanand Prasad Singh, said, “Born in 1882, he wore many hats. Dr Roy was a physician, freedom fighter, educationist and chief minister.” Some of the doctors, who were feted on the occasion, included Satyajeet Singh, A A Hai, I S Thakur, V P Choudhary, Binod Kumar Singh, Hira Lal Mahto, and Dr Shanti Roy. IGIMS pays homage to docs: A simple function was organised at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences to pay homage to the doctors, who died due to Covid. The hospital’s director, Dr N R Biswas, and superintendent, Dr Manish Mandal, observed a two-minute silence as a mark of respect for the departed souls. Mandal told this newspaper, “Nearly 150 doctors tested positive for Covid. Some were placed under home isolation while others were admitted to the hospital. They, however, continued to serve and treat patients selflessly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-felicitates-295-health-experts-on-national-doctors-day/articleshow/84045216.cms||VK Tripathi

The study, which kicked off 3 months ago, will conclude in the next 9 months, said Ashwani Gupta, COO, Nissan Motor. The ongoing study in India focuses on manufacturing electric vehicles in India at the Oragadam plant both for local as well as export markets. “We are studying electric vehicles, charging infrastructure and battery manufacturing. If we decide to come with an electric car to India then only domestic volumes will not help us and we have to look at exports too and we have to do close to 100% localisation,” added Gupta. That goes for batteries too — local manufacturing for local and global sales, he added.The electric range, when it comes, will be made in the Renault Nissan plant in Oragadam. Batteries may also be shared just like the new global electric crossover shares a battery with alliance partner Renault. “We are happy with the success of the Magnite and already working on the next product line up for India,” said Gupta.As for whether Nissan will tap into the current demand for electric light commercial vehicles for e-commerce last mile deliveries, Gupta said that too was an opportunity. “We are currently working with Mitsubishi for a micro electric car after which there is an opportunity to talk about a micro electric CV (small commercial vehicle) for India,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nissan-conducts-study-may-manufacture-evs-and-batteries-in-india/articleshow/84048013.cms||---

It took two hours to extract the workers as nearby land had to be dug up with an earthmover. The deceased include Dharmik, who was supervising the inspection work, and two labourers Ishwar and Rajesh. “The workers were inspecting the drainage line for blockages. Initially, one worker went inside and as he started suffocating Dharmik entered to rescue him. When both started suffocating the third labour entered and he too fell unconscious,” a UT official said. A Silvassa Municipal Council officer said that the sewage line was recently laid and before using it, the contractor’s men were inspecting it for blockages. “The workers examined some portions before reaching this point and on noticing blockage they might have entered the sewage line,” he added. “The workers were instructed not to enter. But for some reason, they went inside which is yet not clear. An inquiry will reveal the exact details,” he said. Meanwhile, police have started a preliminary inquiry and after collecting details a case will be registered. Sources said that Dharmik hails from Amreli and the two labourers were from Dahod. All three were employees of a contractor who was assigned the task to inspect the sewage line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/three-suffocate-to-death-while-inspecting-sewage-line-in-silvassa/articleshow/84046921.cms||---

Established under the aegis of the Army Wives Welfare Association, the school has been providing quality education, therapy, counselling and rehabilitation to children with disabilities since 1994. “We have special teachers, sportspersons, musicians, speech therapists, vocational trainers, and physiotherapists for helping 50 students with disabilities. We not only enrol the children of Army officers, but those of common people as well,” the principal of Asha School, Kalpana Jha, who has been associated with the institute for 13 years, told this newspaper. She added, “Students in the age group of 5 to 18 years are part of this school that follows the curricula of the Bihar School Examination Board.” The principal, however, pointed out that conducting online classes amid the Covid-19 pandemic was a little difficult because “a few students do not have access to the internet, cellphones or laptops”. The Danapur-based school was registered with the state education department as Asha Society for Handicapped Children on November 14, 1998.

At present, NKDA runs 10 markets across the township. NKDA officials said the spots have been identified and authorities have started the process of engaging an agency to construct the complexes. An estimate of Rs 7 crore and a deadline of nine months have been set. Residents said there has been a demand for markets in the blocks. “CE Block is one of the biggest in New Town but does not have a market. The nearest market is in CB Block. This is a welcome initiative by NKDA,” said Ankur Roy Chowdhury, a resident of CE Block. NKDA has already initiated a scheme to make all NKDA-run markets plastic free, starting from CB Block market. The authorities also plan to set up a G+1 market complex on a one-acre plot to rehabilitate street vendors and hawkers who have encroached on the pavements at present. Locals said the markets in New Town have proper lighting and air-condition systems, but regular monitoring and inspection were needed to check whether everything, including fire safety arrangements, were in place. NKDA has been keeping watch on whether Covid-safety protocol is followed in the markets as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-to-get-two-more-mkt-community-centre-bldgs/articleshow/84047087.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy launches YSR Bima, credits Rs 750 crore to over 1 lakh families||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday launched the YSR Bima scheme with new guidelines and paid Rs 750 crore as the premium. The guidelines were changed to facilitate the state government paying the insurance amount directly to the family of the deceased. The scheme will support 1.32 lakh families in the state. The chief minister said the government prioritised public health care and pegged the annual income for Aarogyasri at Rs 5 lakh and increased the number of treatments to 2,450. Similarly, as promised during the elections, the government has launched YSR Bima, an insurance scheme to support those families who have lost their breadwinner. He said that about 1.30 lakh families have been brought under insurance coverage with an insurance amount of Rs 1 lakh if the beneficiary, aged between 18 to 50 years, succumbs to natural causes. He said Rs 5 lakh will be paid if a beneficiary in the age group of 18 to 70 years dies in an accident. The chief minister said that the Centre, which was paying 50 per cent of premium, withdrew from the scheme in April 2020. However, the state has been paying the entire premium on humanitarian grounds to provide security to families in need. He said the government had brought 1.2 crore families under insurance coverage and paid premium to banks. However, only 62.5 lakh accounts were opened and the remaining accounts were not opened by the banks though the state government had credited the insurance premium. Despite the state paying the premium, claims were not paid to 12,039 families where a beneficiary died in the meantime. But the government paid Rs 254 crore to these families on humanitarian grounds, he said. The chief minister said village and ward secretariats will handle the scheme, including enrollment and disbursement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-launches-ysr-bima-credits-rs-750-crore-to-over-1-lakh-families/articleshow/84045930.cms||Gopi Dara

Operators of mechanised boats said the first voyage was not a profitable one due to the low catch and low demand for some varieties. After the ban on deep sea fishing ended last month, fishermen set sail on June 16 from Vizag Fishing Harbour. Some boats returned in the last two days with their catch but fish quantity and variety of prawns, disappointed fishermen said, has been far below expectations. “We went on the first voyage with lot of hopes. But, we could meet only expenses worth over Rs 60,000 from the voyage,” said PC Appa Rao, president of AP Mechanised Boat Operators’ Welfare Association. Some boats returned with brown prawn and a few other varieties. “As exporters are not interested in purchasing brown prawn due to low demand in other states and countries, we sold the catch in the domestic market at low prices,” said Appa Rao. Normally, the first outing to sea after the end of the ban fetches returns worth over Rs 3 lakh. “This time, we managed catch around Rs 2 lakh only that can just meet fuel and other expenses,” fishermen added. The drop in prices of brown prawn is another cause of worry for the sector. Citing that demand for Indian-farmed Vannamei shrimp is high in other states and abroad, seafood exporters are offering a low price for brown prawn. “If we get at least Rs 420 a kilos for brown prawn, we will get some profits in the trade otherwise we will incur more losses,” said Ch Satyanarayana Murthy, president of Visakha Dolphin Boat Operators’ Association Fishermen are banking on a good catch of silver pomfret and tuna in the coming days to get some profits from the trade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/fisherfolk-in-vizag-worry-after-low-first-voyage-catch/articleshow/84054927.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Patna||Patna University gears up to resume classroom teaching||PATNA: As the universities and colleges in the state are likely to resume their academic sessions soon, they have started gearing up to ensure timely commencement of classroom teaching and examinations. The academic sessions are already delayed owing to the closure of institutions during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Patna University (PU) has announced the date of online submission of forms for Degree Part III honours examinations of 2021. The submission of forms would start on July 2 and end on July 17. The details of filling up examination forms have been displayed on the university’s website, said PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Choudhary. The VC said the examination schedule of Part III examinations in science, arts and commerce streams would be announced as soon as the university gets a green signal from the Raj Bhavan or the state government. The online classes of students admitted to all other courses of conventional as well as vocational courses, both undergraduate and postgraduate, are going on and their courses of studies are likely to be completed soon, he said. The only problem being faced by the university relates to the announcement of admission schedule for the Degree Part I honours courses in its different colleges for the 2021-22 session. Choudhary pointed out that taking into consideration the students’ convenience and safety, the university had decided to do away with the practice of holding entrance test for undergraduate courses for the current year. The PU academic council and the syndicate endorsed this decision and subsequently a proposal for enactment of a transitory regulation to this effect was sent to the Raj Bhavan, he said. On query, the VC was informed that the proposal for amendment to the existing admission ordinance has been sent to Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC) for necessary action. But, the necessary amendment to the ordinance is yet to materialize, the VC said. BSHEC vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha, when contacted, said the proposal received from the Raj Bhavan would be screened by a high-powered screening committee being constituted with a member from the judiciary (sitting or retired judge). As soon as the committee is constituted, PU’s proposal would be screened and sent back to the Raj Bhavan, he said. PU students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar said the university is awaiting the chancellor’s nod to the university’s proposal for admitting students on Class XII marks. By that time, the results of class XII examinations of different boards would also be announced, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-gears-up-to-resume-classroom-teaching/articleshow/84045973.cms||B K Mishra

TDP legislator Velagapudi Ramakrishnababu moved the HC, alleging that transfer of tax revenues into APSDC account is illegal and against the Constitution. Ramakrishna said the state government transferred 15 assets to APSDC to get an additional loan of Rs 25,000 crore by mortgaging them to the financial institutions. Transfer of government properties to APSDC is illegal and in contrary to Article 21 of the Constitution, he argued. It is the responsibility of the state to protect government assets, not to sell them, he said, and sought interim directions for immediate stay on transfer of the assets to APSDC pending disposal of the petition. — Srikanth Aluri||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pil-seeks-stay-on-transfer-of-govt-assets-to-apsdc/articleshow/84046830.cms||---

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has named this project as Arth Ganga project. Under this project, districts along the stream of river Ganga would be connected with a row-pass cruise. The cruise will not only carry passengers, but also work as freight carriers. There is a hope that after this service, business in the districts situated on the bank of the river would increase. According to Anupam Srivastava, the tourism officer project worth Rs 100 crore has been cleared. Now, a detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared. “The tourism department will decorate the ghats of the Ganga and depict the history of Bithoor. Brahmawart Ghat, Pathar Ghat, Druv Teela and other places would be decorated with solar lights and saplings of various species will be planted. Moreover, a Ganga nursery would be set up in which medicinal plants would be grown,” he added. “The Central government is spending a lot of money in cleaning the river under the Namami Gange project and the ghats of Bithoor have been renovated from the funds released under the project. However, this was not sufficient in view of the tourist department. To attract more tourists, some more development is needed,” he further added. He informed TOI on Thursday that under this project, one ghat each from Rishikesh (Uttrakhand), Bithoor (Kanpur) and Bhagalpur (Bihar) had been selected to develop them from a tourist point of view. Besides local craft and culture, local recipes will be publicized. Bithoor is a religious place as well as historical place. Therefore, it would be a special attraction for religious tourists. Tourism would enhance the income of local residents and craft. A cycle track from Dhruv Teela to Paththar Ghat is also proposed. Similarly, an amphitheatre is also planned under the project. Srivastava stated that on the lines of Haridwar and Varanasi, daily Ganga aarti would be performed here and efforts would be made to keep the river water at ghats even during summers. For tourists and visitors, food courts would be raised in which local prominent sweet shops and others would open their counters. Bithoor was selected due to its religious importance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/under-arth-ganga-bithoorto-get-a-tourism-makeover/articleshow/84046800.cms||---

When police finally managed to get hold of Ranjeet alias Rinkoo of Etawah, Aditya Singh of Kanpur, Mohd Arif of Firozabad, Sheebu of Prayagraj and Shanshah of Firozabad, senior cops were stunned to know that the car thieves were acquiring richer tastes, targeting luxury cars like Fortuner, and Scorpio. The gang stole at least five SUVs within a week from Sangam city alone. The modus operandi of auto lifters was also quite different. One of the gang members after surveying the targeted SUV usually used to paste a special tape on its window panes. After that, another gang member with the help of an electronic device used to open the lock to deactivate the sensor of the luxury vehicle with the help of a tablet. They also used to generate a new code via the electronic device and ignite the engine with the help of a master key. After lifting an SUV or luxury vehicle, the gang members used to park it at a deserted or isolated spot or narrow lanes for at least four to five days and paste a fake registration plate. If any luxury vehicle or SUV had the facility of GPS and cops or vehicle owners managed to trace its location, the auto thieves had made arrangements to escape in little time. Before targeting and lifting any SUV or luxury vehicle, the auto lifters did their homework well and had forged documents ready. Remarkably, this was the first time when a joint team of a crime branch and Cantt police arrested the five key men while they were planning to flee with five SUVs. The gang, as per police, had their agents across the country and auto lifters used to shift their operational area from one state to another to dodge police. “They would steal the cars in Delhi and sell them in Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan,” said a crime branch official adding that the cops seized five stolen vehicles, including one Fortuner and four SUVs, after information from the accused. A senior cop, meanwhile, said that with the recent rise in vehicle thefts particularly of SUVs in the Sangam city, a joint team was formed to stop the menace. The team closely followed up on the cases of SUVs theft one by one and conducted several raids,” he added. The auto lifters told police that after stealing the luxury cars and SUVs, they would tamper with the chassis number, engine and number plates and then dispose of the cars in various states. They usually targeted luxury cars, but if there was an easy catch, the gang didn’t feel shy of stealing smaller vehicles too. Police, meanwhile, said that arrested Ranjeet alias Rinkoo is an expert in opening locks of SUVs with the help of an electronic device. Similarly, Aditya Singh owns the responsibility of lodging and boarding gang members in different hotels. Similarly, Mohd Arif and Seebu were assigned to transport the stolen vehicles to a safer place and conduct a survey for the targeted vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/suvs-luxury-cars-main-targets-for-auto-lifters-in-city/articleshow/84046516.cms||---

Kalawati was honoured by the President for building thousands of toilets across the state last year. The missing persons are residents of Shivrajpur area of the district while Kalawati resides in Raja Ka Purwa, Kakadeo locality of the city. The police first registered a case of missing, but on the complaint of her son-in-law lodged an FIR against unknown persons for kidnapping. The police said that during preliminary investigations, the connection of the incident is related to the Safipur area of Unnao district, and two police teams have been formed to locate the whereabouts of the mother-son duo. Kalavati, who had built more than 4,000 toilets in slums and villages across the state was felicitated by President Ramnath Kovind on the occasion of International Women’s day in March 2020. Not only this, Kalavati, was one of the seven women achievers who got a chance to take up Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s social media handles on the occasion and shared her story of patience and determination. Her daughter, Mala Singh was married to one Sukhendra Singh, a resident of Kunwarpur village of Shivrajpur area of the district. Sukhendra stated in his complaint that on June 21 at 11 am, his wife Mala along with their son, five-year-old Rishi, had gone to their brother-in-law’s house in the Panki area of the city. “It was when they did not return home in the evening, he contacted his brother-in-law on the phone. However, it came to fore that the mother-son duo did not reach there,” he said and added, “Mala had also taken Rs 15,000 besides jewellery and Aadhaar card with her.” Kalavati said that a missing person complaint was lodged at Shivrajpur police station on June 21. “On June 28, she had also spoken to the police to trace the missing daughter and grandson, but to no avail,” she told reporters. “Two teams are being formed and with the help of electronic surveillance, we have procured the call details of the missing Mala Singh’s mobile number,” said the police. SHO Shivrajpur Kaushlendra Pratap Singh on Thursday said, “A person had contacted Mala’s mobile nearly 43 times in a single day. We are obtaining the call details. Also, the connection of the case is related to Safipur, Unnao. Investigations are on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/daughter-grandson-of-celebrated-social-activist-missing-since-june-21/articleshow/84046587.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The day marks the birth and death anniversary of former West Bengal chief minister, Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy, who was a noted medical practitioner as well. An IT firm employee, Priyanka Singh, came to know about Doctors’ Day through social media. She told TOI, “Doctors are the unsung heroes, who work tirelessly to save others. We should, therefore, be grateful to all of them.” Nandita Rai, who is preparing for her medical entrance exam, wants to become a doctor because she has immense respect for the profession. “I know doctors face a lot of hardships, but they make the world a better place,” she said. Thanking doctors for risking their own lives amid the pandemic, Abullias ‘sir’, who teaches medical aspirants, pointed out, “Covid claimed the lives of so many doctors, who spent hours in PPE kits without meeting their families.

---||Patna||Now, Paras faction of LJP wants Bharat Ratna for RVP||PATNA: After Chirag Paswan, the Pashupati Kumar Paras-led faction of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) on Thursday urged PM Narendra Modi to confer Bharat Ratna on party’s founder and former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan. The Paras faction of the LJP has also demanded that a life-size statue of Ram Vilas be installed either in Patna or Hajipur. The demands were made from the PM ahead of the birth anniversary of Ram Vilas Paswan scheduled to be held on July 5. While Ram Vilas’s son and Jamui MP Chirag has announced to organise a function at a Dalit hamlet, Sultanpur near Hajipur, to mark the former’s birth anniversary on July 5, the Paras group will celebrate the occasion at the party’s state headquarters in the state capital. The Paras faction also wants CM Nitish Kumar to send a proposal to the Centre, recommending Bharat Ratna for Ram Vilas. A similar proposal was earlier adopted at the executive committee meeting of LJP chaired by Chirag in New Delhi. Chirag had then written to the PM, urging him to confer Bharat Ratna on his father for his contribution in nation building and uplift of the downtrodden. In a statement released on Thursday, Paras said, “My beloved brother Ram Vilas Paswan was a messiah of Dalits and the downtrodden. He wanted to light candles in the houses that had remained in darkness for ages. Our party will leave no stone unturned to fulfil his dreams.” Both the factions are currently busy in making preparations for the birthday celebrations of Ram Vilas. Meanwhile, Chirag reiterated on Thursday that he was the national chief of the party as the rival faction has not staked its claim over the party’s bungalow symbol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-paras-faction-of-ljp-wants-bharat-ratna-for-rvp/articleshow/84045854.cms||Ramashankar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Fate of mother and child care unit hangs in balance||AMARAVATI: Notwithstanding the government’s plans to construct three super-specialty paedriatic hospitals in the state, the fate of mother & child care unit (MCCU) at the Guntur government general hospital continues to hang in the balance. The MCCU has not been included in the government’s priority projects list. While the three paediatric super-specialty hospitals will come up at a cost of Rs 180 crore each, the upgrade of MCCU — which was designed to be developed as a one-stop solution for all healthcare needs of new mothers and infants — requires around Rs 15 crore. Once functional, it was supposed to be the biggest dedicated institution for mother and childcare with 600 beds. While it took nearly 50 years to develop GGH-Guntur as the biggest public healthcare facility with a capacity of 1,160 beds, MCCU was expected to add over 50 per cent bed capacity in one go. It was the Union health ministry which took the initiative in 2017 and proposed to sanction Rs 20 crore to develop an exclusive block for MCCU within the existing GGH under the National Health Mission programme. The Centre asked the state government to allot Rs 20 crore as matching grant to develop the block. After the initial estimations, it was felt the amount would not be sufficient to develop a super-specialty hospital for mother and child care. Members of government medical college alumni of North America (GMCANA) were then roped in to contribute to the project. The entire project cost was estimated at Rs 65 crore, when the state government signed an MoU with GMCANA in 2018. Old students of GMC-Guntur came forward to contribute Rs 30 crore, with district collector Kona Sasidhar playing a key role in the negotiations. However, MCCU works came to a grinding halt almost a year ago, when the project contractor left the scene after laying of the foundation. “Works were stalled due to delay in clearance of bills to the contractor. We have taken up the issue with director of medical education Dr M Raghavendra Rao during his recent visit, and urged him to identify a site for construction of the super-specialty pediatric hospital,” said GGH superintendent Dr N Prabhavati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fate-of-mother-and-child-care-unit-hangs-in-balance/articleshow/84046739.cms||Samdani MN

The lab will help identify genetic mutations occurred in any microorganism, including virus. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the lab with sophisticated instruments has been set up with funds provided by the Centre. “All appliances have been installed and tests and trials have started at the lab under the supervision of experts from the National Institute of Virology, Pune and CSIR, New Delhi as part of the standardisation process required for giving approval by the government of India for becoming functional,” he said. The genome sequencing technique assumed greater role in public health in the wake of Covid virus mutating and changing its nature, thereby becoming more dangerous to human life. Recently, the state government had sent some Covid samples to the Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, for confirmation on the new variant of Covid virus, called Delta Plus. Dr Mandal said once the lab becomes operational, all suspected samples from the state would be tested at faster pace at the IGIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/genome-sequencing-lab-ready-at-igims/articleshow/84045407.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Goa||Goa: Potholed roads, unlit junctions at night put motorists at risk||PANAJI: Lack of signboards, potholed roads, defunct signals and unlit junctions have not only made commuting during the monsoons a nightmare but also put lives of motorists in the state at risk. With PWD and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) contractors digging up and widening roads across Goa, the roads are beginning to resemble an “obstacle course”, say commuters. People who commute daily say that state authorities are turning a blind eye to the danger that motorists and pedestrians face. A case in point is the busy Chimbel junction along the Old Goa Kadamba bypass road. After several fatal accidents, the government installed traffic signals to control traffic but the signals have stopped working since the last two months. Chief minister Pramod Sawant travels on this route on a daily basis. “For villagers to cross from one end to another we need the traffic signal or else cars don’t stop. Imagine senior citizens or kids trying to cross the road,” said local resident Deepali Desai. “The speeding vehicles especially the trucks don’t realise they are passing through a village. A small road side shop was damaged couple of years ago when a truck rammed into it,” she said. The Merces junction at the entrance of the capital is no better. The badly damaged road along with the merging of several lanes of vehicular traffic makes it difficult for motorists to navigate the junction. Though police personnel are posted at the junction their role is to penalize motorists and not streamline traffic, said motorists. GOACAN coordinator Roland Martins, who is a member of the state road safety council, said that bad road engineering and lack of monitoring by the PWD is responsible. While the PWD and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) have initiated road-widening projects across the state but at night, the construction sites are unlit and the diversions are not marked properly, say commuters. Martins said that people need to start filing complaints with the authorities and even with the consumer court so that action can be initiated. “PWD needs to have a vehicle to move up and down to check if the contractor adheres to safety norms. PWD has to monitor the works but road users also need to file complaints,” said Martins. “The roads are a mess and with the rains it is worse. The contractor has to abide with the terms of the contract regarding signages, lighting but since nobody monitors they wilfully ignore them,” he said. On June 28, residents of Virnoda, Pernem, planted a coconut tree in a pothole in the middle of the road out of frustration with the condition of the roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/potholed-roads-unlit-junctions-at-night-put-motorists-at-risk/articleshow/84049781.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Patna||‘Blatant violation of safety norms led to exponential rise in Covid-19 cases’||PATNA: A large number of people may have attributed the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases in 2020 to the exodus of migrant workers amid the nationwide lockdown, but a recent sociological study claimed that a blatant violation of safety norms led to the spread of the virus. Christened ‘Learning from Covid-19 Cases: A Sociological Study of Patna District’, it was published by the Centre for Health Policy at Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI). The study made by former bureaucrat, K C Saha, revealed that lack of awareness about social distancing norms and the role of wearing masks at crowded places led to an alarming surge in Covid cases, especially in urban areas. “Although more than 15 lakh migrants returned to Bihar, people intermingling in busy markets, wedding ceremonies, funerals and other functions largely led to the spread of the virus,” it added. The study disclosed that infection among women increased during wedding ceremonies where they sang customary songs in groups for days. It also said, “All the BDOs and the mukhiyas categorically stated that Patna was the epicentre from where the virus spread rapidly to other places. People, who came to Patna from different districts, caught the infection and spread it in their areas later.” Based on the 23,344 fresh corona cases reported between June, 2020 and May 15, 2021 in Patna, the study also took into consideration other primary sources of information like telephonic interviews of 200 Covid positive patients, government functionaries as well as elected members of local bodies. The study revealed that the maximum number of positive cases among men in the age groups of 21-40 and 41-60 years were reported in July, 2020 and April, 2021. An analysis of the 23,344 cases in Patna indicated that Covid spread mostly in city areas and was almost negligible in the slums. “Interestingly, none of the slums in Patna reported a single corona case. Of the 7,300 sanitary workers of the Patna Municipal Corporation, only three or four tested positive for Covid-19. Similarly, the panchayats in Mokama Tal area did not report any case,” the study added. ADRI’s member-secretary, P P Ghosh, told this reporter that the findings of the study were valuable and would help identify proper strategies to control the pandemic. He said, “We hope the government adopts the recommendations of the report for tackling Covid-19 in an effective manner.” Social scientist, N K Chaudhary, however, pointed out that initially the migrants did lead to the spread of the virus in the state. “The problem was aggravated due to the elections, religious congregations, festivals, marriages and other social functions along with the lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour among the people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/blatant-violation-of-safety-norms-led-to-exponential-rise-in-covid-19-cases/articleshow/84046008.cms||B K Mishra

We have mediated as the detail of all the allottees of the housing will be given to the towers and residents will take the initiative to form RWAs. The complex has only three CCTV cameras. So we have urged them to install at least 15 more and they have agreed,” said Sen. According to plans, there will be around 20 RWAs formed. “We wanted a solution to this problem the residents were facing for a long time. We are grateful to Hidco for arranging the meeting,” said Ankur Roy Chowdhury, vice-chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of RWAs. “The security arrangements at the complex have been inadequate for all these years,” said Abhijit Ghosh, vice-president of Sparsh Cultural Committee, a forum at one of the blocks. “We have asked the builders to give us details of all flat owners so that power of attorney can be taken to form the RWAs. The builders have agreed. There are other issues which will be discussed in another meeting after a few months,” said Mainak Kanrar, joint secretary of a cultural society at the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rwa-apex-body-more-cctvs-to-make-sukhobrishti-feel-safer/articleshow/84047073.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Patna||Shatrughan, Yashwant eyeing way to national political arena?||PATNA: Two former Union ministers Yashwant Sinha (84) and Shatrughan Sinha (75), caught in wilderness for the last few years, have suddenly generated a stir in the national political arena, as the former is tipped to be sent to the Rajya Sabha by the TMC and the latter is seemingly trying for the ‘ghar wapsi’ to the BJP from the Congress. Yashwant made his intention to return to active politics last year when he unsuccessfully tried to cobble up a credible front of the opposition parties in Bihar during the assembly elections against CM Nitish Kumar and the NDA comprising mainly the BJP and JD(U) and two small parties. The Bihar elections were tipped to be the show of PM Narendra Modi. This year, however, he was on the side of TMC chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, who was battling out PM Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and others during the no-holds-barred assembly elections that resulted in the TMC romping home with 213 of the 294 seats. Further, Yashwant has been trying to cobble up an opposition combine, and in fact, floated a non-political body, Rashtra Manch, to work against PM Modi. Shatrughan, meanwhile, has sent out enough signals through statements and tweets that he has been feeling uneasy in the Congress. Accordingly, the speculation is rife that he has been trying to get back to the BJP. Even on Thursday, at a conclave organised by a news channel, Shatrughan praised PM Modi for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. “I will say that the intention of the government and society is very good. I hope that the government will very soon become successful in its vaccination for all drive,” Shatrughan said. “In the world, there are four kinds of sad people: Those who are sad due to their own sorrow; those who are sad on seeing other’s sadness; those who are sad by seeing others happy and those who are unnecessarily sad for no reason,” Shatrughan tweeted. In Patna on Tuesday, Shatrughan had played light of his tweet, saying it was just a “good humour”. However, he has been in near wilderness since he lost the Patna Saheb parliamentary seat on the Congress ticket to Ravi Shankar Prasad. His wife Poonam Sinha too had lost the Lucknow seat. Further, their son Luv Sinha had also lost the Bankipore assembly seat in Bihar last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/shatrughan-yashwant-eyeing-way-to-national-political-arena/articleshow/84045919.cms||Abhay Singh

This is the first prepaid instrument to be launched after the central bank allowed more features to be built into prepaid cards, bringing them on a par with payment banks. Eroute had received authorisation as a prepaid instrument issuer in May. The only other company to have received the prepaid authorisation after the guidelines is Bajaj Finance. The Noida-based company was founded by Sanjeev Pandey, former group president of Yes Bank, Abhishek Saxena, an alumnus of IIT-BHU, and Jason Ho, chairman of Taiwan-based Taisys Group. OmniCard, which is issued in physical form with tap-and-pay option included, can be used both offline and online. The card is issued on the RuPay network and comes with a mobile application. It can also be used for mobility payments like in Metro trains. Eroute Technologies was one of the companies selected by the RBI for its regulatory sandbox, where it deployed a UPI-based offline payment solution using a SIM-overlay smartcard placed on the SIM to facilitate payments on feature phones without internet. In April, the RBI allowed prepaid issuers to be part of payment systems like NEFT and RTGS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/omnicard-launches-prepaid-card-aimed-at-youngsters/articleshow/84050607.cms||Mayur Shetty

All the 104 rescued children are boys. Social welfare directorate director Raj Kumar said the children would be received by government officials and child welfare committee members and kept at short stay homes. “They will be sent to their home districts by bus and handed over to their parents after completing formalities. Concerned district’s child welfare committees are responsible for handing over the children to their parents,” he said. Kumar said it would take four to five days to hand over all 104 children to their parents. He said the government has already verified the home addresses of the rescued children. “The government will keep a tab on these children so that they are not trafficked again,” he added. Suresh Kumar, executive director of an NGO which played an important role in tracking these children with support from government officials, said all of them were rescued from different bangle factories in Jaipur. “All these boys were trafficked between July and December last year. They were rescued between January and March this year,” he said. Kumar added the average age of these children is around 10 years. “Among the rescued children, there are some who are just eight or nine-year-old,” he said, adding most rescued children are from Gaya, Samastipur and Nalanda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/104-trafficked-kids-to-be-brought-back-today/articleshow/84045220.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Diwali’s family members and others blocked NH-30 connecting Maner to Patna for at least four hours on Thursday with his body, disrupting traffic movement on the important road. Vehicles remained stranded on the road till 12.30pm due to the protest. SHO of Maner police station Alok Kumar said three people have been detained in connection with the murder. “Diwali’s cousin Rudal Yadav had objected to former’s buffalo grazing in the area. Rudal and some other villagers also have cattle shed in the riverine belt. The arguments between Rudal and Diwali soon snowballed into a scuffle. People from the two sides started beating each other with sticks and rods. However, Rudal’s side proved stronger and they thrashed Diwali to death,” the SHO said, adding three of Diwali’s associates were injured in the incident. The SHO said Diwali also had a land dispute with his brother Kalicharan Yadav. “A road was constructed at Vyaspur village on part of land owned by Diwali and Kalicharan four months back. Rudal used to support Kalicharan,” he said. The SHO added Diwali’s body was cremated on Thursday after postmortem and police are awaiting written complaint from the victim’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-beaten-to-death-over-petty-dispute-3-detained/articleshow/84045772.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Goa||Optic fibre cables, utility pipelines clog Panaji’s drains||PANAJI: Thick bunches of fibre cables and utility lines laid in culverts and storm water drains across the state capital hamper the flow of rainwater and lead to waterlogging, said the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP). Solid waste, particularly PET bottles and discarded polythene bags in the drainage system, gets trapped in the cables affecting the flow, said CCP officials. CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes told TOI that the corporation’s workers have a hard time constantly clearing Panaji’s storm water drains, some of which are caked with silt and are in poor condition. While CCP has asked telecom operators and utility service providers to remove the cables from the drains, the latter have asked CCP to make other arrangements where the cables could be laid. “Almost 100% of the drains are full of cables, power cables, fibre optic cables and various others, effectively blocking water flow and trapping garbage,” said Fernandes. Under the Smart City Mission, the authorities had outlined an ambitious aim to lay dedicated utility trenches across the city that would put a complete end to frequent road-digging and would also help shift cables out of storm water drains. Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Limited (IPSCDL) had proposed to create a common trench for sewerage, water pipelines, optical fibre cables, electrical supply and even the city’s gas network. The state capital is criss-crossed with water pipelines, storm water drains, electricity cables, optical fibre cables, gas lines and telecom lines, but the civic body does not have a map of all the services. CCP officials said that every monsoon, plastic waste gets washed into the drainage network and gets stuck where the drains are narrow or where cables are passing through. The civic body has tasked its daily wage workers to clear the bottlenecks as and when they occur, as any delay in clearing the drains leads to inundation. Since the bunch of cables — each measuring 5-8cm in diameter — are tightly connected, corporation workers find it difficult to clear the clogs without damaging the cables, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/optic-fibre-cables-utility-pipelines-clog-panajis-drains/articleshow/84049347.cms||---

The youth had intervened in a fight between his father and the accused after his motorcycle brushed past their vehicle. All six accused have been arrested. The deceased, Dev Priya, was a resident of Burari in north Delhi. He was pursuing graduation from Delhi University’s School of Open Learning. The incident took place around midnight when his father, Jaipal (45), was returning home on his bike. “Jaipal was drunk and rammed a tempo and a car from behind when he reached Azadpur. After a short argument, the car driver left the spot. However, the tempo driver and his five accomplices, who were also drunk, started to fight with Jaipal,” said a senior police officer. Sensing that the situation was getting out of control, Jaipal called Dev for help and told him that a fight had broken out due to his motorcycle “touching” another vehicle. Dev and his elder brother, Pant Priya Sagar (21), soon reached the location. Sagar later told police that their father informed them that the accused men had hurled abuses and thrashed him. “A crowd soon gathered there. While some men held my father, two others tried to drag Dev inside the gate of the MCD staff quarters. A man also thrashed me. He tried to push my father, but when I caught hold of his bag, he pushed us and ran away. When I started to look for my brother, I saw three men holding him, while two others stabbed him,” said Sagar in his statement to police. DCP (Northwest) Usha Rangnani said the PCR received a call around 12.30am reporting a scuffle at Azadpur. “A team reached there and rushed an injured Dev to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital. When his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to Fortis Hospital, where he died during treatment. A case of murder was then registered based on Sagar’s complaint,” she added. Rangnani said the tempo was traced after scanning CCTV footage from the spot. “Following surveillance and local intelligence, we arrested all six accused within five hours. They have been identified as Sahil (25), Annu (21), Devender (18), Satyaveer (18), Aakash (18) and Anurag (19). Two knives used to attack Dev have been seized from them,” added the DCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/youth-stabbed-to-death-by-six-men/articleshow/84049351.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Objections raised over age criteria in scooty scheme||JAIPUR: After the directorate of specially abled persons issued guidelines for distribution of scooty to persons belonging to the category, the Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh on Thursday raised objection with the disability commissioner with regard to making only persons with locomotor disability eligible for the scheme and leaving out persons with disability (PwD) of other categories. It also raised an objection in respect of giving benefit under the scheme to employed persons up to 29 years of age. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had announced in the budget for the financial year 2021-22 that college-going students and employed youths under PwD (persons with disability) category will be provided scooty under a new scheme. Rs 15 crore was earmarked for the scheme in the budget. “There are 21 categories of PwDs (persons with disability) in the state. However, in the guidelines issued by the directorate, they have made only category with locomotor disability eligible for the scheme. Others like acid attack survivors, persons with autism spectrum disorder, speech and language disability, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, dwarfs, those having hearing loss and others should also be made beneficiaries under the scheme,” said Hemant Bhai Goyal, vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh. “Moreover, Section 3 of PwD Act states that there should not be any discrimination among the different categories of specially abled persons. But the guidelines issued by the department have discriminated among the categories. The officials of the directorate don’t take opinions from the stakeholders and experts before issuing the guidelines. Second, we have raised an objection in respect of giving benefits under the scheme to employed persons/businessmen up to 29 years of age. We demand that the age limit should be increased to 40. All those who have been issued a driving licence by the transport department should be eligible for this,” he added. The guidelines also state that they should produce medical certificates of 40% disability or above. Moreover, those who are pension holders under social security are not required to furnish income certificates. However, those who are not pension holders, they will have to produce income certificates (not above 2 lakh per annum).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/objections-raised-over-age-criteria-in-scooty-scheme/articleshow/84049368.cms||---
---||Delhi||460 schools that went to Delhi HC to provide 15% fee deduction||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has issued a circular saying the 460 schools that had petitioned against its fee order will have to provide a 15% deduction in annual and development fees for the academic years 2020-21 and 2021-22. The other schools will have to abide by the April 18 and August 28, 2020 orders, which had allowed only tuition fees. When the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed in 2020, Delhi government had allowed around 1,700 private schools in the city to charge only tuition fee, and not the annual and development charges. Action Committee, an association of private schools, had moved Delhi High Court against the order and a single-judge bench allowed them to charge annual and development charges with the concession. The government then moved the court and a double bench ordered that for 2021-22, the “fees levied would be recovered on the same principles applicable to the academic year 2020-21”. On Thursday, the directorate of education circular detailed the way the fees can be collected. If the monthly fee in 2020-21 was Rs 3,000 — Rs 2,000 tuition fee, Rs 500 development fee and Rs 500 annual charges — the high court’s order entitles a school to collect Rs 2,550 per month after a deduction of 15%, it stated. The circular also stated that if a school had collected fees in excess, the same should be refunded or adjusted in subsequent months or refunded to the parents. Referring to the current session, it added that following the order of the division bench, the above arrangement would be applicable for the academic year 2021- 22, “as is payable by students of the school concerned as and when it (fee) becomes due and payable”. However, Kamal Gupta, counsel of Action Committee, said, “These directives are in contempt. What has been dealt with and allowed in the court is annual and development charges with a discount of 15%. The tuition fee or its reduction was never an issue in the court and was, thus, never dealt with or reduced.” Gupta added, “If we charged other earmarked jlevies like transport, caution money, registration and admission fee, computers, medical and activities, we would have given a 15% discount on everything. But when schools are charging on three heads, where is the question of giving discount on tuition fee?” The other part of the order, such as not charging transportation fees and not increasing any fee, is applicable to all schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/460-schools-that-went-to-hc-to-provide-15-fee-deduction/articleshow/84049386.cms||Shradha Chettri

Not just the Meerut Commissionary but small neighbouring towns like Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Hapur and Baghpat are facing unscheduled power outages even as temperatures hover over 42 degrees Celsius. On Thursday, seven areas in Meerut district faced an hour-long power outage. The power outages are so frequent that Arvind Mallappa Bangari, MD, Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), had to pay a surprise visit to sub-stations at midnight and transferred a junior engineer (JE) after the latter failed to give a concrete reason for the shut down. Fourteen districts --Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Gautambudh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Shamli, Bijnor, Moradabad, Sambhal, JP Nagar and Rampur -- fall under PVVNL. The average load of electricity in May was 4,212 MW. The load increased to 5,562 MW in June and since the last week of June, the demand has peaked between 7,500 and 8,000 MV. “As the power consumption almost doubled in the past one month, the PVVNL has resorted to unplanned power cuts of two hours each three times in my area on Monday which was reduced to an hour on Tuesday,” said Kishan Chand of Balwant Nagar here. Power cuts were also reported from outskirts and villages besides affecting industries. Following reports of frequent power outages, the MD of PVVNL has directed the JEs posted at the power station to keep a record of daily details of the reason for shutdowns. “I conducted a surprise inspection at Electricity Urban Distribution Board, Meerut under Shastri Nagar, Mohkampur, Rangoli, Ramlila Ground-1, Ramlila Ground-2 and Begumpool power station on Thursday and found that there were some unscheduled power cuts the reason of which couldn’t be explained by the JE. I have transferred the official immediately,`` Bangari told TOI. He added that the western UP is experiencing peak power consumption and the delayed monsoon has escalated the demand but one cannot cut power without a plan. Bangri also directed the executive engineer and officials at subdivision level to inspect power stations randomly, every four days, and that too, at night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/delayed-monsoon-causes-power-outages-in-western-up/articleshow/84045222.cms||Ishita Mishra

Police said the bus driver, Harimangal, his aide Kuldeep Yadav and the survivor’s 19-year-old stepsister were arrested on Thursday. SP Sultanpur Vipin Mishra said mastermind Shivpujan is still absconding.

Harimangal could neither show his driving licence nor give a satisfactory reason about plying late in the night. During search, we spotted the feet of a child on the last seat of the bus. On being called out, two girls and a male child came out,” said the SHO. “On being questioned by women officers, the 15-year-old girl said that the other 19-year-old girl is her stepsister and brought her by deceit.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Pokkali farmers await dewatering of farm in Chellanam||KOCHI: A small group of Pokkali farmers in Chellanam are still waiting for the Padashekaram Samithi to dewater their fields so that their paddy crop can be cultivated. With the Samithi refusing to clear the saltwater from the fields, farmers say that they are unable to go ahead with their cultivation. “One of the farmers approached the Kerala HC, seeking contempt of court proceedings against the district collector who is the chairman of the district Pokkali Land Development Authority (PLDA). District collector S Suhas has submitted in court that the area would be dewatered within 10 days. The court passed the orders on June 28. Till now, we have not been able to get them to clear the fields off the salt water,” said Francis Kalathunkal, general convener, Pokkali Samrakshana Samithi. Chandu Manjadiparambil, a 73-year-old Pokkali farmer had filed a case in the high court on April 9, following which the court directed the collector to ensure that the sluice should only be opened after November 15. Chandu said that he owns 2.26 acres of paddy land in which he cultivates paddy. As the land is in the coastal belt where an integrated farming practice is followed, fish is farmed from November 15 to April 15 and paddy is cultivated afterwards. “Because of the higher rate of profitability in saline aquaculture in relation to the Pokkali paddy cultivation, landowners do not support paddy, which has resulted in serious ecological imbalance, including percolation of salinity to fresh groundwater channels, steady perceptible degradation of residential structures. This is due to the constant presence of salinity in the subsoil acting negatively on the bonding strength of cement, scarcity of freshwater, destruction of cash crops like coconut palms, organic vegetable cultivation etc.,” he said in his petition. “PLDA has been formed to protect this unique paddy crop which is very local to just Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Thrissur. The crop calendar has been notified by the government that specifically states that in Pokkali lands, the period from April 15- November 14 is allocated for paddy cultivation alone,” the petitioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pokkali-farmers-await-dewatering-of-farm/articleshow/84047214.cms||---

Hence, the trial could not proceed against them.” The HC also noted Kishan Kumar, younger brother of Gulshan Kumar and a director on Super Cassettes Industries, said he was “acquainted” with Nadeem Saifee “as he used to visit their office in his presence.” The prosecution had said Kishan Kumar was the second “witness to the conspiracy to kill Gulshan Kumar.” The HC said, “On 5th August 1997 P.W. 32 (Kishan Kumar) saw his brother in a frightened condition and upon inquiry, had disclosed that he had received threatening call from Salem.” Kishan Kumar said, “Nadeem had confronted the deceased and blamed him for the failure of his album sales.” On August 30, 1997, police suspected Nadeem. He was in London. The Indian government did not succeed in the extradition proceedings before the London high court. Advocate Majeed Memon, Saifee’s Indian lawyer at the time, said on Thursday, “The London high court criticized the police and later the Indian government even went in appeal to the House of Lords, where leave to appeal was denied.” Memon said, “Nadeem has been given a British passport as well.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kumars-brother-said-nadeem-blamed-him-for-failure-of-album/articleshow/84051272.cms||---

Gehlot’s presence at the event was an eye-catcher as, in a statement issued by the chief minister’s office on June 14, it was informed that doctors advised him to avoid one-on-one meetings for at least one to two months considering his post-Covid condition. The statement was issued when the tussle between Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot over a cabinet expansion and political appointments was at the peak. Gehlot attending the event is now likely to prompt his rival faction to revive the demand for cabinet rejig at the earliest. On the occasion, Gehlot said that the working style of Mishra, who has a simple, soft spoken and friendly personality, is different from everyone. While wishing Mishra on his birthday, he said in the title of the book, ‘I’ has been given at the last place, which shows the simplicity and thinking of Mishra. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said Governor had devoted his entire life for the welfare of humanity and society and is such a rare politician who has been a member of the four Houses of legislative Assembly, legislative council, Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha and is now discharging his constitutional responsibility as governor Joshi, referring to Articles 153 and 159 of the Constitution, said Mishra is effectively doing the work of protecting the basic spirit of the Constitution and the bridge between the state and the Centre. Mishra said, “When it came to writing a book on my life for the first time, I thought what have I done that should be written in the book on my life.” He said in reality he does not consider himself to be worthy of so much praise and appreciation because he has tried to fulfill all the responsibilities in life by considering himself as an instrument instead of having a sense of me.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/guv-a-soft-spoken-friendly-personality-says-gehlot/articleshow/84049387.cms||---

Many of those who attended the meeting, including the Kochi mayor, criticized the slow pace of project implementation. CSML CEO Jaffer Malik informed that major roadworks in Ernakulum will be completed by September 2021. Progress in west Kochi roadworks was drastically affected by the contractor's poor performance and, hence works were terminated from his scope. He said that the other road works are ongoing. The hospital works are also progressing and, the Mattancherry hospital renovation will be completed by December 2021. The foundation works of Syed Mohammed bridge and Calvathy School are in progress. The Market rehabilitation project is expected to be completed by July 2021 and, the tender for the new market building will also be awarded this month. The Marine drive walkway will be completed by the mid of July, he said. Mayor M Anilkumar, MP Hibi Eden, MLA T J Vinod, MLA K J Maxi, district collector S Suhas attended the meeting. Mayor Anil Kumar said that there has been a delay in the works of Smart City projects due to various reasons and Covid-19 also has impacted its progress. Some of those who attended the meeting said that CSML has to expedite the implementation of projects. Those who attended the meeting suggested that separate meetings with ward councillors should be conducted for the effective implementation of projects. They said that the priority of the agency should be the completion of road works. They added that a proper timeframe for project implementation should be prepared and should be strictly adhered to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/major-roadworks-in-district-to-be-completed-by-sept/articleshow/84047229.cms||---

---||Jaipur||In Rajasthan, leopard dies of starvation as people block cave entrance||JAIPUR: In a cruel act, villagers shut the entry of a cave with boulders and rocks leading to the death of a young leopard which lived there. The incident took place in Masuda region of Ajmer district in Rajasthan, which is outside the protected area. Though the forest teams had reopened the cave, the wild cat had died of starvation by that time. This has again highlighted that caves, which once used to be home to leopards, are now a plot of conniving government apathy and individual greed. As these caves are situated in the hills falling on revenue or pasture land outside the protected areas, forest department also can’t promise much to protect these leopards, which are listed on a par with tigers under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA) 1972. A senior forest official said, “Many leopards live inside caves of hills situated on private land, outside the protected areas. In such circumstances, it becomes very difficult to monitor the animal and habitat as it falls outside forest jurisdiction.” Leopards, which like to stay under rocks and in caves, are under serious threat across the state. Land owners and encroachers have adopted the practice to seal these caves and push the animal to other areas. Green activist Babulal Jaju said, “The caves are destroyed purposely so that the animals abandon the area and activities such as mining or farming in the foothills can be carried out. Due to this, man-animal conflicts has also increased. The forest and district administration should act on the issue at the earliest to protect the leopards outside the protected areas.” A similar situation is faced by leopards in Bera, popularly known as leopard country. Leopards dwelling in caves in adjoining areas of Jawai Bandh Leopard Conservation Reserve (JBLCR) are fast losing their homes as influential encroachers are blocking the entrances of caves in the hills. The Jawai Bandh forests were previously a closed wildlife area. On February 23, 2010, the state government declared it as Jawai Bandh Leopard Conservation Reserve. Since then, it has set a successful example of wildlife peacefully co-existing with humans. However, encroachers are fast eating into the hills where leopards have lived for many years. A forest officer said, “At present, the leopard population is 65 in the reserve and adjoining areas. After the population increased, many leopards shifted to nearby hills, which falls under revenue or private land. Complaints have been received that leopards caves are blocked. However, forest department requires the district administration support to take action.” Several caves have been blocked by thorny bushes, stones and debris to shut the natural shelters of leopards living in the surroundings of villages, including Bisalpur, Jeewda, Serna, Bera and Kothar. Encroachers have also fenced hilly trails and closed paths to restrict the movement of leopards. This has resulted in around 10 leopards being forced to shift to other areas. As many hills are located on pasture and government land, locals are finding it easy to encroach as the district administration is turning a blind eye to the issue. Renowned nature guide Gaffar Khan said, “The habitat of these wild cats is destroyed by the influentials who have encroached government and pasture land. This week, encroachers in Bera erected barbed wires in hills where a male leopard and a female leopard lives with three cubs. We apprised the administration about the encroachments on pasture and government land several times. However, no action has been initiated.” Wildlife enthusiasts fear that increased human activities will affect the solitude of these hills and push leopards far from the reserve. “Only in Jawai Bandh, one can see leopards living in caves. Encroachment is a serious threat and may become a cause for leopards to move from the area,” said Vijaybhan Singh, a wildlife enthusiast.

---||Allahabad||PIL on Ganga water: HC issuesnotices to Central Govt, ICMR||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Wednesday issued notices to the Central government and the director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking lab test on the action of ‘bacteriophages’ found in Ganga jal (water of river Ganga) which the petition claimed can treat Covid-19. Ernest Hackins, a British bacteriologist, found the presence of bacteriophages in river Ganga in 1896. Later, studies found that bacteriophage's presence does not putrefy or deteriorate the water of the Ganga, but kills the pathogens and ‘bacterial infections’. Hearing the PIL filed by Arun Kumar Gupta, a senior advocate of Allahabad High Court, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Rajendra Kumar directed to list this case for hearing on expiry of six weeks. According to the petitioner, he was studying curative properties of river Ganga for a long time and after the outbreak of Covid-19 last year, he started searching on the internet for the effect of water of river Ganga on Covid-19 patients. After doing research work, the petitioner prepared a scientific paper titled, “Treatment of Covid-19 by Ganga Jal” and sent the same through e-mail to the President of India on April 26, 2020 and National Mission for Clean Ganga. The Mission forwarded it to Ayush ministry and the director general, ICMR, but his paper was not considered due to lack of scientific studies to validate the claim. The petitioner was an advocate and clinical study and clinical data has to be done or collected by any recognised medical institute. Thus, Gupta approached doctors of Indian Institute of Medical Sciences IMS, BHU, Varanasi and Dr Vijay Nath Mishra, professor in the department of neurology, BHU agreed for further scientific research and clinical study on the subject and the theory. In the petition, it was stated that a nasal spray was also prepared for treatment of coronavirus but permission for its clinical trials is pending before the ethics committee, IMS, BHU since last seven months. The petitioner has alleged that ICMR has acted arbitrarily by not conducting any study on the theory proposed by the petitioner and his team of doctors, which is violative of Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution of India. According to the petitioner, ICMR has been created by the Government of India for conducting and finding researches for treatment of diseases but ICMR has statutorily failed to discharge its duty by not conducting any research of the theory and hypothesis. The court passed this order on June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pil-on-ganga-water-hc-issuesnotices-to-central-govt-icmr/articleshow/84046522.cms||---

Police also seized Rs 20,300 cash, one nylon rope and a cotton cloth from the possession of the killers. The arrested persons were identified as Maujilal (50), Rakesh Kumar Bind (28), Chanchal Bind (19) and Rajesh Bind (18), all residents of Sukku Ka Pura (Ghupur). Police said body of a 13-year-old boy identified as Golu was recovered inside the pile of straw in Sukku Ka Pura village under Ghupur police station on June 28. Following the incident, a case under sections 302 and 201 of IPC was registered against unidentified persons. During investigations, police came to know that the prime accused Mauji Lal had hired Rakesh Bind of same village and gave him Rs 50,000 as he wanted to take avenge from the family members of slain Golu for his dishonour. Maujilal told police that grandfather of minor boy had insulated him before the entire villagers related to a land dispute case. Since then, he was planning to take avenge and gave Rs 50,000 to Rakesh Bind and two of his close associates to kidnap and eliminate the minor boy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/4-held-for-killing-13-yr-old-boy-in-trans-yamuna/articleshow/84046466.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Can’t restrict adoption only to kids in conflict with law or orphans: Bombay high court||NAGPUR: In a landmark verdict, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court ruled that adoption can’t be restricted only to orphaned, abandoned, surrendered children or those in conflict with law or in need of care and protection. While partly allowing a revision application by the biological and adoptive parents collectively, Justice Manish Pitale quashed and set aside the Yavatmal district court’s order. Earlier, Yavatmal court had rejected case of parents to hand over their girl. The district court held that provisions of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act, 2015, will not apply since the child is neither in conflict with law nor in need of care and protection and she wasn’t abandoned, orphaned or surrendered. “A perusal of the JJ Act shows that an elaborate procedure is laid down and contemplated for adoption of a child by relatives, who are also specified under the said enactment. If adoption was to be restrictively applicable only to children in conflict with law or those in need of care and protection, such elaborate provisions governing the procedure for adoption by relatives or step-parents wouldn’t have been provided,” the HC judge held. Justice Pitale directed the Yavatmal judge to hear the application once again on merits while considering JJ Act’s new provisions. After both set of parents knocked the judiciary’s doors through counsel Ira Khisti, the HC had appointed Firdos Mirza as amicus curiae to assist it. The latter informed that if the JJ Act, 2015, is compared to the earlier enactment — Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 — it becomes evident that various new provisions have been enacted in the law, thereby broadening the scope of legislation and including in its fold specific procedure for adoption of children. Pointing out to Chapter VIII of the JJ Act, 2015, he contended that that no such chapter existed in the earlier Act and that this is a significant departure. He also stated Section 2(3) defines ‘adoption regulations’, 2(12) defines ‘child’, 2(52) defines ‘relative’ and 2(57) defines ‘Specialized Adoption Agency’ to contend that there was a conscious departure from the JJ Act, 2000. Quoting adoption regulations of 2017, Justice Pitale said those have been framed by exercising powers under the JJ Act, 2015. “Therefore, it becomes clear that the JJ Act, 2015, not only intends to take care of children, who are in conflict with law and those in need of care and protection, but also to provide for and regulate adoption of children from relatives and step-parents.” Initially adoption was undertaken for family lineage: HC According to HC, initially adoption was undertaken primarily to continue family lineage and ancestor worship, but with the passage of time it has been undertaken for taking care of needs of children in distress and those needing care and protection. “The adoption practice has been prevalent since ancient time and in different societies. The established practices and norms have evolved over a period of time. With the advent of democracy and modern form of government, such customs, traditions and practices have found their way in codified law through statutes enacted by the legislature. There are personal laws enacted specifying rules and procedure for adoption, as also secular laws for regulating such procedure,” Justice Manish Pitale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cant-restrict-adoption-only-to-kids-in-conflict-with-law-or-orphans-hc/articleshow/84049097.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||MPD-41 likely to come into effect by December, Delhi Development Authority to do annual reviews||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority’s vice-chairman, Anurag Jain, on Thursday said the land development body was trying its best to complete the process of notifying the Master Plan for Delhi-2041 by December. The draft was put in the public domain on June 9 for inviting suggestions and objections and a webinar was conducted on Thursday by DDA with the aim to facilitate the general public to understand the provisions and various policies that have been made part of it. Speaking at the webinar, which was the first in a series of three more to be held on July 6, 17 and 20, Jain said it would be ideal if MPD-41 came into its final shape by December, but it would be definitely in place by January or at most February 2022. He said DDA had ensured that unlike previous master plans, which used to get delayed by four to five years, MPD-41 was completed on time. “That, however, doesn’t mean there has been any quality compromise and I have myself attended 30 meetings in the last one year.” Jain also said that unlike the five-yearly reviews for the previous master plans, MPD-41 would see annual reviews. “Earlier there was no monitoring framework and there were only five-year mid-term reviews. For MPD-21, it was done only once, in 2012.” He said another new and useful feature would be that people would be able to zoom into maps and find out MPD features at plot level. For MPD-41, every year all government agencies would have a meeting in January. He said all master plan goals would be reviewed to see where all government bodies had reached and the public would also get to know. “Unless there is social interaction, there would be no pressure on us.” He said the master plan used to be a wish document but now consultation meetings with various bodies had been carried out and DDA was playing a facilitator’s role. The major issues that were raised in the webinar were extension of last date for submitting objections and suggestions, lack of specific planning goals, periodic and regular engagement of stakeholders, regulatory framework for permissible activities in proposed zone O-1 near the Yamuna. The open forum saw some participants mention that there should be special provisions for marginalised groups accessing public spaces, checking unauthorised construction and encroachment on public land, and clarification of status of Special Area mentioned in the draft. In the first Webinar, issues related to introduction, vision, environment, economy, culture, heritage and public spaces chapters were presented. The next webinar will cover Shelter and Social Infrastructure and Transport and Mobility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mpd-41-likely-to-come-into-effect-by-dec-dda-to-do-annual-reviews/articleshow/84049400.cms||Sidharatha Roy

During the same period last year, 56 tiger deaths were recorded as per the data recorded by the official website of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). A review of half-yearly data compiled by Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), an NGO working to combat wildlife trade and law enforcement, shows the increase in deaths is shocking as overall tiger deaths in 2020 were 109 while those of leopards 653. “With six months still to go, the number of deaths may further go up,” says Nitin Desai, Central India director of WPSI. The figure of 94 tiger deaths in the last six months is quite high. However, NTCA’s official website has pegged the number at 68. “This must be because the website has not been updated since April 12, 2021,” said an NTCA official. There have been several tiger and leopard deaths since then. On June 19, three tiger deaths were reported in Assam, Karnataka, and MP, but these deaths don’t reflect on the NTCA website. Of the 94 tiger deaths from January 1 to June 30, 2021, some 40 were found dead, 25 poaching cases, 19 died in territorial fights, 6 killed in road accidents, 2 died during rescue or treatment, and 1 each being shot dead and killed in fight with other animals. Once again, Madhya Pradesh with 26 tiger deaths topped the chart in the country followed by Maharashtra (25). Karnataka recorded 11 deaths, Uttar Pradesh (9) and Uttarakhand (8). These are the top five states that reported most of the tiger deaths. Maharashtra forest officials claimed 23 tigers have died in the last six months. However, WPSI data also includes the recently cracked wildlife crime cases in which tiger body parts were seized from some accused in Chandrapur district. Similarly, 310 leopard deaths have been reported in the last six months. Maharashtra tops the chart in the country with 95 leopard deaths, with 50% of them dying in road accidents. MP is the second highest with 41 deaths, followed by Uttarakhand (38), Rajasthan (24), and Jammu & Kashmir (20). Of the 310 leopard deaths, 102 were poaching cases, found dead 95, road hits 47, killed by villagers 22, infighting 25, shot dead 5, electrocution 2, killed by other animals 8, rescue operations 4. Desai says, “There should be clarity on ‘found dead’ category, which amounts to a high number of deaths. Reasons for these deaths have not been mentioned as these cases may be pending for forensic tests and investigations.” “Many inferences can be taken from the data. Deaths due to infighting means tigers are crying for space. Many deaths in road hits indicate that roads are being widened near forested areas without taking any mitigation measures. We have to create space for big cats by reducing human intrusions on their land,” said wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar.

The deceased, Kamaljeet Kaur, who used to live in Sunny Enclave, Kharar, had three daughters. One of them lives in Canada while the other two are based in the Tricity. Family members of the woman said the incident took place on February 12, 2021 in the evening when one of the daughters of the deceased, who lives near her house, saw smoke coming out of the house. She rushed to the spot with her husband to find that Kamaljeet had died in the fire. Sources in the police department said the family claimed in their initial statement that fire broke out due to overcharging of the mobile phone, following which police initiated proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPc. However, they grew suspicious later when they noticed that the jewellery (chain, earrings and rings) of the deceased, which she always used to wear was missing. Her purse, which contained money, was also missing. The complainant, Gurpreet Kaur, the victim’s daughter and a resident of Sector 35, Chandigarh said, “ We want justice for our mother as she has been murdered.” She said they still did not know how the bedroom caught fire. Family members approached Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP), following which an inquiry was conducted. On Wednesday, a case was registered under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at City Kharar police station after inquiries. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Kharar, Rupinderdeep Kaur said, “No arrests have been made so far and we are investigating the matter. A case has been registered after an inquiry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/murder-case-filed-over-4-months-after-elderly-womans-death/articleshow/84047279.cms||---

In this connection, the revenue department investigated the land transferred to Gopalpur Sanyukta Krishi Sahkari Samiti Limited in Manihan area. The probe report was produced before the state government which ordered the Mirzapur district magistrate to initiate legal action,” said assistant commissioner & assistant registrar (cooperative) Mirzapur Mitrasen Verma while providing details of the FIR lodged at Manihan police station. “As the matter belonged to my department, the DM forwarded the report to me after which I lodged a FIR with the Manihan police station on June 15,” he added. Giving details of the case, station officer (SO) Manihan Rajkumar Singh said, “The FIR was registered under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forging document), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine document) of IPC.” “Police investigation in this case has been started. It is a very old case. Therefore, collection and verification of documentary evidence is a lengthy process as it has to be collected from many districts. Besides, many related issues are also under litigation,” he added. “Legal successors of those primary members, who are not alive, should be booked for committing fraud and misleading courts and officials concerned by Gopalpur Sahkari Krishi Samiti Limited. The lists of 17 primary members and their 42 legal successors of the samiti was provided to the probe committee by samiti’s secretary Baijnath Singh. This list contained the names of former minister and Rajeshpati Tripathi’s father late Lokpati Tripathi, Mandavi Prasad Singh and others,” the report stated. The report further stated that land pooling after formation of the samiti was not as per law while in 1961, when ADJ and other courts were informed that samiti has 105 members, no land pooling was done by them except for 17 core members. Also, undue advantage was taken by producing confusing information about 105 members by the managing committee of the samiti. Membership given to people from other states was also illegal. “The report also contains that sale of 132.6 acre land to a food park limited by samiti’s deputy chairman Rajeshpati Tripathi in September 2016 and further deal in 2018 was done without seeking permission from the authority concerned and overlooking prescribed rules. Terming the managing committee, core members and their successors as guilty, legal action was recommended,” said Verma.

BJP president Satish Poonia tweeted, “Under the rule of Congress, fear among the common man and trust in criminals is increasing day by day,” which is the opposite of Rajasthan police motto of fear among criminals and trust in the common man. Poonia’s tweet followed by a tweet by BJP national spokesman Gaurav Bhatia who tagged a few newspaper stories of Thursday on crimes against women. Bhatia tweeted, “The dark truth of Rajasthan. No end to crimes against women in Rajasthan. Jaipur: Murder of a woman, Jhotwara area, Dholpur: wife did not bring dowry, husband & friends gangrape her, Jodhpur: death of the married woman in suspicious conditions, Churu: girl attacked with a sword.” Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Union water resources minster and a strong critic of the Gehlot government, tweeted in Hindi, “The inhabitants of the land of heroes are now helpless because of the government that has bowed to the criminals. In the last 24 hours, there have been reports of crimes against women at five places in the state, and such reports come daily. Every single incident is a question on the capability of the Gehlot government, which they are unable to answer.” In another tweet, he said, “Rajasthan carries the burden of its failed government every day. The state government is a drama company, which is sometimes engaged in poster drama, performance drama and sometimes in yagya drama. Gehlot ji, if you have to perform yagya, then do it for the safety of mothers and sisters, to improve the law and order situation in the state!” He was referring to the yagya and poster war carried out by the Congress after Delhi Police crime branch issued summons to Congress leader Mahesh Joshi in the phone tapping case on a complaint filed by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-targets-gehlot-on-twitter-over-rising-crimes-against-women/articleshow/84049399.cms||---

Both Yadav and Bhola are visually and hearing impaired and were roped in by Irfan Sheikh to lure and convert specially abled children. Yadav called himself Abdul Mannan after embracing Islam. Irfan’s photos at a Prime Minister’s event in Delhi had gone viral on social media, but investigators downplayed the issue, saying photo-ops have nothing to do with the ongoing probe. ATS sources said Irfan would brainwash children and convert them to Islam at Jamia Nagar-based Islamic Dawah Centre, which was run by one of the masterminds, Mufti Kazi Jahangeer Qasmi, who is now in ATS custody. The trio of Irfan, Yadav and Bhola will be confronted with key accused, Umar Gautam and Qasmi, for cross examination and corroboration of evidence, followed by a one-on-one with the duo. IG ATS, G K Goswamy, said they would be interrogated on evidence gathered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/conversion-case-ats-gets-remand-of-3/articleshow/84051265.cms||---

SHO, Bajaj Nagar, Ramesh Saini said the accused Brajesh Rajpoot was arrested following an FIR filed by a woman in Bharatpur on May 14. The woman alleged that the accused had raped her at different hotels in Jaipur since 2018.

---||Goa||Mapusa bank unveils plan to recover loans||PANAJI: The Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank (MUCB), which is being liquidated after it lost its banking licence, has formulated a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme to recover outstanding dues from loan defaulters. With as many as 1,512 loan accounts defaulting on repayment, the bank’s liquidator, Anthony De Sa, has given a three-month period to settle the loans. MUCB says that loan account holders will have to return the outstanding principal amount along with regular interest till the date of classification as non-performing assets (NPA), and simple interest thereafter. Penal interest for non-payment has been waived. Loan accounts that were classified as NPAs as on June 1 are eligible for the OTS scheme. “Time is of the essence. The liquidation process cannot go on indefinitely and to bring it to a close as expeditiously as possible, an OTS scheme was formulated so that the dues, including the chronic ones relating to NPAs, could be expeditiously realised,” said De Sa, former chief secretry of Madhya Pradesh. The scheme is open to all borrowers except those classified as wilful defaulters, or in case of loans guaranteed by directors of MUCB and loans under government programmes. De Sa said defaulters need to repay the loan in a lump sum and only when a borrower is unable to pay the entire amount will a three months time-frame be given. All the loan customers were asked to clear their dues by May-end but many failed to comply. As part of the action plan to recover outstanding loans, De Sa said court cases will be filed against the defaulters who do not repay, with the SARFAESI Act being invoked. The Reserve Bank of India cancelled the banking licence of MUCB on April 16. Bank of Goa and the Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies appointed a liquidator to wind up the bank’s business. De Sa has appointed a settlement advisory committee (SAC) headed by advocate M P Mulgaonkar to oversee the OTS scheme implementation. General manager of MUCB, Shailendra Sawant, and statutory auditor Gautam P Sardesai are also on the committee. “Applications shall be invited for the OTS scheme from July 1-31 and all the applications received, without exception, shall be placed before the SAC. The SAC shall decide on eligibility for OTS,” said De Sa in a public note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-bank-unveils-plan-to-recover-loans/articleshow/84049392.cms||---

Questioning the intention behind blaming the government, Sawaikar said that there are more “ human points” in Goa tourism that include hotels which sell delicacies reflecting the true identity of Goa. Club Tito's co-owner and group director Ricardo D'Souza had claimed in a social media post on Monday that he has sold the club and their “entire business in Goa” due to “harassment” from state government “officials” for an undisclosed amount. “The question is when you are shutting or quitting a particular business why blame the authorities. While starting and running the same business, the same authorities were in place, maybe at times their assistance also must have been taken, then why these allegations now?” Sawaikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/publicity-bid-by-club-titos-co-owner-bjp/articleshow/84049412.cms||---

Originally from Wai and a resident of Gultekdi in the city, Gayatri Ithape succumbed to her injuries the same day in a private hospital. The victim’s friend, Prathamesh Mandhare, was riding the bike and lodged an FIR relating to causing death due to negligence under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Motor Vehicle Act with the Kondhwa police on Wednesday. Mandhare is also from Wai and resides at Warje Malwadi in the city. “Ithape and Mandhare were headed for Covid-19 vaccination centre in around 1.45pm on Tuesday. When they were passing via NIBM-Undri road, an autorickshaw plying ahead suddenly applied brakes,” inspector Deepak Barge of the Kondhwa police said. “The situation forced Mandhare to slam the brakes hard. The impact of the sudden deceleration was such that Gayatri panicked and lost her balance. She fell off the bike on the right side of the road and run over by a speeding car coming from the rear,” Barge said. Mandhare escaped unhurt as he had fallen on the left side of the road. The car driver, with the help of some passersby, took the girl to a hospital but she succumbed to her injuries. “We have served a notice to the car driver asking him to join the police investigation, as he was booked under a bailable offence.

The council has also decided to employ experts to prepare a feasibility report to develop a medical college and hospital. Speaking to TOI, vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar said, “The Covid Care Centre will come up at our health centre. It will have doctors who will provide preliminary healthcare services to our staff and their family. The decision was taken after many staff and faculty members lost their lives as they failed to get health facilities in the initial stages of the infection.” Akhtar said a medical college and hospital has been a dream of many VCs in the past. “My first announcement, too, was that Jamia will realise this.” The VC said that she had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was promised that steps would be taken in this direction, but then the pandemic happened. “The EC has asked for a feasibility report, which will entail details on the timeline and funds required for the project.” Akhtar said she had also prepared such feasibility reports in the past. “We will ask professionals from medical colleges, government and private individuals to prepare a report. We also have a plot adjacent to the campus, which we want to bring under our control.” The VC said that a committee was also prepared in the past for the project, but failed to give any positive output.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jamia-to-set-up-covid-care-centre-for-its-staff-on-campus/articleshow/84049435.cms||---

The cabbies say Rohtang was the only source of income for thousands of families and they were suffering huge financial losses for over one year. Rohtang, the main tourist destination of Manali where tourists see snow in most time of the year, was opened for tourists in June. Given the safety of tourists, only local taxis were being allowed to go to the area. Permit to go to Rohtang was being issued manually by the SDM office. Now that online permit booking system is being restarted and any vehicle from the country can do so after paying permit and pollution charges of Rs 550. Only 1,200 vehicles are allowed to go to Rohtang pass every day following the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order. Taxi union president Puran Chand said, “We already had very few passengers this year. Most of the tourists are coming in their own cars and are going to other locations. If permits are available to everybody, local taxi operators will get only a few permits out of a daily quota of 1,200. How will we survive? If the government fails to come out with a solution, we may go on indefinite strike.” Cabinet minister Govind Thakur went to meet the agitating cabbies and sat on road along with them to talk with them. “Their demands are genuine. The tourism industry has suffered huge losses. Taxi operators had no business since March 2020, but we are also bound to comply with the NGT order.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan saw ‘cooler’ summer this year, but humidity levels soar||JAIPUR: Rajasthan is known for its blistering heat especially in Churu, Sriganganagar, Jaisalmer and Barmer districts where the mercury breaches 46°C almost every year. However, this year the weather hasn’t been that harsh in May and June, thanks to various cyclonic systems that developed during these months. Though the mercury hasn’t touched the near 50°C mark this year, delayed monsoon and higher humidity levels in June have made the real feel much higher that what it actually logged. TOI on Thursday spoke to Jaipur Met office director Radhey Shyam Sharma for an understanding of how the weather played in May and June compared to previous years. “In Jaipur, we have had days in May when the mercury touched 45°C. This year has been different as the temperature has ranged between 41°C and 43°C. On May 26 last year, we recorded a maximum temperature of 45°C. In June, the maximum temperature touched 46°C. But this year, the mercury hovered between 40°C and 41.5°C,” said Sharma. Asked about the reasons, he said, “Various things including western disturbances and occurrence of cyclone Tauktae brought rainfall and dust storms which guided the mercury to take a dip.” He added that higher humidity levels starting from June 20 onwards in Jaipur and other areas have increased night temperatures. “This year, there has been little increase in minimum temperatures as it rarely touched 30°C,” he added. Churu, which logged 50°C in 2018, saw a maximum of 46°C this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-saw-cooler-summer-this-year-but-humidity-levels-soar/articleshow/84049402.cms||Ashish Mehta

Last year, the state reported 1,807 rape cases from January to March. During the same period this year, 2,461 rape cases were registered. Similarly, the state reported 1,619 abductions of women last year, while this year, the state logged 2,452 such cases.

In Bhankrota, a 23-year-old woman returning from a party was gangraped by two persons on June 7. The accused are still at large. In May, a 24-year-old homeless woman was gang-raped in an ambulance by the driver and his friend. The state police said the increase in cases is also because of the mandatory FIR registration rule which made it difficult for local police stations to decline a complaint. Also, in 2019, the SPs and DCPs were empowered to directly register FIR from their offices in case a police station turns away the complainant.

The work for construction of the 22-floor IPD tower at SMS Hospital at a cost of Rs 300 crore will begin in August. Out of the entire amount, Rs74 crore will be provided under Smart City project and Rs 50 crore each will be provided by the Housing Board and Jaipur Development Authority. The rest Rs 125crore will be provided by the medical education department. The IPD tower will come up at a place where cottage wards are existing. JDA will demolish the cottage wards soon. The state government has recruited 2,700 medical officers in the state in the past one year, said Sharma, adding that it had made all efforts to take care of all members of the medical family. He said necessary action had been taken after sympathetically considering the demands such as changing the designation of nurses lying pending for last six years, creating pharmacist cadre, increasing honorarium of resident doctors and ex gratia of Rs 50 lakh on death due to Covid. Meanwhile, the octors’ demand of creating a cadre for them as per the agreement in 2011 and 2017 is still pending. Sharma said the cadre committee in June had made the proposal in this regard and submitted it to the state government. The proposal will be examined and will be implemented soon by considering it sympathetically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/memorial-for-doctors-lost-lives-during-covid-pandemic-coming-up-at-sms-hosp/articleshow/84049433.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Journalists shouldn’t dramatise incidents & make news by endangering lives: Allahabad HC||LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court has rejected the bail petition of a reporter accused of abetting suicide, saying a journalist shouldn’t dramatise incidents and create news by putting a person’s life in danger. The bench of Justice Vikas Kunvar Srivastav made this observation while rejecting bail of a Lucknow-based journalist, Shamim Ahmad, who’s accused of prodding a mentally and financially distressed man to immolate himself outside the Uttar Pradesh Assembly last year and filming the act for live telecast. The judge said, “A journalist is not expected to dramatize a sensational and horrifying incident and make news by putting his actor in danger of death. A journalist keeps an eye on anticipated or sudden events and informs people through media without tampering. This is his business.” The bench also directed the trial court to conclude the case within a year, while clarifying that it need not be swayed by its observation in the bail rejection order. Journalists Shamim and co-accused Naushad Ahmad had allegedly contacted a tenant facing eviction and induced him to set himself ablaze in front of the Vidhan Bhawan. Additional government advocate Prem Prakash said, “On October 19, 2020, Zaved Khan asked his tenant, Surendra Chakraborty, to immolate himself if he was unable to vacate the accommodation. Then journalists Shamim and Naushad approached Chakraborty and told him that if his immolation is telecast on television, it will highlight his plight and halt his eviction. This was stated in a FIR filed in Hussainganj police station by the deceased’s wife.” Opposing Shamim’s bail plea, the government advocate said, while the man poured kerosene set himself on fire, the journalist, who was camping in front of the Vidhan Bhawan as per plan, kept video-graphing the immolation and did not once budge to douse the flames enveloping the man. Policemen were also seen trying to rescue Chakraborty, who later died in hospital on October 24, he added. The court order was uploaded on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dont-dramatise-incidents-make-news-hc-to-journos/articleshow/84051339.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

Police said the conspiracy was hatched in MP, where the mastermind lives, and is yet to be arrested. While the accused claimed their motive was only to loot the store, police will probe if the murder was a result of a personal feud. Shailendra Pandey (37) had been shot within 10 minutes of entering his shop, Om Sai Raj Jewellers, on Wednesday. Three masked men were captured on camera fleeing on a scooter. On suspicion that the scooter was stolen, police started to go through complaints of theft. They found CCTV grabs of a scooter theft where the thief was wearing white shoes. One of the masked assailants at the Dahisar store had been wearing the same shoes. Investigators scoured through surveillance videos till they located images of a car from which the scooter thief stepped out. The car belonged to Dahisar resident Chirag Rawal. Rawal said he knew nothing about the crime. “But we checked his social media accounts and found profiles of the masked assailants among his contacts,” said joint commissioner Vishwas Nangre Patil. Rawal’s interrogation led police to a village 12km from Surat, where assailants, Ayush SP (19), Nikhil Chandal (21) and Uday Bali (21) were hiding. The trio was picked up. It turned out they had been supplied weapons by Bunty Patidar from MP who had lived in Dahisar earlier, and knew about Pandey’s jewellery store. The assailants had practised firing the weapons in MP’s jungles. Patidar hired Rawal and associate, Ankit Mahadik, to be the assailants’ local contacts in Mumbai. On June 29, Ayush, Chandal and Bali arrived here by bus. Rawal picked them up in his car and they did a recce of the jewellery store. The trio ate and slept in the car. On Wednesday, Mahadik went along in an auto to confirm if the assailants on the scooter were landing up at the right location. “As soon as they entered the shop, two of the men opened fire as they did not want Pandey to activate an electronic lock, which would bolt the store shut,” said DCP D S Swami. After the crime, the assailants went to Kashimira, where they abandoned the scooter and hired a car to travel to Gujarat. At least 30 tolas of gold jewellery was stolen. Two guns used in the crime were dumped by the shooters in Surat but police found one. We are verifying the group’s criminal antecedents and will check if MCOCA can be invoked,” said Nangre Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/5-held-for-dahisar-jewellers-killing-cops-say-conspiracy-hatched-in-mp/articleshow/84051403.cms||Nitasha Natu

Exactly 10 days ago after petrol price touched Rs 101.04 per litre, authorities announced that prices of 14.2 kg domestic LPG cylinders have has gone to Rs 887 from the existing Rs 861.50. Immediately after the revised price came into force, LPG dealers started issuing revised cash receipts on Thursday. Consumers, who booked LPG cylinders on old price (Rs 861.50) were after delivery boys carried cash receipts with a hike of Rs 25.50 paise on a cylinder. In Hyderabad, the price of a LPG was at Rs 746. 50 in February, before prices went up substantially. For instance, prices in February and March increased by Rs 10 in March and continued to go up before settling at Rs 861.50 for a while. “Rate of crude oil hike in international market is the reason behind the hike of LPG prices,” D Ashok Kumar, president of Greater Hyderabad LPG Distributors Association told TOI. Though, the consumers are getting subsidy amount through ‘direct benefit transfer’ for LPG consumer (DBTL) scheme and money is getting transferred to their bank accounts by the oil company concerned, consumers who take delivery of LPG will have to pay the full price, he said. “After the cylinder price was hiked, how much DBTL amount consumers will receive, will be decided by the oil companies concerned,” Ashok Kumar clarified. He also said that the price of commercial cylinders also increased. On Thursday, dealers collected Rs 1,768 per cylinder. Industries and commercial units, like hotels, restaurants and eateries use non-domestic cylinders. Currently, over 25 lakh consumers are getting cooking gas from 120 LPG distributors of three oil companies. The association also said they will look into instances of LPG delivery boys asking for Rs 900 instead of Rs 880 from consumers towards delivery charges. “Even though we are paying a hiked price of Rs 880, delivery staff are demanding to give Rs 20 additionally. If we refuse to pay an extra amount, delivery boys are threatening to take the cylinder back, saying the door of the consumer concerned is locked,” Satya Prasad, a consumer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cooking-gas-prices-hiked-cylinder-now-costs-rs-887/articleshow/84047362.cms||Sunil Mungara

Under this, residents will get their bills through SMS. CM Khattar said the water bill generation system has been launched for Panchkula and would be scaled up across the state within a month. It was launched after the 54th meeting of the Water Supply and Sewerage Board held under the chairmanship of the CM on Wednesday. During the meeting, the CM was informed that with the inauguration of this system, about 33,000 consumers from Panchkula could pay their bills digitally. Discussing the water tariff of Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran and Urban Local Bodies (ULB) Department, Khattar asked officers to ensure uniform water tariffs. Besides, the CM asked officers concerned to conduct a survey of villages and identify areas where water pipes are to be laid and lanes are to be developed. The CM asked officials to constitute a team to inspect grey water management for cleaning of ponds in 620 villages (where grey water management has been done) and issue an inspection certificate. A presentation was delivered by additional chief secretary, public health engineering department, Devender Singh during the meeting. Haryana State Safai Karamchari Commission vice-chairman, Krishan Kumar was also present in the meeting. Speaking on grey water management, the CM said the remaining villages where grey water management is to be conducted should be segregated on the basis of population. He also approved the purchase of robotic machines to clean manholes. He also suggested use of robotic machines for cleaning of manholes to avoid manual scavenging on the lines of Sirsa and Bhiwani. Besides, pilot projects like “Sewage water danger mark alert system” should be taken up in other districts as well, he said. According to the CM, households which are not being covered under the present policy of providing water supply to Dhanis (areas with population of less than 100 persons), should also be considered for provision of water supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/paperless-water-billing-through-sms-launched-in-pkl/articleshow/84047347.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

So far, 20 people have been arrested in connection with the scam which has been probed since 2013. The inquiry was initiated after a Lokayukta probe indicted 199 persons, including Siddiqui, Kushwaha and 12 BSP MLAs. Siddiqui is now with the Congress. A source in the vigilance department said that besides Siddiqui and Kushwaha, notices have been served on 40 government officers who were in service at that time for recording their statements. Vigilance officials said that project managers had used red sandstones which were purchased at exorbitant rates. Sandstones used in the construction of parks and memorials were procured from Mirzapur district, but were routed via Rajasthan to make more money, causing huge revenue losses to the state exchequer. The officials had filed the first chargesheet in the memorial scam in October 2020 in which it had named six government officials.

---||Hyderabad||Darbhanga blast: Accused stayed near intel HQ for two decades, says NIA||HYDERABAD: The Lashkar e Taiba (LeT) sleeper cell operating from Hyderabad is a blemish in the anti-terror performance sheet of Telangana’s Counter Intelligence (CI) Cell, as one of the accused, who as per the NIA probe, even visited Pakistan, has been operating from the city for about two decades, staying 2.5 kilometres away from state intelligence head quarters. NIA’s latest arrest of alleged LeT operatives Nasir Mailk and Irfan Malik from Hyderabad indicated that they have made the IED responsible for blast on platform number 1 at Darbhanga railway station on June 17 in Hyderabad and sent it to Bihar by train in a parcel with an intention to cause incendiary explosion in the moving train. Only after the blast, alerted by the Bihar police, CI cell sleuths tracked down the brothers and the transnational terror conspiracy came to light during the subsequent NIA probe. NIA sources confirmed that Nasir Malik visited Pakistan with a visa to meet the relatives in 2012 and during that period, he also met LeT handlers operating from Pakistan.“Nasir was bringing ready made garments from Delhi, UP for sale. For about decade, he has been running a small shop in Mallepally. His brother came to the city and joined him few months ago,” said an intelligence official. A neighbour Azad Khan told media personnel that the brothers used to stay with their mother in a flat and Nasir used to spend long hours talking over the phone at a ground near his house. “None of the locals found anything suspicious about the brothers. We believe that they operated without any involvement from locals, a standard method used by sleeper cell operatives. So they have not come under our surveillance,” said a special branch official. CI cell was formed by in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh state way back in 1999. The last terror blast city witnessed was in February 2013 at Dilsukhnagar and ever since the arrest of Indian Mujahideen (IM) key operative, Yasin Bhatkal and other associates in 2013, attempts have been made by IS influenced modules to make IEDs in city but NIA busted the modules with CI cell support. Docus on IEDs seized from two ‘LeT men’:NIA sleuths seized documents pertaining to preparation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) during searches conducted at the rented house of two alleged LeT operatives in Hyderabad. After the arrest of Mohammed Nasir Malik and his brother Imran Malik at New Mallepally in Hyderabad on Wednesday, NIA sleuths searched their house. Among the items recovered by the NIA were various documents pertaining to procedure for fabrication of IEDs,” said an NIA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/blast-accused-stayed-near-intel-hq-for-two-decades/articleshow/84047501.cms||Mahesh Buddi

A recent study by researchers from India and Norway found that the periods of increasing extreme rainfall events in India during June to September coincide with rapidly declining summer sea ice in the Arctic. Based on analysis of climate data for the last 100 years, the scientists have established the link between the declining Arctic sea ice and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), which typically lasts from June-September. They have found that upper atmospheric circulation changes associated with rapid melting of sea ice in the Arctic ocean can reach further into the tropics and influence extreme rainfall events in India. The findings from the study show that the upper atmospheric circulation changes due to Arctic sea ice loss facilitate enhanced moisture supply and convection over the Indian landmass and cause increased extreme rainfall events. The study has been published in the reputed npj Climate and Atmospheric Science journal. Led by Sourav Chatterjee and co-authored by M Ravichandran, Nuncio Murukesh, Roshin P Raj and Ola M Johannessen, the study further stressed that detailed numerical modelling studies into the observed link will help shed more light on the potential contributing factors behind extreme weather events in India. “The study’s findings point to the fact that the variability of extreme events during ISM can at least partly result from upper-level atmospheric circulation changes due to remote sea ice changes in the Arctic and local sea surface temperature changes in the Arabian Sea,” said Chatterjee. Scientists had already observed the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events over the Indian landmass during ISM in the past few decades. Climate researchers have noticed more “extreme rainfall periods” in 2019 and 2020 as compared to 2018, but large parts of India have also witnessed drought-like conditions due to the unequal distribution of rainfall. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in its ‘Statement of Climate of India during 2020’, shows that high-intensity precipitation events have been on the rise, leading to flooding in Kerala, north Karnataka, Maharashtra (including Mumbai), Assam, Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, south Gujarat and even Punjab. The sea ice in the Arctic ocean is declining rapidly, potentially influencing global climate and weather patterns, said director of NCPOR, M Ravichandran. “A large amount of heat released during the extreme rainfall events in northwest India is known to travel up to the Arctic and reduce sea ice. But in this study, the research team focused on the possible relationship the other way round to see if changes in the Arctic atmospheric condition due to sea ice loss potentially influence the extreme rainfall during ISM,” said Ravichandran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-based-scientists-find-extreme-rainfall-link-to-arctic-melting/articleshow/84049544.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Pune||Kunal Khemnar takes additional charge of PMPML||Pune: Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Thursday assumed the additional charge of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) as its CMD following the expiry of the term of the previous incumbent Rajendra Jagtap. Khemnar told TOI that a full-time CMD would be appointed soon. “The state government will appoint a full-time CMD and I am holding additional charge at present. My focus will be to look into projects that are already in place and expedite them efficiently, rather than taking any new decisions. The e-bus project needs attention and my focus will mainly be on the same, apart from proper coordination with the PMC and PCMC on PMPML’s demands,” he said. Jagtap, an officer with the Indian Defence Estate Service (IDES), was appointed the chairman-cum-managing director of the PMPML in July last year during the first lockdown. Prior to his appointment as the CMD, he was the head of the Pune Smart City Project. He was on deputation in Maharashtra since 2012. “Jagtap handed over the charge after his term ended. Kunal Khemnar has taken over the additional charge of the PMPML and joined office on Friday,” a senior official with the transport body told TOI. “This is another instance of a PMPML CMD vacating his post after being in service for less than a year. The fact that the government has not appointed any official as a full-time CMD of the PMPML and given a PMC official the additional charge of the transport body shows its level of seriousness. The ailing transport body needs a full-time CMD,” PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole said. While Jagtap took several new initiatives like the ATAL bus service, ordered additional e-buses and revived the Pune airport bus service, besides connecting rural areas, some of his decisions also drew flak. Before Jagtap’s appointment, the transport body was under the additional charge of Nayana Gunde, who, despite being transferred in February 2019 and posted as the deputy director general of YASHADA, continued to hold the additional post at the transport body. Between February and July of the same year, former Raigad collector Vijay Suryavanshi was appointed the PMPML CMD, but he didn’t join office and was later posted as the commissioner of the Kalyan-Dombivali Municipal Corporation. Prior to Nayana Gunde, Tukaram Mundhe was in charge for 10 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kunal-khemnar-takes-additional-charge-of-pmpml/articleshow/84049471.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Airport liquor licence plan seeks to thaw 48-year freeze||MUMBAI: Almost 48 years after a state policy against creating or issuing new licences for liquor sale or consumption, the state excise commissioner has proposed a new category of licence for the premium liquor shops and bars at Mumbai airport. If created, this new category of licence could be extended in future to metro stations, malls, multiplexes and other city centres attracting tourists, said industry watchers. Delhi has a separate liquor licence for airports. According to the airport licence proposal, two separate categories of licences — one on consumption (open) and another off-consumption (sealed) — can be created. One of the reasons is that the shops and bars inside the airport do not have to follow dry days and can operate 24 hours unlike shops and bars outside. Moreover, they store and serve a variety of premium brands too. The proposal, sent by excise commissioner Kantilal Umap on May 14, 2021, to the principal secretary, state excise, at Mantralaya is based on a memorandum submitted by the Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) pointing out the need to treat bars and shops at the airport as a separate category. Principal secretary, excise, Valsa Nair Singh confirmed receiving the proposal, but said no move has yet been made to take it further. Umap did not comment. Maharashtra has not issued a new liquor licence since 1973 and in 1989, when Sharad Pawar was the chief minister, a resolution was passed in assembly that if any new liquor licence was to be issued, the proposal had to be be presented in the assembly. Mumbai has different categories of liquor licences or permits for shops, hoteliers and clubs but not for airports. However, Punjab and Delhi have separate categories for airport facilities. In Maharashtra, all licences at the airport are issued under FL2 and FL3, which are also given to the shops and bars outside the airport. Umap’s letter said: “To facilitate this, the Mumbai Foreign Liquor Regulations 1953 will have to be amended, for which a draft notification will be necessary based on certain criteria such as separate licensing fees for installations at the airports.” MIAL says there is a difference between liquor shops outside the airport and inside, as airport allows entry to only passengers and officials working there. Hence, it argues, the shops and bars inside the airport deserved a separate category. At Delhi airport, there is a separate authority to run the shopping mall at the airport and hence, those who have hired spaces there apply for the liquor licence separately, the letter added. In Mumbai too, licences can be issued in the name of those businesses which have hired the spaces inside the airport on lease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-liquor-licence-plan-seeks-to-thaw-48-yr-freeze/articleshow/84051457.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

---||Pune||Pune: Curbs on property deals in 23 newly merged villages||PUNE: Restrictions have been imposed on carrying out any property transaction in the 23 villages merged in the Pune municipal limits to check unplanned last-minute construction boom in these areas. As a part of the power transition, sarpanch and other office-bearers of these villages will have a limited say in the decision-making of these areas on administrative decisions. According to the experts and urban planners, even the monitoring of last-minute building permissions or other approvals at the gram panchayat level should be done to avoid the approvals with malafide intentions. Among the newly merged villages, 20 villages are from the Haveli taluka, while three are from the Mulshi taluka. “We have issued instructions for the transition of authority. The documents and other office infrastructure of district administration will now be handed over to PMC,” said Ayush Prasad, ZP CEO, told TOI. Prasad said an audit would be conducted of the works, as well as government assets, which are to be handed over to the civic body. “It was seen that fly-by night developers get their building permissions a the last minutes, before a village is merged in the PMC areas. Many of these plans are not sanctioned properly. This often leads to illegal and unauthorized constructions,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens group. Ujwal Keskar, a BJP leader, said a process to immediately seal the administrative offices at village level should be carried out as soon as possible. “The same formula was used in 1997, when villages were merged in the PMC limits. It had averted the lastminute intervention by the outsiders in those offices,” he said. He said even the details of existing land use and proposed land use in these villages should be published. It will help in keeping a check on land use. The ZP CEO said the rules pertaining to constructions as well as property tax, which are applicable to the PMC areas, will now be effective in the newly merged villages. “We are coordinating with the district officials for smoother transition of the administrative responsibilities. Same type of process was carried out in 2017 when 11 villages were merged in the civic limits,” said a senior PMC official. As per the official, no authority at the gram panchayat level can intervene in the decision-making of PMC. The elected representatives, such as sarpanch or zilla parishad members of the merged areas, will now be only the former elected representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/transition-of-power-begins-at-23-newly-merged-villages/articleshow/84049481.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand’s bitter experience with political instability||DEHRADUN: Even before the first election could be contested in Uttarakhand in 2002, the Himalayan state – carved out of Uttar Pradesh on November 9, 2000 – saw the tenure of two chief ministers. In the past 21 years of existence, Uttarakhand has witnessed nine leaders take charge of the top post. In a sharp contrast, neighbouring Himachal Pradesh – which became a state in 1971 – has seen only six on the CM's post in a span of 50 years. Speculations of a change of guard have started in Uttarakhand and going by the state’s past track record a new face may not come as a surprise to many. In the last 21 years, Narayan Dutt Tiwari has been the only CM to complete his five-year tenure (from 2002-07). Social worker and political analyst Anoop Nautiyal told TOI, “It is the state's misfortune that political instability has continued for such a long time. I think most of the people, who became chief minister, lacked the political ability to manage.” Nautiyal added, “They failed to get along with people, fulfill the ambition of party members and extract results from bureaucracy. The lack of managerial and leadership skills led to the early departure of most CMs." Nityanand Swami, the first CM, could be in power for only under a year before he had to resign in favour of Bhagat Singh Koshyari. When BJP came to power in the period between 2007 and 2012, the CM's post alternated between BC Khanduri and Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank mainly due to the resentment expressed by MLAs first against Khanduri and later against Nishank. It was a similar scenario when Congress came to power in the period between 2012 and 2017 with Vijay Bahuguna becoming the CM till 2014 and the post, thereafter, being taken over by Harish Rawat after he gathered enough MLAs on his side to stake a claim for the top post. In 2016, Rawat got a taste of his own medicine when 10 Congress MLAs rebelled against him putting his government in a crisis and leading to imposition of central rule. Despite the fact that BJP won 57 out of 70 assembly seats in 2017, Trivendra Singh Rawat could not complete his full term and barely nine days before completing four years, he stepped down. Tirath Singh Rawat, the current CM, is the ninth person to hold the key post. Political analyst Jay Singh Rawat opined, “It is hard to fulfill all commitments and in the last 20 years, both parties – BJP and the Congress – have had a number of seniors vying for the top post. Since the state's formation, there has been a lot of internal bickering. Even in the interim government Nityanand Swami could not complete the two-year term and had to be replaced midway."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhands-bitter-experience-with-political-instability/articleshow/84047517.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s daily jab average halved in a week||AHMEDABAD: From a daily average of 3 lakh first-dose vaccinations between June 19 to 25, Gujarat from June 26 to July 1 saw an average of 1.4 lakh. In all, the weekly vaccination number for the first dose dipped by 50% from 21.31 lakh in the previous week to 10 lakh this week. For the past four days, the city – and state – have been reeling from a severe shortage of vaccine doses with the majority of vaccination centres witnessing long queues. Sources privy to developments said that several industrial areas in the eastern city parts reported the formation of queues as early as 5am to jostle for doses. Several centres also witnessed fights over the day’s tokens. State government officials on Thursday said 4 lakh doses would be procured in the next two days including three lakh of Covishield. Sources said that these doses will cater to both the 18-44 years category taking the first dose and those in the 45+ years category for their second dose. The second category will get larger with the peak of first doses administered for this category being two months ago. For Ahmedabad, vaccination on Thursday was at the lowest level in four days at 21,724 doses administered. On June 27, the city had recorded 20,100 vaccinations. The numbers are much lower than the target of the state government, said experts, pointing at the decision to extend the deadline for getting vaccinated for those working at commercial establishments to July 10 from June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/states-daily-jab-average-halved-in-a-week/articleshow/84049485.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Lockdown aids illicit liquor brewing||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The cessation of liquor sales through bar hotels and Bevco outlets adversely impacted the state not only on the revenue front, but also increased health risks due to the manufacture and consumption of illicit liquor, revealed figures. As many as 1,112 cases of illegal liquor brewing were registered during the recent lockdown period and maximum cases were reported from Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam as per government statistics. While Thiruvananthapuram (168) topped the chart, Kollam (148), Alappuzha (116), Palakkad (121) and Kozhikode (111) followed, registering over 100 cases. Wayanad (nine), Kannur (21) and Kasaragod (25) were the districts where the least number of cases were registered with respect to illicit liquor brewing. This trend was visible during last year’s lockdown as well. According to the figures of excise department last year, the quantity of wash (which is the base for manufacturing arrack) that was confiscated from various parts of the state since March 24, 2020 (the day lockdown began) till April 6, had steadily increased from 160 litres/day to 6,000 litres/day. The number of Abkari cases also increased from 10/day to 51/day. Department officers said the main reason behind this is the curtailed movement of vehicles, because of which the ‘traditional’ method of manufacturing liquor is making a comeback. The department has been relying on the data of the areas that have been traditionally under radar for illicit brewing as well as individuals who were earlier involved in illicit liquor brewing, said officers, adding that this has helped them nab illicit liquor brewers. Bevco had incurred a loss of Rs 1,700 crore during the lockdown period this year. Liquor sales had begun on a positive note in the current financial year with the government earning approximately Rs 970 crore through sales from April 1 to April 27. However, a decision was taken to shut down Bevco outlets and bars once again from April 27 and it lasted for 51 days before sales resumed once again. Last financial year, the state earned a robust revenue from liquor sales. It had earned Rs 11,743.99 crore through liquor sales, which is only 5.28% less compared to the immediate year before it. In 2019-20, liquor sales fetched the state exchequer a sum of Rs 12,398 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lockdown-aids-illicit-liquor-brewing/articleshow/84045588.cms||KP Saikiran

Pramod Kamble (23) of Kondhwa has lodged an FIR with the Mahalunge police chowkey. Assistant inspector Dattatreya Gulig told TOI that Kamble was on night duty on Wednesday. He had reached his workplace a little early so he was walking around. “When he neared a petrol pump in Kuruli around 12.30am, five unknown youths blocked his way. They thrashed him and also hit him with a water bottle on his right ear,” Gulig said. One of them, carrying a sharp weapon, threatened to kill Kamble and demanded money from him. “As Kamble was not carrying any money with him, the suspects snatched his two smartphones and fled,” Gulig said. The officer said the police have arrested one suspect and detained his three accomplices. “One more suspect is still on the run. We will take him into custody soon,” Gulig added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-held-3-detained-on-robbery-charge/articleshow/84049503.cms||---

Industrial Development minister Satish Mahana said on Thursday that the road connecting Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh with Lucknow and then onward to Delhi (through Agra and Yamuna Expressways), is more than 95% complete despite the two waves of Covid-19 pandemic that have struck the state since last year. “We are carrying out work in such a way that by July end, it will be motorable and by August 15, we will be in position to start it in its entirety. Despite Covid-19 issues, we have been able to complete the project in record time and have not exceeded the initial estimate of 36 months. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will be starting a tree plantation drive along the expressway very soon as he is keen on developing it as a green expressway. We are getting eight petrol pumps started and amenities in place for the public,” said Awanish Awasthi, CEO, UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA). Mahana spoke about the changes in the industrial sector which have been brought about by the BJP government, from land reforms in which land allocation has been made to industries like the Hiranandani Group for a data centre in 15 days, to bringing UP on the second position in ease of doing business rankings. “Due to our proactive policies, we have managed to draw investors to the state. For the MoUs signed in the 2018 investors summit, we have a conversion rate of over 50% whereas anywhere else in the world it is not more than 15%. Earlier UP was importing ice cream sticks from China but now we are manufacturing them in the state. When the pandemic started, US was sending us ventilators but now UP can manufacture ventilators here itself,” the minister said. Awasthi said that work on the Ganga Expressway was likely to start by September. He said that over the past three months, 83% of the land or 5,600 hectare had been acquired and by the beginning July, 90% of the land was available with the government. “More than Rs 5,000 crore have been distributed to 63,500 farmers with not a single case of dispute. The project itself has an estimated cost of Rs 42,000 crore. The bidding process for this is on and we will be submitting the bidding documentation to the Cabinet very soon. By mid-August we should have the bids and work should start by September,” he said.

Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials claimed that most centres received between 100 and 250 doses. There was controversy over former city mayor Kanaji Thakor along with a few BJP party workers organizing an independent vaccination drive at the Thakorvaas in Madhavpura. About 100 doses were administered at the Thakorvaas camp. “The AMC claimed that vaccines will be available at designated municipal schools, community halls and urban health centres, then how can a municipal councillor organized a special drive for a certain locality,” asked Shitij Patel, 26, who had gone to the nearby urban health centre (UHC). In all, 21,605 vaccine doses were administered in the city on Thursday. “The city will get about 24,000 vaccine doses for the next five days after which more vaccine centres will be made functional,” said a senior AMC official.

---||Mumbai||Beneficiaries must insist on digital certificate after dose: BMC||MUMBAI: The earlier BMC guidelines for vaccination camps at workplaces or housing complexes, issued in May, had put the onus on the private Covid vaccination centres who would administer the jabs to inform the local ward office, which was not done in case of some of the suspicious vaccination camps held across the city. Now, the new regulations say not only does the housing society have to inform the ward office, it also needs to inform the local police station and on the day of the camp, a police officer has to be present on site. The BMC has asked residents to insist on getting a digital certificate immediately after the jab (see box). On June 14, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had ordered that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the private vaccination centre with any workplace or housing society should have details like number of medical staff stationed at the site and ambulances in case of adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI). In the first case of the fake drive at a Kandivli housing society, the BMC found there was no MoU with the hospital, nor were the credentials of those administering the jabs verified. Advocate Vinod Sampat, president of the cooperative societies residents and users association, questioned why police have to be informed about a vaccination drive. “There is no question of law and order that one needs to involve the police. While the intention is noble, the BMC should keep the guidelines simple; the society should inform the BMC and it can verify the details and allow them to go ahead with the camp,” said Sampat. Political leaders too criticised the BMC, saying it was putting the responsibility on everyone, from housing societies to private hospitals and doctors. “Why can’t the BMC itself check whether a vaccination camp is genuine or not? It should be mandatory to inform the BMC in advance about the vaccine batch number. I have demanded that the (affected) residents be vaccinated again, now that it is a month and it’s highly unlikely proper vaccine was administered to them,” said Kandivli MLA Yogesh Sagar. In a letter to the deputy registrar of co-operative societies on June 29, the public health department had mentioned that the new SOPs were in response to the Kandivli incident in which unverified and possibly fake vaccines were given to some residents of the Hiranandani Heritage Co-operative Housing Society during a camp held at the complex. On Thursday, BMC’s senior counsel Anil Sakhare shared the SOPs with a high court bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, which was hearing a PIL filed by Siddharth Chandrashekhar over CoWin accessibility for all. His counsel Anita Castellino said the private camps must have stricter scrutiny over information regarding the batch of vaccine and guidelines for proper record and destruction of vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/beneficiaries-must-insist-on-digital-cert-after-dose-in-mumbai-bmc/articleshow/84049587.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Nagpur||Record 7,790 objections filed against Ajni tree felling for IMS project||NAGPUR: In a record-breaking mass movement, over 7,790 objections were filed by citizens to stop felling of thousands of old trees at Ajni for the proposed inter-modal station (IMS). As per officials, this is the highest number of objection letters that Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has received till date for a tree felling case. Earlier, a large number of objections were filed to save Bharat Vann urban forest. As reported by TOI earlier, the garden department of NMC had extended the deadline for filing objection letters to June 30. Not just Nagpur, people from other cities too have come forward to object against the large-scale loss of green cover. According to the Maharashtra (Urban Trees) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, which was passed by the state government in 1975 and amended in 2017, a public hearing on objections is mandatory and a decision is to be given within two weeks of that. However, while the process of filing objections was going on, the state government issued a GR, bringing in new tree norms in place with immediate effect. As per the amendment in the tree act, if more than 200 trees aged 5 years or more need to be felled, the case will be referred to the Maharashtra State Tree Authority. Going by the guidelines, NMC will now be handing over the matter to the state. “There is a possibility that a public hearing won’t be held and the matter will go straight into the hands of state government. We will get more clarity once the state tree authority is formed. NMC will go by what the authority recommends,” said NMC officials. On speculations regarding how the age of trees will be calculated, officials said that the state will give directions regarding the same. “Civic officials might be trained by experts on this,” they added. The objections had been called following a public notice issued by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) — the implementing agency of the project. The notice stated that over 4,500 trees will be for IMS phase -1. Activists have been slamming the authorities for hiding facts from the public. As per some documents, the actual project is being planned in four phases, which experts say will destroy over 40,000 trees in all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/record-7790-objections-filed-against-ajni-tree-felling-for-ims-project/articleshow/84049489.cms||Manka Behl

Harshad, 44, a zoo keeper entrusted with care of reptiles reportedly got bitten by a king cobra while he was cleaning the back cage. The cobras were not put for display in the enclosure owing to lockdown and were kept in the back cage. There are three king cobras at the Trivandrum zoo. One snake is kept separately while the other two are housed as a pair. The officials suspect that Harshad may have been bitten by the snake kept in one of the back cages. He was rushed to the medical college hospital but his life could not be saved. Harshad, a resident of Kattakada, leaves behind his wife and a kid. The snake house for cobras is designed in such a way that there is an exhibit enclosure, a keeper’s cabin and a back cage. The back cage is set on a raised platform behind the exhibit enclosure. It is a wire mesh structure fitted with a shutter. When the exhibit enclosure needs to be cleaned, the snake is drawn to the back cage by lifting the shutter and is guided back in the same way. The authorities believe that Harshad may have put his hand inside the cage without guiding the snake out. It may have been for a fraction of second but he was bitten and in no time he fell on the floor. Minister for zoo J Chinchu Rani visited Harshad’s house Harshad and paid her respects to the family. Shyju, who takes care of bears in the zoo, said he was on his way back for lunch, when he heard a frantic tapping on the grilled door of the snake house. He thought somebody may have accidentally locked Harshad from outside. He saw Harshad lying on the floor, flailing his legs, his mobile phone scattered to pieces and trash spattered all over. This is the second death of zoo keeper at Trivandrum zoo in the past two decades. In 2003, Vijayakumar Ganakan, a zoo keeper, was gored to death in the enclosure of rhinoceros.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tvm-zoo-keeper-dies-of-snake-bite/articleshow/84047589.cms||---

Swiftly responding to a complaint lodged by the youth’s father, Bulandshahr police tracked down the location of the mobile phone used for making the ransom call and with the help of Mumbai Police, found Aman Singh and his two friends, who had accompanied him to Mumbai earlier this week, to a roadside eatery in Buldhana district. No arrest was, however, made in this connection, said the police. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Santosh Kumar Singh said Bulandshahr resident Lokman Singh had lodged a written complaint at New Mandi police station that his son Aman was abducted in Mumbai and he had received a ransom call for Rs 2 lakh from the kidnappers, who used his son’s phone. “As the kidnappers had threatened Singh with dire consequences if he informed the police, he deposited Rs 1 lakh into the bank account number given to him,” said the SSP. “We found that bank account belonged to Multinter Prize Malkapur Ltd in Maharashtra. I then directed the surveillance team to track the location of Aman’s phone and coordinate with Mumbai Police.” The bank account was subsequently frozen. “We coordinated with Jalgaon, Jamod and Nandura police and the youth was found in a roadside eatery in Nandura police station jurisdiction. Mumbai Police also got two of his friends freed from the abductors. The three youths, who had been thrashed by the abductors, were found in an unconscious state,” said Sanjay Kumar of the Bulandshahr surveillance team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-7-hrs-after-ransom-call-city-cops-help-rescue-3-abducted-up-youths/articleshow/84051566.cms||---

The virus has re-emerged as a new strain. Wearing masks, following social distance and getting vaccinated have become all the more important now,” said Khalid Rasheed. He added that Covid-appropriate behaviour was the only way to keep trouble away. He also urged people to motivate their families, friends and acquaintances to do so. Miles away from Lucknow, in a village in Gonda, a young Mohd Aslam was seen in a video clip making the same appeal. In Siddhartnagar, Maulana Bilal Ahmad, Mutawalli Wasim and Abduk Mubin of Madrassa Jamia Ahle Sunnat Isha At ul Islam provided a platform to the district health team led by medical officer Dr DK Chaudhury to understand the importance of immunisation. Later, the madrassa held sessions with community members and pleaded them to take the jab. Likewise in Meerut’s Sarurpur Khurd block, Maulana Abdul Wahid held several public gatherings within the community to dispel myths and misconceptions around vaccination. Within weeks, there was an 80% increase in the number of vaccinated persons in Meerut. In Amethi’s Babuganj village, Mauni Maharaj is telling devotees to see vaccines as a blessing of god and get the jab without fail. In Barabanki, where several people had jumped into the river—they were later rescued—upon seeing the health team, the local administration engaged with imams and gurus and showed them videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath taking the vaccine to convince them about its safety. Now, the same videos and photos are being used by religious leaders, health workers and gram pradhans to counter doubtful minds with the assertion ‘would PM and CM have taken them if the vaccines were unsafe’. Across UP, more than 5,000 religious leaders are working to fight misinformation against Covid-19 vaccination drive while making people understand its importance. Many of them have also given hand-written appeals and video messages to be used to fight hesitancy. The role of these leaders is being seen as a key contributor for improvement in rural vaccination coverage. In addition, they are constantly sending messages about the importance of Covid-appropriate behaviour. Hailed by admin While the actual impact of the communication undertaken by faith leaders will be quantified later, a number of health officials and district magistrates have already noted the difference. “Misinformation travels faster than correct news. Under such a situation, people tend to doubt the system as well. Faith leaders act as a bridge between people and administration,” said a district magistrate posted in a large eastern UP district. An officer posted in western UP said: “Counselling alone doesn’t work. There has to be a trust element, especially in villages and backward pockets. In addition to their role in dispelling myths and sending correct messages, they become the source of guidance and can be approached at any time of the day. Successful precedents exist Experts pointed out that religious leaders in different countries have collaborated with the system for the cause of public health on many occasions. “Faith moves mountains and in case of health issues, the interest of religious communities is aligned with the system. Together, they add up to turn the Hindi proverb ‘ek aur ek gyarah’ true and do wonders for the community,” said Dr Praful Bharadwaj, health officer, Unicef. He mentioned how the power of religious leaders had come to the fore in measles, rubella, Mission Indradhanush, pulse polio programme and even in the fight against encephalitis. In African countries, such leaders have worked for diarrhoea, HIV and more lately Ebola. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, they have contributed immensely for routine immunization. Their role is well-acknowledged and factored for health programmes, particularly immunisation, in India too. The Union ministry of health and family welfare’s document on Universal Immunization Programme, for instance, reads: “A highly innovative communication strategy to dispel fears, overcome resistance and refusal and elicit community participation with active involvement of religious leaders, opinion makers and civil society implemented vigorously.” The leaders, on their part, consider it their duty. Khalid Rasheed believes that all religions of the world see good health as a blessing of the almighty. “Each one in their own way preaches to make people live and practice things that keep them mentally and physically healthy. If a religious leader associates with health programmes in times of crisis like we did, they are simply doing their duty,” he said. President of Lucknow Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee RS Bagga said that there is nothing better than contributing to the lives of people in a positive way. Mahant Devyagiri of Mankameshwar Math said, “The pandemic has left everyone shaken and broken. People have lost their dear ones. It is our duty as responsible citizens to help people understand ways and means that can help in saving them from further trouble.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/good-health-a-gift-of-almighty-it-is-our-duty-to-ensure-it-say-faith-leaders/articleshow/84051561.cms||Shailvee Sharda

In its affidavit, the state health department said that the government “is putting in all efforts to carry out the vaccination drive with full vigour, as vaccination is a big weapon against stopping the chain of transmission of the virus.” The state government has told the HC that as on June 30, it had total 5,95,030 vaccine doses. There were 5,12,260 Covishield doses and 82,770 doses of Covaxin in the stock. The government has claimed that 65.56 lakh people have received their first dose of vaccine, whereas 16.27 lakh have received the second dose as well. In 33 districts, 1.33 crore people have received their first dose and 39.08 lakh of them got the second dose also. The state government supplied details of vaccination done till date, particularly in inmates and the staff members of special homes like children’s homes, old age homes, women shelter homes etc. It claimed that in nine grant-in-aid homes for the beggars, there are 145 residents. Of them, as many as 121 beggars have been inoculated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/80-of-adult-population-to-get-first-vax-dose-by-sept-end/articleshow/84049571.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Cop who chased Parv Shah had no jurisdiction||AHMEDABAD: A new development in the Shivranjani hit and run case has left the city police department red in the face. Investigation has revealed that a cop, who had no jurisdiction in the area, had allegedly forced a sedan driver to chase Parv Shah — the 22-year-old car driver who ran over a family sleeping on the footpath, killing a woman. Shah fled the spot and surrendered before the cops 15 hours later, claiming he had lost control of his vehicle because he was being chased by a cop. Eyewitnesses also reported that a sedan car had been speeding after Shah’ hatchback. The police initially failed to carry out an inquiry against the other car driver. After facing severe flak, they booked the sedan owner from Ashram Road for violating curfew norms. B B Vaghela, incharge PSI of N Division Traffic Police, said, “We have filed a case of curfew violation along with charges under epidemic act as well as disaster management act against Dhir Rajesh Patel, a 27-year-old resident of Jalvihar Flats near Ajanta commercial complex on Ashram Road.” On why Patel was chasing Shah’s car, Vaghela claimed, “A man in khaki uniform had stopped Patel’s car and asked him to chase the hatchback, claiming that its driver looked shady. He told Patel that the car had made a u-turn near Thaltej Crossroads, raising his suspicion.” On why the khaki-clad man did not stop when Shah ran over the footpath dwellers, Vaghela said that the cops did not know anything about it and the man in khaki was yet to be summoned. DCP (Traffic) Tejas Patel said, “We do not know who the khaki-clad man is.” However, a police officer, refusing to be named, said, “The city and traffic police officers are making all possible efforts to conceal the identity of the cop. It may expose corruption in the police department.” A senior traffic police officer, seeking anonymity, said, “We have identified the driver of the other car as well as the policeman, who neither belongs to the city police nor the city traffic police. He was chasing Shah’s car even though he had no jurisdiction to act in Vastrapur and Satellite areas.” On why did he not stop after the accident, the officer said, “He must thought that it would put him in trouble.” Sources in the traffic police said that the cop who forced Patel to chase Shah’s car was roaming in Thaltej area and probably decided to nab Shah and his friends suspecting that they were drunk. The accident claimed the life of Satu Bhabhor, 38. Her husband Babu, 40, and their two kids Jetan, 7, and Vikram, 5, suffered severe injuries when Shah ran his car over them near Shivranjani crossroads during the wee hours of Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cop-who-chased-parv-shah-had-no-jurisdiction/articleshow/84047567.cms||---

Manohar Subramanian, a secondary grade teacher from Panchayat union Primary School at Velliyanai in Karur district, was one among the three teachers selected for the award out of the six names recommended by the state government for the year 2018. He had taken inspiration from the state board text books introduced in 2018 with QR code and decided to have QR code in the identity cards of the school students. The idea of QR code struck him during his attempt to create a digitised database of a student's profile. Apart from basic details of their children, parents could also get to know the academic performance of their children. “We also made students interact with students and teachers from other states and even from many other countries through Skype,” said Manohar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/karur-teacher-2-others-bag-natl-ict-award/articleshow/84049545.cms||---

Six years ago, Harshad who was then a daily-wage zoo keeper, had locked himself up in the cobra enclosure in a suicide bid. He was frustrated over the endless wait for a permanent post at the zoo. He later became a permanent employee and died from the bite of the same snake he had reared all these years In 2015, Harshad sat inside the enclosure with around 30 poisonous snakes for an hour. He demanded that he needed assurance from the minister’s office that he would be made permanent. The matter was communicated to the minister’s office and senior officials assured him over phone that his grievance would be immediately addressed. He then voluntarily came out of the cage. A native of Kattakkada, Harshad had been a daily wage keeper at the zoo for more than 15 years before he was recently enrolled into a permanent job. Harshad had always flirted with danger handling dangerous reptiles. When the anacondas were brought to the city zoo, the officials were warned. Once Harshad was feeding the anacondas when one leapt from the water and bit him on his right arm after coiling around his hands. Harshad kept his cool, slowly undid the knots and released the snake as though it was a plastic, harmless rope. Under his care, anacondas became popular exhibits at the zoo and when they started dying, nobody was more hurt than Harshad. Two years ago, he had his arm lacerated by a crocodile. He underwent a plastic surgery and was back for duty soon. Even when he was bitten by the snake, Harshad showed presence of mind to keep the latch locked or else the King cobra would have slipped outside causing even further danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/once-he-sat-with-snakes-in-protest/articleshow/84047609.cms||---

Although Patole said he was not targeting energy minister Nitin Raut, the firm to which the tender has been allotted has links with Raut. In a letter to the CM and Desai, Patole pointed out that Rukhmai Infrastructures has no net worth, lacks experience and does not have security clearance either. Further, the company with which it has formed a joint venture has been blacklisted by the national company law tribunal. “Our information is that the said firm does not satisfy even a single tender condition.

There are also plans to bring Kovilpalayam police station under Periyanaickenpalayam subdivision from Karumathampatti subdivision for administrative purposes. Neelambur village panchayat presently falls in Sulur police station limits. The Sulur police have to travel at least 8km to reach the village whenever crimes are reported there. Since Sulur police station is already struggling with manpower shortage, superintendent of police (SP) S Selvanagarathinam had recently conducted a meeting with other police officials to discuss about setting up a new police station manned by a sub-inspector of police at Neelambur. “We are preparing the proposal. This will reduce burden on the Sulur police. Neelambur is a newly developed area and it has to be covered completely,” Selvanagarathinam said. The rural police have six sub-divisions - Periyanaickenpalayam, Mettupalayam, Karumathampatti, Perur, Pollachi and Valparai - and 39 police stations. Presently, Sulur, Karumathampatti, Kovilpalayam, Chettipalayam and Sulthanpet police stations fall under Karumathampatti sub-division. “An officer in the rank of deputy superintendent of police from Karumathampatti sub-division has to travel more than 20km to reach Kovilpalayam police station. Thudiyalur and Kovilpalayam police limits are thickly populated and developing areas. Both are located near the city borders. So, we are planning to bring Kovilpalayam police station under Periyanaickenpalayam sub-division,” the SP said. He said discussions were also on to change Karumathampatti sub-division to Sulur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rural-police-plan-new-station-at-neelambur/articleshow/84049546.cms||A Subburaj

During the last surge in Covid cases, the state’s maximum oxygen requirement per day was 1,150MT. The state government had asked the Centre to increase oxygen supply anticipating that a surge in cases will lead to a requirement of 1,600MT per day by mid-May. However, the number of cases fell and Gujarat did not need this amount of medical oxygen. However, the state government informed the HC that if a third wave is to occur, it expects active cases to go up to an estimated high of 2.5 lakh. There were a maximum of 1.48 lakh active cases in the state during the last surge, when maximum new cases in a day reported was 14,605. The peak number of new cases in a day is expected to reach 25,000 in a potential third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-need-1800mt-of-o2-per-day/articleshow/84049620.cms||---

The facility, a first-of-its-kind in Tamil Nadu, will have life-size elephant statues. A life-size mammoth replica has already been installed. Paintings of Asian and African elephants, tusks and skull replicas will also be on display. “It is an attempt to create scientific awareness about elephants among the young people. They have to understand the elephant’s role in biodiversity,” said additional principal chief conservator of forests I Anwardeen. A butterfly park and a children’s park will also be set up near the facility. “We are planning to promote ecotourism. An ecotourism management committee will be formed and tribal people from Kallar will be roped in to work at the interpretation centre. This will improve their livelihood,” Anwardeen told TOI.

Farmers who have been deprived of the facility ever since the lockdown was imposed had come to the markets early in the morning. Soon public also started trickling in. They were told to maintain social distancing and wear masks. Though 50% stalls were permitted, in most of the uzhavar sandhais the stalls were less than that. In Sundarapuram, only 15 shops were open. Since it was the first day, not many public were also aware of the reopening and hence the crowd was lesser.

---||Trichy||Minister K Ponmudi asks colleges not to admit students before board results||TRICHY: For the second time in the last one week, higher education minister K Ponmudi has asked arts and science colleges to refrain from starting admission before the board examination results of Class 12 are released. The marks are expected by end of July but most arts and science colleges in the state have started the admission process right after state government announced cancellation of Class 12 board examination. Popular colleges in cities are almost done with the admission process. Colleges, mostly aided colleges, are capitalising on the anxiety among parents of losing seat in these colleges. Unlike the centralised admission process for engineering or medical colleges in the state, every arts and science college individually calls for applications to fill seats in its undergraduate and postgraduate programs. When the debate on whether to cancel or conduct board examination was at the peak in the state a few weeks agocolleges were busy registering interested candidates through their websites. As the colleges got the basic details of students including contact numbers, it was easy for them to offer seats on a first come first serve basis once board exam was cancelled. M Nagarajan, convenor of Joint Action Council of College Teachers in Tamil Nadu, said most of the self-financing colleges in southern districts are in the process of filling up seats, while a few are already done with the admission. “They have taken a token advance or a part of the fees already. After the minister’s recent statement not to fill up seats for now, the colleges have kept the list in secret. Some of the aided colleges too have started admission for self-financing courses offered by them,” he said. Among those who have taken admission is S Rajendran, who secured a BCom seat for his daughter at an arts and science college in the city. “I was asked to pay the semester fee of Rs 16,000 which I paid. They asked me to come once Class XII results are published,” he said. It wasn’t the case about two decades back when colleges used to call for applications, scrutinise them and prepare merit list for each programme. The list was based on the marks obtained by candidates in Class 12 and seats were allotted by following the reservation system. “Norms have been thrown to wind over lack of proper monitoring by the higher education department,” said AUT general secretary M S Balamurugan. Such violations could have been avoided if the state government had issued a special admission guideline for carrying admission in arts and science colleges soon after the announcement on cancellation of class 12 board exam, he added. While anxiety among parents was legitimate, a committee headed by the regional joint director of collegiate education should have been formed to ensure that colleges adhere to the guideline. One of the principals from a college in Trichy said parents seek admission citing admission being carried by neighbouring colleges. If we orient them on the norms, we would lose a bright student. “After the state government released methodology to evaluate Class 12 marks, every student could calculate marks on his own and offer it to colleges,” said the principal. A Mekala, regional joint director of collegiate education, said she has instructed colleges not to carry admission process based on the direction from the higher education minister. “Action would be initiated against the college in case the department receives complaints,” she said. A similar trend was seen in Coimbatore as well. Arts and Science as well as engineering colleges have unofficially commenced the admission process where students approach the institutions and book their seats. These private institutions had begun the process for filling management seats over the past few days. Much of the deliberations are held online without the parents or students visiting the campus. Some reputed institutions have clarified that they do not admit students and are awaiting the government orders.

Ravi Yadav of Haryana and Jagath Singh of Uttar Pradesh and their spouses are the complainants in the case. They faced the attack while they were out for a walk on Sunday around 8.30pm. City police commissioner Balramkumar Upadhyay said it was Rakesh and Praveen who took part in the attack. Abhijith Nair and Shiju were arrested for helping the main accused escape from the city after committing the crime. While Rakesh was caught from Kottiyam, Praveen was held from Monvila. The others were held from Nedumangad. Police said Rakesh and Praveen were riding on a motorcycle when they saw the couples walking along the road. The two men were walking ahead while their spouses were trailing behind. Rakesh, who was riding pillion, harassed one of the women. When Ravi Yadav and Jagath Singh confronted them, the accused attacked them using sharp weapons and inflicted injuries.

---||Lucknow||Your voice in Protect UP||Vitamin D plays a huge role in boosting immunity and in downgrading cytokine storm in Covid. Since we are anticipating a third wave to involve children, it makes sense to suggest that government evolves a mechanism to administer/fortify vitamin D in children and mothers. The government already has a programme for deworming children and the drug used is Albendazole. An equally safe drug is Ivermectin which in many studies has shown remarkable results in Covid prophylaxis and even included in Covid treatment. I suggest that an urgent action be taken to include this drug either as combination with Albendazole or even replacing Albendazole. - Dr KB Muthappa Every shopkeeper must distribute masks among customers as a token. On carry bags, mask pictures should be printed with products. Policemen should distribute masks to people instead of fining them. Benefits of wearing mask should be seen everywhere. President of India should come forward and appeal to all political parties to help in inoculating people. All politicians irrespective of party should appeal for vaccination. - Ajay Kapoor We need to make ‘masking up’ the new normal in ways other than just appeals or fines. For this to happen, here are my suggestions: Lead by example: No popularly known face must ever be shown in any media without a mask. This includes the PM, all central ministers, CMs, all state ministers and all known political faces down to the village sarpanch. This has to be extended to all fields such as the performing arts, music, films, sports, faith or religious leaders, journalists, TV news readers, the bureaucracy, the military and para military forces and so on. In meetings chaired by the PM/CMs/ministers/bureaucrats/party spokespersons/TV channel debates, I have noticed with surprise, unmasked assistants standing behind seated senior officials. Alternatively, TV debates, news and shows must clearly flash a clarification that participants have been checked, and the premises have been sanitized to obviate the necessity of masks; or that participants are not wearing masks as they are joining from their homes. Advertisements and hoardings, TV serials must also show only masked faces. Organize mask design competitions to design the most “fashionable” mask. Institute awards for best advertisements encouraging masking up, and separately for a best mask slogan in all languages. - Rawindra Mehendaley||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/your-voice-in-protect-up/articleshow/84051603.cms||---
---||Delhi||Ex-chief secretary assault case: Supreme Court rejects Delhi Police's plea against Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a nine-month-old Delhi High Court order directing Delhi Police to give the statement of eyewitness V K Jain to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia and 11 other AAP MLAs, who have been chargesheeted for the alleged assault of then Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash. A combative additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi argued that the trial court was legally correct in refusing a copy of Jain's statement to the accused persons as it was part of the case diary and not one relied upon by the prosecution. "The accused are entitled to those statements which are relied upon by the prosecution and not to those which are part of the case diary," he argued. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah asked, “What is the harm in giving the witness statement to the accused? After all, the accused should get a fair trial. Since it is not an oral statement, the benefit of it should be given to the accused, otherwise it would not be a fair trial." When Lekhi continued with his attempt to force the technical issue, the bench said, "In our robust criminal justice system, the accused must get fair opportunity to defend themselves by getting access to all relevant documents and witness statements." Lekhi said the accused are not entitled to see the case diary and that only a court could have access to it. The bench said, “The Delhi High Court order is pro-liberty and we support it. There is nothing in the appeal. The case may be a political hot potato, but on merits, the high court has passed a correct order." The bench dismissed Delhi Police’s petition challenging the HC's October 21, 2020, order which had asked the trial court to consider Jain's statement before passing its order on charge. The high court had said it was a “prime duty” of an investigating agency to conduct a free and fair probe and bring to the notice of the court all the evidence collected. “The investigating agency has no power to appreciate the evidence, it rests with the court. Consequently, the trial court is directed to consider the statement dated February 21, 2018, of V K Jain (witness), which is part of ‘case diary’ and placed on record by the accused, at the time of passing the order on charge,” it had said. Prakash had alleged that he was assaulted by AAP MLAs in the presence of Kejriwal and Sisodia during a midnight meeting on February 19, 2018, relating to release of advertisements for the government on it completing three years in office. Kejriwal, Sisodia and nine other AAP MLAs were granted bail by a trial court. Two MLAs -- Amanatullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal -- were granted bail by Delhi HC. Delhi Police had filed a chargesheet against all 13 accused on August 13, 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-rejects-delhi-police-plea-against-kejriwal-sisodia/articleshow/84049601.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The 15 cops who received the cameras were from Thudiyalur, Periyanaickenpalayam, Vadavalli, Madukkarai, Kinathukadavu, Kovilpalayam, Chettipalayam, Negamam, Anaimalai, Sulur, Mettupalayam, Annur, Pollachi East, Karamadai and Perur. The 15 alpha team members would wear the body-worn camera on their uniform and record road accidents, family quarrel and any law & order issues. The body-worn cameras have infrared features that would help record incidents during night hours. The camera can record continuously for six hours. Selvanagarathinam said the patrolling police officers should reach the crime spot as soon as possible. “We can use the body-worn camera footage for legal purposes. Some people raise the issue of manhandling by police. These cameras will help the cops to handle such issues and can use the footage as evidence,” Selvanagarathinam said. “These cameras would help cops on several occasions,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rural-policemen-get-15-body-worn-cameras-with-night-vision-feature/articleshow/84049552.cms||---

She was speaking to media persons after turning up at the district court at Vanchiyoor to collect the copy of the high level police inquiry report that absolved her of the charges against her. The woman said the SI who took her into custody was a friend of her estranged husband. He made an offer to her to drop the case provided she agreed to grant the custody of the children to her estranged husband. She said that though the police have dropped the case, the report absolving her has no mention about who influenced her minor son to raise such allegations against her. As per the report, her son has not retracted his statements given earlier. There has to be a probe conducted to find out the person who encouraged the child to give such statements, she said. She added that her petition seeking custody of her children is pending before the family court. She had also filed a petition before the chief minister demanding that appropriate action be taken against those involved in the conspiracy which threw her life off the rail. It was in December that the Kadakkavoor police arrested the 35-year-old woman, based on the complaint given by her husband, who is an NRI. She was sent under judicial custody following the arrest. However, the police department initiated a high level-probe under the directions of the high court after she approached the court with a petition seeking to bring out the truth. The probe concluded that there was no medical or circumstantial evidence to support the child’s allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-accused-of-abuse-seeks-action-against-cops/articleshow/84047655.cms||---
---||Delhi||Need novel approach in teaching to cover Covid gaps: Sisodia||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister on Thursday asked teachers in the city to find innovative methods of teaching to cover the learning gap created by the Covid-19 pandemic. Laying the foundation stone for a new placement centre, open theatre and auditorium at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Sisodia said that a novel approach in teaching and learning was the need of the hour. “We have to decide whether we should continue to teach our children using archaic and traditional approaches or really teach them how to learn.” Sisodia also spoke on the need to adopt a diverse mindset towards learning. He added that at present, two methods of teaching are adopted in the field of higher education all over the world. “The first method is to teach content from 4-5 books and the other method is to read by taking samples from some part of the content in books. While the first method of teaching is adopted in most of the universities in our country, the second method is mostly adopted in developed countries. Covid-19 has challenged us to adopt the second method of teaching and teach students how to learn.” The deputy CM stated that “it is time for us to decide the kind of approaches we should adopt in our online or semi-online modules”. Sisodia said that IP University is one of the biggest varsities in Delhi and that it is imperative that top-class facilities are set up in the university. The vice-chancellor of the university, Mahesh Verma said that the project will be completed in nine months at an estimated cost of Rs 25 crore. “The seating capacity of this auditorium will be around 750 people and the open-air theatre will seat about 1,500. Facilities like a structural cooling system, radiant cooling, thermal storage, rain-water harvesting, waste-water management have been planned to give it a cutting–edge infrastructural outlook.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/need-novel-approach-in-teaching-to-cover-covid-gaps-sisodia/articleshow/84049731.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Cops take position at dams as Telangana & Andhra Pradesh water war escalates||HYDERABAD/VIJAYAWADA: Simmering tension over construction of alleged illegal irrigation projects and hydel power generation is now snowballing into a major showdown between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh with both states deploying hundreds of police personnel at hydel power stations on Krishna river in their respective regions. Tension was palpable at the power stations since Wednesday evening itself as Telangana deployed Special Protection Force personnel at Pulichintala, Srisailam, Jurala and Nagarjunasagar projects to prevent any untoward incidents and closed dam sites for vehicular and tourist movement. In a counter move, AP too deployed police force at Pulichintala dam on its territory. Although AP police claimed it was confined to protection of key installations at the projects, the heavy deployment of security personnel from both states triggered tension in the region. Telangana police denied entry to some officials from AP, including revenue and irrigation officials from Guntur, at Macherla on Andhra border, who wanted to give a letter to Telangana Genco officials asking to stop hydel power generation from units at Pulichintala and Nagarjunasagar. Later, amidst heavy security, J Ramesh Babu, superintending engineer, Pulichintala, AP, reached the hydro-electrical power station located on the other side of the state, and submitted a memorandum to TS Genco officials. Nalgonda DIG AV Ranganath and Guntur Rural superintendent of police Vishal Gunni were present during the negotiations between the AP and Telangana officials at the border. Kurnool superintendent of police K Fakeerappa said they have deployed force at Srisailam project on AP side as a safety measure and advised people not to come towards the reservoir site. AP police have stepped up security to prevent agitations and protests by opposition parties. Incidentally, this is not the first time Telangana and AP irrigation officials clashed over their rights on Krishna water. In fact, it was for the third time (2015, 2017 and 2021) in six years that both states deployed police personnel in large numbers at the dams. Earlier, on February 13, 2015 police personnel of both states nearly came to blows at Nagarjunasagar dam site. Both the states’ officials even lodged police complaints in 2017 for not releasing water from Sagar. Telangana and AP have been at loggerheads over construction of irrigation projects on Krishna, especially Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) in AP and hydel power generation in Telangana for the past two weeks. The Telangana government had written letters to Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) complaining against the AP government and a case was also filed in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which asked the AP government to stop the works. The Telangana irrigation officials alleged that the AP government did not stop RLIS works despite NGT and KRMB orders. AP strongly objected to power generation from Srisailam and other projects, especially Pulichintala, where the water level was just 20 tmcft and cannot generate power at that level, that too without taking approval from KRMB. AP irrigation engineer-inchief C Narayana Reddy shot off a letter to KRMB member secretary seeking immediate suspension of power generation by Telangana at Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala. On June 29, Telangana Genco started hydel power generation from two units of Srisailam, which the AP government objected to saying it started without taking permission from KRMB. Later, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao directed officials to generate power from all hydel power stations to full capacity. Following the orders from the energy department, Genco enhanced the capacity by operating more units at Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar, Pulichintala, and Jurala projects. “We will enhance hydel power generation depending on availability of water and inflows,” Telangana Genco director (Hydel) Ch Venkata Rajam told TOI. Refuting AP’s claims that Telangana cannot generate hydel power, Telangana energy minister G Jagadish Reddy said Srisailam project was constructed for generation of hydel power and not for irrigation. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy writes to PM Modi, seeks CISF cover for projects:Amid tension between two Telugu states over sharing of Krishna river water and the deployment of police by both states at Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala projects, AP chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to intervene and resolve the issue. He requested the PM to notify the jurisdiction of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and provide Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) protection at the projects. Jagan alleged that Telangana was illegally drawing water from the river at Srisailam for power generation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sagar-srisailam-simmer-cops-take-position-at-dams/articleshow/84053759.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||Ayurveda doctor found dead in Pune within hours of wife’s death||PUNE: A 28-year-old Ayurveda practitioner was found hanging on Thursday morning from a shower rod in the washroom of his house at lane number 2 of Azadnagar in Wanowrie barely hours after his wife — a homoeopath — was found hanging from a ceiling fan in the house around 5.15pm on Wednesday. Police said the couple — Nikhil Dattatreya Shendkar and Ankita (25) — had a verbal tiff on Wednesday evening over phone on handling a patient at the clinic in their residential building while Nikhil was returning home from his other clinic at Kasurdi in Yavat. After reaching home, he found Ankita hanging from a ceiling fan. She used a dupatta to hang herself. On Thursday morning, Nikhil went for a bath and did not come out of the washroom for quite some time. His family members got worried and broke the bathroom door. They found Nikhil hanging from the shower rod, using another dupatta. Senior inspector Deepak Lagad of the Wanowrie police said, “Ankita’s preliminary post-mortem report stated the cause as ‘death due to hanging’. Nikhil’s report has mentioned ‘asphyxia due to hanging’. Viscera has been preserved for chemical analysis in either case. We have registered accidental death cases and will record statements of the couple’s parents, relatives, friends and neighbours.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Namrata Patil told TOI, “Nikhil’s family members handed us a note, purportedly written by him, stating that nobody should be held responsible for his death. It stated he had no idea about why Ankita ended her life. In the note, Nikhil apologised to his parents and inlaws for the incident.” Nikhil’s uncle, Ramdas Shendkar, told TOI, “After Ankita’s death last (Wednesday) evening, Nikhil told us that he had called her around 4pm requesting her to attend a patient suffering from mental illness. But Ankita was not willing to attend the patient as she felt the patient was argumentative by nature. We came to know about Ankita’s death only after Nikhil returned home around 5.15pm. We don’t know what went wrong between them.” Nikhil’s maternal uncle, Dhanaji Dimble, said, “Ankita was from Uruli Kanchan and got married to Nikhil in December 2019. The couple was jointly running the clinic and would counsel patients testing positive for Covid-19. We never thought a happy married couple would end their lives in such a way.” Nikhil and Ankita stayed on the third floor of a groundplus-three storied independent house built by Nikhil’s father on five-guntha land in Azadnagar. Nikhil’s family has been residing there for the last 35 years. His parents, brother and sister — both dentists, stay on the ground floor. Lagad said, “When the police reached their house, Nikhil told us about the tiff and that she was neither responding to his calls nor opening the door. He broke into the room and found her hanging. He removed her body and tried to resuscitate her by giving CPR, but in vain. He then informed the police, who took the body to the Sassoon General Hospital, where doctors declared her dead.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ayurveda-doc-found-hanging-within-hours-of-homoepath-wifes-death/articleshow/84049606.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Several vehicles and a police jeep were also damaged. To bring the situation under control, the police had to fire multiple gas shells, a plastic bullet, and a bullet round in the air. The police have so far arrested 10 people and eight have been detained — their role in the violence is being verified. The police have also booked 59 identified suspects, including two corporators, and around 100 unidentified suspects on charges of attempt to murder, assault and criminal force to deter a public servant from performing an official duty, unlawful assembly and rioting. In addition, the police have slapped sections of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act Nanded superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale said, “The area where the incident took place has members of both communities. It has a history of communal friction fanned by local miscreants.” He added the riot was triggered by a petty argument between youths from the two communities inside a local gym. The argument had started with accusations of the youths staring at each other. This was followed by one side assaulting the other. Additional SP Vijay Kabade said, “As both groups of youths are closely associated with the corporators, a large number of supporters gathered on each side and started pelting stones.” On learning about the incident, the police sub-inspector along with four constables rushed to the spot and stood in between the two groups. They got injured during the stone-pelting. However, none of the accused from either side sustained any injuries. “The police personnel sustained head injuries and bruises while trying to prevent the groups from clashing”, said Kabade, who also rushed to the spot along with riot control police and quick response team commandos. In the wee hours of Thursday, the leaders from both sides decided against lodging an offence against each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-petty-argument-escalates-to-riot-5-cops-hurt/articleshow/84043178.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Coimbatore||Flights, passenger traffic take a nosedive during pandemic at Coimbatore airport||COIMBATORE: Passenger traffic at the Coimbatore International Airport, which had begun trudging upwards from last July to touch 50% of usual movement, has again nosedived due to the second Covid-19 wave. With Coimbatore struggling to control cases, passenger traffic dropped by 71.2% in a single month and fell even lower than that of July 2020. This is despite the airport continuing to function daily. The number of flights operated also fell by 60.8%. The number of passengers arriving and departing from the airport fell to 23,555 people in May due to the lockdown imposed across the state. This is a 71.2% drop compared to the 81,989 passengers the airport saw in April. In fact, April recorded a 31.1% fall in traffic compared to March, after cases started increasing and the wave began in Maharashtra, New Delhi and Karnataka, and the subsequent lockdowns in those states. “Once voting was completed on April 6, people had fewer reasons to fly in, out and within the state,” said travel agent P K Ganesh of Express Holidays. “That along with cases increasing in cities like Bengaluru, New Delhi and Mumbai led to people not risking travel.” Once passenger traffic fell, airlines that operated flights into the city from the metros began cancelling flights. The district begun enjoying flights from Madurai to Ahmedabad and one-stop flights to Kolkata. The airport, which saw 1,106 flights landing and taking off in March, saw movement fall by 64.8% in two months. The numbers of flights as well as passengers dropped below that of last July. Due to the pandemic, from October to March, when cases were low, passenger traffic, which had increased up to 1.28 lakh in January and February, had reached only 50% of its usual traffic of 2.35 lakh people. The number of flights, which reached 1,118, is also almost half of the 2,056 flights that were operated in a month last year. Airport director R Mahalingam, who admitted May was a tough month, said passenger traffic in June has increased by more than 20%. “Once cases started reducing and the government began lifting lockdown partially, the number of passengers began increasing. Once this happens, flights will also increase,” he said. “We expect passenger traffic to again surge ahead in the next few months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/flights-passenger-traffic-take-a-nosedive-during-pandemic-at-coimbatore-airport/articleshow/84049575.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal: 31% to 3% slide in positivity in 2 months||KOLKATA: The massive second surge of Covid, that claimed many lives across the state, is on the wane in Bengal with positivity rate plunging below 3%. It had climbed up to 31% in May when the second wave was at its peak. Health experts said the fall in the rate is a positive sign but the state and its citizens still need to keep the guard up to prevent a resurge. The positivity rate went down to 2.7% on Wednesday when the state reported 1,478 fresh cases. This is the lowest ever positivity rate Bengal has achieved in about a year. “To be in a safe zone, we should strive for positivity to slide below 5%. Now, it is below 3% which is an extremely encouraging sign,” said senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee, who is also a member in Bengal’s Global Advisory Board for Covid-19 response. Positivity rate started climbing from April hitting the two-digit figure. With number of cases spiking steadily, the infection rate had swelled to 31% on May 1, the highest recorded during the entire pandemic. It kept swaying between 20% and 30% till the third week of May before it started declining and fell below 3% in just about a month’s time. “The positivity in our lab between April and May had surged to 40% and above on a good number of days. But now it is just about 3%. Unlike the first wave, the surge to the peak this time was sharp and quick as also the decline to plateau was also rapid,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. While the highest fresh cases the state had recorded during the first wave was 4,157, reported on October 22, the second wave saw the number shooting up to 20,846 on May 11. The positivity rate on that day was 29%. “The infection rate is finally settling down below 3%. But we need to hasten and widen our vaccination coverage so that we can prevent another wave of this magnitude,” said ID Hospital Beliaghata infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray. But health experts warn Kolkatans to keep the guard up and not live in a sense of false security as the virus could strike back any time. “It is good to see that test positivity rate is slowly going down in the state. But we need to check regularly whether this positivity rate remains same or declines in all the districts, otherwise this can lead to false sense of satisfaction. At the same time, symptomatic patients should not delay Covid testing. If these parameters are taken care of, we can conclude that second wave is in declining phase,” said public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan Anirban Dalui. Mukherjee said the state needed to keep a close watch on the 200-plus mirco-containment zones and also have a zone-wise break-up on positivity rate for better monitoring. “Even as Delta plus variant found in some state is a concern I believe the third wave will not be as ferocious as the second wave due to the vaccination drive,” said Chaudhuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/31-to-3-slide-in-vity-in-2-months/articleshow/84047656.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The teacher, who has co-authored the primary English textbook for Class I, says he comes from a family of teachers. “I am the eighth teacher in my family. With three aunts, a few cousins and brothers-in-law being teachers, doing my BEd and preparing for the teachers’ eligibility test was almost a natural progression after my bachelors in English.” A postgraduate in English, Dhayananth says what makes his job more passionate for him is the students’ eagerness to welcome him to the classroom. “They wait for me to enter the classroom with a smile and it not only makes me happy but also motivates me to keep making learning more fun and interesting for them.” When he first got his posting in 2012, Dhayananth conducted a simple test for his students from Classes VI to X. “That was when I realized that many students couldn’t even spell their name correctly or know the alphabets properly. So, I wanted to strengthen their foundation, gain their trust and I didn’t want English to be their scariest subject anymore. I also wanted to engage the usually distracted children.” The middle school teacher then embarked on his journey of using interactive platforms like videos to get even the usually quiet, irregular and distracted students to actively participate in class. “I realized that some students participate and understand from videos better, because it piques their interest. So, I started learning animation, illustration and video making through YouTube and making videos for them topic wise,” he says. “I made videos for grammar lessons first followed by those for other topics for classes VI to X. I also co-authored the Class I primary textbook with QR codes, which students can scan to see pop-ups and videos.” It was these initiatives that gained him recognition with the directorate of school education, the state education ministry and finally the national education ministry. Dhayananth says, “My aim will be to keep trying to make my students eagerly wait to learn the next topic and not think of “portions”. I want to keep making my videos more fun, easy to understand and interesting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-teacher-makes-studies-interactive-and-animated-wins-national-award/articleshow/84049581.cms||---

Established on May 1, 1994, with an aim to help backward regions from the state to overcome their developmental backlog, the term of the statutory body had expired on April 30 last year. The appointment of member secretary has stoked a debate with stakeholders offering mixed views. Dr Ashok Belkhode, expert member (health) of the recently dissolved Marathwada Development Board, said the key body had become the victim of political war. “It appears that the continuous cold-war between Maharashtra governor and MVA government over different issues has been causing a delay in the necessary revival of Marathwada Development Board. Marathwada, which is lagging on different fronts including health and education, is at the receiving end of such a conflict,” he said. ‘  Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar during the budget session of the State Legislature had said the government would extend the development board on the day the governor officially approves the appointment of 12 members of the Legislative Council. The appointments concern are also pending. BJP spokesperson Shirish Boralkar said the appointment of member secretary on expired Marathwada Development Board was another classic example of alleged mismanagement on the part of the state government. Refuting such allegations, Congress spokesperson Jitendra Dehade, “The post of member secretary was vacant, which is now filled by the government before giving official extension to Marathwada Development Board,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/awaiting-extension-marathwada-development-board-gets-member-secy/articleshow/84043204.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Coimbatore||Nilgiris prepares to fight third Covid wave||UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Nilgiris district administration has launched measures to tackle the predicted third Covid-19 wave. The administration is holding back the existing 19 Covid care centres, said Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya. “We are holding Covid care centres back as a precautionary measure. Periodical fumigation is done to keep them ready. Also, 1,000 more beds are being set up in six new Covid care centres across the district.” Currently, the district has 2,474 beds, including 500 in government hospitals. As part of the measure, the collector has written to the government seeking appointment of physicians and specialists, especially pediatricians in vacant posts and additional posts in government hospitals. “It was widely reported that the third wave could affect children more,” said Divya. The five government hospitals in the district are being installed with oxygen generators so that the district becomes self-sufficient in oxygen supply. “With a capacity of 500litre/minute, an oxygen generation unit started functioning a few days ago at the old premises of the Ooty Government Medical College and Hospital,” said Divya. Likewise, the facility is being provided to government hospitals in Kotagiri, Coonoor, Gudalur and Pandalur. While Kotagiri and Coonoor GHs will have units having 500 litre/minute capacity, Gudalur and Pandalur GH will generate 250 litres of oxygen per minute. While the oxygen unit in Ooty GH is government-funded, those at other GHs are sponsored by private donors. “Thus, we will be a self-sufficient district when it comes to oxygen supply,” said Divya. “Vaccination is the best shield. But the main objective is scaling up vaccination efforts, which could play an important role in mitigating the virus and the future wave.” Health minister Ma.Subramanian, who visited Ooty on June 6, had promised to give priority to small districts such as the Nilgiris to complete vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/nilgiris-prepares-to-fight-3rd-covid-wave/articleshow/84049647.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Teachers adopt children who lost their dad to Covid||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The teachers of Cotton Hill, Government LP School have set an exemplary model with their kind gesture of adopting a family of four girl children who lost their father due to Covid-19. The LP school has decided to adopt four students, studying in Classes III, VI, VIII, and X, along with their ailing mother. In connection with the initiative, ‘Koodeondu Cotton Hill’, 27 permanent teachers with their headmaster K Buhari jointly worked to bring new life to a family who lost their sole breadwinner. A few months ago, Aneesha, a Class III student of the school, and her siblings had lost their father, an autorickshaw driver, to Covid-19. Their mother was already a patient. Considering their plight, the school teachers decided to extend a helping hand to the family by providing them with food and other essentials. After visiting the family, headmaster Buhari was moved by the helplessness and struggle of the children and their mother. Later, when he discussed the matter with the other teachers and PTA, they readily accepted to adopt the family. “They actually live in extreme poverty after their father's death. As all children study in a government school, they need not spend much on their education. But, after all, they need to survive. Their mother does not have the health to work. In that case, we thought of adopting the family”, said Buhari. Currently, the school plans to provide food and other essentials worth Rs 5,000 every month. According to school authorities, the family can purchase essential commodities, including vegetables and provisions, from a store of their preference and the school will pay the amount for the same. The school will also provide study materials for the students. “It is not at all a burden for us to look after a family. We just need to contribute a small share of our salary for the purpose,” Buhari said. Also, the school teachers are planning to construct a house for this homeless family. After their father’s death, Aneesha’s family moved to her maternal uncle’s home at Kattakada. Dileep, a daily wage labourer, was so kind to accommodate his sister and her four children in his small rented house where, Dileep, along with his wife and two children were residing. Now, the school hopes that any kind-hearted soul would give away a small portion of land to build a house for the family. “They don’t own a property, but if someone could donate a plot of land, we can arrange the fund and within six months we can complete the construction of the house,” said Buhari. The decision to adopt the family will be announced on Friday, in an event, organized as part of ‘Koodeondu Cotton Hill’. Besides adopting the family, the school also ensures to provide smartphones to 60 students in the event. Out of 60 phones, 25 were bought by the teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/teachers-adopt-children-who-lost-their-dad-to-covid/articleshow/84047669.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bengal: Daily vaccination count dips from 3 lakh to 1.1 lakh in 1 week||KOLKATA: The vaccination drive across Bengal slumped on Thursday with the number of doses administered climbing down to around 1.1 lakh. In Kolkata, the number remained low at just about 18,000 jabs. Health officials said that it was largely due to many KMC clinics not operating in addition to many private hospitals deferring their off-site camps. “We are hoping for the drive to pick up pace once again from Friday and then further from Monday,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. The previous week, the state had administered 3 lakh and above doses daily on five consecutive days. The number started dipping once the SOP for private hospitals on conducting off-site camps was introduced. “While the drive at our three hospital CVCs and the three off-site camps — at two malls and Eastern Diagnostic — is going on full swing, the overall number of doses we have been administering has come down. But our team is working on the necessary approval for a few off-site camps. By next week we should be bouncing back,” said AMRI Hospitals group CEO Rupak Barua. On weekdays, about 300 private CVCs would operate in Kolkata on any given number of days. On Thursday, only 179 CVCs operated in the city, of which 85 was by private hospitals. Across the state, only 1,062 sites operated, more than half of the usual number. “In the hospital CVC, however, there is an increasing number of recipients coming to take the shot. From 200-plus doses on June 14, we administered 500-plus doses on Thursday,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. Suspension of vaccination at off-site centres has hit senior citizens and those with physical disabilities the hardest. Many are unable to book slots on Co-Win while others are unable to travel long distances to get their first or second doses. All KMC-run vaccination clinics and mega vaccination centres (community halls) remained shut on Thursday. A civic official said there was a possibility of resuming vaccination drives at the civic clinics but only the recipients of Covishield second doses would be entertained. “My grandfather, who is 72, is due for his second dose on July 4 but there is hardly any centre administering the vaccine now. We will have to take him to one of the private hospitals but even there slots are booked,” said Anukul Saraf, a resident of Bangur. The crisis started from Tuesday when the supply of vaccines to the KMC vaccination clinics dropped to an all-time low. The vaccine quota was drastically reduced for each vaccination centre from 300 to 50 only. Apart from 150 KMC vaccination clinics located across 144 wards, the civic body is running 50 mega vaccination centres primarily meant for the super spreaders. “Now, the vaccine supply is so poor that we are struggling to reach the 10,000-mark,” a KMC health department official said. Fortis Hospital and Rotary Club of Inner City vaccinated more than 150 underprivileged recipients on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/daily-vax-count-dips-from-3l-to-1-1l-in-1-week/articleshow/84047664.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Mumbai police have asked the BMC to seal the Charkop-based Shivam Hospital, allegedly at the centre of the scam. Rajesh Pandey, a former employee of Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, was tracked down to Baramati. Pandey is accused in five of the 11 FIRs. He would allegedly falsely say he was organising vaccination drives through the Ambani hospital. The management terminated his service after the scam came to light and clarified he was never involved in their vaccination programme. “Pandey kept changing locations after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected on June 22. He was in Pune before he moved to Baramati,” said an officer. A Shivam Hospital administrator, Rahul Dube, was the second to be arrested on Thursday. Dube was allegedly involved in refilling empty vials with saline water and storing them in the hospital fridge, officials said. Police said Neeta Pataria, who ran Shivam Hospital, played a key role. “Meetings were held between Neeta, another key accused, Dr Manish Tripathi, and the mastermind, Mahendra Singh, at a resort in Malad where they discussed which establishments to target for carrying out bogus camps,” said an IPS officer. Police have also learnt that nine “certificates” were issued on Shivam Hospital’s letterhead to vaccine beneficiaries in early April as valid certificates would not get generated via the CoWin platform. The hospital had permission to function as a private Covid vaccination centre (PCVC) at that time. “We have found a diary page which has names of people whose certificates did not get generated via CoWin even back then. We will attempt to reach out to all these people,” said an officer. A Shivam Hospital director has been booked in the latest FIR lodged at MIDC police station on Thursday where Dr Tripathi and his students are co-accused. The complaint was filed by Inter Gold (India) Pvt Ltd, which is located in Andheri (East). On four different dates in April and May, 1,055 employees of the company were given shots by the accused and Rs 2.6 lakh was charged as advance, the balance was pending. In terms of the number of people given fake doses, this is the largest camp unearthed so far. More than a thousand employees did not receive vaccine certificates even a month and a half after being given the shots. The BMC was not informed about this camp which is a requirement as per guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-more-held-in-vax-scam-11th-fir-filed-for-jabs-to-andheri-firms-1k-employees/articleshow/84047659.cms||Nitasha Natu

This is the Phase III trial of fourth Covid vaccine the city is taking part in and the first time a state-run institute is being part of a Covid vaccine trial. “Novovax is the parent vaccine developed in the US and Covovax is its Indian counterpart, which contains the same vaccine but packaged into a finished product in India. Novovax has duly completed phase III clinical trials abroad and 90.4% efficacy is reported. Covovax, being its replica, is very likely to be showing similar efficacy,” said principal investigator Santanu Kumar Tripathi. The trial will have clinical pharmacologists Chiranjib Bagchi, Sumalya Sen, Sambho Samrat Samajdar and STM department of clinical pharmacology head Santanu Munshi as co-investigators. The trial kicked off with seven volunteers on Thursday and will involve 100 participants to determine whether the vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India provides the same immune response as Novavax. “We urge people to take part in the trial and contribute to development of Covovax,” added Tripathi. Unlike other placebo-controlled trial, volunteers at STM will receive the actual vaccine, two doses of either Novavax or Covovax, three weeks apart. Volunteers can’t take any other Covid vaccine while he or she is a part of this study for the next six months. Besides the two visits for the doses, a participant must come four times in the next six months. During each visit, 3-13ml blood will be collected to test the presence of antibodies. A general health check-up of the vitals shall be undertaken. Currently, along with Covovax, ZyCov-D, another vaccine for children between 12 and 18 years, is undergoing Phase III trial at the Institute of Child Health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ph-iii-trial-of-4th-vax-under-way/articleshow/84047663.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The marriage, which took place a year ago, came light only recently after the all women police station police, Manapparai, got a complaint from the Manapparai Taluk district social welfare office (DSWO). DSWO extension officer M Kannammal said the parents of a 16-year-old (age when the marriage took place) girl in Vaiyampatti forced their minor daughter to marry Dinesh Kumar, 26, from Nariyampatti. His parents were also accused of supporting the marriage. Kannammal said the girl was the eldest of two daughters to her parents. “After completing her Class 10, her parents decided to put an end to her education after Dinesh expressed his willingness to marry her, against her will. The marriage was also solemnised. The girl decided not to continue with the marriage and returned to her maternal house. Yet, the mother of the girl forced the girl to reunite with her husband.” As she was unable to handle the pressure from her mother, she dialled Childline helpline 1098 and sought their help. Acting on information from Sevai Child Line, Kannammal enquired with the girl and rescued her on June 14. The girl is at a home as per the orders of the CWC. “She is determined to continue with her education,” said Kannammal. Acting on the complaint from Kannammal, AWPS Manapparai inspector Manamalli booked the husband and four others a couple of days back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/five-booked-for-child-marriage/articleshow/84049666.cms||---

During the land survey, they found the unit management had also encroached one acre of poramboke land, which the latter have promised to return to the government. A Radhakrishnan, who moved the HC against the unit, told TOI that the management of Arthanari loom unit had encroached Kuruvipanai lake land to construct boilers and other machineries. He had petitioned the court on January 7, 2019. The high court had subsequently directed the district administration to evict the encroachment at the earliest. When the administration failed to obey the court order, Radhakrishnan approached the high court again in January 2021, seeking direction to the revenue department to evict the encroachment. On June 17, the court ordered the revenue officials to inspect and remove the encroachments at the earliest. The revenue officials visited the spot along with the petitioner on Thursday and surveyed both the lake and powerloom unit areas. “The officials confirmed that the unit has encroached 7.5 cents of the lake land. They have earmarked the encroached areas for eviction,” Radhakrishnan said. A Alagarasan, managing director of the unit, said they had already demolished the structures on the encroached land based on the high court order.

---||Trichy||Plan to revive abandoned quarries in Trichy||TRICHY: Trichy corporaption has completed a study to revive and reuse three abandoned stone quarries and a public tank as common rainwater harvesting tanks. Besides improving the water management, the proposal will utilise Jal Jeevan Mission funds to convert the area around the quarries as recreational zones with walking, skating and bicycle tracks. In a recent survey covering the Periyamilagupaarai locality, the civic body identified the Ponnagar quarry, Kalludaikkum Paarai quarry and an unnamed quarry behind the TNSTC regional office on Collector office road which were abandoned several years ago. Since the quarries cannot help in recharging the groundwater table due to rocky bottom, a team of 10 architects was roped in by the corporation to study and prepare a proposal to convert them for better use. The architects suggested that the quarries be used as common rainwater harvesting (RWH) tanks to store rainwater that usually inundates the roads, residential properties and government offices. A proposal to install overhead water tanks was mooted to filter the rainwater and supply households in slum pockets for non-potable purpose during the summer. “The catchment area of the quarries will be streamlined. Even sewage treatment plant can be installed to retreat the wastewater and fill the quarries. This will save the cost of pumping the wastewater to the far placed treatment plant,” S Vijaykumar, a senior architect said. Utilising the rainwater harvested from the TNSTC office and KAPV college campus, a swimming pool was proposed in the abandoned quarry in Periyamilagupaarai. The vicinity will have amphitheatres and greenery. Similarly, the Kollankulam tank in E Pudur encroached by residential and commercial properties in the past 20 years is proposed to be redeveloped along with the abandoned quarries. In a portion of 48 acres tank that has no ayacut, Miyawaki forest is to be grown while the bunds will serve as walking and bicycle tracks. “Feasibility study is complete, the cost estimate preparation is underway. Municipal administration minister has suggested relocating the settlements in the tank banks to an alternative site,” S Sivasubramanian, commissioner, corporation told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plan-to-revive-abandoned-quarries-in-trichy/articleshow/84049686.cms||Deepak Karthik

The police identified the accused as Mahesh of Edava near Varkala. The police said that the incident related to the case took place on Thiruvambadi Beach Road on Wednesday evening. The group of three women — a UK citizen, a French citizen and the Mumbai resident — were walking along the road when the accused who came riding a motorcycle tried to harass the Mumbai resident. When she resisted, he verbally abused her. One of the women managed to click an image of the accused and his motorcycle on her phone during the melee. This image was handed over to the police along with the complaint, which helped the cops identify, trace and take the accused into custody within hours. Varkala police station house officer inspector S Dwijesh said that the main complainant in the case was the Mumbai resident, who had been staying at Varkala for the past two months. The complaint was received on Thursday afternoon. Incidentally, this is the second consecutive day these women were facing harassment. The UK resident in the group had faced an atrocity on the beach on Tuesday night. According to her, a man showed lewd gestures at her as she was taking a stroll along the beach. “We have registered a separate complaint in that case and a search is on to arrest the accused,” the inspector said. The UK resident had been here for one year. She was staying at a homestay at Varkala. The two other women joined her two months ago. The accused was slapped with Section 354 of IPC that pertains to outraging the modesty of women. He will be produced before the court on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/one-held-for-harassing-women-tourists/articleshow/84047720.cms||---

But, the south units were jolted into action only after the DGGI served a notice. The NTPC, otherwise, reverses the ITC regularly. C Elbert, DGM (corporate communication), NTPC, said: “All the GST returns are filed well within the timelines. Since January 2021 when the auto-populate system computed ITC has started, GST on the purchases made by the NTPC got accumulated.” However, the same was not used for making GST payments, except the eligible ITC towards business support services. “The NTPC reversed the accumulated ITC and the same was communicated to the GST authorities,” Elbert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ntpc-returns-rs-350-cr-input-tax-credit-after-gst-notice/articleshow/84051754.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Staff shortage for Covid bandobast, upcoming festivals like Eid, Ganeshotsav, Navratri and bandobast for civic polls are reasons for the decision. The police department has received applications for transfer from 2,200 constables in eight months. Speaking of manpower shortage, a senior officer said that vacancies of 6,500 constables in the city are vacant as of today. “Transferring around 2,200 constables to other districts and getting their replacement is a big thing.

The facility set up at a cost of Rs 3.52 lakh was established based on the suggestions put forward during a recent fire safety audit. HR&CE officials said that three locations were chosen for establishing high-power hydrants including near sanctum sanctorum, Dhanvantri shrine and near Karthikai gopuram. With Chandrapushkarni temple tank as the common water source, the three hydrants were positioned to cover both narrow spots and office space being used by HR&CE to maintain records. The hydrants can be connected by multiple reels (hose) each of which can cover 50 feet from the spot where the hydrant is installed. As high-power motors are installed in the hydrants, officials said that water can be discharged at a high pace, reaching up to 80 feet. “Chandrapushkarni tank will always brim with water throughout the year. The hydrant mechanism can be handled even by our temple workers to extinguish the fire immediately, not waiting for the fire service personnel to arrive. Trial runs held were successful,” S Marimuthu, joint commissioner, Srirangam temple, told TOI. HR&CE has utilised the temple fund to install the mechanism. The 25 acres (worship area) of the temple can be covered by the hydrant mechanism. Even the narrow entrances where fire-extinguishing vehicles cannot enter will be covered by the hydrants. Further, a team from the fire service department will inspect the working of the hydrants to offer suggestions for bettering the safety. In March 2020, a minor fire had broken out at the prasada stall near Garuda Mandapam. It was after the incident that the need for hydrants inside the temple was apprised by the fire service department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/srirangam-temple-gets-own-fire-system/articleshow/84049697.cms||Deepak Karthik

The virus has snatched away at least 65 doctors in Bengal during the second wave. On Thursday, while the nation celebrated Doctors’ Day, the medical fraternity was busy at the hospital wards taking care of patients. While the number of Covid patients has come down drastically, doctors continue to fight to save the lives of patients in critical condition. And those who are not treating Covid patients are back tending to the rising number of non-Covid patients. “The world came crushing down for us when my husband died in January. But life has to go on. My two children and I are proud of the way my husband served his patients. I hope his students and juniors will promise to carry forward his work as a tribute to his work,” said ophthalmologist Swati Ray Bandyopadhyay. Her husband Biswajit Bandyopadhyay, one of the pioneers at paediatric cardiology in eastern India, succumbed to Covid last January. The 52-year-old was attached with RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences and had worked till a day before the whole family was detected positive to the infection. Ray Bandopadhyay, who works with several charitable organizations, was busy seeing patients on Thursday. The Covid team at the state-run Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata Hospital was at the wards tending to patients, including 15 critical ones. Infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray managed to snatch a few hours to be at Swasthya Bhavan for lunch with senior health officials. Ray rushed back to the hospital. Till late evening, the team was busy trying to shift a 37-year-old patient to a hospital that has ECMO facility. “Even on ventilation, this patient’s oxygen saturation continues to be dangerously low. She is only 37 and we want to save her,” said Ray. “From 30 patients during the peak, it is now down to 16. But since condition of each of these patients is extremely critical they need meticulous monitoring. Our effort is to save each of them and we can celebrate only after that,” said Medica Superspecialty Hospital ECMO specialist Arpan Chakraborty. One of the 16 patients is a senior neurosurgeon from a government hospital. Bengal Obtretics and Gynaecological Society (BOGS) observed the day by donating blood where 25 doctors, including its president Bhaskar Pal donated blood. “It was our way of observing the day and paying tribute to doctor colleagues who we lost in the pandemic,” said gynaecologist Basab Mukherjee. While the first wave had claimed as many as 105 doctors in Bengal between March and December 2020, the number has come down to about 65 in 2021. “Covid has turned the world upside down for all of us. At least four doctors we lost to the pandemic were close to me. But then we cannot stop seeing patients,” said CMRI director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. The pulmonologist who has been treating Covid patients throughout the pandemic had got infected once. On Thursday he was busy with patients and academics. Some doctors which the city lost include 40-year-old Rashmi Khandelwal, 35-year-old Nitish Kumar and Yogesh Bhavishi (62). Many doctor organistaions observed the day as Covid Martyr Doctors’ Day, paying tribute to the doctors the fraternity lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-memoriam-on-drs-day-medics-recall-colleagues-who-died-in-combat/articleshow/84047716.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The protesters displayed banners highlighting their demands to conserve the studio lands from being taken for private development. Recently, the state government rejected KMC’s grade 3 heritage tag to the Shalini Cinestone land. A pledge to conserve the land of Shalini and Jayprabha studio was taken in the protest. Dhanaji Yamkar, the vice-president of ABMCM said, all the artists and others involved in the Kolhapur film industry have taken an oath to conserve the studio lands. Shalini and Jayprabha studio lands have historical significance and should be given heritage status so that they are conserved.  On Saturday evening, a candlelight protest for the same will be held at Bindu Chowk||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/abmcm-stages-silent-protest-to-conserve-shalini-and-jayprabha-studio-land/articleshow/84043271.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

People with comorbidities account for most casualties in the district. With 18 urban primary health centres and 50 rural primary health centres, each of the centres have around 250-300 persons with comorbidities visiting the health centres for monthly medicine and examination. Health officials said that the PHC staff were told to enquire and maintain a record exclusively verifying whether they have got vaccinated. “Although the cases have come down, our priority is to ensure that the vulnerable population is vaccinated. A set of patients, mostly senior citizens, approach the PHC for medicine every month. Our staff will check their vaccination status,” a senior health official in the district added. In the last five days, Trichy has reported 25 deaths and continues to be one of the top districts in reporting Covid-19 deaths. Most of the casualties as per the Covid-19 bulletin released were patients aged 60 years and above. Health officials have planned to keep a limited number of vials available for the 45+ age group with comorbidities to get the jab. While plans are afoot to cover the vulnerable age group, vaccine shortage is withholding the authorities from emphasising the focussed coverage. Officials blamed delayed admission to hospitals, only after the symptoms get worse, as a reason for the Covid-19 casualties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/phcs-to-check-vax-status-of-those-coming-for-monthly-check-up/articleshow/84049694.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Mumbai||Gulshan Kumar murder: Bombay HC says no leniency in the interest of justice & society||MUMBAI: Almost 24 years after three men gunned down T-Series founder Gulshan Kumar (inset) in the city, the Bombay high court on Thursday upheld the 2002 conviction of one assailant, Abdul Rauf Dawood Merchant, declared guilty a second gunman, Rauf’s brother Abdul Rashid, and upheld the acquittal of Ramesh Taurani, Kumar’s business rival. While Rauf’s life term was confirmed by the HC, Rashid, who had earlier been acquitted, got similar punishment. Kumar had reached his car after offering prayers at a temple in Andheri (W) on August 12, 1997, when a person rushed towards him at 3pm, placed a pistol on his back and pumped bullets into him. When Kumar turned around, he got bullets in his chest. Two other shooters then emerged from behind a stall and an auto and opened fire. An eyewitness, who testified to this, identified the brothers, and his testimony was not shattered, the HC said. The witness, however, also said the first shooter, who fled the scene, was not in court during trial. He is an absconding accused. “It was indeed a coldblooded murder,’’ the HC bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and N R Borkar said, adding, “It was also not a case of a sole eyewitness.” There were five, including a resident nearby, a rickshaw driver and Kumar’s driver of 14 years. Each emphasized the role of the brothers as the attackers, the bench said. The assailants escaped towards Versova Link Road in a taxi they took at gunpoint. Abdul Rauf had “no personal animosity or grudge” against Kumar, said the HC judgment. “He had committed the ghastly act as he was hired by Nadeem Saifee and Abu Salem who wanted to satisfy their personal vendetta against the deceased,” the HC added as the reason for upholding Rauf’s conviction for criminal conspiracy too. Nadeem and Salem were absconding accused then and hence not tried, said the HC. The government’s efforts to extradite Nadeem from London failed. The HC said Abdul Rauf, who had absconded initially for almost three-and-a-half years before his arrest in January 2001 and (keeping in mind) later his non-surrender for seven years following a two-week release on furlough in 2009, does not deserve any remission. “In the interest of justice and society at large, the appellant does not deserve any leniency,” the HC said. The police said it was a case of business rivalry. There were 19 accused. Charges against two were dropped pending trial. Five years later, the Mumbai sessions court held only Abdul Rauf guilty, acquitting the remaining 16, including Taurani, owner of Tips Cassettes, and Abdul Rashid. Abdul Rauf was also convicted for attempt to murder for firing at Kumar’s driver that day. The HC said it was a case of “direct” and “sterling evidence” from eyewitnesses. The trial court held that “shots were fired by accused No. 19 (Abdul Rauf) and absconding accused”. The HC said the prosecution, represented by additional public prosecutors Madhavi Mhatre and Prajakta Shinde, proved that Rauf murdered Kumar and fired at his driver. It said there was evidence to show Rauf “was in Dubai when the conspiracy was hatched” and executed it with his brother and the third shooter, who is allegedly absconding. A pistol was recovered from Abdul Rashid and two from the brother-duo’s mother, who was also an accused. She was acquitted. Bullets recovered by police tallied with the pistols, the court said. Abdul Rauf’s counsel Satish Maneshinde, who had highlighted lacuna in the police probe and delay to nail him as a footsoldier, told TOI, “Both judgments, against Abdul Rauf and Abdul Rashid, will be challenged before the Supreme Court.” The state’s appeal had said Taurani hatched the conspiracy with Nadeem and Salem to kill Kumar. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda and advocate Apoorva Singh denied it. The HC held, “In the present case, there are serious lapses in the investigation and there is no cogent and convincing evidence to hold that (Taurani) had spoken to Abu Salem in Dubai.” The only witness who deposed against Taurani was “also present” when Taurani allegedly called Salem from Juhu. The HC added there was no probe to verify if the phone was Salem’s, who at that time was an “absconding accused since 1993 serial bomb blasts”. A plea to make the witness an accused was rejected by the trial court. “In view of this, the acquittal of the respondent No. 1 (Taurani) calls for no interference,” the HC held. But, for Abdul Rashid, it said there was “cogent evidence” in the form of eyewitnesses and ballistics. “Unwarranted acquittals would not only give wrong signal to society but would pose a threat to law and order,” the HC said, adding hence he deserved to be convicted as his “role cannot be segregated from the role of Abdul Rauf…since both had shot” at Kumar. The HC ordered that “Abdul Rashid Merchant shall surrender forthwith before sessions court or before D N Nagar police station... He shall then surrender his passport to the police”. The HC also asked the state what precautions it intended to do take given the “connections” of the convict with Gulf countries and that a “forged passport” was recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gulshan-kumar-murder-hc-gives-killer-bros-life-upholds-taurani-acquittal/articleshow/84051713.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Chennai||MPhil programme will continue in all state universities: Tamil Nadu government||CHENNAI: Following a controversy over scrapping of MPhil degree by Madras University, the Tamil Nadu government on Thursday announced that all state universities will offer MPhil degree programme for 2021-22. “Madras University has recently discontinued MPhil programme. Though there are two opinions about the course, we have decided to continue the MPhil course in all universities,” higher education minister K Ponmudi told reporters after a meeting of vice-chancellors of state universities in Chennai on Thursday. Madras University discontinued it citing poor enrolment. Officials said the pre-research degree lost its sheen after the University Grants Commission (UGC) made PhD, NET and SLET minimum qualification for faculty members in colleges and universities. However, a section of academics said the abolition of M Phil degree was part of National Education Policy 2020 and the university was implementing NEP though the state government was yet to accept it. Before Madras University, Madurai Kamaraj University also discontinued the course following the UGC’s direction. Further, the minister said all state universities would begin UG admissions on August 1 based on Class XII marks, as announced earlier. “We have directed the state universities to announce exam results before conducting admissions,” he said. He further said the online engineering counselling would be conducted by the Directorate of Technical Education (DOTE) this year as well. “All state universities should follow uniform procedures for appointment of professors, controllers of examination and registrars. They are asked to ensure transparency in the recruitment process,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-mphil-programme-will-continue-in-tn-univs/articleshow/84047774.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Dug up roads in Hyderabad become danger zones during rains||HYDERABAD: Inordinate delay in restoration of roads dug up for various works related to stormwater drains, laying sewer lines, telecom cables or water pipelines have turned them into potential danger zones for commuters as well as residents during rains. At many places, the road cuttings, potholes and improperly covered roads are not only causing traffic chaos but making them accident prone. “The road, which I usually take to commute for work has been cut to lay a cement road on one side and the other side has been left incomplete for several days now,” said Aarif Khan, who stays near Chacha Nehru Park at Masab Tank. “There is only a narrow gap on the thoroughfare and that is also a back breaking experience due to the gravel and other construction waste left unattended.” The road from Khaja mansion convention function hall to Garden Towers in Banjara Hills is another such example. It was dug up in the middle for water works a long time ago, and has been left unattended. “The pit is at least 8-feet deep and can prove to be dangerous during rains. There are children walking on this road on a regular basis,” said B Kaushik, a resident of Banjara Hills. Near Humayun Nagar, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has dug up a pit, which is a potential danger zone for commuters as well as residents. A similar pit has been dug up by GHMC at Ahmednagar. A small board on the barricade erected around the dug-up road reads, “Inconvenience caused is regretted”. At Chital Basthi, the road that leads to Khairtabad, Banjara Hills near Sarvi restaurant and Road Number 10, the pits dug up for repairs are now becoming water logging points causing severe inconvenience to citizens. Most places where the repairs are being delayed were subjected to flooding during the heavy rains last year. The GHMC has banned road cuttings from June 1 to October 31, including those that come under the comprehensive road maintenance programme. Agencies undertaking cabling work, laying gas and water pipelines were told to restore the pits and road cuttings owing to the onset of monsoon. Citing example Kavadiguda and Bholakpur, where roads have been dug up, officials said they have given permissions to water works department and Transco for emergency works. “In Bholakpur, the water works department is taking up work to lay a water pipeline. We have given permission only because residents in that area were getting contaminated water and there were chances of them falling sick,” said M Devanand, chief engineer (maintenance), GHMC. “Otherwise, all government and private agencies including Transco, HMWSSB and BGL have been told to restore roads soon. The ban came into effect on June 1, but there are certain pending works. We will certainly take action against them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dug-up-roads-in-city-become-danger-zones-during-rains/articleshow/84051776.cms||Moulika.KV

The court dismissed the petition saying it was absolutely vague as to what sort of education he wants to give the people of Tamil Nadu.The division bench of Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice S Ananthi observed that the petitioner’s submission (regarding ‘ondriyam’) was directed at chief minister M K Stalin and the council of ministers regarding the manner in which they address the Centre while speaking in the assembly. The court observed that the prayer sought for was thoroughly misconceived and no such direction could be issued to the CM or the council of ministers to speak in a particular fashion.The DMK government had been referring to the Centre as “ondriya arasu” in its communications days after assuming charge. The party said that India being a Union of states according to the Constitution, ondriya arasu was the apt Tamil translation for “Union government”. The BJP had taken exception to the reference saying it showed the government’s confrontational approach towards the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-against-state-using-ondriyam-to-address-central-govt/articleshow/84049742.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Pawar was speaking at the virtual inauguration ceremony of D Y Patil Agriculture and Technical University set up at Talsande in Kolhapur. “There is opposition to GM crops. Protests against GM foods in America and Europe are taken out. But America and Brazil have become major exporters of oil, sugar and wheat. This happened due to increased production through GM crops,” he said. “On one hand, the western countries oppose introducing GM crops in developing countries and on the other hand, they grow GM crops to make commercial gains. We need to think of using all such methods to grow productivity in agriculture and need to support scientists,” said Pawar The state legislature had approved to set up the first private agricultural university of the state. At present, agriculture education and research are done through four universities run by the government. He said when he took charge as agriculture minister in the Centre during 2004, the stock of grains left with the government was adequate for just three days and he had to hesitatingly decide to import grains. “When I resigned the office 10 years later, India was among first three countries in terms of production of grains, fruits, milk and vegetables. We need to emphasise on bringing the use of every drop of rainwater as still 60% of our agriculture is rain-fed. Also, we need to increase the quality of the soil. The research needs to be done in this aspect,” he said. Pawar suggested that the D Y Patil Agriculture and Technical University needs to tie up with international universities for knowledge sharing and exposure to the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sharad-pawar-backs-gm-crops/articleshow/84043303.cms||---

The foundation stone for the proposed project is likely to be laid in the next six months, prior to the assembly elections. “After the greenfield international airport at Mopa, this is another big project that has been approved for Pernem taluka. The first meeting on the project was held on Wednesday,” tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar told TOI on Thursday. Ajgaonkar said that while the required land is currently in possession of the revenue department, formalities to transfer it to GTDC will be done shortly. It will be built on public-private partnership (PPP) mode, but all required permission will be facilitated through GTDC. “The cost estimation of the project is yet to be done, but they want to start at the earliest. Completion of the formalities pertaining to transfer of land, and then selecting a suitable bidder will take some time,” he said. The entertainment village, Ajgaonkar said, will have facilities to conduct small and medium-scale entertainment events. They have not decided whether it will be a suitable venue for any electronic dance music (EDM) festival that may take place in the future. “The place will be a hit as the project is coming within proximity of the international airport,” he said. During the tourist season, music and food fests, or other such events are mostly held in Calangute-Candolim, or in Panaji. A tourism stakeholder said it is a good plan to have a designated entertainment venue in Mandrem as it is frequented by tourists. “Although ours is an international tourist destination, we don’t have a designated venue for music or entertainment events. It is high time that we have one,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-entertainment-village-mandrem-set-to-get-biggest-tourism-project/articleshow/84049814.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Incumbent panel to retain power in Krishna sugar mill||KOLHAPUR: Despite a three-way contest, the incumbent panel, led by chairman Suresh Bhosale, is likely to retain power in the Karad-based Yashwantrao Mohite Krishna Cooperative sugar factory. The “Krishna” factory is the largest cooperative sugar mill in the region and has a presence in five tehsils of Satara and Sangli districts. It has over 47,000 farmers as voters. Political heavyweights from both the districts had distanced themselves from the election. Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan and current Cabinet ministers Jayant Patil and Balasaheb Patil had stayed away from participating in the election process primarily because their own supporters were divided over which panel to support. Chavan, in the early stage of the poll, had tried to bring the two opposition panels — one led by Avinash Mohite and another by Indrajit Mohite — together. However, they could not agree on seat sharing and,therefore, decided to contest as separate panels. Minister of state Vishwajeet Kadam had openly campaigned for the Rayat panel led by Indrajit Mohite. His efforts, were futile. Around 91% of the voters had cast their votes. In previous five-yearly election, the turnout was 79%. The increased turnout was due to fierce campaigning. The panel led by Bhosale comfortably won. By Thursday evening, the panel was comfortably ahead on all of the 21 seats. Sitting chairman Suresh Bhosale was leading by over 10,000 votes. Shantaram Patil, a political observer from Islampur in Sangli district, said, “The distancing of the senior political functionaries is one of the reasons for the incumbent panel to retain power. Otherwise, the voters usually turn the tide against the incumbent panel every five years. This has been happening for the past couple of decades. The other reason for Bhosale’s panel retaining power is the help extended to the farmers during Covid, mainly by providing the highest price for sugar cane.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/incumbent-panel-to-retain-power-in-krishna-sugar-mill/articleshow/84043291.cms||---

However, many students of civic schools do not have access to mobile phones and other devices, which may prove to be a major roadblock in utilising this platform on a large scale. North and East Delhi Municipal Corporations have already initiated Google Meet classes and officials from the south corporation say that they, too, will launch classes on the platform soon. Since last year, the corporations have been using WhatsApp groups to send worksheets to the students. Data from the east corporation, which was the first civic body to switch to Google Meet classes recently, shows that out of over 1.5 lakh children in its 366 municipal primary schools, around 30,000 have joined the platform. About 80,000 students are connected through WhatsApp groups and 26,204 others who don’t have access to either of these platforms are using printed material distributed from schools. The north corporation started Google Meet classes from July 1. A senior north corporation education department official says that out of 2.3 lakh enrolled students, 40% students are connected through Google Meet and if WhatsApp groups are also taken into account, the attendance would be around 70-75%. Teacher unions, meanwhile, paint a different ground situation. Ramniwas Solanki, who heads Nagar Nigam Shikshak Sangh, said that hardly any student used the video mode due to accessibility issues. “Should we be discriminating between students? One child will get video classes, another will use WhatsApp, and the third one whose parents go for daily labour will have access to none,” he said. Solanki said that no training session was held before ordering the online video classes. The unions also claim that no support has been provided to teachers to start these classes in terms of devices and access to internet. “North corporation primary school teachers have not been paid for three months. How do they expect teachers to bear these additional costs,” Solanki wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lack-of-devices-hurdle-in-corpns-plan-to-start-online-classes/articleshow/84049778.cms||Paras Singh

A third-party agency recognised by the food safety and standards authority of India (FSSAI) accompanied the officials for rating the food preparation in the temple kitchens under the Union government’s ‘Blissful hygienic offering to God’ (Bhog) certification scheme. The officials inspected the kitchens of Rockfort Thayumanaswami temple, Ranganathaswami temple in Srirangam and Jambukeswarar temple in Thiruvanaikoil. The official team expressed satisfaction in the food preparation practice. Each of the temples was given 10-15 suggestions to further improve the food preparation and to ensure hygiene inside the kitchen space. “We have suggested temples to mention the date of packaging in the prasadam offered to devotees. Glass containers were insisted to be placed in the prasadam stalls,” Dr R Ramesh Babu, district food safety officer said. The temple management was given 15 days period to implement the suggestions. Photographs were taken by the officials as evidence, which will be compared with the situation after 15 days during a similar survey in the temples. There will be a total of 120 marks awarded under the Bhog survey based on the inference through field visits. Temples securing more than 100 marks will get 5-star rating while temples securing 90-100 marks and 80-90 marks will get 4 star and 3 star ratings respectively. Certificates will be provided by the Centre in a month or two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/temple-kitchens-inspected-by-fssai-for-bhog-certification/articleshow/84049700.cms||---

It will wait for a police report on what was administered before taking a decision, said an official. The civic body has asked the 390 residents for details like whether those who did not receive vaccination certificates have gone ahead and taken the vaccine again or conducted an antibody test. The BMC is yet to receive any complaints from residents about side effects after the suspicious drive on May 30. A resident said around 140 of the 390 residents got certificates, while many of those who did not had gone ahead and taken the jab again. “It has been a month since the suspicious camp was held. How long can people wait to take the vaccine after knowing that they have possibly been a part of a camp that was not genuine?” said resident Dinesh Zala. Sanjay Kurhade, BMC assistant municipal commissioner, R south ward, said they are yet to decide on vaccination for those who were a part of the suspicious camp. “Our staff is continuously monitoring their health status and so far no one has shown any adverse reactions. We will wait for a report from the police on what was administered before deciding on vaccination to be administered to them again,” said Khurade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-month-after-fake-vax-drive-municipal-body-yet-to-decide-on-re-vaccination/articleshow/84049893.cms||Richa Pinto

Speaking to reporters after a meeting on kharif season, Pawar said, “Awankhed has set an example for the entire state. We hope other villages would also do their best on the cleanliness front.” About the kharif season, Pawar said only 14% sowing of kharif crops was achieved so far this year as against 64% last year.  “This year there is no rain due to which sowing is lagging behind. The farmers have been rightfully advised by the agriculture department to wait till good rainfall is recorded as there were chances that farmers would have to undertake sowing again,” he said. The deputy chief minister added the agriculture department, under the guidance of state agriculture minister Dada Bhuse, had planned timely delivery of seeds, fertilizers, and other things to the farmers right to their farms and hence farmers had nothing to worry about other than rain this year.  Attempt to show black flags A group of people claiming to be members of Maratha organisations tried to show black flags to Pawar at Ashok Stambh at 11 am, but they were detained by Sarkarwada police. “A group of people wanted to block the road for Pawar’s convoy to press for their demands for Maratha reservation. We, however, foiled their attempt and rounded them up.” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/awankhed-wins-cleanliness-prize-dy-cm-praises-village/articleshow/84043368.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Amitabh Bachchan’s ‘deewar’ to be razed to widen road||MUMBAI: Four years after receiving a BMC notice, actor Amitabh Bachchan’s family will finally have to part with a portion of their Prateeksha bungalow plot in Juhu for widening of the adjoining Sant Dnyaneshwar Marg. The BMC has asked Mumbai suburban collector Milind Borkar to instruct city survey officials to demarcate the exact portion required for the road-widening project, reports Chaitanya Marpakwar. BMC issued a notice to the Bachchans in 2017To eradicate the traffic bottlenecks in the lane leading from Prateeksha towards ISKCON temple, the BMC is taking over a portion of properties to widen Sant Dnyaneshwar Marg, which connects Chandan Cinema area to Link Road, from 45ft to 60ft. The work is almost done, but for the stretch in front of Prateeksha. In 2017, the Bachchans and the owners of the neighbouring plots on the stretch were asked to give a portion of their plots for the project; most adhered to the notice. In 2019, the BMC demolished the boundary wall of a building adjoining Prateeksha, but the superstar’s bungalow was left untouched. Congress corporator Tulip Miranda recently took up the issue with the K-West ward and claimed that the BMC was deliberately delaying the acquisition of the Bachchan property. “The adjacent properties have been acquired, but only this plot has been left untouched. By sending the issue to the city survey officials, the BMC is only buying time...If the acquisition is not done, we will file a complaint with the Lokayukta,” Miranda said. In a written reply to Miranda, K-West ward officials said the BMC would acquire the land as soon as the city survey office finalises the demarcation of the portion of the Prateeksha plot that is required. Civic officials said they had applied for getting the Prateeksha plot demarcated in December 2019 and also paid the fees. A joint measurement for the demarcation was held in February 2021. A senior official said city survey officials had pointed out some discrepancies in the maps, but all the details were submitted to their office to clarify the deviations. Bachchan did not respond to queries from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bachchans-deewar-to-be-razed-to-widen-road/articleshow/84051806.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The boy’s heart was successfully transplanted into a 29-year-old Sangli woman, wife of a farmer, suffering from end-stage heart disease at Sahyadri Hospital. “This was the year’s first heart transplant in Pune,” said Aarti Gokhale, coordinator at Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee. The donor had sustained grievous head injuries in a road accident and had been undergoing treatment at DY Patil Medical College and Hospital in Pimpri. He was declared brain dead last week and his family consented to donate his vital organs two days ago. The multiple organ donation and the subsequent transplant took place on Wednesday. Heart transplant surgeon at Sahyadri Hospital Manoj Durairaj said, “The recipient was suffering from a rare disease called restrictive cardiomyopathy from 2016 and her condition had been deteriorating rapidly over the last few months. The heart transplant was the only option for her. She is now stable and will be under observation for a few days before she returns home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wife-of-farmer-gains-a-gift-of-heart/articleshow/84049824.cms||Umesh Isalkar

He was speaking at the meeting of unorganised drivers of Madurai AIADMK west district wing on Thursday. Udhayakumar said DMK should keep its promise and give the Rs 10,000 subsidy for purchasing new autorickshaws to drivers and that they should also be given Covid relief of Rs 2,000. Former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami had met the people even during the last Covid crisis and people had wished he will become CM again. But, traitors using the AIADMK symbol worked against it leading to the party’s defeat, he said. These people would have to pay for their treachery, he added. He went on to add that they were not bothered if seven crore people spoke to V K Sasikala, but that the AIADMK symbol was safe in the hands of Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam. Secretary of the drivers wing Ramakrishnan presided over the meeting. Meanwhile, Thiruparankundram Anna trade union secretary and district councillor Lakshmi Rajan has put up posters hailing Sasikala in the area. She called Sasikala ‘tyagi’ who was coming to destroy the treachery. Lakshmi Rajan has said that only Sasikala can give a stable leadership in the party, as the current double leadership was causing a lot of confusion among cadres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aiadmk-lost-due-to-traitors-udhayakumar/articleshow/84049756.cms||---

Not likely||GANDHINAGAR: After the government announced withdrawal of lockdown violation cases against over 500 labourers, there was a buzz that it would do the same for over 1.75 lakh cases registered against citizens. However, key sources in the state government categorically stated that the government has no intention of withdrawing the remaining lockdown violation cases. Earlier, the government had withdrawn petty cases against common citizens registered during the Patidar, Dalit and other caste-based reservation stirs. Similarly, the government had withdrawn cases registered during the farmer’s stir as well. There were expectations that, similarly, cases registered during lockdown against senior citizens, women, and for petty things like walking one’s pet or strolling on the terrace will be withdrawn.  A key source close to the development said, “The government has received many representations from various groups to withdraw petty cases registered during lockdown against common citizens without criminal background. However, at the highest level, it has been decided not to withdraw any more cases as government is seeing the possibility of need for further lockdown if third wave of Covid-19 pandemic hits. Any move to withdraw lockdown violation cases will make people lower their guard against the pandemic. Cases against labourers were withdrawn on humanitarian grounds.” The Gujarat government announced on Thursday that it has decided to withdraw 515cases of lockdown violation against labourers who were migrating back to their native places during the lockdown. Minister of state for home, Pradipsinh Jadeja said that the state government could contain the first wave of the pandemic effectively because of the nationwide lockdown an the government has shown sensitivity by deciding to withdraw 515 cases against labourers who were booked for violating lockdown guidelines. Jadeja said that over 1,000 ‘shramik trains’ were operated from Gujarat and arrangements were made to ensure than about 24 lakh migrant workers could go back to their native places. He added that the public prosecutors have been given instructions to initiate the process of withdrawing cases that were filed against migrant workers for violating lockdown guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lockdown-cases-to-be-withdrawn-not-likely/articleshow/84047822.cms||Kapil Dave

Rao said the Union government’s Jal Jeevan, Rythu Bandhu and now Nagar Van are schemes inspired by Telangana government’s development programmes. After Rythu Bandhu, the Centre has come up with Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana, which is benefiting about 16 crore farmers, he said. Speaking at the launch of Amberpet Kalan Urban Forest Prak, the minister urged people to actively participate in Haritha Haram. “Haritha Haram is meant to increase the green cover in the state and not to derive any political mileage. I request all citizens to actively participate in the programme and ensure a safe environment for the future generations,” he said. Citing the report published by Forest Survey of India, Rao said the green cover in Telangana increased from 23% to 28% in the past few years. The target is to increase the green cover to 33%, he said. According to the forest department, so far, 220 crore saplings had been planted under Haritha Haram at a total cost of Rs 5,900 crore. “This year, the target is to plant 20 crore saplings and distribute six saplings to each household,” said forest minister Allola Indrakaran Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-t-schemes-going-national/articleshow/84051807.cms||---

District collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar, who flagged off the bus, said that the aim of the mobile service was to cover a large chunk of the floating population. The bus would be stationed at places where people gather in large numbers, like in bus stations, both in the city and rural areas. The vehicle would have a doctor and two nurses who would administer the vaccines. It will have the capacity to vaccinate 250 people per day. The collector asked Yi to cover street vendors in markets and other places in the first three days, for which the city health officer would provide the route map. After that, the vehicle would start moving towards the rural areas under the guidance of the deputy director of health services. Yi Madurai chapter chairwoman Poornima Venkatesh said they had realised that there were a lot of inhibitions about vaccination in the rural area. “Elderly people and even the general public were reluctant to travel to vaccination centres. So, we decided to take it to their doorsteps,” she said. Meanwhile, it was another day of vaccine non-availability in government hospitals and PHCs in Madurai, after the general public who went there were turned away. “The gatekeeper at the Elango Corporation Boy’s Higher Secondary School has asked me to come at 6am on Friday,” said Saranya, a young mother who failed to get a vaccine after trying for the past five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mobile-vax-bus-launched-to-help-achieve-100-coverage-in-madurai/articleshow/84049820.cms||---

The state government, which had only briefly engaged with the six individual trusts between late January and early February are yet to officially provide a detailed plan of the project. “We don’t have a copy of the master plan or the project design. We need a document to enter into a dialogue with the governing or executive council of the project,” said a senior official of the Gujarat Khadi-Gramudyog Mandal. The official added that in the coming few days a meeting of the six trusts will be held. A senior official of the state tourism department told TOI that within a fortnight individual meetings with each trust will be held to iron out issues related to revenue title, property ownership and NGOs that are functioning out of these buildings. “The negotiation process will be slow as the trusts involved in the negotiation have apart from following their core objectives have diversified into a number of activities,” revealed a senior official associated with the project. On January 24, this year the six trusts operating out of the Ashram campus had aired their concerns and had claimed that the “suggested (redevelopment) plan of the government required thoughtful conservation of many issues such as autonomy and mandate of different trusts, consensus of Ashram residents and preservation of the sanctity of the place keeping in mind the values and ethos of Gandhiji.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-to-meet-ashram-trusts-over-project-in-a-fortnight/articleshow/84047835.cms||---
---||Madurai||Stung by losses, hoteliers urge Tamil Nadu government to allow tourism in Kodaikana||DINDIGUL: Hoteliers in Kodaikanal hill station have urged the state government to allow tourists with all safety precautions as they are facing monetary issues, while thousands of employees working in the sector stare at livelihood loss. They also sought the state government to exempt them from paying electricity charges and taxes for a certain period. While the state government has allowed bus transport in most districts where Covid-19 cases have come down, hill stations are yet to be opened. People are allowed to travel to Kodaikanal only after getting an e-pass. With the hill station’s economy completely dependent on the tourism sector, locals are one of the worst-hit in the state. S Abdul Kani Raja, secretary of Kodaikanal hoteliers association said that even if the state government allowed the sector to function from now onwards, they do not have the wherewithal to operate. Government should extend its support for the revival of the industry. “Some of the states have given exemption for hoteliers from paying electricity tariffs and taxes for a particular period. We also need similar support for the revival,” he said. A proprietor of a private hotel from Kodaikanal said that the government should take up promotional activities to increase tourism after opening up the hill station for tourists. There are many lesser-known spots, which need attention. The measure would help attract tourists, who have already visited the hill station, once more. “Last year, a team set up by the tourism department conducted inspections at lesser known falls and dense forests. But the report prepared by the team is yet to see the light of the day. The district administration should take up measures to choose the places and develop infrastructure facilities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stung-by-losses-hoteliers-urge-govt-to-allow-tourism-in-kodai/articleshow/84049800.cms||V Devanathan
---||Chennai||Petrol price crosses Rs 100 per litre in Chennai||CHENNAI: The pump prices of petrol will breach Rs 100 mark for the first time ever in Chennai with a litre of petrol costing Rs 100.13 on Friday. The prices of diesel will cost Rs 93.72 a litre in the city. The record increase in fuel prices is due to an increase in crude oil prices, but the rise is sharper and customers are charged higher pump prices also because of taxes which account for 58% of cost of petrol and 52% of diesel prices. The Indian basket of crude is around $72 a barrel, up from $63.4 in April. “The chances of a cut in prices is highly unlikely as there is no move at the federal level to cut excise duties and states too do not want to blink and cut value added tax or VAT on auto fuels,” an official with an oil marketing company said. A simple break up of taxes (when pump prices were Rs 98.8) are thus: Dealer price: Rs 39.33, Excise Rs 32.9, Dealer comm Rs 3.82, VAT Rs 24.08. Auto fuels are not part of GST and hence attract excise duties and VAT from state governments. Taxes have been raised several times to make fuel costliest in India. Between FY15 and FY20, the government increased excise duties by a record 12 times and lowered it once twice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/petrol-price-crosses-rs-100-per-litre-in-city/articleshow/84047838.cms||---

The highest bid for an HIG flat in Sector 39 was of Rs 1.06 crore and that for a commercial unit in Manimajra was of Rs 81.51 lakh. The reserve price of 12 commercial units was Rs 5.65 crore. The highest bids received against these units were of Rs 6.55 crore. Similarly, the reserve price of two residential leasehold dwelling units was Rs 1.70 crore and the highest bids received against them were of Rs 1.75 crore. CHB chief executive officer Yashpal Garg said, “The CHB has received average about 13% above the reserve price of these units. The remaining unsold units will be included in fresh e-tender in the next few days.” With the financial bids opened on Thursday, the highest bidder is required to make the payment within five working days (by July 8) to avoid forfeiture of earnest money deposit (EMD) and blacklisting from future tendering process of CHB, Garg added. The CHB had received six bids against 11 residential units but only two could be sold to the highest bidders. Similarly, 16 bids were received against 156 commercial units and 12 units could be sold to the highest bidders. The board had recently started the process to auction 55 residential units on freehold basis, 11 residential units on leasehold basis and 156 commercial properties on leasehold basis through e-tender. The tendering process of 55 residential freehold units will be completed by July 5. The board had prepared a list of 270 properties, including 11 residential (leasehold), 109 residential (freehold) and 156 commercial (leasehold), for sale. The bord has started with auction of freehold residential units and already auctioned 54. To get a good response, the CHB had reduced the reserve price of the properties by 10%. Not even a single bidder had expressed interest in the auction of its properties in 2019 as the reserve price was too high for both residential and commercial units. This time, the board has replaced the e-auction process of selling properties with the e-tender one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hig-flat-in-sector-39-goes-for-rs-1-06-crore/articleshow/84047842.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Nagpur||Aim to start Mihan project quickly, create jobs for Vid||Padma Shri Kalpana Saroj is known as the original ‘Slumdog Millionaire’. Born in a Dalit family in Murtijarpur town of Akola district, her story is of a child bride living in a Mumbai slum becoming a business tycoon. Saroj grabbed headlines after taking over Kamani Tubes Limited, a company originally founded by freedom fighter and industrialist Ramji Kamani. The company was slated for liquidation when Saroj stepped in and revived it. Now, she plans an aviation venture in Nagpur through Kalpana Saroj Global Aviation Limited, a fully-owned subsidiary of Kamani Tubes. Starting with one acre, the company has bigger plans. Excerpts- Q. How did you plan to diversity into aviation? A. I was thinking on these lines for the last four to five years and have built a team of technical experts comprising retired professionals from Air India. They specialize in aircraft maintenance and related fields. I always wanted to contribute to Vidarbha’s development by creating jobs. Finally, the company Kalpana Saroj Global Aviation Private Limited was formed around a year ago. Q. It’s been known that you are ultimately planning a Rs4,000 crore project. How would you go about it? A. Initially, we had planned to take up 30 acres in Mihan. The plans were shared with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who immediately wrote to the Maharashtra government recommending the case. Later, we decided to start with an engine hospital or engine bay, a facility that would take up maintenance of aircraft engines. There is tremendous scope for such a facility in the country’s aviation sector. There may be other set-ups too but the demand is much more and the airlines have to take the planes abroad for maintenance. Having an engine bay here will also save foreign exchange. Q. What are the subsequent plans? A. We would like to go step-by-step, which includes forging JVs. There are plans to start an aviation school in Nagpur. My own son had to go to Germany for pilot training and ended up spending as much as Rs60 lakh on the course. If there is a full-fledged flying school here it will not only give an opportunity for the local youth but save foreign exchange also. Q. Is the aviation company the first-ever subsidiary of Kamani Tube which is now headed by you? A. Yes, it is a subsidiary of Kamani Tubes. Q. How do you plan to fund the project. Will funds also come from Kamani Tubes? A. Initially, yes. The initial amount is not much. Funds will be arranged as and when the plans will have to be implemented. Different sources will be explored. We may also raise funds from the market, if needed. There are plans to start the first phase without wasting time. Already, Covid has taken a toll on employment. The company’s main focus is to create jobs, profit comes later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aim-to-start-mihan-project-quickly-create-jobs-for-vid/articleshow/84047848.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Hyderabad||At 2,800, Telangana among top 10 states in number of people paying GST||HYDERABAD: Telangana has made it to the top ten states making a substantial contribution to Goods and Services Tax (GST). It has come in sixth in the country with 2,863 such tax payers who will be applauded by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBITC) with appreciation letters. As the GST rollout has completed four years, an analysis shows that Maharashtra has highest number of GST payers at 15,131 followed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, West Bengal and Telangana. This, however, has not helped in getting GST compensation from the Centre. “We have pending dues of more than Rs 3,000 crore with the Centre,” a senior Telangana official said. Among the taxpayers from Telangana, 36% are from micro enterprises, 41% from small entrepreneurs and 11% from medium enterprises. The data has been collected by National Institute of Public Finance And Policy (NIPFP). NIPFP has also pointed out that between July 2017and January 2020, Rs 1,874 crore GST was evaded in the state and Rs 805 crore was recovered. Effectively, 43% of the evaded tax was recovered. State planning board vicechairman B Vinod Kumar said that buoyancy in tax collections and recovery was always good in the state. “Even when Andhra Pradesh was united, recovery from Telangana districts was good,” he said. “People here comply with rules.” In fact, for the past four years, the state has seen a 10% growth in GST each year. During the 2020-21 financial year when the lockdown impacted economic growth, GST collections fell compared to other major states. Data of GST collection between April and August 2019-20 and 2020-21 shows that there was a decline of 26.3% in collections.In 2019-20 the state collected Rs 15,949 crore between April and August as against Rs11,762 in 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/at-2-8k-t-among-top-10-states-in-no-of-people-paying-gst/articleshow/84051841.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The urns were opened in the presence of experts from the Madurai Kamaraj University. Sivagalai is considered part of a civilization that flourished on the banks of the Thamirabarani thousands of years ago. As burial urns were found in Sivagalai in the past, experts considered it as a burial site of the civilization that flourished in the region. The second phase of excavation is underway at the site by the Tamil Nadu state department of archaeology. Site excavation director M Prabhakaran said that it was interesting that they found a full skeleton in one of the urns, which was the first such discovery in both the phases of excavations. Last week, fifteen urns were found in two of the adjacent quadrants at the site. With this, the total number of urns found at the site has gone up to 40. Only five of the urns are intact with the lid, while ten are in good condition without lids. Two of the five intact urns, one measuring 1.5 meters in height and 49cm in diameter were opened on Thursday and one urn had the skeleton in a slightly tilted condition. Prabhakaran said that the skeleton might have been placed in the urn in a seated position and it had tilted to a side over time. Small black red pottery in the form of offering bowls were also found in the urn. The smaller urn contained a few small bones and some pots. During the previous AIADMK had decided to set up a Rs3-crore ancient DNA testing laboratory at Madurai Kamaraj University for analysing the DNA samples of the skeletons found in the various excavation sites, including Keeladi, in the state. It is being established under the guidance of the principal investigator department of genetics Dr G Kumaresan and eminent immunologist Dr R M Pitchappan. The urns were opened in the presence of Dr Kumaresan and his team. Meanwhile, the MKU has called for tenders for establishing the ancient DNA testing laboratory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/human-skeleton-found-in-burial-urn/articleshow/84049783.cms||---

Police said the one-year-old boy was sold to one of the couples for Rs 2 lakh and the two-year-old girl for Rs one lakh to the other. Both the children had been rescued on Wednesday. The arrested were identified as G Kannan, 50, and his wife K Bhavani, 45, Sagubur Sathik, 38, and his wife Anees Rani, 35, R Kalaivani, 32, who was in-charge of the home run by the trust, besides brokers Raja and Selvi. Kalaivani had received the chief minister’s youth award for social service in 2019. Special police teams are searching for trust director G R Shivakumar, who is believed to be hiding in Chennai, and his associate Mathershaw. Police said that Raja who received Rs 50,000, as commission was supplying essentials required for the home while Selvi, was a donor to the home. Selvi helped sell the baby girl and it is not known what commission she got. Tallakulam police inspector S Selvakumar has altered the child missing case to children missing case and various IPC sections including 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using fake document as genuine one) and of Juvenile Justice (care and protection) act 2015 invoked. A higher police official said that only after the arrest of Shivakumar and Mathershaw will they know whether they had sold more children. Shivakumar was also running a rescue centre jointly with the police in Mattuthavani bus terminal. They will be closed down, he said. Meanwhile, Madurai district collector Aneesh Shekar has said that strict action would be taken against the accused involved in children’s sales. As a precautionary measure, a team will be formed consisting of child welfare committee members, social welfare department officials and revenue staff to check all the homes in the district. An inquiry will be carried out to check whether any government employees were involved in preparing the fake documents used in the case. Those who want to adopt a child have to approach only adoption agencies and officials concerned and not brokers. Those involved in adopting children illegally will face legal consequences, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/7-held-in-madurai-child-trafficking-case/articleshow/84049849.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Court denies bail to 7 accused in gold heist case||KOZHIKODE: Manjeri judicial first class magistrate court on Thursday rejected the bail plea of seven arrested accused in the intended dacoity case registered in connection with the Ramanattukara gold heist bid. The court rejected the bail petition of six accused belonging to the Cherupulassery gang and an accused hailing from Manjeri who were arrested for allegedly trying to commit robbery of the smuggled gold brought in through the Karipur airport on June 21. The prosecution opposed the bail plea saying that if the accused are let off on bail they are likely to commit such offences and could go into hiding and could destroy evidence and threaten the witnesses. Kondotty deputy superintendent of police K Ashraf told the court in a statement that there were multiple criminal cases registered in Cherupulassery and Koppam police stations against many of the accused in the gold heist bid case. Also, the additional public prosecutor told the court that there were many more accused who are to be nabbed in the case and the person who had sent the smuggled gold through the carrier and those who facilitated the smuggling have to be caught. Police told the court that the accused had conspired to rob the gold smuggled in by Perinthalmanna native Shafeeq. They were part of the 17-member team of identified accused who had assembled in five vehicles near the Karipur airport. The statement submitted by the police opposing the bail plea said that the accused had hurled a soda bottle towards the car at Newman Junction while pursuing the vehicle headed to Kannur. Five persons belonging to the 15-member Cherupulassery gang had died in a road accident after the car in which they were travelling collided with a truck while they were returning after pursuing a car on the belief that a carrier who had brought gold was in the vehicle not knowing that the customs had seized the 2.3kg of gold which the gang had planned to rob. Currently, police have arrested 11 accused in the case registered under IPC section 399 (making preparation to commit dacoity).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/court-denies-bail-to-seven-accused-in-gold-heist-case/articleshow/84045817.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad boffins spy black hole eat up neutron star||AHMEDABAD: A recent discovery that excited astrophysicists across the globe was the definitive proof of a neutron star devoured by its binary (companion) black hole in not one but two successive events recorded this January. The event was recorded through gravitational waves recorded by Earth-based set-ups which are part of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) in the US and Virgo observatory in Italy. The events happened 280 and 300 megaparsecs (one Mpc is 32.6 lakh light years) away, claimed an exhaustive research paper ‘Observation of Gravitational Waves from Two Neutron Star–Black Hole Coalescences’ published by the team in the Astrophysical Journal Letters having over 300 contributors. Two of the contributors include Soumen Roy from IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), and S Sunil from Institute of Plasma Research (IPR). Dr Karan Jani, an astrophysicist of Gujarati origin, currently works with Vanderbilt University in the US. Talking to TOI, Roy, a PhD scholar at IIT-Gn said that it’s an exciting discovery that gives definitive proof of interaction of neutron star–black hole (NSBH) binaries. “These events are taking place very far away from us. Its observation is giving us insight into the mechanism of the universe,” he said. “Earlier, a few such events were suspected to have taken place, but it’s for the first time that we have proof.” Experts pointed that the observatories generate a lot of data during such events, which is validated through various computational models. This is where the role of collaborators from across the globe comes to fore. Current understanding of the events point at presence of binary stars, much bigger than the Sun, circling each other their whole life. As they ran out of fuel, one of them became a black hole, whereas another’s remains took form of a neutron star. They came closer and closer due to gravitational pull, which eventually resulted in destruction of neutron star by the black hole. The occurrence is ‘observed’ for the first time, pointed out experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-boffins-spy-black-hole-devour-neutron-star/articleshow/84047872.cms||---

Many of them were expecting Sandhya to be the natural choice of the government as the next SPC. The absence of Sudesh Kumar and Sandhya was noted by all not only during the charge handing over ceremony but also for the informal farewell function and dinner hosted by the IPS association for the outgoing chief Loknath Behera at the police training college on Wednesday evening. Even though Tomin J Thachankary was also absent during the charge handing over ceremony, he participated in the farewell function online. As per the gradation list of IPS officers, the seniority of the officers shortlisted for the post of SPC in the descending order is Sudesh Kumar, Sandhya and Anilkant. The state has four posts of DGPs approved by the Centre at present, two of which are cadre posts and two ex-cadre posts. Till Wednesday, the four officers who were in the rank of DGPs, in their decreasing order of seniorities were Loknath Behera, Rishi Raj Singh, Tomin J Thachankary and Sudesh Kumar. With the retirement of Behera, the next person to be automatically elevated to the grade of DGP was Sandhya, who was superseded when Anilkant was chosen as the SPC. Though Sandhya was bypassed while being considered for elevation to the rank of DGP owing to the selection of SPC, the officer will be elevated to the rank on July 31 when Rishi Raj Singh will retire from the service. It is for the first time in the history of the state police that an officer has been superseded while conferring the rank of DGP to a junior officer.  “But it has been done for a genuine reason as the government is in its full rights to select one from the list of officers prepared by the UPSC, irrespective of their seniority. Earlier, the state has been strictly following the seniority principle while conferring the rank of DGP to officers,” top police sources said. Meanwhile, the demand of the state police to increase the number of DGP posts in the state to four is pending before the Centre.  This would mean that if it is agreed to by the Centre, there would be effectively eight DGPs in the state four in cadre and four in equal number of ex-cadre posts. However, police sources say that it is unlikely to be cleared. “We expect at least one more post of DGP, which would then take the total number of DGPs to six,” sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-chief-govt-bypassing-seniority-surprises-many/articleshow/84045838.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Mumbai||Deshmukh’s secy to ED: Min had a role in police transfers||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Trouble continues to mount for former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. His private secretary Sanjeev Palande in a statement to the Enforcement Directorate has said that the controversial NCP leader had a role in transfer postings of police officers, specially those in the IPS. In an order extending Palande’s remand, a special PMLA court said “investigation material” suggested a meeting between Deshmukh and another minister regarding transfers. In a hearing before the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court where ED sought further custody of Palande, 51, and the minister’s personal assistant Kundan Shinde, 45, special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves said investigations had revealed that a meeting was held to discuss transfers of police and IPS officers and that an unofficial list of candidates was prepared. Pegging payoffs linked to the probe at Rs100 crore, ED said the duo’s custody was required to ascertain the links between police officers and Deshmukh. Palande and Shinde were arrested on June 25. The court has extended their custody to July 6. ED may issue a third summons to Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh for questioning next week, which may limit the duo’s options and allow the agency to consider tougher steps. The minister and his son, citing health concerns posed by Covid, have side-stepped two summons so far in connection with the extortion and money laundering investigation registered against him and some senior police officers. Deshmukh has been questioned once and officials have conducted searches at his residence and other premises in Mumbai and Nagpur. It is the ED’s contention that Rs 4.18 crore in bribes were funnelled into a Nagpur-based trust run by Deshmukh and his son as donations and loans. It was done by routing funds via shell companies and two Delhi-based hawala operators Surendra and Virendra Jain. In a reasoned order extending custody of Palande and Shinde, special judge S M Bhosle said, “On consideration of investigation material there was a meeting between the home minister and one of the ministers in respect of transfer of police officers. According to the special public prosecutor, an unofficial list was prepared and investigating agency intended to verify the same from the transferred order issued by the government. Further the statement of accused states that there was transaction related to police officers.” The court said that while the accused had mostly given evasive answers, there was material to show that they were present when discussions were held. “Therefore, I found substance in the argument of the special public prosecutor that the accused persons required to be confronted with (dismissed cop Sachin) Vaze, other witnesses and the police officer, who were transferred,” the court said. The ED said Palande had “admitted” that a meeting was held on March 4 with police officers where discussions about Covid-19 restrictions on bars took place. Palande’s advocate Shekhar Jagtap, however, argued that he was an additional collector appointed as a personal secretary of the home minister and was only performing official duties. Referring to the March 4 meeting, his advocates said the assembly session was in progress then. They said the minister had to discuss various issues with concerned officers before presenting them in assembly. They said the meetings could not be linked to alleged transfer of IPS officers. The ED had alleged that Palande and Shinde had played an active role in money laundering. Palande had coordinated with Waze, DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil to collect money from ‘orchestra bar’ owners in Mumbai, and hand it over to Shinde, it said. Waze had said he had collected Rs 4.7 crore between December 2020 and February 2021 (when government relaxed Covid lockdown conditions allowing bars to operate) and handed it over to Shinde. On Thursday, reiterating Palande and Shinde’s role in the alleged offence of money laundering, the agency said their custody was required as they may be aware of crucial facts since they were in charge of Deshmukh’s affairs. The ED alleged that Shinde had not cooperated and claimed to have neither met Waze nor communicated with him. Shinde’s advocates, Mehul Thakkar and Prashant Pawar, argued that Shinde was only a member of the charitable trust run by Deshmukh with no powers in its management. The investigating agency also said that during its searches several documents and gadgets were seized. “Further income tax returns and bank account statements of both the accused have also been called for further scrutiny and same needs to be confronted with both accused for establishing the money trail and unearthing the proceeds of crime,” the agency said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukhs-secy-to-ed-min-had-a-role-in-police-transfers/articleshow/84051948.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The court, however, said that the relief sought for cannot be granted as the location of a liquor outlet is to be decided by the authorities in accordance with law as per the relevant rules and guidelines. In his public interest litigation, K Karunanithi stated that a few people started brewing illicit liquor. In order to prevent this, a liquor outlet was set up in 1989. Till 2003, the village panchayat was running the shop. From 2003, Tasmac has been running the outlet on the outskirts. In December 2020, the authorities had planned to relocate the outlet to another village called Thaniyamangalam. When the villagers objected, a peace meeting was conducted. Despite the objections raised by the villagers, the district collector passed an order dated June 14 to shift the shop from Vellalore to Thaniyamangalam. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that it is a peculiar relief sought for by the petitioner. The petitioner is a resident of the said village and wants the outlet to be situated in the very same location, but it cannot be granted. Hence, the judges disposed of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-moves-hc-against-relocating-tasmac-liquor-outlet-from-village/articleshow/84049897.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Nagpur||Even after high court directives, school fails to start online classes for five-year-old||NAGPUR: After Nagpur bench of Bombay high court provided temporary relief to a five-year-old child, whose online classes were stopped by Mother’s Pet Kindergarten school, the state education department has issued notice to its principal asking to restart his classes. Quoting the HC directives, zilla parishad education officer Chintaman Wanjari issued a simple notice to principal Kalpana Dhareshwar to promote petitioner child Dhairya from Kg-I to KG-II. “There shouldn’t be any violation of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, and the student shouldn’t be deprived of access to online education,” the notice said. Petitioner’s father Pritesh Bansod alleged that despite clear HC orders and directives by the education department, the school failed to restart his son’s online classes till Wednesday. He has filed an additional affidavit in HC through counsel Ravi Sanyal, complaining about violation of its orders. Refuting Bansod’s charges, Dhareshwar told TOI they had fully complied with the HC orders to release the child’s report card and also promote him to next class. “However, nothing is mentioned in HC order about restarting online classes,” she said. On allowing the petitioner to attend online classes, she said the parents had paid partial fee of last year, and not paid a single penny for KG-II. “Let them clear the dues first, we will allow the kid to access the classes. We understand the problems faced by the parents in Covid-19 pandemic. His parents should also think about others who have paid full fees. As for department’s notice, we will look into it through our legal department,” she said, assuring the school will comply with HC directives. The five-year-old had approached the HC through his father after the school withheld his KG-I result, asking parents to pay remaining fees of Rs86,800. The school also stopped promotion of the kid to KG-II. According to Bansod, he was invited by the school management on June 24, two days after the HC heard the case, for a meeting with Dhareshwar and vice principal Gauri Zaveri. “Over 45 minutes, the principal asked me why I moved the HC and challenged the school when 90% of parents had paid the fees,” he mentioned in the affidavit. Bansod then requested both to comply with the HC orders to share the online teaching link of KG-II with his son so that he can attend regular classes. He was told that both would consult their legal team and inform him. Next day, Bansod received an email that Dhairya was promoted to KG-II and his final report card was also released. On June 27 and 28, Bansod had sent emails to the school to share the online link for KG-II and also share books and study material as prescribed. When the school failed to do that, he filed an additional affidavit. Edu Dept takes cognizance of TOI report The Education Department has taken cognizance of TOI report of June 23, which had reported about a five-year-old knocking the judiciary’s doors after his school refused to issue his KG-1 mark sheet and also to promote him to KG-2 for want of fees. The department officials called on TOI for seeking complete details about the HC case. They stated that they had received instructions from their senior officials in Mumbai to inquire about the case mentioned in TOI and take action against school management for flouting the norms of Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009. The clarified that no school can prohibit any student from attending classes for want of fees, as it would be violation of the RTE Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/even-after-hc-directives-school-fails-to-start-online-classes-for-5-yr-old/articleshow/84047866.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The drive by the students of Chairman Manicka Vasagam Middle School began on Monday. As many as 102 of the 110 students wrote messages like “let us stop corona by taking vaccines,” “let us take the vaccine with a smile” and “let us use the government’s free vaccine” on the postcards and sent them. P Devadarshini, a Class VIII student, said that the postcards also helped create awareness among her parents and neighbours as they asked her what she was writing and what its purpose was. “Parents also shared the message with the neighbours and relatives,” she said. School headmaster L Chokkalingam told TOI that they motivated students to take up the campaign as Covid-19 vaccines are not administered to those aged below 18 years. They would be safe only if their parents, the parents of their fellow students and elders in the village got vaccinated, he said. “Over the last few days, parents have been coming to the school to collect the free books for their wards. When we interacted with them, we came to know that most of them had not taken the jab due to undue fear and taboos. They lacked awareness and the motivation to take the vaccine,” he said. He said all the eight teachers of the school has taken the jab. “We asked the postman not to get annoyed by mistakes in the addresses on the postcard and to deliver them,” the headmaster added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/students-send-vaccine-awareness-postcards-to-parents-of-friends/articleshow/84049858.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Hi-end dream drives PhD holder, friend straight into police’s net||NEW DELHI: It isn’t as if criminals aren’t educated or that only the illiterate turn to a life of delinquency. And yet one would still stop in surprise to read that car thief Mehtab’s resume boasts a PhD apart from a pass in the National Eligibility Test, making him eligible for lectureship in a college or a junior research position. His fellow car thief, Tadrish, too had graduated from a top Delhi University college and had a postgraduate degree from Aligarh Muslim University. Their educational accomplishment made crime decidely an unusual career choice for them. However, a chance meeting with notorious car lifter Juma Khan lured them into the world of big money that came from stealing high-end vehicles. The duo allegedly sold the stolen vehicles in the Northeast, even to insurgency groups there, police claimed on Thursday. Tech-savvy and educated as they were, Mehtab and Tadrish started using GPS detectors to locate and disable the tracking devices fitted in contemporary vehicles. They stole 10-15 high-end vehicles every month, according to the cops, and sold them in Manipur after changing the chassis and engine numbers. Till date, they are reckoned to have stolen and sold off around 300 cars. "The inter-state racket was busted by a team led by ACP Ved Parkash and inspector AK Singh from the anti-auto theft squad (AATS) and 12 luxury cars with automatic transmission have been recovered from Manipur,” said Priyanka Kashyap, DCP (East), on Thursday. AATS was working on source information about the inter-state auto thieves active in Delhi-NCR and tracked down Mehtab and Tadrish after a month-long surveillance. When the cops received information that the two had arrived in Delhi from Manipur and were staying at Hotel Silicon in Paharganj, they conducted a raid and arrested the duo. The two conceded that they often flew to Delhi from Manipur for back-to-back larcenies. Other members had specific roles in the gang. While Mehtab and Tadrish stole the vehicles and drove them to Manipur, others changed the chassis numbers and prepared forged documents for the vehicles. Some gang members were then deployed to get the vehicle registered and sold in areas under the jurisdiction of different transport authorities of Manipur. “During interrogation, they revealed that some cars were sold to groups engaged in insurgency,” DCP Kashyap said. “The connivance of transport authority officers cannot be ruled out and this aspect is being investigated.” After the arrests, police teams visited various places in Manipur, including insurgency-affected areas. The operation was interrupted by a curfew declared by underground organisations in Manipur, but local police helped in the successful recovery of 12 high-end cars, including a Fortuner, Creta, Scorpio and Brezza from the state. DCP Kashyap said, “The AATS team showed a lot of courage and dedication and themselves drove all the cars across 200km of the insurgency-affected regions."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hi-end-dream-drives-phd-holder-friend-straight-into-polices-net/articleshow/84049913.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Society secretary, corporator’s husband file complaints||PUNE: The secretary of a housing society in Aundh was beaten up allegedly by the supporters of the husband of a local corporator, who also happens to be the resident of the same society. Madhukar Musale, husband of local corporator Archana Musale, refuted the allegation, saying his supporters were abused by the secretary. The incident took place on Wednesday afternoon outside the entrance of the housing society. Senior inspector Rajkumar Wakchaure of the Chatushrungi police told TOI, “We have registered crosscomplaints in this regard. The complaints are non-cognisable in nature. The dispute was over demolition of a compound wall of the housing society.” Wakchaure said that Sanjeev Sindgikar, secretary, Clarion Park Co-operative Housing Society Limited, stated in his complaint that he was beaten by up Madhukar Musale, a member of the society, and another person. “Musale alleged in his complaint that the secretary had abused him,” Wakchaure said. Sindgikar said in his complaint that on June 27, Musale had demolished a part of the compound wall without informing the members. On Wednesday, he wanted to demolish the wall on the other side, too. He had told the watchman to contact the members whose cars were parked along the wall to shift them elsewhere. “When Sindgikar came down, the suspects beat him up, alleging that the latter had circulated copies of complaint application against them,” said a police official. Musale alleged in his complaint that the secretary had abused him. Sindgikar told TOI, “I came out to stop wall demolition. That’s when they started beating me up. Musale asked me why I was distributing copies of the police complaint to the society members. He was implying I was trying to defame him, whereas my intention was to keep the society members updated.” Musale said, “I asked Sindgikar why he was distributing the papers among society members and trying to defame me. There was no reason to distribute such papers. I did not beat him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/housing-society-secretary-corporators-husband-file-cross-complaints-with-police/articleshow/84049885.cms||---

---||Madurai||Act against use of banned cone speakers in Kodaikanal||MADURAI: The Madras high court has directed the Dindigul district collector to constitute a team of officials to inspect and take action against the people who are using banned cone speakers in Kodaikanal. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Minoo Erach Avari who sought for a direction to remove all cone speakers in Kodaikanal. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that though the Supreme Court and this court had issued several earlier directions prohibiting the use of cone speakers, the authorities are being mute spectators to the violations. It appears that no action has been initiated against the people or organisations who have been using cone speakers. Hence, the judges directed the collector to constitute a team comprising officials from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, two senior police officials to take action against all the religious, commercial establishments, individuals who have erected cone speakers or who temporarily erect such speakers. The judges directed the team to issue notice to such people to remove the installation of cone speakers within three days, failing which, the authorities shall remove the same and recover expenses from the violators. If there are repeated violations, then the electricity board shall disconnect the power supply for the entire building, until the defect is permanently rectified. Taking note of the fact that such cone speakers are rented from vendors, the judges directed the team to inspect all such vendors in Kodaikanal and give them an opportunity to change over to box speakers, failing which the cone speakers can be seized. The judges directed the authorities to file a report in this regard and adjourned the case by six weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/act-against-use-of-banned-cone-speakers-in-kodai/articleshow/84049921.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madras high court: All PHCs should have ambulance to shift patients||MADURAI: All primary health centres (PHC) should have an ambulance to shift patients in case of emergencies as every second counts and any delay can cause death, the Madras high court has said and directed the state to pay Rs 5 lakh compensation to the family of a woman who died after childbirth as there was a delay in arrival of ambulance to shift her to a government hospital. The court passed the order on a petition filed by T Rajagopal seeking compensation for his wife’s death. The petitioner’s wife gave birth to a female child on June 26, 2012, in the PHC at Rajakamangalam in Kanyakumari district. Due to excess bleeding after childbirth doctors planned to shift her to the government hospital at Asaripallam. Though the staff nurse had called for an ambulance, it arrived after a delay of 30 minutes. When the woman was taken to the government hospital, she subsequently died. Justice N Anand Venkatesh took note of the fact from the counter filed by the doctor wherein it was stated that nearly 4 to 6% of the cases can encounter ‘postpartum haemorrhage’ during delivery and it is a common cause for maternal deaths after delivery in the country. The judge observed that there was a delay in shifting the woman had ultimately proved to be fatal. In medical parlance, it is referred to as the golden hour. “When it comes to saving life, every second counts and delay by even a few minutes can cause the death of a person. Therefore, when it comes to medical emergencies, delay can never be condoned like how leniently we condone in courts. Every PHC is supposed to have an ambulance readily available to shift patients in case of emergencies,” observed the judge. The judge observed that the PHC at Rajakamangalam was regularly dealing with delivery cases and they have to expect an emergency at any time and cannot afford to run the centre without an ambulance. The judge said that as per a GO in 2018, the state government has created a corpus fund, where the government doctors contribute a certain amount towards this fund for payment of compensation whenever a situation arises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-all-phcs-should-have-ambulance-to-shift-patients/articleshow/84049952.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Mumbai||Vax drive only for 3 hrs in Mumbai city today: BMC||Nashik/Mumbai: On a day several districts, including Mumbai, couldn’t carry out Covid-19 vaccination due to shortage of doses, deputy CM Ajit Pawar said the government has set a target to inoculate at least 70% of the state’s adult population within the next two months. AMC Suresh Kakani said vaccination in Mumbai would resume on Friday but would be carried out for three hours between 2 pm to 5 pm.  Talking to reporters in Nashik on Thursday, Pawar said the MVA government has accorded priority to the vaccination programme. On Thursday, none of the public centres could administer any doses, while private centres vaccinated 31,380. Compared to Wednesday, vaccination in the city dropped by 50%. Many Mumbaikars took to social media to express anger at having to cancel bookings for free vaccine slots they found after multiple attempts.  Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has received 9 lakh doses which will be distributed to all districts.Maharashtra could administer only 2.74 lakh doses on Thursday, a significant drop from last week when nearly 4 lakh to 5 lakh doses were administered daily. State officials said Maharashtra has been assured 1.15 crore doses by the Centre.The private sector too has been assured a little over 24 lakh doses for this month. “Since health experts are predicting a possible third wave in near future, our government wants to ensure at least 70% of all eligible beneficiaries above the age of 18 years are inoculated in the next two months,” said Pawar. He, however, conceded that supply of vaccines is still an issue in Maharashtra.  The state has so far vaccinated 1.97 crore with one dose and 64.66 lakh with both doses. It is estimated Maharashtra’s eligible population for vaccination is 8.5 crore, which means70% of that would translate into roughly 6 crore people. So the state can meet its two-month target only if it vaccinates upto 7 lakh people daily for the next two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-drive-only-for-3-hrs-in-mumbai-city-today-bmc/articleshow/84049999.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 65 acres of airport land to be used for slum dwellers’ rehab||Mumbai: Sixty-five acres of Mumbai airport land will be used for in-situ rehabilitation of airport slum dwellers eligible for free housing under the state’s slum rehabilitation scheme. The land, spread over eight pockets between Agripada in Santa Cruz and the Cigarette factory in Chakala, Andheri East, was offered to Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) — a real estate company that had constructed 17,000 tenements for Project Affected Persons (PAP) on the erstwhile Premier Automobile land at Vidyavihar. The land was offered not for monetary benefits but as compensation for the PAP tenements. Slum dwellers from Kurla and Saki Naka which are closest to the place are to be rehabilitated here. These slums are in the aeronautical zone and have been identified as a high security risk. BJP MLA Parag Alavani said it was the Devendra Fadnavis government that had first promised in-situ rehabilitation for airport slum dwellers. “There were two Memorandums of Understanding to be signed. The first was to handover the 17,000 tenements to MIAL for slum rehabilitation, but this was subject to the condition that it would handover the 65 acres for slum rehab,” he said. In 2019, the state housing department had written to the chief executive officer of Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) informing that the agreement between Mumbai International Airport LTD (MIAL) and HDIL for rehabilitation of slum dwellers on airport land had been scrapped. The 65 acres offered earlier to HDIL as consideration instead of monetary benefits for such rehabilitation was now available to SRA to carry out rehabilitation. Sources said the 65 acres will be used to rehabilitate 30,000 of the 80,000 slum households that today live on the nearly 200 acres of Mumbai airport land. Of the 80,000 families, around 50% are eligible for free housing, the rest being unauthorised slum dwellers. The balance 10,000 eligible slum dwellers would be offered housing on the Premier plot at Vidyavihar where 17,000 tenements have already been constructed. “We are happy that the decision taken by the Centre and the then BJP government to provide in-situ rehabilitation is finally being implemented,” said Alavani. Activist Godfrey Pimenta, however, said the government will need to provide housing to all slum dwellers within 3 kms of their present dwelling as per a 2007 national policy on relief and rehabilitation. “It cannot be piecemeal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-65-acres-of-airport-land-to-be-used-for-slum-dwellers-rehab/articleshow/84051951.cms||Clara Lewis

Chennai, too, gets ready to play ball again as the state government green-lights the fifth edition of the Tamil Nadu Premier League to be played in the city from July 19. “We have got the permission. Chennai will host the first phase of the event from July 19-29. All the matches will be played at the MA Chidambaram (MAC) Stadium. But there won’t be any fans inside the stadium,” a senior TNCA official told TOI on Thursday. The tournament has been planned in three phases till August 15 and the state government has given its consent for the event to be hosted cities such as Coimbatore, Dindigul, Salem and Tirunelveli. The TNCA, though, is still in the process of finalizing the venues for the second and third phases. A bio-bubble needs to be created and the association will take a call whether it is feasible to have it in smaller centres. The Covid-19 situation in the districts is also being monitored and if the association chiefs feel Chennai will be a safer bet for the eight-team franchise event, the entire tournament will happen in the city. “The option for hosting the full edition in Chennai is always there, but we are keen to host the second and third phase in districts,” an official said. Ahead of the tournament, all players, officials and support staff of the eight franchises will enter the bio-secure bubble at a city hotel on July 4. “All franchises will be put up at the same hotel and we are following all the protocols prescribed by the government,” the official said. The TNPL has thrown up a lot of stars like T Natarajan and Varun Chakravarthy and it will also be great preparation for those who will be part of the second phase of the Indian Premier League in the UAE in October. “It was disappointing that last year’s edition had to be cancelled due to the pandemic despite our best efforts. It will be a big boost for cricket in the state which is craving for resumption,” the official added. It can be noted that post the first wave, big ticket cricket had returned to India with back-to-back Test matches in Chennai against England in February. The city also successfully hosted one leg of this year’s Indian Premier League before it was stopped due to the second wave of pandemic. “We have the necessary experience to pull it off and things should go well in TNPL too,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-green-lights-fifth-edition-of-tnpl-tn-gets-ready-to-play-ball/articleshow/84047970.cms||Prasad RS

Over 70 politicians are accused in the case and this is the first attachment in the case. The ED statement details a sequence of transactions which link the assets to Ajit Pawar. It said the mill was purchased in the auction by a company called Guru Commodity Services Private Ltd and leased to another named Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Private Ltd.

In the MSCB case which was investigated on directions from the Bombay high court, ED has alleged that MSCB officials sanctioned loans to sick sugar mills and when the mills defaulted on the loans, they were auctioned off to recover the loss. The MSCB officials ensured that relatives or close associates of senior politicians got the mills during the auction at throwaway prices. In August 2019, the Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai police registered a cheating case against past office bearers of MSCB. Subsequently, the ED too registered a money laundering case for investigation where 76 past directors of MSCB (many senior politicians) were named as accused.

Ajit Pawar was one of the members of the board of directors of MSCB at the time. Jarandeshwar SSK was purchased by a company, Guru Commodity Services Pvt, Ltd, and leased to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd. A part of the funds towards the mill’s purchase came from Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd, a company related to Ajit Pawar and his wife, said the investigating agency.

After the partial lifting of lockdown restrictions, more women passengers have started using the buses compared to men in many parts of the city. T Usha of South Gate said that shared autos were more convenient earlier, but now they charge thrice the amount of the original fare. “When you compare the charges, free travel has a lot of benefits for a person like me as I sell dosa batter for a living,” she said, adding that the savings by way of travel was nearly Rs 100 a day now. “The fare from Gomathypuram to GRH was Rs 20, now it has increased to Rs 35 due to the fuel price hike,” said S Yasoda, a fruit vendor. Madurai has more than hundred shared autos, and they have a better patronage than city buses. P Gopal, a share auto driver, says that he used to transport not less than 100 women a day before the lockdown, but now he has less than 20 travelling in his vehicle. Mini buses, which travel into the inner roads in the city, are also expected to be affected by the free travel rule for ladies in city buses. Meanwhile, many people said that it would be better if the free travel rule was allowed for the low-floor city buses as well, as most elderly ladies found it difficult to climb to the ordinary buses, which had steep steps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/free-bus-travel-for-women-hits-share-autos/articleshow/84049956.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gold demand plummets by 73% in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Weakened spending triggered by second wave of Covid infections pushed down gold demand by a significant 73% in June, year-on-year. According to data by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex, barely 0.85 metric tonne (MT) gold was imported in June 2021 against 3.29 MT in June 2020. Jewellers said that timing restrictions coupled with weakened consumer confidence led to a significant decline in demand for gold. Jigar Soni, president of Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad, said, “The demand has failed to pick up throughout June because the purchasing power of people weakened during second wave. Businesses which were barely recovering got into a vicious cycle of shutdown, short staff, and underutilised capacities. Moreover, with fewer weddings taking place, jewellery demand too declined.” Industry players said that demand for bullion too significantly weakened, thanks to falling prices of gold. In the past fortnight, the price of gold, which hovered around Rs 51,000 per 10 gram plunged to Rs 48,700 per 10 gram on Thursday. “Decline in gold prices has been a major deterrent for those investing in gold. At the same time, it has also failed to boost demand for jewellery,” said an Ahmedabad-based jeweller. Analysts also said that people are avoiding unnecessary expenditure and are saving up money for medical emergencies, especially after witnessing a sinister second Covid wave and as a result, demand for gold and jewellery have both taken a hit. Gold demand, however, was slightly better if we look at the first quarter of 2021-22 as compared to the corresponding quarter. However, this is primarily because of muted demand in April and May last year due to the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-demand-plummets-by-73/articleshow/84047985.cms||Niyati Parikh

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor directed the respondents to process the students’ forms as per merit and in accordance with law until further orders. “In the circumstances, we find that prima facie case has been made out by the petitioner. Accordingly, we’re inclined to grant limited interim relief. On the next date, this petition shall be taken up for final disposal. Therefore, parties are put on notice to complete their pleadings well in advance. We also make it further clear that no further time shall be granted in this matter,” the bench said. The directives came while hearing a plea by the Tribal Officers Forum through counsel Mohan Sudame, praying for interim relief to the tribal students. The petitioner had challenged the rules of centralized counselling for MTech/MArch/MPlan admissions, where it was made mandatory for ST students to submit caste/tribe certificates issued by the Government of India in its own format, which is available on its website. Sudame contended that Government of India format is different from the certificate issued by the Caste/Tribe Scrutiny Committee, constituted as per the Maharashtra state act to issue and verify caste certificates. He prayed for permitting the ST students to take part in the admission process on the strength of caste/tribe validity certificates issued by the scrutiny committees constituted under the state act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-relief-to-tribal-students-seeking-admissions-to-prof-courses/articleshow/84047978.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

So far, no case has been registered, but the allegations of human trafficking are being probed.” On Wednesday, 20 minor boys from Bihar were rescued from trains in Aligarh and Firozabad in three raids when they were being taken to Delhi, allegedly to work in factories. The investigation found that fake Aadhaar cards were made to show that the boys were not underage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/80-including-minors-being-trafficked-from-bihar-rescued-from-train-in-up/articleshow/84043636.cms||Maria Khan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Wrong message would go to society, says court as it denies bail in ‘fake’ degree case||Mumbai: Observing that a wrong message would be sent to society, a sessions court this week rejected the bail plea of Swapna Patkar, arrested last month for allegedly practising clinical psychology using a fake degree. The court said there is ample material even at this stage and prima facie, there were reasonable grounds for believing that she has committed a non-bailable offence. In a complaint to the police, it was alleged that Patkar obtained forged degree of PhD in Psychology and had been misleading the public via social media by claiming she was an expert having earned various degrees and qualifications. Patkar was arrested on June 8. The defence, however, submitted that Patkar was falsely implicated. It was further submitted that the entire case of the prosecution rests on documentary evidence, which is already in the custody of the investigating officer. Opposing her bail plea, the prosecution submitted that the deputy registrar of Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj University, Kanpur, from where Patkar purportedly procured her PhD degree, had informed the investigating officer that her degree was not genuine. The prosecution further said that she had obtained the post of “Honorary Consultant” with Lilavati Hospital based on the forged degree and had charged patients fees. It alleged that Patkar offered certification courses for which she charged exorbitantly and ran a private clinic based on forged documents. The prosecution said two co-accused who helped her are absconding. “Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it will not be proper to release the applicant on bail when the matter is under investigation, otherwise a wrong message will go to the society. In my view, the applicant has not made out a case for the grant of bail,” said the court rejecting the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wrong-message-would-go-to-society-says-court-as-it-denies-bail-in-fake-degree-case/articleshow/84052034.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The incident occurred in northeast Delhi’s Karawal Nagar last Sunday. Police said the family tried to pass off the crime as natural death, but the priest, who had come to perform the last rites, noticed something amiss and alerted the cops. According to police, the accused, Prashant Chand, was sleeping beside his brother Prem Shankar, when a fight broke out between them. Shankar had objected to Chand speaking to his sister-in law. On the day of the incident, the accused was speaking to her on the phone when Shankar got angry and slapped him twice. Angry over this, Chand whipped out a country-made pistol and shot him. Police are investigating how Chand managed to procure a pistol. At the time of the incident, Shankar’s wife was away to her maternal house. The parents learnt about the murder in the morning when the mother went to the room and found Shankar in a pool of blood. To save Chand, the family cooked up a story that he fell off the bed and died. They also took the body for cremation where the priest noticed something suspicious. A case of murder was then registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/19-year-old-shoots-brother-in-ne-delhi/articleshow/84050067.cms||---

He said the comments of AP ministers on the irrigation projects were unwarranted and added that Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has always wanted harmonious relations with Andhra Pradesh and even extended help for the government on various issues. “The Telangana government constructed Kaleshwaram project with the approval of Maharashtra govenrment and even invited AP and Maharashtra CMs during its inauguration. Similarly, the AP government can construct projects after taking the approval from Telangana,” Srinivas Goud said at a press conference in Mahbubnagar. Srinivas Goud said people who have roots in AP and have been residing in Hyderabad should also raise voice for Telangana which would be deprived of Krishna water if Andhra Pradesh goes ahead with the RLIP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-work-on-rlip-goud-tells-ap/articleshow/84047988.cms||---

The water supply was restored Thursday late evening after civic officials fixed the damage. Due to the disruption in water supply, locals were completely dependent on water tankers that came twice a day. “I have lived here all my life but never witnessed such a disruption in the water supply before. Besides all household issues, standing in long queues to fetch water made us vulnerable to contracting Covid-19,” said Sudha Devi, a senior citizen from Rajpur. The water shortage also impacted the professional lives of people in the area. “I have a work-from-home job and I need to spend a large part of the day on my computer working on my office assignments. However, due to the water supply disruption, I had to constantly look out for the mobile tanker and stand in long queues,” Shazi Aman, another Rajpur resident, told TOI. When queried about the issue, A Bhandari, the joint engineer at Peyjal Nigam (Dehradun),said, “The water supply got disrupted after one of the water pipelines in the Rajpur area got damaged during a government construction work. However, we restored the water supply late Thursday evening after removing the mud and fixing the damage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/water-supply-hit-in-rajpur-after-pipeline-damage/articleshow/84045968.cms||Mohammad Anab

Rampur additional superintendent of police (ASP) Sansar Singh said, “The killing was an outcome of an old rivalry between two groups.

---||Delhi||In Red, Metro Outsources Yellow Line Ops||New Delhi: Very soon, train operations on Delhi Metro’s Yellow Line will be managed by a private agency. The first batch of “outsourced” train operators, who have been trained by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), will soon take over the reins of its busiest corridor between Samaypur Badli and HUDA City Centre. While DMRC has long been outsourcing staff for manning ticket counters, token vending machines, housekeeping work etc, it has now outsourced arguably the most crucial job in the system. DMRC plans to start privatising train operations from two of its oldest corridors, the second one being Red Line between Dilshad Garden and Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda. The 49.3km Yellow Line comprises 37 stations and witnesses the highest footfall among all corridors. TOI was the first to report in September 2019 that DMRC is planning to privatise train operations on its Yellow and Red lines. “DMRC has got a private agency to manage the train operation services on Line 2 for three years,” an official said. “The first pool of 153 train operators are undergoing training at Delhi Metro Rail Academy, Shastri Park, out of which approximately 70 have cleared the competency test after successful completion of training,” he said. They will operate under the supervision of DMRC Operations Control Centre at Shastri Park, he added. “DMRC plans to outsource train operation services through a similar procedure on its other lines in a phased manner.” DMRC will maintain overall supervision of train operations. “The existing DMRC staff of train operators will be deployed suitably in trains so as to provide troubleshooting, major fault handling, rescue operations and emergencies and counselling of private staff,” the official said. DMRC will pay the service provider for the manpower provided based on train-running hours. This, DMRC hopes, would prove economical in the long run. This may prove to be helpful at a time when DMRC’s earnings have been hit due to Covid-19. At present, the pay grade of a train operator is around Rs 21,000, one of the highest for non-executive employees. The existing train operators on Yellow Line will be utilised to augment frequency and number of trains on the existing lines. They will also be deployed on the upcoming Phase-IV corridors. The official said this outsourcing was already in place in Chennai Metro and DMRC had studied its process. “The Metro rail policy also entails engagement of private participation in operation and maintenance as one of the parameters for seeking central assistance for project proposals,” he added. The policy states that with the increase of metro rail systems in the country, the management may explore the possibility of provisioning of rolling stock, signalling systems etc and also maintenance and operation by a private entity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-red-metro-outsources-yellow-line-ops/articleshow/84048119.cms||Sidharatha Roy

But for Satara and Sangli districts, the coverage of the second dose is 25% and 26%, respectively.Three districts from the region have more Covid positivity rate than the state average. The positivity rate in Kolhapur district is 10%. While Sangli and Satara have a Covid positivity rate of 8.5% and 9% respectively.Recently, the state health authorities rolled five action plans for the nine districts to be adopted to bring down the positivity rate. These nine districts have a positivity rate more than the state average of 4.5%. One of the strategies is to ensure an increase in the pace of vaccination. So far in Sangli district, 7.60 lakh people have been given the first dose, of them, 2 lakh have received the second dose. The vaccination authorities of Sangli said the slow supply of vaccines has also resulted in the backlog of vaccinating the priority group of people.Vivek Patil, the vaccination nodal officer of Sangli said, “Around 45,000 to 50,000 frontline and healthcare workers are yet to get both their doses. We have around 18 lakh beneficiaries to be vaccinated in the district, of them, 7.60 lakh have been vaccinated for the first dose. We can vaccinate around 40,000 beneficiaries per day. We have sought more doses on regular basis.”The authorities said currently around 50% of beneficiaries turning up at the vaccination centres require a second dose. In the case of Satara district, around 8 lakh have people received the first dose, of them, 2.04 lakh have got the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vax-coverage-sangli-satara-lag-behind/articleshow/84244785.cms||---

Appearing for the AP CM, senior counsel S Niranjan Reddy said the MP had become more disgruntled ever since the YSRC wrote to the Lok Sabha speaker asking him to disqualify Raju from his MP post on account of his ‘anti-party’ activities. Principal special judge BR Madhusudhan Rao was hearing a plea filed by Raju urging the court to cancel the bail granted to Jagan in the quid pro quo case. Niranjan said: “It has been eight years since Jagan came out on bail in 2013. There has not been a single allegation of any witnesses being harassed or any document tampered with. In fact, he is seeking an expeditious trial and hence it would be meaningless to charge him with delaying the process. He has never sought a stay on any of the proceedings against him. Delay in the trial can at best be attributed to the complexity of the issue and not to Jagan.” He also said Jagan had never violated any of the bail conditions even in respect of his appearance before the court. “Raju has to show specific instances of violations while seeking cancellation of the bail given to Jagan,” he said. Appearing for Raju, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao said the fact that several accused in the quid pro quo case were given key official postings and making the environment intimidating is enough to create a fear psychosis in the minds of the witnesses. According to S Sri Venkatesh, counsel on record for Raju, the CBI would file its written submissions soon. The judge posted the case to July 8 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/raju-failed-to-present-witness-being-harassed-jagan-counsel/articleshow/84048032.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Sweat makes their blood boil||MOHALI: The Punjab government’s “power surplus” claim sounds like a joke in Mohali district, which has been facing unprecedented electricity shutdowns. Many parts of Mohali district did not get power for the past 14 hours on Wednesday and Thursday. Fed up, people came on to the roads to protest. All the peripheral towns of Mohali experienced power cuts for as long as 14 hours. People blocked roads and highways in Zirakpur, Nayagaon, Kurali, Kharar and Majri block. Residents come on roads in MullanpurResidents of Zirakpur gheraoed the office of PSPCL executive engineer and they were joined by local MLA NK Sharma. People raised slogans against the corporation and threatened to intensify stir if the power problem was not solved within 48 hours. Kharar residents also faced power cuts for eight hours and thereafter intermittent outages. They came out on roads after midnight and raised slogans against the Punjab government as well as the PSPCL. Kharar DSP intervened and pacified the agitated residents and they ended their stir. Residents of Kurali also took to roads and blocked Kurali Bypass for many hours. They lined up tractors to block the highway and protested against the Punjab government. Residents of Majri block too jammed the Kurali-Baddi Road and tried to march towards the chief minister’s residence, but were stopped by the police. On Wednesday, the Punjab government had announced power cuts in the entire state due to short supply of electricity.  The Zirakpur residents have been experiencing daily outages for the past couple of weeks. Questioning PSPCL’s claims of uninterrupted power supply, they mocked that as electricity was expensive in Punjab, the authorities snapped supply to lower their bills. Residents have decided to put up banners outside their societies, displaying power cut problems. SK Dhiman, a resident of Zirakpur, said, “Senior citizens, infirm persons and children suffer the most in this hot weather. Besides, people are working from home and need constant power. PSPCL officers should have some pity on Zirakpur residents. We had bought a flat in Zirakpur on the authorities’ assurance of surplus power in Punjab. In November 2019, a delegation of Escon Arena was assured by the then executive engineer that there wouldn't be any power cuts in future.” Intermittent shutdowns kept the residents awake at night in many parts of Lohgarh, Dhakoli, Ghazipur, Baltana, Bhabat, VIP Road and Chhat village. Raj Rani of Lohgarh said, “We have been facing power cuts of two to four hours daily for the past three days. Because of it, the water supply also stops. We cannot sleep at night and PSPCL officials fail to provide any reason for load shedding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sweat-makes-their-blood-boil/articleshow/84048022.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Kochi||Kerala: Husband, 4 others booked for assaulting pregnant woman||KOCHI: Aluva West police booked five persons, including the husband of a 22-year-old pregnant woman, after she filed a complaint that she was harassed over dowry and physically assaulted on Wednesday evening. The complainant is a resident of Thuruth in Aluva. The case was registered against Mohammad Ali Jouhar (28), his mother Subaida (55) and sisters Shabeena and Shareena. A friend of Jouhar, Muhuthas, was also booked in connection with the incident. Police have intensified its search as they went into hiding. Police said the woman complained that she was harassed mentally and physically over dowry ever since her wedding. As per the complaint, the woman who is four-and-a-half-months pregnant, was allegedly beaten up in the presence of her father. The attack reportedly happened after she declined to obey her husband, who asked her to go home with her father. The mother-in-law was present at the time of the attack and her sisters-in-law too telephoned her repeating the demands of Jouhar. Meanwhile Muhuthas, allegedly attacked the woman’s father. The case was registered under IPC Sections 498 (enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal intent a married woman), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). Police went to the husband’s house and found it locked. The suspects are likely to move court seeking anticipatory bail, sources said. They added that the couple got married nine months ago and the husband was allegedly paid Rs 8 lakh and given gold worth Rs 2 lakh as dowry. The complainant’s family alleged that Jouhar kept demanding more. The woman’s father was at the couple’s home after the husband told them that he was selling the house to settle debts. The husband and his mother left the woman and her father at their house for four hours and when they returned, told them that an agreement had been made to sell the house. Subsequently, they told the woman to leave with her father. The attack happened when she refused and her father was beaten when he tried to intervene, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/husband-4-others-booked-for-assaulting-pregnant-woman/articleshow/84046062.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune office spaces register increased uptake in Jan-June||PUNE: A report by real estate consultancy JLL has found that Pune was only one of the three markets nationally, along with Bengaluru and Kolkata, to buck the trend of faltering absorption of office space demand. Observers said IT and ITeS companies were driving the demand in the uptake, especially in Pune. The figures for the first half of 2021 (see box) also reveal a precipitous drop in absorption in Mumbai when compared to the same period last year with the Maharashta capital’s largely financial services and enterprises market being not in a position to fill large-scale vacancies in the peripheral areas and the upmarket central business districts. Though Mumbai’s peripheral areas, such as Navi Mumbai, have a sizeable IT and ITeS presence, the high rents and the lack of an IT ecosystem was driving more companies to Pune, the analysts said. “Vacancies in Mumbai are really high. The main transactions happening in Mumbai are renewals, with very few fresh leases. This is a problem in a real estate market such as Mumbai. The vacancies are also high in the peripheral areas of Mumbai, which have a lot of ‘A’ grade buildings to attract IT and ITeS companies. But the tech ecosystem is much more mature in Pune, which is why companies are moving there. Pune’s vacancy is in single digits,” Samantak Das, chief economist and head of research, JLL, told TOI. Realtors and observers were unanimous that large IT companies, for many of whom rents were only a small part of its topline, were renting spaces in the co-working or even full lease models in Pune. “They counted on vaccinations to increase over the rest of the year, so that they can return to offices in a hybrid manner,” an observer said. Vineet Goyal, managing director of Kohinoor Group, said, “We have got a lot of enquiries from IT and fintech firms over the past few months who are interested in leasing space, particularly in the co-working model. They are keenly looking at that model for a couple of years, or at least till Covid is around. While the demand has not increased a lot over the past few months, there have certainly been a lot of renewals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-office-spaces-see-uptake-rise-in-jan-june/articleshow/84050108.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Hyderabad||Woman in Telangana offers mangalasutra as bribe to officials||HYDERABAD: Vexed with officials for allegedly not settling her land issue, a woman hung her mangalasutra to the door of the tahsildar’s office in Rajanna Sircilla district in a bid to draw attention to her problem. The woman, Polasa Manga, of Manala village of Rudrangi mandal staged a protest at the Rudrangi tahsildar’s office by sitting at the door and hanging her mangalasutra to the office door in an attempt to offer it as a bribe. Taking note of the woman’s problem, Rajanna Sircilla district collector Krishna Bhaskar asked officials to investigate the matter and submit a report immediately. On Thursday, officials checked the land records. However, a senior official said that from what they have found, there was no wrong-doing on the part of revenue officials but the transfer of the land from one person to another had taken place some years ago and this was in the records. The issue, he said, pertained to assigned land. Polasa Manga alleged that a close relative had transferred the land on to their name when her family also was supposed to get it. She said she had been making the rounds of the tahsildar’s office to rectify the alleged wrong but this did not happen. Manga said that ultimately, the officials said that the matter was sent to the RDO’s office and that she should pursue it there. Disappointed, the woman removed her mangalasutra when she visited the office on Wednesday and said that was the only thing she had if any of the officials were expecting bribe from her. Police who later arrived at the place spoke to her and got her to remove the mangalasutra from the door post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-offers-mangalasutra-as-bribe-to-officials/articleshow/84048021.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Among the states completing more than cumulative doses of one crore, at least nine states have given more jabs in the 18- 44 age group. Uttar Pradesh has given the highest number of doses in this age group, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Kerala is the only state which had given more doses to people above 60 years of age so far, while few states have administered more doses in 45-60 age group. Director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao said that in July, 30 lakh second doses need to be given in the state. For the vaccine drive for 18–44 age group, 204 centres will be set up. From July 3, vaccination drive will begin in100 centres across the city. “Initially our vaccine policy was focusing on people above 60 years age to prevent mortality as they are more vulnerable, but giving more jabs to younger population not only protects them, it also will play major role breaking the infection chain,” said director and professor at ASCI Centre for Health Care Management, Dr Subodh Kandamuthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/states-vax-drive-for-18-44s-on-right-path/articleshow/84049946.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The state government had commenced special vaccination drive for these student from June 5. Immediately after the special counter was opened at the Institute for Preventive Medicine, Narayanguda, students started queuing up in large numbers to get the shot. In fact the state government had sought special permission from the IPM to decrease the time interval between the first and the second dose to complete the entire vaccination process for students. “Majority of the students are due to go for the fall semester to countries such as the US, the UK and Canada. Up to the third week of June, 6,874 students were vaccinated. Many of them have got their first shot and have applied for the visa process,” said an official. However, the fact that vaccination for this group is provided only in Hyderabad has remained a constraint for many students in districts and the state government is flooded with requests to begin more centres in districts. After prioritising vaccination of students heading to foreign universities for thier higher education, the state government also began the vaccination drive for people going abroad for employment purposes, some days back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-half-of-10k-students-going-abroad-vaccinated/articleshow/84049740.cms||---

Dinkar Temkar, director of the council, said while there may not be a need for syllabus cuts if schools reopen, it may be required if they remain closed for an extended period. “The proposal for a 25% cut announced last year was limited to the previous academic year. In case schools do not open for a longer time, the state may cut the syllabus for this year too. This will be the same as last year,” said Temkar. At present, teachers are conducting bridge courses.

---||Hyderabad||Private hospitals in Telangana pay up Rs 72 lakh excess charges||HYDERABAD: Hospitals have coughed up Rs 72.2 lakh excessive charges in 30 cases so far over the last two months. These 30 cases are among 350 complaints of overcharging received so far by the health department against 170 hospitals across 14 districts in Telangana. As per a report of the health department, majority of these complaints were from Hyderabad. The authorities had received 148 complaints against private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. After Hyderabad, the maximum number of complaints were received from Medchal-Malkajgiri, followed by Rangareddy, Warangal Urban, Mahbubnagar, Sangareddy and Karimnagar. Apart from complaints related to overcharging, complaints of mismanagement, lack of proper attention etc had also been received. “As part of action in the 350 complaints against 170 hospitals, the director public health had suspended Covid treatment permission for 22 hospitals. On the directions of the high court, the suspension of permission to treat Covid-19 patients of the 22 hospitals was revoked with directions to refund surplus amount to patients. In this connection, as of now, 30 grievances got resolved and Rs 72,20,277 got refunded to the complainants,” an internal report of the health department said. As per the tariff for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals and diagnostic services revised by the government, Rs 4,000 for regular bed, Rs 7,500 for ICU (Intensive Care Unit) care and Rs 9,000 for ICU care with ventilator, have been capped as the upper limit for daily basic charges. These include monitoring and investigations like complete blood count, urine routine, HIV spot, anti HCV, HbsAg, serum creatin, USG, 2D Echo, X ray, ECG, drugs, consultation, bed charges, meals and procedures like Ryles tube insertion, urinary tract catheterization but do not include high end tests. “Hospitals were advised to refrain from unnecessary and repeated tests which had been seen in many of the bills attached to overcharging complaints. We are still in process of doing justice to the complainants,” informed a senior official from the health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hospitals-pay-up-rs-72l-excess-charges/articleshow/84049540.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Plan to outsource 6k beds in three new jumbo centres||Mumbai: The BMC plans to outsource nearly 6,000 beds in three upcoming Covid jumbo centres. It has recently invited bids from external agencies to run the ICUs, beds with oxygen support and regular isolation beds at the jumbo centres coming up in Malad, Somaiya Ground and Kanjurmarg. The civic body has decided to pay Rs 6,000 per ICU bed, Rs 1,500 per oxygen-supported bed and Rs 800 for the management of regular non-oxygen beds to these agencies. The 6,000 beds include 100 paediatric isolation and PICU beds each. Besides the new jumbo centres, the tender also includes bids for running the 108-bed ICU facility at BKC jumbo centre and another 100 beds at Dahisar jumbo centre. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC plans to outsource only part of the functioning of the facilities. “We are looking for partnership mainly in management of ICUs and oxygen support beds that need round-the-clock monitoring,” he said, adding that the BMC has invited expressions of interest and will bring the agencies onboard in a phased manner. “We have already started receiving some interest from hospitals, but everything will be decided based on the anticipated third wave,” Kakani said. The last date for submission of interest is July 3. Outsourcing of civic healthcare facilities had recently come under political attack with the Aam Aadmi Party alleging that it was mostly given to agencies indirectly owned by politicians and bureaucrats. Kakani said only private hospitals, corporate hospitals, charitable hospitals, charitable medical trusts and those who are already providing similar services to major hospitals can participate in the bid. The agencies will have to run the jumbo centres for three months or till the pandemic subsides. The BMC will build the facilities, including creating complete ICU setups and providing medicines and laboratory services, while the agencies have to bring the manpower. It has specified that to run a 10-bed ICU, the agency should have a team of at least 28 staffers, including one consultant and associate consultant each, six RMOs and 10 nurses. Similarly, the minimum strength for a 50-bed unit of oxygen beds should be 30 and for 100-bed non oxygen units, it should be 31. “The bidder can quote for one or more facilities, but one won’t be given more than two facilities as per the tender,” said Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC jumbo, who is coordinating the process. The public-private partnership (PPP) for management of jumbo centres was introduced last year. The Mulund jumbo facility was partly run by a private agency, while the 108-bed ICU at BKC jumbo was run under a PPP. The NSCI Covid centre is now managed by HN Reliance Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-plan-to-outsource-6k-beds-in-three-new-jumbo-centres/articleshow/84050181.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Hyderabad||Re-purposing anti-diabetic drug may help against Covid, says research||HYDERABAD: Re-purposing an anti-diabetic drug might be useful in Covid-19 treatment, stated a research by a University of Hyderabad incubated startup. Re-purposing approved pharmaceutical drugs provide an alternative approach for rapid identification of potential drug leads. The startup, ReaGene Innovations, completed the process of finding a repurposed drug within a year of funding from Tech Mahindra. As part of it’s research, the startup found that Ertugliflozin — a drug used for type-2 diabetes — seems to possess desirable properties demonstrated by in-silico and in-vitro pharmacological studies for Covid-19 treatment. The researchers proposed that Ertugliflozin is a strong candidate for immediate repurposing for treatment of Covid-19. “It has immense potential to treat Covid-19 infection, and our research proves its efficacy in the test-tube assays,” said Dr Uday Saxena, chief executive officer (CEO) of ReaGene Innovations which co-founded with Dr Subramanyam Vangala and Dr Sreedhara Voleti, MD of INDRAS. The outcome of this research was recently published in a journal (BioRxIV) and a patent was filed both in India as well as PCT. “We have found a molecule that can potentially attack Covid-19. We have applied for a joint patent,” said Nikhil Malhotra, global head of Makers Lab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/re-purposing-anti-diabetic-drug-may-help-against-covid/articleshow/84049782.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Alwar girl gangraped since 2019 after cops refuse to register FIR||ALWAR: A 20-year-old girl from a village in Alwar was allegedly gangraped continuously for over two years by four accused who had shot the video of the incident and blackmailed her. Shockinlgy, the Malakheda police in Alwar district had refused to register an FIR when the rape survivor had gone to file a complaint in 2019. This had resulted in further harassment and sexual assault of the survivor by the four accused until last month. On Thursday, the police arrested two of the culprits for allegedly kidnapping and raping the girl two years ago after she gathered courage and lodged an FIR on June 28. A third person also has been arrested for harassing her. According to the FIR, the girl had gone to Alwar to appear for an examination in April 2019 and was met by one Vikas Chaudhary who was known to her. “Vikas and his friend Bhuru Singh Jat kidnapped and drugged her and, later, raped her at a house situated at MIA area on the outskirts of Alwar. She alleged that the guard of the housing locality had also connived with the accused. In the FIR, she has named Vikas and Bhuru and stated that two others had also raped her,” Alwar SP Tejaswini Gautam told TOI on Thursday. The survivor had approached Malakhera police in May 2019, but the police refused to register her complaint. Since then, the main accused Vikas and others had been harassing her and also raping her. Last month, on June 25, the survior was shocked when another man named Gautam Saini sent her a video clip of her rape and started blackmailing her and demanded to meet him on June 27. “Saini asked her to meet him. She then came to me on June 28 and an FIR was lodged in this connection, based on which, we arrested Vikas and Bhuru,” the SP added. Two days after lodging the FIR, police arrested the two main accused in this connection, while two are still at large. Police also arrested Saini who had sent the video to the girl. Saini had randomly received the video clip and the number of the girl. “He has no role in the rape, but started blackmailing her since June 25. He has been booked under IT Act and other sections of the IPC,” the SP said. The probe has now been shifted to Alwar City Mahila Thana. The role of policemen who refused to register an FIR will also be investigated by Alwar (rural) circle officer Amit Singh. “He will look into the role of policemen whom the girl has claimed to have approached in May 2019. If anything is found against them, action will be taken,” she added. The case is similar to the Thanagazi kidnapping and rape case of April 2019, which had made national headlines, when the survivor was harassed for a few weeks after the police refused to register a case.

Teachers said that the state has divided students into three groups and started broadcasting bridge course lessons through Doordarshan and TSAT for class 3 to class 10 students. While students of class 3 to class 5 are placed in one group, class 6 and class 7 students are clubbed together and class 8 to class 10 are made part of a group. “The bridge course will most likely continue for one month,” said Chava Ravi, general secretary, Telangana State United Teachers Federation adding that 50% of students have attended digital classes on the first day. Through the state has started digital classes, it is yet to release guidelines and instructions pertaining to digital classes. Further, teachers said that instead of bridge courses, it would be better if the state creates modules of all subjects and share them with students so that they can go through them and revise what’s taught in previous years. “Once modules are shared, worksheets can be given to know the understanding of a student,” said M Ravinder, president of the Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation, Hyderabad. Ravinder added that students are facing difficulty in sending in their attendance. “Last year, they used to send a photograph while watching TV to mark the attendance. But, now with lockdown lifted, students are not having a smartphone at home and are unable to send their attendance,” he added and said that on average about 50% of the students attended classes on day 1. The private budget schools, which have also started online classes for class 1 to class 10 from Thursday, said that about 60% of students have attended classes. “In higher classes, about 85% to 95% students attended online classes. When it comes to primary and upper primary, about 40% attended classes. On average, about 60% attended classes on day 1,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president of the Telangana Recognised School Management Association (TRSMA) adding that it would take at least a week for all students to join classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/around-50-students-attend-online-classes-on-day-1-of-new-ay/articleshow/84049875.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Pune||Hundreds from clinical trials left in lurch with no CoWIN certificates||PUNE: They were the first to receive the Covid-19 vaccines in the country. But hundreds who were part of clinical trials continue to have only rudimentary proof of their fully vaccinated status — in some cases, mentioned on a single sheet of paper with the letterhead of their trial site. Volunteers said they’ve been unable to get CoWIN certificates despite having received two doses during the tests. The CoWIN certificates — tamper and forgery-proof — are verifiable digital documents. With reports of fake vaccination camps emerging from parts of the country, volunteers also said certificates from trial sites may not pass muster with authorities. Dr Padmanabh Keskar, a Pune volunteer who has been asking authorities for a CoWIN certificate for the last three months, said, “My wife and I were part of the Covishield phase 3 trials. We were given two doses during the trial in October-November 2020. After the trials, the hospital site gave us a certificate of vaccination with their letterhead. But this certificate carries no value for international travel. Even insurance firms are now asking for CoWIN certificates, which have a secure QR code to protect it from falsification.” There are indications the government is working on a solution for the volunteers. A senior health ministry official said, “CoWIN certificates can only be provided to those who are vaccinated through CoWIN. But this matter is being looked into.” There is, however, a key problem. Dr Samiran Panda, chief of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said, “In randomized double blind placebo-controlled clinical trials that test efficacy of a vaccine, one group of participants belong to the intervention arm and are given a vaccine. The other group are the placebo arm. During the trial period, participants and researchers remain blinded to this allocation. In other words, they remain unaware of who gets what. Once the trial is completed and data analysis finished, the unblinding process is undertaken for volunteers to know which arm they were a part of.” Dr Panda said they have taken up the certification issue for both groups. Those who were in the placebo arm should be vaccinated on priority because of their involvement in the trials, he said. Dr Ashish Bavdekar, principal investigator of Covishield trials at KEM Hospital, said, “We have been getting requests for CoWIN certificates from trial participants. While we have given each of them a document of proof, verifying their two-dose vaccination, we have also been assured by SII the issue has been taken up with ICMR, which has communicated the matter to the health ministry."  A source from a top city hospital, which was a Covishield trial site, said many from the placebo group were given two options after the unblinding process: either take the vaccine later through the government’s immunization programme or get the shots provided by the vaccine manufacturer for the placebo study participants. “Almost all of them took the vaccine through the latter route,” the source said. He added those in the placebo arm, who were later given letter-headed documents as proof of vaccination, are now requesting CoWIN-generated certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hundreds-from-clinical-trials-left-in-lurch-with-no-cowin-certificates/articleshow/84048139.cms||Neha Madaan

However, it is facing a vaccine shortage now. On June 29, 74,852 were vaccinated. It dipped to 62,962 the next day. On Thursday, 44,959 were given the jab. In Dehradun, only 7,964 were vaccinated on Thursday while 10,799 and 11,000 were vaccinated on June 30 and 29, respectively. Meanwhile, the state received 60,000 doses of Covaxin while 2.40 lakh doses are expected to arrive on Friday. Explaining the reason behind the shortfall, director of National Health Mission, Dr Saroj Naithani, said, “The idea is to do intensive vaccination. As soon as we are getting vaccines, our teams are conducting quick drives across the state. Hence, we are falling short. Uttarakhand is among top five states in terms of vaccination. The Centre has to provide vaccines to the other states as well. So, it might take a day or two to dispatch our order.” One of the doctors at the health department said, “May be, it is due to the issue of storage. We have a polio drive also going on.” In June, with 14,83,185 doses of a total 43,31,688, 34% of all doses had been administered.  Meanwhile, the state recorded 124 positive cases and one death on Thursday taking the tally of overall positive cases to 340379 and deaths to 7324, a death rate of 2.15% which is second highest in the country. Incidentally, the state’s 88% backlog deaths (218) which were reported on Wednesday were from hill districts. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-achieves-34-vaccination-in-june-to-receive-more-stock-today/articleshow/84046081.cms||Shivani Azad

Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation executive engineer Shrikant Sawane said Dhore, municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil and others were among the first to pay and park their vehicles. Sawane the policy would be implemented at more spots across the twin township based on the initial feedback. “We have identified and shortlisted around 450 parking spots on 13 major roads and under 10 flyovers in the civic limits. Pay and park will be implemented across all these areas. On Thursday, as the contractor had a staff shortage, we were only able to open a few spots. The number of paid parking spots will increase gradually,” he said. NCP’s Pimpri Chinchwad unit president Sanjog Waghere, opposing the move, said the civic administration was “making a mockery” by implementing paid parking at a time when citizens were facing hardships due to the pandemic. He was referring to the skyrocketing fuel prices. “We had opposed the move in the past and we will continue to oppose it. The civic body should cancel the policy at the earliest. If not, we will stage a protest,” Waghere said. Hourly parking charges have been fixed at Rs 5 for two- and three-wheelers, Rs 10 for cars, Rs 15 for tempos, Rs 25 for minibuses, and Rs 100 for private buses and heavy vehicles such as trucks. The policy, which got the general body’s nod in 2018, was approved at January’s standing committee meeting. The roads where the policy will be implemented include Nigdi-Walhekarwadi Spine Road, Telco Road, Spine Road, Nashik Phata-BRTS Road, Aundh-Ravet Road, Thergaon Gaothan Road, Prasundham Society, Nashik Phata-Moshi Road, the old Pune-Mumbai highway, Kalewadi Phata-Dehu-Alandi Road, Tilak Chowk to Big India Chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-flags-off-pay-and-park-policy-ncp-opposes-scheme/articleshow/84050145.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Hyderabad||Soon, students in Telangana can access courses from different state universities||HYDERABAD: Students in the state will soon have the flexibility to study courses from different state universities while being enrolled in one. This, as part of a cluster system proposed by the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE). The council convened a meeting with all state university vice-chancellors on Thursday wherein the cluster system was proposed to enable sharing of courses, credits, and resources between the universities. “There are certain courses and resources that are available in specific state universities and not in others. We are exploring the possibility of enabling students to pursue courses from across state universities. Credits earned for those courses will be transferred to the parent university,” said commissioner of collegiate and technical education department, Navin Mittal. A committee will be constituted to work on the modalities and study the intricacies in transferring credits and sharing resources available in the cluster system. Following this, Dr BR Ambedkar Open University (BRAOU) vicechancellor, Professor Seetharama Rao, proposed that all universities may utilise e-resources and course material made available by BRAOU. During the meeting, members unanimously decided that Osmania University (OU) will conduct a common entrance test for all post-graduate courses of all six conventional universities for AY 2021-22. In addition to this, members also decided to conduct a common entrance for PhD admissions. “TSCHE will constitute a committee which would go into modalities of PhD admissions, after examining present process of selection, UGC guidelines,” said TSCHE chairman, Papi Reddy. The common almanac for academic year 2021-22 was approved for six state universities. Members decided that colleges with zero admissions for two consecutive years shall not upload details on degree online services Telangana to avoid confusion among students. “It was also decided to introduce BA honours as a pilot project in four undergraduate colleges among university constituent colleges and government colleges. Osmania University would monitor the programme and take the initiative to design the curriculum,” Papi Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/soon-students-can-access-courses-from-across-state-varsities/articleshow/84049692.cms||---

Dinkar Temkar, director of the council, said while there may not be a need for syllabus cuts if schools reopen, it may be required if they remain closed for an extended period. “The proposal for a 25% cut announced last year was limited to the previous academic year. In case schools do not open for a longer time, the state may cut the syllabus for this year too. This will be the same as last year,” said Temkar. At present, teachers are conducting bridge courses. Temkar said new books will be distributed in eight to 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-25-syllabus-cut-for-class-i-to-xii-likely-again/articleshow/84057215.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Hyderabad||SEC: No need for separate Sputnik Light phase-3 trials||HYDERABAD: In a move that could speed up the rollout of single-dose Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik Light in India, the subject expert committee (SEC) has told Dr Reddy’s Laboratories that it need not conduct a separate phase-III trials in India. The expert panel has said that data from the Russian phase-III trials would be enough to grant a marketing authorisation (MA) to the vaccine. “After detailed deliberation the committee recommended that the firm should present the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of Phase-III clinical trial of Sputnik Light that is being carried out in Russia for considering the proposal for grant of MA in the country,” SEC said at its meeting on June 30. “As the safety and immunogenicity data of component-1 in the Indian population has already been generated in the country in another trial, there seems to be inadequate data and justification in conducting a separate similar trial,” said the expert panel that advises the Drugs Controller General of India. Dr Reddy’s had conducted a bridging phase-II and III study on1,600 volunteers in India before being granted an emergency use authorisation for Sputnik V in mid-April. The committee also noted that a phase-III efficacy trial on Sputnik Light is ongoing in Russia and the efficacy data is yet to be generated. Confirming the development, a Dr Reddy’s spokesperson said the company has been asked to “submit the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from phase-III clinical trial of Sputnik Light in Russia to SEC.” Dr Reddy’s, the Indian partner of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), had submitted a proposal to the SEC seeking grant of MA for Sputnik Light along with the interim safety and efficacy data generated from the phase-I and II clinical trial of the single-shot vaccine in Russia. The company had also submitted a protocol for conducting a phase III clinical trial in India. Sputnik Light is the onejab version of the two-dose Sputnik V and comprises just component-1 — human adenoviral vector Ad26. The single jab vaccine showed an interim efficacy of 79.4%, while the two-dose Sputnik V showed an interim efficacy of 91.6% and real world efficacy of 97.6%, as per its developers Gamaleya Research Institute and RDIF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sec-no-need-for-separate-sputnik-light-phase-3-trials/articleshow/84049634.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: After 46 hours, L&T restores CCTV access to cops, NMC||NAGPUR: Following the high court’s intervention, Larsen and Toubro (L&T) restored access of city police and civic authorities to around 3,700 CCTV cameras on Thursday, 46 hours after servers were switched off. On Tuesday at 9pm, L&T had unilaterally withdrawn access to the CCTV cameras for cops and civic authorities over pending payment issues. The access was restored on Thursday at 7pm. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who had written a strong letter to NMC and Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL), had been taken aback by the abrupt decision of the private service provider to deny access to CCTV cameras. This was barely two hours after his meeting with the top L&T officials on Tuesday. The meeting had discussed upgrading the CCTV software further and installing 64 unused CCTV cameras at Kalamna and Hudkeshwar. Soon afterwards, that the top cop got the message from the L&T official about their decision to withdraw access over an unresolved payment issue. As the top brass started alerting police stations to remain on toes, especially near vital installations and sensitive locations, three major incidents took place in the city on Wednesday where investigations were hampered in the absence of CCTV access. A 69-year-old woman was robbed at Pandey Layout, and some armed robbers attacked a family at Pardi. The third case was of two ATM thieves decamping with cash Rs3.65 lakh from a Central Avenue bank. This incident was old, but cops could not access CCTV footage when they got a complaint about it on Wednesday. The CP said such an abrupt decision to withdraw access had serious implications on the law and order, safety and security of citizens, Covid management and enforcement of the lockdown. “City police have taken a strict view about this arm-twisting measure by the private operator. This was certainly not the way to resolve a grievance, by threatening security of the city and citizens,” he said. Meanwhile, a day after L&T stopped streaming videos to the Command and Control Centre, NSSCDCL served legal notice to it for breach of service conditions, said chief executive officer Buvneshwari S. The CEO also told TOI that the firm had stalled screening of video footage by sending a letter of suspension of service for want of payments. Buvneshwari said NSSCDCL has no outstanding of payments. “We have already paid our payment of Rs103 crore in advance. NSSCDCL has no shortage of funds for the projects it launched in the city,” she said. A L&T representative refused to comment but said the service provider would follow the guidelines of the court and its orders. Sources said the firm has to recover over Rs150 crore from department of information technology and home department. According to sources, the home department has not paid its dues of Rs68 crore, while DIT has defaulted on around Rs100 crore. The NSSCDCL CEO said just video on system was off and Command and Control centre was shut, but surveillance system across the city was continuing. “Cameras installed at important squares, roads, WiFi service etc were all on but our access to video footage was cut off,” she claimed. Even recording is also going on, she said. The centre at NMC’s administrative buildings monitors footage of 3,698 CCTV cameras installed at 660 junctions and generates e-challans to violators. This work too was adversely affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-46-hrs-lt-restores-cctv-access-to-cops-nmc/articleshow/84046131.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to install house indicator signboards||CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation is all set to install house indicator sign boards in all sectors of the city. The MC engineering department has completed tender process of most of the works and even allotted some of these in different sectors. The civic body authority will spend around Rs 3 crore on this project. Sign boards are being installed as per the specification and design approved and issued by the urban planning department of Chandigarh administration. The matter was sent to the urban planning department due to heritage status of the northern area of the city and its architectural significance. According to the specifications, the boards will have only house numbers and nothing else. “These will be blue and white in colour in sectors and will have only house numbers with no lane number of sectors and other related details. Therefore, these will be quite small and thin boards but quite visible due to the colour combination and glittery plates and strips,” sources said. Since the Building and Road (B&R) wing of the MC engineering department has three different divisions, each division initiated and completed the tender process on its own level instead of going for a combined tender. Therefore, division wise tenders were opened and allotted in some sectors. Engineers concerned will ensure laid down specification and design on the ground. “All the work to install sign boards is being done from the financial quota of ward development fund (WDF) of each municipal councillor. Municipal councillors have given approval to spend money from their ward quota for these works. Accordingly tenders were floated. In some areas, works have been allotted, while in some, allotment process is still continuing,” an official said. The issue of installing house number sign boards is quite old, but due to design and specification issues, it could not materialise earlier. Since the UT’s urban planning department has recently given its nod, the MC started the process and has now allotted the work in some areas to install the boards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-to-install-house-indicator-signboards/articleshow/84048155.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Jaipur||Jab crisis: Rajasthan govt starts process to buy 1 lakh Sputnik V vaccines||JAIPUR: Facing a severe shortage of Covid vaccines, the state government has now decided to buy Sputnik V vaccines from Dr Reddy’s to scale up the inoculation drive and ensure people are vaccinated before the third wave emerges. Eleven districts in the state could not administer even a single dose of vaccine due to shortage on Thursday. On Wednesday, eight districts did not vaccinate a single person. The state has received 5.4 lakh doses, but they are in the process of being distributed. The state government had repeatedly written to the Centre urging them to increase the allocation from 65 lakh to 1.5 crore doses for July. Since 75 lakh doses alone are required to adminsiter second doses to beneficiaries, the government has said it would be difficult to give the first dose in July if they only get 65 lakh vaccines from the Centre. “We are procuring 1 lakh doses of Sputnik V. The process has been initiated," said health secretary Siddharth Mahajan. The state government is chalking out a plan on where to provide Sputnik V. It will be administered in two doses like Covaxin and Covishield. One dose of the vaccine will cost Rs 1,000 to the state government. The Russia-developed vaccine is now available at Jaipur National University (JNU) hospital in the city. On Friday, the Centre is expected to supply 2 lakh doses. Health department officials said that they have received 2.41 crore doses of vaccines till now. Out of those, more than 2.44 lakh doses have been administered. This happens because while 11 doses are packed in each vial, they are counted as 10. The health department administered the vaccines carefully and prevented the extra dose from being wasted. Officials said that though 10% wastage is permitted, the department had prevented such wastage. At JNU, around 200-250 people are getting vaccinated by Sputnik V daily. “Sometimes, full families with their friends and relatives come for vaccination in groups of 50-70 at a time," said Sandeep Bakshi, chancellor, JNU. Besides, Fortis Hospital has also received some doses of Sputnik V. But they are using it to vaccinate in-house staff and not providing it for the public as of now. The hospital official said that they would do so when they get more doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jab-crisis-raj-govt-starts-process-to-buy-1-lakh-sputnik-v-vaccines/articleshow/84050190.cms||---

According to data from the state commercial tax department, tax evasion worth Rs 2,551.25 crore was detected in Gujarat over the past four years i.e. since the rollout of goods and services tax (GST). According to SGST officials, fraudulent transactions worth Rs 17,992.18 crore took place in Gujarat, in some 705 cases. The department has so far arrested 65 persons in connection with various tax fraud cases.  Evasion is a serious concern since the GST rollout, especially because Gujarat is a manufacturing-heavy state, it has already been losing revenue since the new tax regime was rolled out. “The majority of these cases were fake billing scams, reported from places across Gujarat including Ahmedabad, Surat, Unjha, Valsad, Rajkot and Junagadh, among others. The SGST department has ramped up detection,” said a senior official of the state commercial tax department. Sources said a huge number of GST registrations were illegally obtained and one of the major reasons was no physical verification was done at the time of the GST rollout. In December 2020, the GST Council made physical verification of a business premises mandatory, for the purposes of obtaining GST registration to curb fake billing fraud. The SGST department has also been using big data analytics to fish out illegally-obtained registrations to prevent further fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/4-yrs-of-gst-evasion-worth-rs-2551cr-detected-in-state/articleshow/84048175.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Delhi||Uptick in passenger traffic at Delhi airport; most flying out for meeting family, or vacations||NEW DELHI: After a sharp drop in passenger traffic at Indira Gandhi International Airport due to the lockdown and flight restrictions, footfall has increased considerably — from around 18,000 passengers per day in mid-May to 62,000 by the end of June. On Thursday, the airport said that a survey found that post-relaxation of the lockdown, 48% of the passengers flying in were ‘visiting friends and family’, followed by those on vacation (25%) and for business (19%). In stark comparison, a similar survey after last year’s nationwide lockdown was lifted in June 2020, only 2% of travellers were flying on vacation, with a large chunk being those visiting friends and family members, followed by people on business travel. Data from the airport showed that in addition to a sharp increase in domestic air travel, international travel had also picked up in June. The average international passengers per day has increased from around 4,500 in mid-May to 7,500 by June-end. Domestically, in May and June this year, Mumbai, Patna, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad, Leh, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Jammu & Kashmir were the top 10 destinations from Delhi. IGIA has been conducting regular internal surveys to determine passenger trends, while also counting the daily passenger load. Pre-Covid trends (June 2019) showed as many as 44% of flyers were vacationers, while 41% were visiting friends and family. Airport officials said that only Terminal 3 is functioning. While Terminal 1 or Terminal 2 will not be made operational at the moment, moves to make the latter operational may be considered once the daily passenger count crosses one lakh passengers per day. “Last year too, we opened T2 after the footfall crossed one lakh,” said an official. To ensure safety for passengers, the airport operator, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), has taken measures such as auto dispensing hand sanitisers, disinfectant mats at strategic locations and biomedical waste bins in the terminals. Sneeze shields have been installed at all the counters and CISF checkpoints to minimise the risk of virus transmission. Airport officials said the disinfection of the terminals and deep and frequent cleaning of high-touch areas, such as lifts, handrails, glass walls, trolleys, CUSS machines, counters, washrooms and boarding gates using disinfectants and UV light towers is also being done. The airport also recently introduced ‘luminometers’ to ensure that high-contact surfaces were free from any living or dead bacteria, fungi or microorganisms. Luminometers are devices that are sensitive enough to even measure weak emissions of visible light coming from a sample by means of a photomultiplier tube. When using one of these devices, a test swab, after a surface is cleaned, is put in a luminometer. It measures the intensity of the light emitted from the sample and displays the test result in Relative Light Units, which is used to determine if the sample shows the presence of microorganism. Officials said such rapid-result tests like these assisted DIAL to take immediate remedial action in response to a failed test result. “The test surface or area with a failed test result can be re-disinfected and retested, ensuring that hygiene management goals are achieved,” explained a DIAL official. With measures like in place to assure travellers, another survey done recently determined that 99% of flyers using IGIA felt ‘confident’ of flying out form the capital’s airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/uptick-in-air-traffic-most-flying-out-for-meeting-family-or-vacations/articleshow/84048169.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Pune||Slight uptick in production, employment: MCCIA survey||Pune: The monthly industry and services survey by Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA) found that productivity and employment improved as the district unlocked in June. The survey noted that concerned over high raw material prices and poor demand remained. Production and employment, which took a massive hit during the lockdown in April and May, increased by 3% and 7%, respectively. The marked rise in employment, per MCCIA, is likely due to parts of the services sector such as restaurants and bars, which employ more people than industries, opening for longer hours. These figures are a far cry from the highs of employment and productivity that the region reached in February this year. Challenges towards getting those levels — and beyond — remain, particularly with MSMEs still struggling to increase employment and production. In micro enterprises, monthly production levels in June increased by around 8% to 57%, but small and medium-scale enterprises remained stagnant at 72%. .MCCIA also added that demand-side economics also need to be addressed, as well as speedy vaccinations for all. “Demand has to increase if the February peak is to be reached and surpassed. People need to have disposable income. Vaccinations need to increase. Those who have received both doses should be allowed to be fully mobile,” Prashant Girbane, MCCIA director-general, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/slight-uptick-in-production-employment-mccia-survey/articleshow/84048177.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

A Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesperson said that there was an intermittent signalling issue — interlocking failure — between Sikanderpur and HUDA City Centre section, affecting four stations of the Yellow Line. Due to this glitch, train services were not available on this section from 2.30pm to 3.30pm. DMRC claimed that the rest of the corridor was running normal throughout this period and services were also restored on the affected section from 3.30 pm onwards. Sources said that there was slow movement of trains on Blue Line in the Dwarka sub city due to theft of cable at sector 9, Dwarka and there were no major disruptions. DMRC also said that its trains are running almost empty as it is carrying only 10-15% of its passenger capacity in view of the Covid restrictions imposed by the authorities.

---||Nagpur||June 2021: Conditions better than before first wave in Vidarbha||NAGPUR: The Covid figures for June 2021 indicate that the pandemic is moving towards becoming endemic in Vidarbha. Less than 18,000 cases were reported, despite a nearly ten-fold increase in the number of tests. The death toll came down to 624 as compared to over 5,000 in May. Overall, the conditions are even better than before the first Covid-19 wave, which started in July 2020. The figures received from all 11 districts in Vidarbha show the average daily test count was about 30,000 during June, while average daily case load was 575. The average test positivity rate in Vidarbha during this month was 1.91%, which is lowest ever for any month in the pandemic. According to WHO, test positivity below 5% for at least two weeks is indicator that spread is under control and government should relax restrictions. Interestingly, for most of the month, Vidarbha enjoyed near normal relaxations in markets and public places. Still, Covid-19 cases kept on declining. The location analysis of the new cases in last ten days of June shows that they are coming from unexposed villages, and tribal areas, which mean cities and towns have already reached their endpoint. Second important indicator is occupancy of beds. Vidarbha region has less than 1,800 patients under treatment now, which is lesser than even after the low point of first wave. Most of the patients are recovering under home isolation, so beds are vacant in almost every part of the region. Recovery rate is at 98%, which is again highest for any month in pandemic. Overall, June has given the biggest cheer for the region. Despite this, the government has imposed restrictions following threat of Delta plus variant. Doctors said that the restrictions need to have a logical end point. “Now, people can protect themselves through vaccination. This was not possible earlier. Those who are unvaccinated could continue to work as long as they get tested at least every week. We have testing mechanism ready. We can resume activities by wearing masks at all times,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. Pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar cited example of Singapore. “Singapore has stated that Covid will be treated like any other endemic diseases like flu. There will be no goals of zero transmission.

A Baramati police team, led by inspector Namdev Shinde, took Pandey into custody from a lodge on Bhigwan Road in Baramati. “Pandey worked as a business development officer at a prominent hospital in Mumbai,” Shinde said. After the scam came to light, the Kandivli police registered a case against five suspects, including Pandey — on the run since then. “Pandey was untraceable as he was constantly changing his locations. On Wednesday, senior inspector Babasaheb Salunkhe of the Kandivli police informed us that Pandey was in or around Pune,” Shinde said. While checking the suspect’s location, the police tracked him to a lodge along Bhigwan Road. “We laid a trap and took him into custody,” Shinde said. Shinde said a Kandivli police team reached Baramati on Thursday. “We handed Pandey over to them,” he said. With Pandey’s arrest, all the five suspects named in the FIR in connection with the fraudulent vaccination camp have been nabbed. The suspects had charged the society members in Kandivli Rs1,260 per dose but it was later revealed that the vaccines were not brought from the authorised sources and the seals of the vials were broken. “Police probe revealed that the suspects had conducted fraudulent vaccination camps at more than five locations in Mumbai,” Shinde said. Two more arrests were made in the fake vaccination scam on Thursday even as the 11th FIR was recorded in connection with more than a thousand employees of a gold trading company in Andheri (East) being given the shots. Mumbai police have asked the BMC to seal the Charkop-based Shivam Hospital which is allegedly at the centre of the scam.

While the first information reports (FIRs) were filed by the authorities in most cases, 58 were registered by the affected girls at police stations across the state, Manisha Biraris, programme officer (Child Protection) of the women and child development department, told TOI. “The department had previously stopped at least 250 child marriages a year. Most were prevented in the rural parts of Marathwada. Child marriages in the drought-prone districts has increased after the lockdown was implemented in March 2020,” Biraris said. Their teams posted at the district headquarters were tipped off about the child marriages and their members arrived in time to avert them, Biraris said. Some child marriages were reported from semi-urban and urban areas too, she added. Biraris attributed child marriages to the parents’ loss of income, girls staying at home since schools were closed and the low cost of weddings due to curbs on guest numbers. Hamid Dabholkar of Maharashtra Andhshraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS), whose organisation prevented five such marriages in the last two months, said they too had observed more child marriages in the lockdown period. “Many parents are arranging marriages of their minor daughters, but the number of minor boys getting married is negligible. Parents want to marry off their young daughters as quickly as possible because of societal and financial pressures,” he said. Dabholkar said jobless migrants are returning to their villages from urban areas and such families consider girls a burden. “Secondly, the girls are at home as schools have shut due to the lockdown norms. Parents want to marry off their daughters instead of investing money in their education,” he added. Anuradha Sahasrabudhe, director of Dnyana Devi Childline, said, “There is no money with many families, no food, and there are no schools. Parents, especially in the rural areas, think they can save money if their daughters are married off early.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/560-child-marriages-foiled-in-state-during-lockdown/articleshow/84050207.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra sanctions Rs 141 crore for climate change project||MUMBAI: In view of rising sea levels and its impact on coastal communities, the Maharashtra government on Thursday sanctioned Rs 141 crore to enhance the community’s resilience to climate change. The project will be implemented in the coastal districts of Sindhdurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad and Palghar up to December 2025. “This year we shall work on rejuvenating 500 hectares of degraded mangrove areas in these districts. Another 35 hectares of degraded coral reefs in Malvan taluka in Sindhdurga will be rejuvenated by translocating healthy coral communities to these areas,” said Neenu Somaraj, deputy conservator of forests (Mangrove Cell). Around 40 villages have been identified for training and providing alternate livelihoods. Initially Panvel and Uran had been selected for the programme but had to be dropped as the coastal areas have been extensively developed. These were replaced with Alibaug and Shrivardhan in Raigad district and Guhaghar in Ratnagiri district. In the next couple of years in all 3,100 hectares of degraded mangrove land will be rejuvenated. Mangroves serve as a natural barrier against storms and tidal waters. The agriculture department will carry out watershed development programme for 600 hectares. ‘Enhancing Climate Resilience of Indian Coastal Communities’ is a United Nations Development Programme – Green Climate Fund activity. Two states along the eastern coast _ Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and Maharashtra on the western coast have been selected for this programme. The Maharashtra government will receive Rs 86 crore as grant from the GCF and the state in turn will provide Rs 141 crore spread over the next five years. While the forest department will expend Rs 100 crore, the agriculture department will provide approximately Rs 19 crore and the fisheries department Rs 17 crore. The mangrove conservation cell plans to set up crab hatcheries in Sindhdurg to help create sustainable livelihoods. The others being training villagers to cultivate fish to used in fish tanks for display, fish fertilisation centre, fish food production house and dairy centre and paddy cultivation. “We shall be creating a network of institutions for coastal governance. The objective is to integrate the perspective of the public and private sectors into adaptation to climate change, plans and resolutions,” said Somaraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sanctions-rs-141cr-for-climate-change-proj/articleshow/84052193.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh spends sleepless nights||CHANDIGARH: With the power demand touching 381MW, which is the highest in this summer to date, the breakdown in supply and crippling electricity infrastructure made city residents spend sleepless nights. For the past two to three days, different parts of the city have been facing regular unscheduled power cuts of six to 10 hours. With the population projected to grow at a high rate, the UT electricity department will face a tough challenge in providing uninterrupted power supply. Amit Kumar, a resident of Sector 40, said they have been facing unscheduled power cuts in the afternoon and at night for the past three days and the helpline numbers were of no use. Jasbir Randhawa, a resident of Sector 35, said there was a power outage for over four hours on June 29 night and again for three hours on June 30 night. For the past two weeks they have been suffering low voltage problem too, he added. Megha, a resident of Sector 46, echoed his views. “Not only power cuts, but voltage fluctuations are also troubling our locality. Low voltage can damage electrical appliances too,” she said. However, UT superintending engineer (electricity) Anil Dhamija said there was no power shortage. “The administration has sufficient power and outages in certain areas are because of local breakdown and technical faults. The electricity demand touched 381MW on Wednesday, which is the highest this summer,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-spends-sleepless-nights/articleshow/84048187.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Similarly, with states such as Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh still continuing with the travel restrictions, private bus operators said less than 10% of their vehicles were going out of Maharashtra. “We are not running any inter-state buses for now,” Shekhar Channe, vice-chairman-cum-managing director of the MSRTC, said. An official with the MSRTC-Pune Msaid inter-state operations had been resumed for cities such as Bijapur, Ganagapura and Bidar in Karnataka. “We were set to start services to Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Gujarat from later this week. If these states ease restrictions, we will immediately start bus operations,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msrtc-stops-bus-services-to-karnataka/articleshow/84048184.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||Feeding strays: Activists hail ‘balanced’ order||New Delhi: Animal activists welcomed Delhi High Court’s order on Thursday acknowledging the right of stray dogs to be fed and for citizens to feed them while ensuring others were not harassed. The court said such an act struck the right balance between compassion and ensuring the dogs were fed only at designated feeding points without inconveniencing citizens. Animal rights activists said while a 2009 high court judgment had directed the creation of feeding points across Delhi, the lack of enforcement was behind the growing quarrels in the city between people feeding stray canines and those opposing such undertakings.Animal rights activist Gauri Maulekhi said the high court’s order only added more strength to the 2009 judgment of the same court while also making sure that common people were not impacted by dogs being fed. “For feeding to take place safely and for citizens to be allowed to feed freely, designated feeding spots are important. This is to prevent dogs being poisoned or dog feeders being beaten by angry people in the area,” said Maulekhi, stating Delhi High Court had acknowledged that compassion needed to be shown to stray animals. She added that it was the duty of the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) to ensure swift implementation of the order.Sonya Ghosh, who has been demarcating feeding spots across Delhi on behalf of AWBI for several years, said progress in this regard had been slow owing to the stiff resistance from residents’ welfare associations. However, this court order was positive for all involved, she said. “Past judgments and this one all recognise the importance of dogs to society, some even acting as service dogs for people. Citizens need to be allowed to feed them, which is why several feeding sites in a colony are necessary and the judgment highlights that. However, AWBI needs to mediate whenever RWAs are reluctant to allow the identification of such spots,” said Ghosh, who also recalled facing this sort of resistance in various places.Atul Goyal, president, United Residents’ Joint Action, an apex body of RWAs, noted that past problems were mostly due to limited or no feeding spots assigned in colonies. Better cooperation was required among civic bodies, RWAs and citizens who want to feed strays, he said. “People feed dogs outside homes or in parking areas frequented by people. This is inconvenient to residents and leads to quarrels. Once feeding spots are designated, it becomes easier to monitor them,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/feeding-strays-activists-hail-balanced-order/articleshow/84048198.cms||---
---||Nagpur||High court slams Maharashtra government and L&T, asks them to resolve dispute||NAGPUR: Expressing concerns over safety and security of citizens due to access being stopped to 3,700 CCTV cameras, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday directed the Maharashtra government and Larsen and Toubro (L&T) to sort out their dispute over payments within 15 days. The directives came after amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar moved an application for urgent circulation in two suo motu PILs (No. 5/2016 and No. 7/2019) quoting media reports that all CCTV cameras stopped functioning after the company stopped its servers operating those cameras as its dues of Rs 135 crore weren’t cleared by the government. He pointed out that the company’s move had put the safety and security of lakhs of citizens into jeopardy, as the cameras installed all over the city used to capture the footage 24x7 which is regularly monitored by the police and other security agencies for investigations. “If monitors and TV screens go blank, the police will be unable to control and monitor criminals’ activities and ensure smooth carriage of vehicular traffic. It may also have cascading effect in the sense that slowly and gradually, the members of the public would come to know of the loss of control over criminals’ activities by police and a sense of fear will grip the whole society,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said. The judges requested additional government pleader Deepak Thakare to coordinate with the Maharashtra Information Technology Corporation and filed a detailed affidavit that included a statement regarding clearance of undisputed dues to L&T within 15 days. Slamming the L&T, the bench said its move not only interferes in performance of public duty by the authorities, but is also prima facie questionable in law, when the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and police submit that the company doesn’t own the entire hardware including CCTV cameras. “If this claim is true, a question would arise whether any maintenance agency like L&T has a right to stop access and if not, how such an act would be viewed by law?” Earlier, L&T’s project manager Ajay Ramteke informed that Rs 135 crore was outstanding against Maha-IT. “We haven’t stopped anything. The CCTVs are functioning and video recording is also being done. Only step that has been taken by the company is stopping their access to the police and other concerned parties,” he said. Before adjourning the hearing till July 16, the judges clarified that they aren’t aware of terms and conditions between the company and Maha-IT. “What we have become aware of the consequence of a particular act committed by L&T. The consequence has been submitted by amicus curiae and rightly so, is deleterious to the public interest. If no access is provided to police, the very purpose of installation of CCTV cameras would be defeated and it may also go against the spirit of the directions issued by HC regarding their installation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-slams-govt-lt-asks-them-to-resolve-dispute/articleshow/84046173.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Dehradun||Study shows 'association of cloud bursts with forest fires'||DEHRADUN: A recent study conducted in collaboration with professors of Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University and IIT Kanpur indicates association of cloud bursts with forest fires. The study finds a connection between the formation of tiny particles, the size of a cloud droplet on which water vapour condenses leading to the formation of clouds and also contributing to forest fires. It measured the activation of these particles, known as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) which is size of 80-nanometres found in the atmosphere, and studied their impact on high-altitude cloud formation and complexity of local weather phenomenon under the influence of different weather conditions in the ecologically-sensitive regions of central Himalayas. It found that the number of CCN particles peaked during forest fire incidents in the Himalayan region. The project was funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, and was conducted at the Himalayan Cloud Observatory located at an altitude of 1.7 km in Badshahithaul, Tehri Garhwal. It is India’s highest altitude located cloud observatory, established in 2018, to understand the cloud formation and its dynamics. The observatory’s principal investigator Alok Sagar Gautam shared the study findings with TOI. “The CCNs formation and deformation occur continuously in the atmosphere. They take surrounding water vapour and form droplets at a height, which means that CCN at a particular time might be contributing all its particles to formation of rain droplets," said Gautam, who led the study and is an assistant professor in the department of physics at HNBGU. "We have observed that whenever there is rainfall, the CCN count is low. Also, during the forest fires episode, we found CCN to be five times more than normal. The five times CCN concentration might contribute to the formation of the cloud and also, the formation of the rain droplets in the atmosphere. It won’t disappear immediately, but will show its impact on the weather as well. After forest fires, if we witness excessive rainfall, it might be due to the higher CCN concentration in the atmosphere,” Gautam added. The findings are based on the data collected in 2018-19. It took three years to complete the study. The data was collected only from Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/study-shows-association-of-cloud-bursts-with-forest-fires/articleshow/84046194.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Goons use mobile phones given in jail to target rivals||NAGPUR: The benevolent measure of providing six Android cell phones and nine landlines by the Central jail authorities to prisoners for communicating with their family members and advocates seems to have been misused by gangsters to intensify their rivalries. The phones were provided to replace the ‘mulaquat’ or meeting system which was suspended due to Covid fear. As a fallout, some top gangsters are being shifted to different jails to diffuse the tension caused due to spreading of rumours against each other, passing on information to aides, threatening rivals and so on. On Wednesday, don Ranjeet Safelkar was shifted to Chandrapur jail after someone spread rumours about his murder a day ago. On Thursday, Safelkar’s close aide Bharat Hate was shifted to Washim jail while another gang member Hemant Gorkha was sent to Akola. There is unconfirmed information about Safelkar being manhandled by Hate. Jail authorities are planning more transfers of top goons to different prisons in the state. They had been on toes since Safelkar and his gang, booked in a series of offences including Manish Shriwas murder of 2011, stepped inside. Safelkar’s arch rival Santosh Ambekar too is lodged in Central jail. In the past, Safelkar and Ambekar had tried to eliminate each other. It is learnt that a gangster booked under MCOCA had sent a voice message to his rival in north Nagpur after the formers’ brother was thrashed in a gym. The same gangster was beaten up in the jail around a month ago. He had also tried to commit suicide. There was also unconfirmed information about fight between gangster Sumeet Thakur and another goon Bhuru. The jail authorities had a tough time searching a body after a lawyer received a call from the jail stating there was a murder. SP Anup Kumre of Nagpur central jail admitted the probable misuse of the 15 phones as he too has received several unconfirmed inquiries and information. “Each jail guard is supposed to manage substantial phone users in the barracks at a time. Many times the jail guards may be unaware of the content if the callers speak in code language or quickly send voice messages,” said Kumre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/goons-use-mobile-phones-given-in-jail-to-target-rivals/articleshow/84046335.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||Three-wheelers hold commuters to ransom in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Auto operators demanded higher fares from helpless commuters in the city as private buses largely stayed off the roads on Thursday. Long queues of commuters were seen at most of the auto stands during morning peak hours as the government has eased several restrictions like extended hours for commercial establishments, reopening of malls and salons and increase in the number of employees in offices. The government buses were packed in absence of private buses and this forced many commuters to scramble for autos to reach their destinations. Taking the advantage of such high demand, the auto operators demanded exorbitant fares from the commuters. Some commuters alleged that with a few private buses plying, the auto operators chose the peak morning hours for maximum gains. “I paid Rs 22 to come to MG Road from Phoolbagan. This is double the actual fare on normal days. The auto drivers were demanding random fares because there were too many people in the queue and lesser number of autos,” said Vineet Agarwal who was coming to his office on MG Road. Similar scenes were seen in different other parts of the city, where there were long queues at auto stands since morning. The commuters said that there was no particular rule followed by the auto operators — some carried two passengers while others carried four passengers. At Garia, two most popular routes followed different policies. While the autos on the Garia-Tollygunge route via Ranikuthi plied with four passengers, those plying on the Garia-Golpark route via Jadavpur took two or three passengers. The fares too fluctuated. On the Airport-Ultadanga route, the commuters paid between Rs 30-40, depending on the time they were travelling. On the Garia-Tollygunge route, the commuters paid the old fare Rs 16 for one trip. Such was the competition among passengers that the auto operators on two separate routes clashed at Airport Gate 1. The autos plying to Baguiati alleged that they were being denied opportunity to pick up passengers by those headed for Ultadanga. This led to a scuffle between the drivers of both the routes, after which the local union leaders had to intervene. At Behala Chowrasta, the commuters headed for Rashbehari were asked how many of them wanted to travel in an auto. “We gave them the option of choosing the number of passengers provided that the total fare for four passengers got shared,” said a leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/three-wheelers-hold-commuters-to-ransom/articleshow/84048248.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Delhi||Delhi: What lies beneath? Dhansa Bus Stand first underground metro station with parking||NEW DELHI: The Dhansa Bus Stand station of Delhi Metro’s Grey Line is going to be its first ever underground station with an entire underground floor for parking. The parking facility will be integrated with the main station area and commuters will be able to park their vehicles and take the elevators and escalators directly to the station concourse. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, said on Thursday that the station had been designed as a four-level underground structure. It will have the platform at the bottom level at an approximate depth of 18 metres, topped by the concourse and then an entire floor for parking above it with the roof level at the surface level. “The parking lot will have space for around 110 cars and 185 two wheelers,” revealed Dayal, adding that DMRC would retain the possibility of property development at the ground level in the future. There will be one elevator at the centre of the parking lot, apart from two staircases and two escalators, each connecting directly with the unpaid area of the concourse below. Two entry and exit facilities will connect the parking lot with both the surface above and the platform below. “In the office hours, when the passengers are in a hurry to board the train as early as possible, the location of the parking lot at such close proximity to the concourse will be a major benefit,” reasoned Dayal. “Local residents will also benefit because the adjoining areas are extremely congested and have limited space for parking.” Dayal also said that work on the 1.8-km Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand section was almost complete and efforts are being made to have it opened sometime later this month after complying with statutory requirements. “With the completion of this section, the Dwarka-Dhansa Bus Stand corridor will be 6.1-km long with four stations. This extension will immensely benefit the residents of interior areas around Najafgarh,” the DMRC executive director said. Delhi Metro currently operates parking lots in around 100 stations. “The Dhansa Bus Stand parking facility can be considered a major design-based improvement since no other underground metro station in the network has such a facility. Currently, the Hindon River station of the Red Line (Dilshad Garden-Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda) has a basement parking facility though it is an elevated station,” said Dayal. The New Delhi station of the standalone Airport Express Line has a multilevel parking lot above the station. Grey Line, Delhi Metro’s shortest corridor, connects Najafgarh with the rest of the city, thanks to the interchange facility with the Blue Line (Dwarka-Vaishali/Noida Electronic City) at Dwarka. There are three trains deployed on the corridor and total travel time on this section will be six minutes and 20 seconds. The extension to Dhansa Bus Stand was scheduled to open by December 2020, but work suffered due to the Covid outbreak. Construction resumed only as part of the lockdown relaxation. The 1.8-km stretch with one station was then slated to be completed by May, but some work remained to be completed. According to sources, the final safety inspection of the section is likely to take place on July 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/what-lies-beneath-first-underground-stn-with-parking/articleshow/84048261.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Even though rapid urbanisation has affected the growth, residents still eagerly wait for these berries. But this year, due to the lockdown and fear of contracting Covid-19, there are no takers. “In the summer we would usually forage for the berries. That has stopped for two years due to lockdown and Covid fear,” said Rohit Kanoujia, a resident. “Usually we would go to the town's outskirts where these berries are available. This year, we are missing its taste,” said Rakesh Rawat, another resident. “These berries are not only tasty, but also full of medicinal properties,” Rajendra Rohilla, a local, pointed out. 'Kingod' (Berberis aristata) has a sweet and sour taste and is considered useful for diabetes, skin disease, jaundice and eye infections. 'Hissar' (Rubus ellipticus) or Himalayan Raspberry is considered useful for treating fever, colic cough and sore throat. Increasing urbanisation has led to reduction in the availability of these wild berries as well. Mussoorie-Hathipaon road, Camel’s back road towards Gunhill, Tehri bypass road towards Jabarkhet and Cloud end are a few areas around the town where these berries are still available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-takers-for-mussoories-seasonal-wild-berries-this-year/articleshow/84046253.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Fake Covid positive report racket unearthed in Khamgaon||NAGPUR: The residential medical officer (RMO) at Khamgaon civil hospital in Buldhana district has unearthed a fake Covid-19 positive reports racket involving a ward assistant. As per the police complaint filed by RMO Dr Nilesh Tapre on Thursday, the ward asistant collected swab samples of Covid patients admitted in the hospital so that fake positive reports could be generated for some staffers and labourers of a leading food factory. The company provides Rs1 lakh assistance and 14-day paid leave to staffers infected by Covid-19. Khamgaon police have booked ward assistant Vijay Rakhonde and one Chandrakant Umap under sections 420, 188, 269, 270 and 34 of the IPC and section 51 (B) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Rakhonde has been arrested while search is on for Umap who is absconding, police told TOI. Dr Tapre told TOI that he smelled a rat after going through names of people coming for RT-PCR tests. “Some names were getting repeated on the list after every 2-3 days, which made me think why these people are conducting tests so many times in such a short interval? Later, I came to know that they were labourers of a big food factory in Khamgaon,” said Dr Tapre. After going through the list of positive patients, Dr Tapre realized that majority of them were from the food factory. Dr Tapre asked his junior doctors to carefully check people who come for testing and to keep a watch on positive patients admitted in the hospital. “On June 30, Dr Prachi Nisal who was on duty told me that four patients who were admitted two days ago were complaining of pain in their nose. When we checked them, the patients said their swab sample has been collected. It’s not indicated to collect swab samples of positive patients on the second day. So, we started an internal investigation,” said Dr Tapre. “The security staff confirmed that no outsider had entered the ward throughout the day but ward assistant Rakhonde was there during his non-duty hours. Patients too confirmed that Rakhonde had collected their swabs on second day of admission,” said Dr Tapre. According to Dr Tapre, Rakhonde has admitted that he used to collect swabs of positive patients admitted in the hospital and supplied them to one Chandrakant Umap who used to pay him Rs5,000 per positive sample. “He had handed over four swab samples he collected on June 30 to Umap and was supposed to get Rs 20,000 on Thursday,” the RMO said. How the racket worked - Ward assistant used to collect swabs of confirmed positive patients on second/third day of admission - He used to sell these samples to a person for Rs5,000 per swab - Through these samples, fake Covid positive reports were to be generated for employees/staffers of a factory - The company provides Rs1 lakh assistance and 14-day paid leave to Covid patients - Ward boy has been arrested while one person involved in this scam is absconding||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fake-covid-positive-report-racket-unearthed-in-khamgaon/articleshow/84046381.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Citing Covid-19, the gang charged five-six times the ticket price from passengers. The accused are suspected to have duped around 200 people in the last one year. According to DCP (railways) Harendra Singh, the accused have been identified as Shashi Bhushan and Hemant. “A complaint was filed by a passenger who had to pay Rs 15,000 for a ticket that was priced around Rs 3,600,” he said. The victim had to go to Chennai by GT Express on June 29, but was not able to get a confirmed ticket. He met a person at New Delhi Railway Station who took him to a shop in Kamla Market and took Rs 3,600 for a confirmed ticket. The gang asked him to come after three-four hours. When the complainant reached the office to collect ticket, the accused asked for Rs 15,000 claiming the prices had shot up due to Covid-19.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Gastrectomy is not cosmetic surgery, Insurer told to pay up||AHMEDABAD: The National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission held that treatment for gastrectomy cannot be considered a cosmetic surgery and asked an insurer to reimburse payment for hospitalization for it. Hiralal Chaudhary from Himmatnagar underwent a gastrectomy and a heavy flap of fat was removed from his belly in March 2010 at a hospital in Ahmedabad. He claimed Rs 3.45 lakh towards Mediclaim, but the National Insurance Co Ltd paid him only Rs 69,545 and rejected the rest of Chaudhary’s claim saying it was a cosmetic surgery and was not covered under the health insurance policy. Chaudhary challenged the deduction before the consumer forum, which ordered the insurer to pay Rs 2.30 lakh more to the consumer. The insurance company took up the issue before the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, which upheld the forum’s order for reimbursement. The insurance company challenged the reimbursement order before the national commission, where the company’s advocate reiterated that gastrectomy falls under cosmetic surgery and is hence excluded from the policy. Chaudhary’s claim was already allowed to the extent it was covered by the policy. The company also argued that Chaudhary cannot be considered a patient of morbid obesity. However, the commission accepted Chaudhary’s argument that medical science is not an exact science and is to be seen with reference to an individual patient. Chaudhary was a slim and trim person, he had a Body Mass Index of 38.9 kg/m2. He had been gaining weight since 1986 and was also diabetic and a hypertension patient on medication. He had undergone gastrectomy and cholecystectomy surgery because of his morbid obesity and gallbladder disease. The commission observed that by no stretch of the imagination can it be said that Chaudhary underwent a gastrectomy for cosmetic purposes. Moreover, there were no terms or conditions in the policy that he was not entitled to get the reimbursement for gastrectomy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gastrectomy-is-not-cosmetic-surgery-insurer-told-to-pay-up/articleshow/84048265.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Many app cabs go offline to run shuttle services||KOLKATA: The revised fare in app cabs came into effect in the city from Thursday. But the surge fare overshadowed the fare revision with demand for cabs exceeding its availability during the peak hours when there were more commuters on roads due to further relaxations in restrictions. Many cabs went off line to operate shuttle services and earn a quick buck. However, the commuters were happy to get cabs on their doorsteps. Online Cab Operators Guild secretary Indranil Banerjee said, “The fare was higher during peak hours to attract more cabbies. But the cabbies went offline as the fare flattened and many ran shuttle services.” The transport secretary sent a “show-cause” letter to Uber, one of the two major app cab aggregators. According to the transport department, Uber officials got in touch with Paribahan Bhawan officials, expressing their idea of increasing the fare. “We asked them to write us a letter, explaining the rationale behind it. But before they intimated it officially, they revised the fare,” said a senior transport department official. The fare from New Alipore to Howrah was being shown Rs 650, almost double the regular fare. “Since I did not have much luggage, I chose a bike taxi instead,” said Swarup Ghosh, who was travelling to Tatanagar by the morning train. With the progress of the day, the fare remained high. From Bhawanipore to Shyambazar, the fare was as high as Rs 450. “It was a bit shocking as I always travel by Metro, spending a much lower fare,” said Jolly Basu, a bank employee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-app-cabs-go-offline-to-run-shuttle-services/articleshow/84048312.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

They had fled after an armed robbery in Hyderabad. The Nagpur railway platform was turned into security fortress after getting an alert from the Hyderabad police along with photographs and details of the arms dealers. The swift action by the multiple teams led to the detention of Anilsingh Gambhirsingh (25) and Shivam Bhupendra after the train arrived at platform 1 at 3pm. The duo who supplied guns that were used in robberies and murders in the past, were netted from coach S-1. “As the train had only five minutes halt, several teams were pressed into action to search the coaches,” said senior divisional security commissioner of RPF, Central Railway, Ashutosh Pandey. Earlier, city police chief Amitesh Kumar had ordered crime branch DCP Gajanan Rajmane to prepare for an operation after getting the alert from Hyderabad police. A gun supplied by the duo had been used to rob a woman at Hyderabad by their accomplice, Shera. The two have several offences, including murder, registered at Chandigarh. The two would masquerade as security guards in different cities before committing crimes and supplying guns procured from UP. Hyderabad police have reached city to take custody of the duo from city police crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gunrunners-fleeing-after-armed-robbery-in-hyderabad-netted-at-nagpur-railway-station/articleshow/84048268.cms||Soumitra Bose

On Wednesday, state authorities told the Bombay high court that it would start trials for home vaccination of the bedridden, from Pune district. Officials here said mobile teams have already reached out to scores of people living in care homes and assisted-living centres. In Pune city, the teams have vaccinated 4,544 people living a dependent or neardependent life at 53 care homes over the last month, including Nivara, Palash, Savali, Umed, Kalpavruksha, Spandan, Pratiti and Devataru. In Pimpri Chinchwad, 100 bedridden citizens have received their shots in special drives that started on June 1. Mobile vaccine teams reach out to care homes, officesFree vaccine drives are also being conducted at government offices, non-governmental organizations and for those in the unorganized sector — vegetable vendors, shopkeepers and daily wage workers who are also part of the potential “superspreader” category of beneficiaries “So far, we have vaccinated 25,000 people living and working at various government and non-government units. We aim to reach out to another 50,000 more in the coming days, including a large chunk of potential superspreaders,” said Vaishali Jadhav, PMC’s Covid vaccination chief. A PCMC official said, “We have developed the ‘mi jababdar’ (I’m responsible) mobile app for citizens who wish to sign up a person with special needs for vaccination. We contact these people accordingly.” Among prominent government departments that had free vaccine drives on their premises are the income-tax department, meteorological office, MahaMetro, NDA, DRDO, MSEDCL, BSNL, C-DAC, Pune airport, the groundwater and forests department and the region’s food corporation. Officials from the PMC said they plan to cover another 70 government offices within the next few days. As for NGOs, groups such as the Hamal Panchayat and some organisations working in Pune’s red-light areas have also been covered. The special drives have included professions in which people come in contact with a large number of people — traders, their staff, vegetable vendors, fuel pump attendants, couriers and food-delivery agents. “To make the Covid-19 vaccination campaign more effective, it was decided to inoculate superspreaders by running special programmes to reduce risk of infection as they come in contact with many people daily due to the nature of their job,” Jadhav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mobile-teams-reach-out-to-bring-jabs-to-care-homes-offices/articleshow/84048264.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Schools had threatened to dismiss admissions this year over non-reimbursement of the fees. The state education department released funds of Rs 50 crore to all districts in state said, deputy director of education, Dinkar Temkar. “The districts received their quota of funds in March itself. The funds are now being disbursed to schools. We are still making more provisions for clear further dues so that the schools are not burdened,” he added. The Independent English Schools Association (IESA) had decided not to enrol RTE students over the dues and also due to reduction in the reimbursement of fees in the forthcoming academic years by nearly 50 %. Advisor to IESA, Jagruti Dharmadhikari, said, “The reimbursements from the government are long due and even if they have released some amount there is still about Rs 250 crore pending. We have not received fees of regular students and on top of that there is a massive cut in reimbursements for the forthcoming years.” In May, the director of primary education issued a notification, stating that, for the year 2020-21, the RTE fees reimbursed would be Rs 8,000 per student as opposed to Rs 17,670 in the previous year. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, had stated that the decision to cut RTE reimbursements for schools was taken due to a paucity of funds in state government as Covid-19 was being prioritised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-hands-out-rs-12-3cr-to-schools-for-rte-fees/articleshow/84048329.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

They said that the state government could conduct the exams online through MCQ format. The exam has been postponed twice since April . Abhinav Pawar, a parent of a Std VIII student, said, “The education sector has been unusually affected due to the pandemic.

This is leading to confusion among the students.” A zilla parishad teacher Smita Dabhade, said, “The exam is conducted based on the enrolments so the exam council should make arrangements for online exams to the students who have enrolled.” Commissioner of Maharashtra State Council of Examinations, Tukaram Supe, said, “The online classes have disrupted the schedule of the school students and they have not got enough time to prepare for the scholarship exam.

---||Nagpur||Rare malformation of lung fixed by blocking blood flow by Nagpur doctors||NAGPUR: In a rare feat, Nagpur doctors fixed malformation of lung by discontinuing blood flow to the abnormal growth and saved life of a two-year-old boy from Akola. The boy was suffering from bronchopulmonary sequestration, which is a rare condition wherein lung tissue develops without being connected to the airways, sometimes inside the lung and sometimes outside. According to doctors, a small part of the left lung of this boy was not connected to the airways and was receiving abnormal blood supply from the aorta. As it was not connected to the airways, it failed to contribute to respiration. Generally, treatment of choice in such cases is surgery. But, the boy, who was suffering from this condition for the last 2 years, was very weak. So doctors decided to go in for a different, rare, and unique path of treatment. “Two-year-old Armaan had repeated episodes of cough and cold along with very poor diet and was underweight. He weighed only 7kg at 2 years of age which was significantly less than expected at this age as ideal weight for this age is 13kg,” said Dr Ashar Khan, who treated the boy along with paediatric cardiologist Dr Manish Chokhandre and Dr Mohd Shakeel Sheikh. “We decided to use a novel technique of blocking the blood flow of this segment by inserting small ‘coils’. This procedure was done without general anaesthesia with sedation to the patient,” said Dr Khan. A small tube was inserted through his groin in a manner similar to how angiography is done. The abnormal feeding artery was intubated and coils were inserted into it to block the blood flow. Overall, 9 such coils were inserted and finally a good result was achieved. Following the surgery, the patient was discharged the next day. “We performed this process in November 2020. Since then, we were closely following up the patient. Armaan slowly started gaining weight and his troubles with having repeated cough and cold got remitted. He had no further episodes of hospitalization over the last 6 months. Presently, he weighs 10.5kg and leads a normal life,” said Dr Chokhandre. The patient’s father is a labourer and their financial condition is very weak. As the family was beneficiary of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, the entire surgery was funded by the state government. Interestingly, a recent CT scan of the kid showed complete resolution of the abnormal segment and significant improvement in the functioning of the normal lungs. Doctors claimed this was a rare procedure and only about 25 such cases have been reported worldwide. A senior pulmonologist in city said the process is novel and not explained in any textbook. He also suggested doctors to send the case to peer review journal. Novel process Bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) is a rare malformation usually removed via surgery Surgery was risky in case of this patient as he was underweight and weak A small tube was inserted through groin and abnormal feeding artery was blocked (fig1) As blood flow stopped, the abnormal segment was completely resolved (fig 2) Doctors revealed details of case after following up patient for over 6 months Entire surgery was covered under Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rare-malformation-of-lung-fixed-by-blocking-blood-flow/articleshow/84046400.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||And you thought nutri biscuits are only for humans…||AHMEDABAD: Feeding exotic animals and birds at the world’s fastest-made jungle safari at Kevadia at SoU is not a usual affair. The diet of these animals does not consist of mundane chicken pieces, raw spleen or liver leftovers from nearby butcher shops or even cooked grain. Their menu consists of specialized food pouches — each customized to the animals and birds within the safari enclosure.  Jenny the Giraffe, ‘Bhim’ the hippopotamus, and animals like zebra, ostrich, wallaby, emu, raccoon dog, marmoset monkey, capuchin monkey, llama, among other animals require special food and are served packed tuna food pellets, gravy pouches, special hay and processed muesli to improve their bowels. As snacks, the young animals are also fed special ‘nutritional biscuits’. For starters there is always pet food, multivitamin mix powders, cool mint and water served with ‘mineral blocks’. Birds like the macaw, cockatiel, pheasants, black swan and Amazon parrots are served packed and processed seed mix, fruit blends and bird nutrition supplements. TOI has a copy of a recent quotation that the Kevadia zoo had issued to vendors. The zoological park has 1,250 animals and birds with 600-odd exotic animals that have been brought from South America, Australia, South East Asia and Africa and other parts of the globe.  Gujarat’s forest officials claim that the specialized processed food is a necessity as the animals are “exotic” and can’t be served raw local food because of fear of local infections. The new jungle safari at Kevadia is spread over 375 acres at seven different levels. Apart from the exotic animals there are endangered species like the Asiatic lion, the Royal Bengal tiger and leopard among others. “We don’t differentiate between the exotic and the indigenous species at Kevadia . All animals are served the same food. Since the exotic animals have been brought from different regions of the world, they cannot immediately adapt to the local food, and till they can adapt, such specialized packed food is to be served,” said a senior forest official at the Kevadia zoo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/and-you-thought-nutri-biscuits-are-only-for-humans/articleshow/84048383.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Around 9pm on June 29, guards at the building told me about the dead dog when I went to feed the strays there. People claimed that the RWA threw out the body after getting to know about it. CCTV cameras just cover the first floor, so any unusual activity taking place upstairs does not get recorded,” she added in the complaint. DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “We have registered a case under IPC Section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc, or any animal of the value of Rs 50) at Defence Colony police station.

According to police, the accused, identified as Chun Chun Mehto, a daily wager from Begusarai in Bihar, had lured the little girl on the pretext of "buying her a chocolate". CCTV footage later led to the 19-year-old man's arrest. The girl’s mother, a resident of Govindgarh area, had lodged a complaint at Kotwali police station on June 28 after she went missing. The girl was playing outside and didn’t return home till late evening. Her parents — father, a construction worker and mother, a domestic help — searched for her in the neighbourhood. A dedicated police team was thereafter deployed to trace her. According to police, the search began with scanning of CCTV footage of cameras installed around Govindgarh where the minor used to play. Local criminals were also on their radar for leads. In the process, the cops scanned 438 CCTV cameras in all. The accused was finally spotted with the girl from Govindgarh to Ballupur and then on GMS road after which he was seen seated on a tempo and going towards Prem Nagar. A separate team working with informers received a tip off that the accused was seen near a public school in Govindgarh. The cops thereafter arrested him. The man tried to dodge the cops initially, but later admitted he had been living in the area near the girl’s house on rent. He said that had taken her to Rangadwala near Mitti Beri tea estate where he first violated her and later suffocated her to death. He also took the police team to the spot where he had dumped her body. Proving details about the sections under which the case has been filed, Kotwali's station officer Ritesh Shah, said, “The accused has been booked under IPC sections 359 (kidnapping), 302 (murder) and 376 (rape). The body has been sent for postmortem after which more details will come to light.

Nagpur has vaccinated 7.82 lakh women (46.47%), which is more than Mumbai’s 45%, Pune’s 44% and Thane’s 45%. Mumbai has the state’s highest vaccination at 56.28 lakh doses followed by Pune at 46.08 lakh and Thane 25.80 lakh as on Thursday evening. Nagpur district has 16.84 lakh vaccination doses as on date. Of these, 9.01 lakh doses have been received by men and 7.82 lakh doses by women in the district. Women lagging behind men in the drive is attributed to a range of socio-economic and well-being issues. Former Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (NOGS) president Dr Vaidehi Marathe said initially women too had some doubts and hesitancy regarding Covid vaccination as men. “There were issues like whether it can be taken during menstrual cycle, or will it cause irregular periods, affect planned pregnancy or infertility treatment. These factors deterred women from going for the jab. Also, initially the vaccine was not recommended during pregnancy and lactation, which led to a significant number of women being dropped out from the vaccination drive,” she said. Dr Marathe added that now she doesn’t find hesitancy in the class of women she treats or offers consultancy. “In fact, I am getting many queries especially from pregnant and lactating women if they can take the vaccine,” she said. Consulting gynaecologist and obstetrician Dr Payal Agrawal said though vaccination does not cause side effects in monthly period or fertility, many patients still are in dilemma. “In the beginning, WhatsApp was full of rumours which are still doing the rounds on social media. Then there are certain patients who are pregnant or lactating, who are not sure. Another set of people are worried if it can affect their family planning. Still, there are certain women in rural population, or low income groups avoiding vaccination,” she said. Dr Agrawal added that housewives suffer as they don’t have access to vaccine. “Some housewives are still not vaccinated because of lack of awareness in the male partner. Offices have more men, who are getting the jab at the workplace,” she said. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi too said vaccination at workplace is catering mostly to men. “We have done surveys and identified pockets which need attention and more women participation. Once we have sufficient stock we shall focus on them,” he said. Meanwhile, Joshi added that the district has got allotment of 40,000 Covishield and 4,000 Covaxin doses, of which the city will get 60%. These 24,000 Covishield and 2,500 Covaxin doses are likely to be made available for city beneficiaries on Saturday. Rest would be utilized in rural centres.

The council’s director Dinkar Temkar said while there may not be a need for syllabus cuts if the schools reopen, it may be needed if they remain closed for extended periods. “The proposal for a 25% cut announced last year was limited to the last academic year. In case, the schools do not open for a longer time, then the state may cut the syllabus for this year too. This will be the same as last year,” said Temkar.At present, teachers across the state are conducting bridge course prescribed by the council which will be taught for 45 days.On the lack of books to teach the bridge course, Temkar said new books will be distributed in 8 to 10 days. However, according to educators, the government should not have told schools to collect old books and distribute them to the new students if they were going to start with the bridge course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/25-cut-in-syllabus-for-std-i-to-xii-likely-for-this-year-too/articleshow/84048336.cms||Ardhra Nair

Police have apprehended the two juveniles after conducting a medical examination of the victim.According to the police, the matter came to light when a complaint was received from the shelter home on behalf of the boy. The boy had written in his complaint that he belongs to Uttar Pradesh and had fled his home last month. Later he was rescued by an NGO from a railway station and was sent to this shelter home in North Delhi on June 26. “He narrated that on June 28, another boy from the same shelter allegedly barged into his room at the night and sodomised him. He said when he tried to raise alarm, the boy threatened to kill him. He also warned him not to reveal anything about the incident to anyone,” said a senior police officer. Police said, the next morning, another boy from the shelter allegedly sodomised him inside a bathroom. He also threatened him. “After the incident, the boy went to the caretaker of the shelter home and narrated to him his ordeal. It was then that the staff informed the police and the boy was taken to a hospital for a medical examination, based on which a case under Indian Penal Code Section 377 (unnatural offences) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered against the two boys,” the officer said.The accused boys, both 17-year-olds, were then apprehended from the shelter home. “Legal action has been initiated as per the Juvenile Justice Act,” police said. The shelter home has also filed a report with the child welfare committee and the victim has been shifted to another shelter home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-juveniles-apprehended-for-sodomising-minor/articleshow/84048319.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||NMC collects Rs 42.8 crore property tax in three months of this fiscal||NAGPUR: About 12% (36,123) of the 6 lakh odd property owners in the city availed Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s 10% rebate in property tax for the current year. NMC collected Rs26.17 crore from these property owners. NMC has set a target of Rs250 crore property tax collection for this fiscal. Assistant municipal commissioner Milind Meshram said the civic body offered a 10% rebate from June 14 for taxpayers for the current financial year. From April 1 to June 30, as many as 74,432 have paid a cumulative Rs42.85 crore as property tax. In the same period last year, the property tax collection was Rs21.51 crore. To a query, Meshram said NMC will adjust the 10% rebate in future payments for those who paid property tax before June 14. As per NMC’s tax department statistics, property owners from Laxmi Nagar and Dharampeth zones led the table of those who availed the 10% rebate. Laxmi Nagar zone mopped up Rs6.85 crore, while Dharampeth zone generated Rs6.38 crore tax. Similarly, Lakadganj zone too collected Rs5.16 crore as property tax in the first three months of the current financial year. Meshram said NMC will not provide any more rebates this year. He clarified that the 4% and 2% rebates, which it used to provide for property owners paying advance tax till May 31 and November 30, will also not be on offer this year. Sources said the civic body should also try to recover arrears – which have risen to Rs650 crore – from property tax defaulters. Of the 6 lakh property owners, around 66% or 4 lakh property owners are defaulting on NMC’s property tax. The cash-strapped NMC must put in efforts to recover the mounting dues, which can be used to improve civic amenities in the city, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-collects-rs42-8cr-property-tax-in-3-months-of-this-fiscal/articleshow/84048457.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Beneficiaries wait in long queues as vax resumes after 48 hrs||Prayagraj: Covid vaccination sites across the city and rural areas on Thursday witnessed a heavy rush of eligible recipients to get jabs. The vaccination exercise was resumed after a gap of 48 hours at 44 vaccination sites and recipients were spotted standing in long queues and waiting for their turn. As many as 8,683 doses were administered on Thursday which included 4,144 first doses and 4,539 second doses of the vaccine. Ironically, the shortage of vaccines has already suspended the cluster plan in Sangam city which was supposed to begin on Thursday. Officials of the health department, however, said vaccination exercise was taken up at all city-based 24 vaccination sites and 20 Community Health Centres (CHCs) in rural areas on Thursday . District Immunization Officer (DIO) and Additional chief medical officer (ACMO), Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that the vaccination process was resumed after stock was received from the state capital. He added that jabs were administered to eligible recipients at 44 sites on Thursday. Dr Lal, however, said the cluster plan will be launched in the district once there will be adequate stock and availability of vaccines. On Thursday, recipients who arrived at rural and semi urban-based vaccination centres had to wait for hours to get jabs. A senior health official, meanwhile, said, there are plans to launch vaccination drives in the city after July first week in 80 wards of the city as per the availability of vaccines. He further added that the vaccination under the cluster plan will be held on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday while there would be routine immunization on Wednesday and Saturday. The official also informed that all the 80 wards of the city have been divided into 16 clusters and as many as 10 teams would cover at least five wards in a day.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sugar mill sold cheap, new owner gets Rs 700 crore loans||Mumbai: In the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) case which was investigated on directions from the Bombay high court, the Enforcement Directorate has alleged that MSCB officials sanctioned loans to sick sugar mills and when the mills defaulted on the loans, they were auctioned off to recover the loss. The MSCB officials ensured that relatives or close associates of senior politicians got the mills during the auction at throwaway prices. In August 2019, the Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai police registered a cheating case against past office bearers of MSCB. Subsequently, the ED too registered a money laundering case for investigation where 76 past directors of MSCB (many senior politicians) were named as accused. The ED has found that MSCB auctioned Jarandeshwar Sahakari Sugar Karkhana (SSK) in 2010 at an undervalued price. Ajit Pawar was one of the members of the board of directors of MSCB at the time. Jarandeshwar SSK was purchased by a company, Guru Commodity Services Pvt, Ltd, and leased to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd. A part of the funds towards the mill’s purchase came from Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd, a company related to Ajit Pawar and his wife, said the investigating agency. According to ED, Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd and Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd are proxy owners of Jarandeshwar SSK and actual control is with Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd. Within a month of leasing out the mill, the Pune District Central Cooperative Bank (DCCB), in which Ajit Pawar was one of the directors, had sanctioned a Rs 100-crore loan to Jarandeshwar SSK. Subsequently, over the next few years, an additional Rs 600 crore loan was granted to Jarandeshwar SSK by Pune DCCB and others. A Mumbai-based developer, Omkar Group, had floated Guru Commodity Services along with another Mumbai-based developer, Shivalik Ventures. Funds to purchase Jarandeshwar SSK in 2010 were put together with the assistance of the company linked to Ajit Pawar. Omkar group promoter Babulal Varma is now in jail in a money laundering case related to Yes Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sugar-mill-sold-cheap-new-owner-gets-rs-700-crore-loans/articleshow/84052392.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Goa||Goa: Mining resumption case to come up in supreme court on July 6||PANAJI: The crucial mining matter is likely to come up for hearing in the Supreme Court on July 6. The hearing is likely to decide on the resumption of mining activities in the state, advocate general Devidas Pangam said on Thursday. The last hearing in the case was held on March 17 and the matter was set to be listed on April 7. But since the matter did not come up due to the spike in Covid cases. In February 2018, the Supreme Court had quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases, bringing the mining industry in the state to a halt. Last year, the state government filed a review petition against the order. The mining companies had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. During the Portuguese rule, the appellants (mining companies) were granted mining concessions, which were then converted into mining leases under the act. The SLP had stated that the act should be made applicable from 1987, instead of 1961. The state government had also told the Supreme Court that the companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8A of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) - MMDR Act, they’re entitled to extend their leases to 2037, but that they would abide by the court’s order. The state had said that the mining concessions were converted into mining leases under the MMDR Act from 1987, and consequently the 50 mining leases would be extended to 2037. To restart the mining activities, the state government is in the process of forming Goa Mining Corporation. The file has been moved to the law department for vetting. The state government plans to auction new mining leases through the corporation and restart mining activities in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-resumption-case-to-come-up-in-sc-on-july-6/articleshow/84050499.cms||---

The TMC has set up a 100-bed capacity paediatric ward at a field hospital in a parking plaza along with arrangements for parents. As many as 50 ICU beds and another 50 with oxygen facilities have also been readied at the facility, in addition to stocking of medication and creating infrastructure to combat the third wave, said Sharma. —Manoj Badgeri||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tmc-prepares-for-third-wave-seeks-to-acquire-80-of-pvt-hospital-beds/articleshow/84050427.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra police to start helpdesk for crime victims eligible for compensation||AURANGABAD: The state police headquarters has instructed the officer of all commissioners and superintendents of police (SP) to set up a dedicated helpdesk to assist and guide victims of crime in getting monetary compensation as per different schemes and norms of the government. The move has made the Maharashtra Police the first in the country to take such an initiative. Normally, the social welfare as well as the woman and child welfare departments coordinate to help the victims get compensation under different government schemes. Depending on the degree of excess or brutality committed against the victim, he or she is eligible for the amount defined under the scheme. Additional director-general of police (law and order) Rajender Singh has issued the directives to ensure that the victims are not only made aware of the monetary compensation, but also get the same at the earliest. “We have started the initiative so that all eligible victims of atrocities, sexual offences, acid attacks benefit from government schemes. After registering the offence, victims remain in touch with the police till filing of the chargesheet. If police assists them with the process, we are confident of winning the trust of the victims in particular and the society in general,” he said. He added the decision was taken after he found that in most of the cases, victims are either less or not educated and they fail to take appropriate steps to avail the timely compensation. “Due to the victims lack of knowledge and awareness, the process ends up getting delayed and eventually there is delay in getting compensation,” Singh said. In 2016, the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, was amended and states were required to prepare a model contingency plan for the implementation of the provisions of the Act. Under the Manodhairya scheme, victims of sexual offences, acid attacks and minors girls rescued from flesh trade and prostitution under the immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act are eligible for compensation ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. High court lawyer Prashant Nagargoje said amendments made to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) 1973 in 2008 as well as through Criminal Law (amendment) Act of 2013, made a breakthrough in acknowledging the rights of the victim, while the amendment made in 2009 mandated the states to launch the Manodhairya scheme. Human rights activist and HC lawyer Nihalsingh Rathod said, “Sections 357 and 357-A of the CrPC lay down the procedure for granting compensation to the victims. It is a welcome move and should continue in the years to come”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-to-start-helpdesk-for-crime-victims-eligible-for-compensation/articleshow/84041452.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The proposal was sent to the Centre in February this year, but it is yet to be approved. NMC has sent a letter to the Centre’s NITI Aayog requesting immediate approval as it will help the civic body to prepare the detailed project report of the plan, which aims to beautify the river and make it pollution-free. The plan will include repairs, re-modification and widening of 67 nullahs and three tributaries, which links the city with the river. The three tributaries are Waldevi, Nandini and Waghadi. The effluent is released at nullahs and the tributaries. This makes the river polluted. Hence, NMC has plans to make all the city nullahs straight, widen and increase the depth. City mayor Satish Kulkarni told TOI that it has a plan to divert the water of 67 nullahs in the city directly to the sewage treatment plants (STPs) through the pipeline to ensure the effluent released in the nullahs do no reach the river. “We had already sent the proposal of making Godavari pollution-free to the Centre around four months ago, but we are yet to get Centre’s approval. Hence, we have sent a reminder letter directly to the NITI Aayog, requesting immediate approval to the project,” said Kulkarni. According to a senior NMC official, the Godavari will not become pollution free until we purify its tributaries and nullahs as sewage of the city flows into the river causing pollution. “Hence, there is a need to make all the city nullahs and tributaries pollution-free by removing encroachment, stopping the release of effluents and maintaining the natural depths and widths,” said the official. Rajesh Pandit, an environmentalist and one of the petitioners in the Godavari river pollution case in the Bombay high court, said, “The Godavari is the lifeline of Nashik city and it has huge religious importance in view of the Kumbh Mela held after every 12 years. The river should be made free from pollution and encroachment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-urges-centre-to-approve-rs-1800cr-plan-for-godavari/articleshow/84041521.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Anil Deshmukh discussed transfer of police officers with another minister’||MUMBAI: The former state home minister and his son, citing health concerns posed by Covid, have side-stepped two summons from ED so far in connection with the extortion and money laundering investigation registered against him and some senior police officers. Anil Deshmukh has been questioned once though and officials have searched his residence and other premises in Mumbai and Nagpur. It is the ED’s contention that Rs 4.18 crore in bribes were funnelled into a Nagpur-based trust run by Deshmukh and his son as donations and loans. It was done by routing funds via shell companies and two Delhi-based hawala operators Surendra and Virendra Jain.Pegging payoffs linked to the probe at Rs100 crore, ED said the custody of Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde was required to ascertain the links between police officers and Deshmukh. Palande and Shinde were arrested on June 25. The PMLA court has now extended their custody to July 6. In a reasoned order extending custody of Palande and Shinde, special judge S M Bhosle said, “On consideration of investigation material there was a meeting between the home minister and one of the ministers in respect of transfer of police officers. According to the special public prosecutor, an unofficial list was prepared and investigating agency intended to verify the same from the transferred order issued by the government. Further the statement of accused states that there was transaction related to police officers.” The court said that while the accused had mostly given evasive answers, there was material to show that they were present when discussions were held. “Therefore, I found substance in the argument of the special public prosecutor that the accused persons required to be confronted with (dismissed cop Sachin) Vaze, other witnesses and the police officer, who were transferred,” the court said. The ED said Palande had “admitted” that a meeting was held on March 4 with police officers where discussions about Covid-19 restrictions on bars took place. Palande’s advocate Shekhar Jagtap, however, argued that he was an additional collector appointed as a personal secretary of the home minister and was only performing official duties. Referring to the March 4 meeting, his advocates said the assembly session was in progress then. They said the minister had to discuss various issues with concerned officers before presenting them in assembly. They said the meetings could not be linked to alleged transfer of IPS officers. The ED had alleged that Palande and Shinde had played an active role in money laundering. Palande had coordinated with Waze, DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil to collect money from ‘orchestra bar’ owners in Mumbai, and hand it over to Shinde, it said. Waze had said he had collected Rs 4.7 crore between December 2020 and February 2021 (when government relaxed Covid lockdown conditions allowing bars to operate) and handed it over to Shinde. On Thursday, reiterating Palande and Shinde’s role in the alleged offence of money laundering, the agency said their custody was required as they may be aware of crucial facts since they were in charge of Deshmukh’s affairs. The ED alleged that Shinde had not cooperated and claimed to have neither met Waze nor communicated with him. Shinde’s advocates, Mehul Thakkar and Prashant Pawar, argued that Shinde was only a member of the charitable trust run by Deshmukh with no powers in its management. The investigating agency also said that during its searches several documents and gadgets were seized. “Further income tax returns and bank account statements of both the accused have also been called for further scrutiny and same needs to be confronted with both accused for establishing the money trail and unearthing the proceeds of crime,” the agency said.

The numbers in Mumbai for the corresponding period were 4 lakh cases and 4,000 deaths.The toll in Mumbai on Thursday stood at 21 after 25 deaths were reported on Wednesday. For four days before that, the deaths in the city were below 20. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation officials said that weekly trends on case tallies and deaths are more scientific than the daily trends. “If we conduct more tests on a particular day, we are likely to get more cases,” said an official. Municipal officials on Thursday held a review meeting to discuss ward-wise Covid cases in a bid to reduce the number of cases and fatalities further. At the state level, the Kolhapur circle, which includes districts like Kolhapur, Sangli, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, added 3,266 cases on Thursday as compared to 2,004 cases added by the Mumbai circle (metropolitan region) and 2,610 cases added by the Pune circle. The Kolhapur clusters have registered the largest number of cases for the past five days; the daily caseload has been fluctuating between 2,750 and 3,821. “Districts have been asked to ramp up testing, especially the RT-PCR share in the tests,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/cases-dip-across-state-but-toll-in-mumbai-city-over-20-for-2nd-day-running/articleshow/84057001.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Action plan is ready on paper since 2019, but still no alerts on heatwave||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s existing State Action Plan on Climate Change, which started taking shape in 2011 and was finally released in 2019, outlines measures to prepare for heatwaves in the region, highlighting how the number of heatwave days have only been increasing gradually over the last few decades. Between 1968 and 1999, only three heatwave days were recorded in Delhi, but this year alone four heatwave days have already been experienced. The third consecutive heatwave day was seen on Thursday, with mercury crossing 45 degrees Celsius in parts of the city. While the existing action plan seeks to put in place an early warning system, with agencies tasked to issue alerts in advance for heatwave and severe heatwave days, much like it is done for possible air pollution spike events, the practice is yet to be initiated. A colour-coded system of yellow for hot days, orange for heat alert days and red for extreme heat alert days is also planned under it. Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), which was to issue such alerts, said a new plan was being prepared after considering data from the last decade to make it more robust and accurate. It would likely be released in the next three months, said an official. The plan stated that Early Warning System and inter-agency coordination was required, with a press advisory to be issued for heatwave alerts. “This can be done in print media on orange alert days and in both print and electronic media on red alert days (extreme heatwave alert). A feedback mechanism on heatwave alerts can be established between agencies and social media also put to use,” it added. A yellow alert should be in place if the temperature is expected to touch 41.1 degrees Celsius, an orange alert for 43.1 degrees Celsius and a red alert for mercury expected to cross even that. “In case of an extreme heat event, DPCC will issue heat alerts based on thresholds determined by them,” the plan stated. A senior DPCC official told TOI that the alert system was delayed due to the pandemic. However, work was going on to prepare an updated plan. “The last plan had data till 2010 only, so by the time it was released it didn’t have information about the last decade. We want to look at more recent extreme events and add the necessary changes. A new plan will be released within the next three months and suitable measures can be taken according to it,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/action-plan-is-ready-on-paper-since-2019-but-still-no-alerts-on-heatwave/articleshow/84048720.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Gathered in large numbers outside the main building of the university, the protesters raised slogans before handing over the memorandum to the Bamu administration. Kailas Pathrikar, leader of Association of Non-teaching Staff of Bam, said arrears corresponding to 58 months towards the Seventh Pay Commission benefits have not been released by the government till date. “While almost all government employees have already received the desired pay benefits, non-teaching staffers of the state universities have been waiting for their dues for long. Such discrimination will not be tolerated in future as employees are running out of patience,” he said. Among other demands, Pathrikar said the non-teaching staff of state universities must be brought under the purview of the service rules that are applicable to other government employees. “Representatives of non-teaching staff from different state universities in Maharashtra are scheduled to meet in Pune next week to decide the future course of action. We have already formally raised our demands before the state government that appears to be not listening to us,” Pathrikar, who is also the vice-president of the state-level association of non-teaching staffers of universities, said. Earlier, in September 2020, the non-teaching staff of colleges across Maharashtra had struck work to press for their demand of introducing the benefit of the Seventh Pay Commission. The agitation, which led Bamu to postpone examinations, yielded results with the state government offering the desired benefits. When contacted, Bamu public relations officer Sanjay Shinde said the university has no power to take a call on the demands raised by the non-teaching staff as the same is vested with the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamus-non-teaching-staff-members-renew-their-protest/articleshow/84041603.cms||---

The Sena leader said that the MVA government needs to counter in a strong manner every baseless allegation levelled by the opposition in the state. Raut also targeted governor BS Koshyari while reacting to the Governor’s reminder to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray regarding election for the assembly speaker’s post. Raut said the state has also reminded the governor to sign off on nominating 12 members for MLC posts, which he has conveniently forgotten.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-trying-to-destabilise-govt-along-with-central-agencies/articleshow/84052560.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa Forward Party's fake B Ed certificate allegations baseless, says BJP spokesperson Urfan Mulla||MARGAO: BJP spokesperson Urfan Mulla on Thursday rebutted all accusations leveled against him over fake B Ed certificate racket by Goa Forward Party (GFP) as “false, baseless and malicious”. Addressing media persons, Mulla said that a defamation notice has been sent to the GFP office bearer John Nazareth who had publicly accused him of being involved in the fake certificate racket and that a defamation case will be filed in the court against him soon. Mulla, who crossed over to BJP from Congress late last year, said that while the complaint pertaining to the fake certificates was filed in 2017-18, investigators had found no substance in the case and had given him “a clean chit”. “A task force was constituted by the education department to look into the complaints. Following thorough investigations in the case, the task force submitted its report to the education department stating that there was no substance in the complaint,” Mulla told reporters waving the documents. He also said that the vigilance department had said that the complaint had made out “no grounds for investigating the case further”. “And all this while, I was in Congress; the GFP has no reason to link the case to the BJP,” Mulla said. The BJP spokesperson further pointed out that as the matter was subjudice, his lawyer would seek a gag order from the court. Nazareth had alleged that the fake B Ed certificate racket was operational in at least six schools with Mulla emerging as the lynchpin of the operation. He had also accused Mulla of jumping from Congress to BJP “to seek protection from a vigilance inquiry and criminal proceedings”. GFP hit out against Mulla after the latter spoke out against any likely alliance between the Congress and GFP and also accused Congress and GFP office bearers of corruption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfps-fake-b-ed-certificate-allegations-baseless-mulla/articleshow/84050640.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik: 7% drop in average onion price at Lasalgaon||NASHIK: The average wholesale onion price at the Lasalgaon APMC has declined marginally by 7% over the past five days due to a drop in demand. The average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 1,675 per quintal on Thursday, down from Rs 1,800 per quintal on Monday. The average wholesale onion price had reached Rs 1,950 per quintal on June 21, but started declining thereafter. According to the APMC officials, the demand for onions has reduced in the domestic market. The arrival of fresh onions has started in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which is catering to the local requirement in those states and also meeting demands from north Indian states. As a result, the demand for the Nashik onions has reduced drastically, said APMC officials. Moreover, the supply of onions has also reduced by around 40%. Around a week back, 22,000-25,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at the Lasalgaon market per day on average. The amount has now reduced to 12,000-14,000 quintals a day. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 700 and Rs 2,100 per quintal, respectively, on Thursday at Lasalgaon. Around 12,000 quintals of onions were auctioned. At presently, onions arriving at the APMCs are summer onions harvested in March and April. Unlike the kharif and late-kharif onions, the summer onions have a shelf life of five-six months. Farmers prefer storing the summer onions in hopes of getting better prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/7-drop-in-average-onion-price-at-lasalgaon/articleshow/84041654.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||India||Act against posts targeting Indian diplomats, Male told||NEW DELHI: India has sought action by the Maldivian government against social media posts and articles in the local media targeting Indian diplomats in Male. The government cited the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to say that “malicious and motivated” articles could damage “time-tested” ties between the two countries. In an official communication, India asked the Maldives government to ensure enhanced security for the Indian mission and diplomats and to act, in accordance with local and international laws, against the perpetrators of these “gross violations” of the Vienna Convention. The government said recurring articles in local media and social media posts had targeted the dignity of Indian diplomats and these attacks were malicious and increasingly personal. The government cited Article 29 of the Vienna Convention which says “the person of a diplomatic agent shall be inviolable” and calls upon the receiving country to take appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their freedom and dignity. Some of these articles have, as a source said, alleged that Indian diplomats were being shielded by the local government which remains friendly with New Delhi.  India and the Maldives have enjoyed excellent relations since former president Mohamed Nasheed’s Maldivian Democratic Party came into office. Sources did not rule out the possibility of certain sections of the media targeting India at the behest of the opposition. India also said in the note verbale that these attacks were meant to create animosity between the Maldivian and the Indian governments and also between the people of the two countries. The government also warned Male that such attacks could damage the relations between the two countries. Recalling the preamble of the Vienna Convention, the government said diplomatic privileges were not meant to benefit individuals but to ensure efficient performance of foreign missions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/act-against-posts-targeting-indian-diplomats-male-told/articleshow/84053266.cms||---

The KMC took the decision after traders claimed that they are in no position to pay the tax due to the ongoing Covid restrictions. The traders also demanded an extension of the concession that will give a 6% concession to the owners paying their property tax. Kadambari Balkawade, civic administrator, said, “We have passed an administrative decision to extend the deadline. The citizens and traders can now avail the concession if they pay tax amount before July 31. The financial strain faced by the property tax payers and traders due to Covid pandemic has affected the revenue of the civic body.” On June 30, around Rs 1.5 crore was collected by the KMC through property tax and since April 1, around Rs 17 crore tax have been collected. The property owners have till date received a total concession of around Rs 1 crore. Property tax is a major revenue source for the KMC and for the current financial year the civic body has set a target of Rs 60 crore. “Since the decision has been taken for the first time, it will take some time to make required adjustments in the online tax collection system. We will take six days to make necessary changes in the computerised system of tax collection to make the concession scheme available,” a civic official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-extends-property-tax-concession-plan-till-july-31/articleshow/84041698.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Nine-day-old fighting for life after being thrashed by mother||GHAZIABAD: A nine-day-old baby girl was brutally thrashed and sustained grievous injuries in her head and leg after her mother allegedly tried to chew her leg and hit her head against the wall multiple times. The infant is admitted to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital. Doctors said the chances of survival are low. According to police, the 26-year-old woman is a resident of Nandgram. “She is mentally unstable and her treatment is underway,” police said. The woman’s husband, who works as a data entry operator in a private company, said they got married on February 12, 2020. “On June 21, she gave birth to a baby girl and was discharged from the hospital four days later. But she was upset as she wanted a baby boy. I talked to her and tried to convince her that a daughter is a gift of goddesses Durga and Laxmi,” he said. The man added that on Wednesday, he went to meet a priest along with his mother to fix a date for the rituals of the naming ceremony. “Around 2pm, I got a call from my wife’s brother that she had lost her mind and was beating our child. I rushed home to find her grabbing my daughter’s leg between her teeth. The child’s head and leg were bleeding profusely. I immediately snatched my daughter from her hands and took her to a nearby hospital where doctors referred her to a bigger medical centre,” he said. The woman had attacked the toddler’s genitals as well, the man added. “If the doctors succeed in controlling the infection, my daughter will be saved. She has received several stitches on her head and leg,” he said. After the incident, the man informed his wife’s parents, who took her to a private hospital in Ghaziabad. The man said he was unaware about her mental illness before their marriage and came to know about it only on Wednesday from his brother-in-law, who told him that she had been on medication. “I learnt that she had been admitted to hospital before we got married too, but her family didn’t tell me anything till now. I have not seen such behaviour from her in over a year of our marriage,” he said. Nandgram police station SHO Neeraj Singh said an FIR has been registered against the woman under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder). “She will be arrested once she is discharged from hospital,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/9-day-old-fighting-for-life-after-being-thrashed-by-mother/articleshow/84050610.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Dehradun||Another change of guard in Uttarakhand?||DEHRADUN: In what seemed to be a repeat of the scenario that unfolded in the political landscape of Uttarakhand in March, when Trivendra Singh Rawat was replaced by Tirath Singh Rawat, political circles were abuzz on Thursday with talk of another change of guard at the top in the state. What fuelled the speculation was the fact that chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat,who was urgently summoned to Delhi a day before and met party chief JP Nadda and home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday night -- just as Trivendra was hastily called in the middle of the assembly session in March and met the party leadership prior to his removal – was asked to stay back though he was scheduled to return to Dehradun on Thursday evening. This, sources said, hinted that the party leadership had perhaps made up its mind to replace Rawat with another MLA for the top post. This was necessitated, sources added, as the BJP was not keen to press for bypolls in Uttarakhand. Rawat, who is Lok Sabha MP from Pauri Garhwal, has to get elected to the state assembly before September 10 in order to remain in the CM’s chair. “Even though the decision to conduct bypolls is the Election Commission’s, the BJP is not too keen on it as holding bypolls in Uttarakhand would mean having to organise it in other states too where seats are vacant,” sources further added. Speculations were also rife in Dehradun on possible contenders for the CM's post if Tirath were to make way for another MLA. A few MLAs including tourism minister Satpal Maharaj had already left for the national capital from Ramnagar, where the BJP’s three-day Chintan Shivir was held earlier this week. Amidst the unfolding political developments in Delhi, former CM Trivendra Rawat, too, on Wednesday met Juna akhada chief Avdheshanand Giri in Haridwar. The meeting was seen by political observers as an attempt to pacify the seer community that was reportedly upset with Trivendra over his decision to hold the Kumbh Mela in a curtailed manner. State government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal when asked about the unfolding political developments, said, “The CM had a meeting with the party chief in Delhi and they had an extensive discussion related to the 2022 assembly polls and the preparations required. For any national party leader, going to Delhi is not a big affair, and therefore the CM’s visit should be regarded as a routine visit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/another-change-of-guard-in-ukhand/articleshow/84046698.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Noida||Attack by ‘friends’ leaves Ghaziabad man with intestine injury||NOIDA: A 28-year-old man suffered severe intestinal damage when two of his friends allegedly inserted an air compressor pipe in his private parts on Tuesday. Sandeep Kumar, a resident of Ghaziabad’s Vijay Nagar area is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Noida and his condition is stated to be critical. Doctors have said a part of his small intestines and rectum have burst and recovery could take up to six months. Sandeep’s friends Ankit and Gautam Kumar have been arrested. Police said three of them work at a unit for snack manufacturer in H block of Noida’s Sector 63. Sandeep’s elder brother Subhash said the youth had jaundice earlier and had to undergo treatment for a long time. “On Tuesday, he left the house for work around 7 pm, like any other day. He works as an operator at the unit. He reached at 8 pm and about three hours later, we got information that he has been admitted to a hospital,” Subhash said. He added that Ankit and Gautam inserted an air compressor pipe in Sandeep’s private parts and then released the pressure. “My brother tried to escape but almost immediately, he started vomiting blood. Even after that he tried to run,” he said. Sandeep was first taken to Tripathi Hospital in Sector 119 by other people in the unit and then to ESIC Hospital. Later, he was shifted to Prakash Hospital in Sector 33. Doctors at the hospital said it is a rare case and the youth continues to be in critical. Aruna Reddy, senior resident doctor at the hospital, said when the patient was brought in, his stomach was inflated and part of his small intestines and rectum had burst. “A pipe attached to stomach is being used as an excretory tract for now. Had he not reached on time, it could have been fatal,” she said. The doctor added that recovery might take up to six months. “Till then, a urine bag will be attached to his stomach. He cannot eat anything,” she said. Subhash said Ankit and Gautam told the police that the incident took place while they were “joking” with each other. “But we suspect they were trying to do something else. At the hospital, my brother tried to talk a little. He managed to tell us that he tried to run, he vomited blood and that four-five other men were there and they had been laughing at him,” Subhash said. He alleged that some local goons known to the accused duo have asked the family to hush-up the case. ACP 1 (central Noida) Abdul Qadir, however, told TOI that the duo had an argument with Sandeep and they tried to kill him. While Ankit is from Etah and stays in Ghaziabad’s Vijay Nagar, Gautam is from Bulandshahr and stays in Noida Sector 62. An FIR has been lodged against them under IPC sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 307 (attempt to murder). Both were produced in a court and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/attack-by-friends-leaves-man-with-intestine-injury/articleshow/84050591.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Delhi||Delhi's peak power demand past 7,000 MW after two years||NEW DELHI: With the monsoon delayed and the heat unrelenting, Delhi’s peak power demand crossed the 7,000MW mark on Thursday for the first time in two years. The heat and humidity pushed power demand even beyond the season’s highest of 6,921MW on Wednesday. Apart from the unrelenting temperature, the gradual relaxation of the lockdown in the city has caused a rise in demand for power with standalone shops, markets, malls and offices all reopening. At 3.30pm on Thursday, Delhi’s peak power demand logged 7,026MW, just past the season highest at the same hour the day earlier. In fact, this is only the third year in Delhi’s power history since 1905 that the peak power demand has crossed 7,000MW. In 2018, the figure had breached the 7,000MW mark for the first time, recording 7,016MW on July 10. The following year, Delhi’s all-time high peak power demand of 7,409MW was recorded on July 2. Officials said that Delhi’s biggest demand is expected to be in the 7,000-7,400MW range this year, even though the original estimates revolved around 7,900MW. Last year, the highest demand was 6,314MW, a figure that has already been crossed on six occasions this year — on Thursday and June 30, 29, 28, 24 and 23. Perhaps due to the lockdown last year, the city’s peak power demand was 6,314 MW on June 29, much lower than the all-time high peak power demand recorded the previous year. Moreover, June in 2020 saw the power demand go beyond 6,000MW and reach 6,193MW on June 18. This year, the 6,000MW figure was breached as early as June 10. On June 7, Delhi’s peak power demand of 5,559 at 11.19pm meant the 5,000MW mark was left behind for the first time this season. From June 1, Delhi’s peak power demand has increased by over 40%. Last winter too had seen a higher power demand than the previous cold season. As the capital faced cold wave conditions in January, the demand for electricity also went up and on 23 days in the month, the peak power demand was higher than the corresponding days in January 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/peak-power-demand-past-7000-mw-after-two-years/articleshow/84048750.cms||Sidharatha Roy

At a time when the corporation claimed to have given crores of rupees to the company for garbage collection, it has not spent anything on surveillance. Sources in the department said, “The amount was around Rs 2 lakh that the corporation was supposed to pay per month, but very abruptly they stopped paying the contractor, who then stopped the internet connection.” TOI repeatedly called executive engineer (project) Manoj Sharma but he didn’t take the call. The civic body had installed more than 20 cameras in various parts of the city to keep an eye on the ongoing work at various places. There have been many complaints in the past regarding the BVG company that they picked up trash from road sides instead of going to every house, just to complete their daily weight target. Officials in the corporation had said that they were able to see whether they are actually bringing garbage from home or from the road side. If there was lot of mud, concrete material and stones, that means it was not collected from houses. Officials were able to even count the number of garbage trucks coming every day. But the stoppage of this work shows the lethargic attitude of the corporation. Around four cameras were installed at Dawabkhana, five cameras at Jai Singhpura Khor, four at Jhalana and three at Lal Doongri garbage transfer stations. There are around 13 other garbage transfer stations in the city that were still remaining to be included in CCTV monitoring.

Ansar Jaan, who had a bounty of Rs 5,000 on his head, was arrested from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, said Ajay Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP) STF. According to STF, Jaan was wanted in the murder of one Abdul Khalid in Udham Singh Nagar district. The case dates back to 2011. Police had named four persons, all brothers of Khalid, in the FIR registered in the murder case. Ansar's arrest was made after receiving a tip-off about his location. The Kumaon unit of STF was alerted and a special team was formed to arrest Ansar. During questioning, he told the STF that he had been hiding in Delhi and Moradabad for the last 10 years. "The other accused in the case have already been arrested. However, Ansar had managed an escape after the murder and was hiding since then," said Ajay Singh. Aftab and Anjaar have already been convicted in the murder case and are currently lodged in Haridwar jail. The fourth accused, Ajeem, was nabbed by the Kumaon unit of STF in 2019 and is currently facing trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/murder-accused-on-run-for-10-years-arrested-by-stf/articleshow/84046703.cms||Gaurav Talwar

And over 2,400 of the 3,003 affected families have already vacated their houses in these villages.This was conveyed to senior bureaucrats by officials of the district administration at a crucial review meeting on Thursday that was ordered on the first day of the month to ensure that everything is resolved by July 15.Officials said the villages of Nagla Ganeshi, Nagla Phoolkan and Kishorepur have been completely vacated while only a handful of families in Dayanatpur Khera are left. Being the largest village, only half the families in Rohi have moved out. Majority of people in Nagla Shareef Khan and Nagla Chitar have also shifted. Racing against time, officials have to clear up all the hurdles to pave the way for the foundation stone laying ceremony. “Shifting of the families from the seven villages was the biggest challenge. But it is being achieved smoothly,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate (land acquisition).“At the same time, we have reviewed the progress of the civil and infrastructure development work in Jewar Bangar and have apprised the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority of the pending work,” added Singh, also the head of the nine-member team set up to expedite the entire process.The major civil and infrastructure work being done in Jewar Bangar include three tubewells, the construction of the 16.68km-long road, 22km-long sewerage line, water supply network and site grading. Officials said all the seven residential pockets are nearing completion and the only major work that is left to be done is the construction of overhead tank and providing water supply to the newly developed township.To upgrade and augment electricity supply, YEIDA has pooled in its funds to set up a 33/11 kV substation in the township. “For now, the supply is being provided from the existing substation in Jewar but in the future the township will be self-reliant,” said an YEIDA official. “Rs 5.47 crore will be spent on setting up the independent substation.”Member of the airport monitoring committee set up by the UP government, Mozzam Khan said, “Ideally, YEIDA and the administration should have finished all the work at the site and then asked the villagers to shift. At present, people are being forced to make their own arrangements for water and septic tanks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/airport-project-over-80-work-done-in-jewar-bangar/articleshow/84050636.cms||Shalabh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: To check Covid thick tail, BMC to focus on hotspots||Mumbai: The ‘thick tail’ of the Covid-19 second wave as well as a slight rise in cases in some localities over the last few days has prompted the BMC to step up vigilance. Five to 10 of the worst hotspots will be studied before a series of localised measures are taken up over the next few days, said BMC officials on Thursday. Cases in Andheri (K-West) have been toggling between 36 and 98 in the last week, with 83 cases registered on June 30. The doubling period here is 488 as compared to the city’s rate of 733 days. Cases in P South ward (Goregaon) rose from 38 on June 23 to 52 on June 30; the doubling rate here is 566 days. The other wards include D ward (Grant Road), H West (Bandra), R North (Dahisar) and S (Bhandup). A review meeting was held on Thursday to discuss these wards. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said they were planning to focus on the hotspots where cases had not declined as expected in the last month. “We will analyse why this is happening and adopt local measures to check the spread,” she added. While cases in Delhi dropped from the second wave peak of over 25,000 a day to around 100 now, cases in Mumbai have for a month been oscillating between 600 and 900 daily. D ward’s assistant commissioner Prashant Gaikwad said, “In our ward, cases were around 25, but are now between 25and 40 per day.” Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said a “minor trend of blips” or increase in cases is underway in some wards/localities. “Hopefully, this is a trickle that will not build up,” he said, adding that “we opened up too fast and too much.” The D ward review found cases were once again from highrises. “Our analysis showed positive cases either had a travel history (or were people who wanted to travel) or were domestic helps,” said Gaikwad. In some wards, extra steps are already being implemented. K West ward’s assistant commissioner Vishwas Mote said, “No one is allowed in the ward without a rapid antigen test.” Also, while the BMC has permitted one vaccination centre in every corporator’s ward, K West has 21 centres despite having only 13 corporators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-check-covid-thick-tail-bmc-to-focus-on-hotspots/articleshow/84050672.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: 100km-long walls across Rajaji, Corbett Tiger Reserve fail to stop man-jumbo conflict||DEHRADUN: Concrete walls — totalling nearly 100 km — built across Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji Tiger Reserve to mitigate man-elephant conflict have been ineffective at keeping the jumbos from venturing into human habitats or raiding crops, experts have found. A majority of these walls were built over the past two decades at a cost of up to Rs 24 lakh per km. An assessment by scientists at the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) surveyed 98.4 km of walls and found 600 breaches. While the pachyderms had managed to damage the 2-metre-high walls in over 300 places, 144 breaches could be attributed to humans or human activities, 31 breaches were due to tree felling and the cause of 146 breaches was unknown. In addition, the walls had 87 weak spots and 94 gaps due to streams and road entry points. The walls were put up in Terai Arc Landscape (TAL), one of the four major elephant ranges in India, which is spread across Corbett, Rajaji and Western Circle of Uttarakhand. Most of the breaches and weak spots were in walls in Corbett and Rajaji Tiger Reserve which house 75% of elephant population of TAL. Researchers said poor maintenance of the walls was a major contributing factor to the breaches. The study, published in The Wildlife Society Bulletin, noted that erecting the walls would have required “substantial investment and maintenance". The forest department told TOI that the first such wall was built in 1994 at a cost of Rs 14 lakh per km and majority of them were built in the past two decades with costs touching Rs 24 lakh per km.  JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of the forest department, said, "We built the walls only in extremely sensitive areas where crop raiding was intensive and human-wildlife conflict was high. We expected retaliation from residents against the raiding animals and thus built the structures to protect them both." Man-elephant conflict in Uttarakhand results in huge loss of cropland and property damages every year. At least a dozen people die each year and several suffer injuries after being trampled by elephants. WII experts have now suggested experimenting with other physical barriers such as using discarded train tracks as a fence. Qamar Quereshi, a senior scientist at WII, said, “Elephants have evolved and learnt how to breach these walls. But humans have evolved too and we can find measures to keep them in their habitats and away from crop fields. There is no point in erecting walls again in areas where walls have been broken because the animals have clearly understood how to get past the barrier.” Concrete barriers also pose risk of injuries to elephants, wildlife experts have long argued. Reenu Paul, a Dehradun-based social activist who had earlier objected to walls being built to contain elephants during Kumbh festival in Haridwar, said, “Lakhs of rupees are being wasted in building these futile barriers when we know that habitat fragmentation is the prime reason behind this conflict.” Paul added that the government’s plan to build an airport in Haridwar would further disrupt traditional routes of these animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/100km-long-elephant-proof-walls-across-corbett-rajaji-fail-to-stop-man-jumbo-conflict/articleshow/84046740.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Goa||Panaji: 20 CCP contract staffers told to go on break from July 1||PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has given 20 of its contract and daily wage workers a break until further orders. Fifteen of them, including junior engineers, accounts clerks, clerk cum typists, lower divisional clerks and a mechanic and electrician have all been issued an order to go on a break from July 1 until further orders. The other five daily wage staffers have also been given the break from July 1. Most hail from outside the city. CCP mayor Rohit Monserrate, when asked, denied it was a move to replace them with his own voters. “The commissioner has taken that decision. The commissioner is under the impression that we have plenty of permanent staff and don’t require more contract labour. On the other hand, we are in the process of regularising daily wage labourers. It is up to the commissioner,” he told TOI. Former mayor and present corporator Surendra Furtado said the workers have been working on temporary basis for many years and hit out at Panaji MLA Atanasio (Babush) Monserrate, who controls CCP, for trying to give jobs to his own voters within the corporation. “He had assured his voters that he would give one job in each house. He’s trying to remove poor people from their jobs at the behest of some others. This is a very serious issue. You cannot let go of workers during a pandemic when people are not getting jobs,” Furtado said.  On the other hand, CCP on June 15 renewed the contract of five employees who were recruited by CCP. TOI had reported that six staff members were recruited, including a ‘garden consultant’ who is paid Rs 60,000 a month since October 2019. CCP has had issues with its staff over the years. Little more than a decade ago, TOI had exposed the scam of ghost workers – that it was paying salaries to non-existing workers. Audit reports had also slammed CCP for engaging daily wage workers in violation of the recruitment norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/20-ccp-contract-staffers-told-to-go-on-break-from-july-1/articleshow/84050737.cms||---

The gym gave me slots for online fitness classes but I wasn’t able to concentrate on the virtual platform with all family members at home. Hence, the moment I was informed about the gyms reopening, I opted for the first slot available and began my workout session alongside my two kids,” said Ruchika Mitra, a homemaker from Bhowanipore who resumed exercise at a Mudiali gymnasium on Thursday. Similar had been the reaction for Pallab Kantu Nath, a doctor and BSF deputy commandant posted at a BSF hospital in Salt Lake, who had turned up at a Salt Lake gym even before it opened shutters. “For a fitness enthusiast like me, it is tough to sit back at home and do nothing. So during this period of closure, I bought some weights and began working out at home, used stairs to climb up and down my flat on the sixth floor and ran at least 20 minutes daily inside my hospital compound. But I am glad to be back at the gym,” said Nath, a resident of Durganagar in Dum Dum. Gym owners said the sight of members turning up in large numbers on the first day itself was extremely inspiring. “Last year, when gyms had opened after a gap of six months, very few members had turned up. But this time, the response is much different. So many members had turned up in the morning slot itself that we had to call some members and cancel their evening slots to ensure the 50% capacity rule set by the state government isn’t violated,” said Rupam Sinha, director of PhysioMax gym in Nagerbazar and Salt Lake. “The sight of happy faces of the members is what boosts our morale to keep fighting even after facing a setback owing to the Covid restrictions that has left our industry battered and bruised over the last 15 months. But the positive response we had on Thursday is very encouraging,” said Gagan Sachdeva, owner of Karma Fitness studio in south Kolkata. Deb Sengupta of The Fitness Connection gym said they were even sending out fumigation and sanitisation photos and videos along with people working out on Day 1 to their regular members to inspire them to get back to the gym.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fitness-buffs-hit-the-floor-early-as-gyms-reopen-after-2-months/articleshow/84046742.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The agency roped in by the Noida Authority has submitted a perception report after surveying the locations where cameras have to be put up. Due to Covid and curfew restrictions, execution of the integrated traffic management system was briefly disrupted. Officials involved with the project said that the report covered aspects like linkages and accessibility of walkways with roads, traffic volumes and estimation of speed of vehicles moving between series of crossings, movement of pedestrians, among other factors. The project is worth about Rs 64.5 crore and will cover 84 crossings in all. A total of 1,065 cameras will be installed and linked to the control room in Sector 94. Deputy general manager, Noida traffic cell, SC Mishra said, “The agency studied traffic volume and speed at busy and non-busy crossings and intersections. It will start work once we get clearance from senior officials.” The authority wants to check the results of the pilot run of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/agency-for-itms-in-noida-submits-report/articleshow/84050655.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Private schools file false info about RTE online classes||JAIPUR: Around 10% of the 18,000 schools have filed false information regarding online classes to RTE students, according to sources in the Directorate of Secondary Education, Bikaner. Also, just 18,000 out of 28,000 private schools, which claimed to have cleared the dues under Right to Education (RTE) in Rajasthan, have filled the information sought by the government. The state government had asked the schools to provide information regarding the medium through which they have given online classes to the students for 2020-21 session, and also to provide phone numbers of students for verification. According to the information, many schools have allegedly given false information. Some private schools have also given fake numbers, filled same number of the entire class, some schools of same city have filled up same numbers and some even claimed that they provided personal classes to students, the claim which was found to false due to pandemic. Deputy director, Directorate of Secondary Education, Bikaner, Chandra Kiran said, “The information given by these schools that are found to be false are put under red mark. Now, the remaining information will be sent to higher authorities from where online verification of the given numbers will be done. If 50% students confirm that they were given online classes, we will consider it to be true.” In online verification, education department workers will call up half of the students in one class, will ask them certain questions and then will confirm if they received online education on the basis of which their claims will be cleared. Around Rs 400 crore is spent every year for RTE students by the government. Schools have stated that for the last two years the money was not cleared. Since March 2020, primary schools have remained closed so classes in majority of the private schools have not been held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-schools-file-false-info-about-rte-online-classes/articleshow/84048795.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Speeding bus mows down cop on bike on Red Road||KOLKATA: On the day bus services in Bengal resumed after being suspended for a month-and-a-half, an accident involving a mini-bus claimed the life of a policeman travelling on a motorcycle. As the bus violently jolted forward, around 18 people on board were injured, two of them seriously. But their condition is stated to be stable. The mini-bus on the Metiabruz-Howrah route was on its way to Howrah with 40 passengers on board when the accident took place near the East Gate of Fort William on Red Road around Thursday noon. The driver was suspected to be rash as 89 traffic rule violation cases were recorded against the mini-bus within the 15 months it operated, an officer said. The bus, which was reportedly travelling at a breakneck speed, had to turn a right turn towards Dufferin Road after reaching the Outram Road intersection with Red Road. But the driver lost control of the vehicle and the bus hit the motorcycle that constable Vivekananda Deb was riding and rammed into the balustrade by the road. The driver apparently hit the wall intentionally so that the vehicle could be brought to a stop. So severe was the impact that the bus’s front axle, along with the wheels, came off. “The biker was standing on the left lane of Red Road to turn into Outram Road when the bus ploughed through him. The bike, along with the rider, was dragged under the bus,” said a bystander. Deb was brought out and taken to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared death. A resident of Jhargram, Deb was posted with the Reserve Force of Kolkata Police. Among those injured on the bus, 16 people were hospitalized. Among them, seven were treated and discharged late in the evening. “The accident could have happened due to speeding. Or it could have been a mechanical snag as the bus was not operated for the past 45 days. The driver hit the wall intentionally to stop the vehicle. The biker unfortunately came in the way. We are probing all the angles and checking footage from CCTV cameras around. Once we interrogate the driver, the exact nature of the accident can be established,” said a Lalbazar officer. While the Maidan police began initial investigations, the case was later transferred to the fatal squad of Kolkata traffic police. Police said the bus driver was among the injured, but they were yet to establish his identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/speeding-bus-mows-down-cop-on-bike-on-red-road/articleshow/84048810.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Traders protest digging of roads leading to Sarojini Ngr market, get work stalled||New Delhi: Protesting against the digging up of three roads leading to Sarojini Nagar Market by National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited (NBCC), over 100 traders gathered at D-Avenue Road on Thursday afternoon and got the work stopped. They were demanding that officials visit the site and argued that digging of the roads will completely restrict the entry to the market. After an hour, shopkeepers left the site as senior NBCC officials assured them that no further digging will take place on the three roads and even levelled the dug portions, said traders. “They started digging in the middle of the roads and the labourers there informed us that there is a plan to barricade the entries after installing huge sheds, which would have surely affected the movement of vehicles and footfall in the market. This left the traders concerned who have already suffered huge losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We immediately started gathering on roads and got the work stopped,” said Kuldeep Singh Sawhney, president of Sarojini Market Shopkeepers’ Association. “Three days back, we even had a meeting with NBCC officials at Lodhi Road and we were assured that entry won’t be stopped to the market from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd crossroads. Via letters, we had conveyed our apprehensions to Union minister Hardeep Puri, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and MP Meenakshi Lekhi too. I think after the intervention of the Union minister’s office, the work was stalled on Thursday,” said Sawhney. A senior NBCC official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The issue has been sorted out. We are not digging on the roads where traders had an objection. But at other places, the process for barricading is going on as part of ongoing projects in the area.” NBCC is presently working on a project to redevelop Sarojini Nagar, which was among the three areas identified for redevelopment by the government of India. The other two areas were Nauroji Nagar and Netaji Nagar. The total cost of the project is pegged at Rs 32,000 crore. TOI contacted NBCC for a comment, but there was no response till the filing of the report on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-protest-digging-of-roads-leading-to-sarojini-ngr-market-get-work-stalled/articleshow/84048905.cms||Vibha Sharma

Each plant will have the capacity to generate around two metric tonnes of oxygen daily. The cost of each is pegged at Rs 1.75 crore. Meanwhile, the first plant of this kind was commissioned at the Vashi civic hospital on Thursday, which is set to generate over 1.86 metric tonnes of oxygen per day. NMMC has completed the tendering process for two more plants. “Work orders will soon be issued to install plants at the Cidco Exhibition Centre and Airoli civic hospital. They will be ready by mid-July. We have identified two more locations at Belapur and Nerul civic hospitals,” said Dr Babasaheb Rajale, deputy municipal commissioner of NMMC.

All of them were accused of assaulting civic body commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh in the chamber of suspended JMC-Greater mayor Somya Gurjar recently. However, the court granted Gurjar, who is also an accused in the case, 15 days’ time to appear as her child was not well. Arrest warrants were issued against the councillors since they did not appear in the court without giving any information despite police serving notice to them. Jyoti Nagar police on Wednesday filed a fresh chargesheet after the court returned the previous one without serving notice to the accused. Gurjar and the four councilors are accused of assaulting the commissioner on June 4 in the mayor’s chamber. The four councilors are Ajay Singh, Paras Jain, Shankar Sharma and Ram Kishore Prajapat. They were booked under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) of the IPC along with other relevant sections. The chargesheet was filed within 10 days after a case was registered at Jyoti Nagar police station following a high voltage drama on June 4. JMC-Greater commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh had alleged that he was manhandled by BJP councillors inside mayor Gurjar’s office in her presence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/arrest-warrants-against-four-suspended-jmc-councillors/articleshow/84048806.cms||---

As salons and beauty parlours across the city re-opened on Thursday — sanitized and all checks in place — appointment books showed that only a small percentage of clients could be entertained and most would have to wait for a few more days for their turn. But even those on the waiting list were happy because finally they would get a chance to relax under the expert fingers of their hairdressers and beauticians after what seemed like an eternity. Punjab Club president Haryam Batra felt privileged as the first customer to walk into A N John at 11am sharp. “I was managing somehow but the lack of haircut and the ugly shape it took really made me uneasy,” he said. Just as relieved was Avni Mehta, who works with ICICI Bank and managed an appointment for her “hair ritual”. There were some who had somehow managed these two months by calling in professionals home but were not happy with the outcome. “That was a makeshift arrangement and I was yearning to be back at the salon,” said Piyush Agarwal, who has a textiles business. Despite her busy schedule, anaesthetist Atasi Sasmal was the first one at June Tomkyns at 11am sharp to get her root touch-up and highlighting services done. “These are aesthetic essentials that are a must and I was missing my salon,” she said. The same story was repeated by Abhinandan Chatterjee who got his hair and beard styled at Toni & Guy at New Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salons-reopen-tick-all-safety-boxes/articleshow/84046754.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Longer hours, new offers may drive sales in malls||KOLKATA: Malls in the city are getting ready for a bumper weekend with retailers pinning hopes on longer business hours and end-of-season sales to register double the revenue that they had clocked last weekend. Retailers in malls said sales recorded between June 25 and 27, the second weekend since malls reopened on June 16, was more than what they had been able to achieve in the eighth weekend after malls resumed operation following the first lockdown. “The recovery of sales following the shutdown has been much faster in the second wave than in the first. People have returned to malls without fear. In the first wave, the fear of the unknown had led to poor footfall for nearly two months. This time though, people are back in numbers. Perhaps, vaccination has made them confident,” said Quest mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra. What’s also significant is that senior citizens and children who were not allowed to step into the malls after they opened during the first wave year are now visiting malls. “Both these categories generate spends. While senior citizens who come to malls have serious buying capacity, children also drive sales, not only of kids wear and toys but also phones, laptops and televisions,” said South City VP Manmohan Bagree. With many brands set to introduce end-of-season sale this weekend, Ambuja Neotia group whole-time director Ramesh Pandey expects this weekend's footfall to be the highest during the pandemic minus the festive season (October-November). “Retailers are very happy about the revised timings. Now, it's almost like regular hours. Store-keepers are bracing up to do some serious business and make up for the loss incurred during the 45-day closure,” said Pandey. K Vijayan, the general manager at Acropolis, said it was not just the timing but also the relaxations in staff deployment and capacity that will come in handy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/longer-hours-new-offers-may-drive-sales-in-malls/articleshow/84046770.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: RSS condemns corruption charges against Nimbaram||JAIPUR: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Thursday condemned the allegations made against its senior leader Nimbaram of demanding Rs 20 crore ‘commission’ from a firm engaged in door-to-door garbage collection here. Nimbaram’s name figures in the FIR registered by the ACB. The allegations levelled against the regional pracharak are efforts of character assassination, RSS leaders said. RSS reaction comes a day after the Congress state president on Wednesday demanded Nimbaram’s arrest after a video of him with suspended mayor Somya Gurjar’s husband and a company representative talking of ‘commission’. “We refute these false allegations. All options are open for us to take legal action,” RSS leader Hanuman Singh Rathore said in a statement. An attempt had been made to present distorted facts even though no exchange of money had taken place, he said, likening it to character assassination of a respected person by accusing them of being involved in corruption. Being a responsible citizen, the RSS leader is ready to support any kind of investigation, Rathore said. The statement said BVG company executives had met the RSS leader with a proposal to contribute for the development of the Pratap Gaurav Kendra in Udaipur through CSR funds. “The leader had asked them to visit the centre and contribute accordingly. The company officials set a date, but never visited the centre and so, the question of CSR funding or any other assistance doesn’t arise,” the statement said. The April 20 meeting between the garbage collection company executives and the RSS leader was a courtesy meeting, it added. Transport minister Pratap Singh Kachariyawas, on the other hand, alleged that BJP and RSS indulged in corruption in the last five years in connivance with BVG in Jaipur. He said the video clearly established role of RSS in wheeling and dealing. He said now the BJP and RSS are trying to intimidate the ACB with the bogy of change of government in every five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rss-condemns-corruption-charges-against-nimbaram/articleshow/84048865.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Owner of vaccination conman’s office space arrested||KOLKATA: The special investigation team probing fake vaccination camps has arrested the owner of the office space from where Debanjan Deb operated a fake KMC office. The fake vaccination camp was also held there. Ashok Kumar Roy, who had rented out the property in Kasba’s Rajdanga to Deb for Rs 65,000 a month, was arrested from his Birati residence and produced at the Alipore court on Thursday. Roy is the seventh person to be arrested in the case. Investigators said Roy played a crucial role in getting the fake raid conducted on a petrol pump in Kasba earlier this year. During this raid, Deb had claimed he was a KMC vigilance officer. Roy had also arranged for 50 friends and relatives to get ‘vaccinated’ at the camp organised by Deb. “We are trying to find out how much Roy was aware of Deb’s activities. Susanta Das, one of Deb’s accomplices arrested earlier, had worked with Roy in the past. It was through Das that the office lease was finalized,” said an investigating officer. The cops are likely to question Deb and Roy in the presence of Das. Deb’s cousin Kanchan is also likely to be present in the questioning. “Deb’s employees have told us that Kanchan joined the office about six month ago. He rarely spoke to anyone. Deb had told his office staff that Kanchan was an officer from the I&CA department. The only time Kanchan stepped out of his room was to speak to Deb and rarely spoke on phone in others’ presence,” said a police source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/owner-of-vax-conmans-office-space-arrested/articleshow/84046797.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||The bus swung madly and hit the bike, I blacked out||My commute to my workplace at Esplanade had been rather difficult for the past couple of weeks owing to the absence of public transport. When the government eased the restrictions and allowed buses to ply, I was relieved I would be able to reach Fancy Market early. When I boarded the bus on the Metiabruz-Howrah route, all the seats had already been occupied. Though buses were supposed to operate at 50% capacity, it was quite understandable that very few followed the rule as commuter pressure was high. As the bus continued the journey, more people boarded. Once the bus took the Kidderpore Road, the rickety bus picked up speed. It continued to travel at a high speed on Red Road. I felt the driving was reckless. Just as we were about to reach the intersection of Dufferin Road and Outram Road, the bus swung wildly, rammed into a motorcycle and then dragged it along before ramming into the wall. In the impact, all of us on the bus were thrown forward. The seats were wrenched off the floor. For a moment, I might have had blacked out or simply could not register what had just happened. By the time I could pick myself up, I heard groans from all around. Many commuters were injured. Soon, I found out that the man travelling on the bike had been killed and I could not stop thinking about the unfortunate person who lost his life.

For this, for the first time a train will be run from Phoolbagan station till Sealdah. The authorities are eyeing a year-end commissioning of the Sealdah extension. To facilitate the Sealdah extension, Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi on Thursday inspected the under-construction Metro station along with KMRC MD Manas Sarkar and KMRC’s director (projects) N C Karmali, below Sealdah railway station. The GM reviewed the station commissioning work and installation of various equipment related to signalling, air-conditioning, power supply, platform screen doors and tracks. Joshi was satisfied with the progress, which has now picked up, as the state government last month exempted infrastructure projects from the ongoing Covid-induced restrictions. A senior KMRC official said: “The signalling tests due to start in July-end will continue for some time. We intend to commission the Sealdah extension by the year-end.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/test-train-for-e-ws-sealdah-extension-to-run-in-july-end/articleshow/84046810.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||India||Truce holds, virtually no LoC infiltration: Army chief||NEW DELHI: There has been “little or no” infiltration across the Line of Control (LoC) after India and Pakistan agreed to observe a fresh border ceasefire in February, which has led to a significant decline in violence in J&K, General M M Naravane said Thursday. “But there will always be some inimical elements who will try to sabotage peace and development. We will have to cater for that,” the Army chief said at a virtual seminar. The statement comes in the backdrop of lack of clarity over whether the drones used in the recent Jammu terror attack were flown from across the international border or from the vicinity of the air force station itself by Pakistan-supported terror outfits like LeT or JeM. Gen Naravane said the security situation in J&K has seen a “marked improvement” since the DGMOs of India and Pakistan agreed to the truce. “Since there is a ceasefire, there is no longer any infiltration. So, the number of terrorists in the Valley is less and the number of terror-related incidents has gone down. But we continue to have a very strong counter-infiltration and counter-terrorism grid,” he said. Certain incidents of violence like firing at pickets of security forces do take place. “But overall, the sharp drop in all parameters of violence clearly indicates that the general population in Kashmir is all for peace and development,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/truce-holds-virtually-no-loc-infiltration-army-chief/articleshow/84053332.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Hottest start to July in 6 years; revival of monsoon on hold in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: As the monsoon continued to remain subdued, the city witnessed the hottest start to July in the past six years on Thursday. High humidity levels made the day more uncomfortable. Though thundershowers may bring momentary relief on Friday and Sunday, the revival of monsoon is expected only after 5-6 days. The maximum temperature was 40 degrees Celsius, 4.2 units above normal, and the minimum temperature was 30.3 degrees Celsius, 3.6 notches above normal. Relative humidity was between 44-72%. As a result of high humidity, the heat felt by people was 2-3 degrees more than the actual temperature. Earlier, 40.2 degrees Celsius maximum temperature was recorded on July 5, 2015, and 41.4 degrees Celsius on July 1, 2012. The state, at present, is witnessing an unusual trend. The districts in northwest and northeast bordering Nepal may witness thunderstorms on Friday and Saturday, while those in the southeast and southwest, including Bundelkhand, may experience the heat wave. As a result, east and central UP which includes Lucknow is reeling under both hot and humid conditions. The reason for such weather conditions is that moisture laden easterly winds coming from the Bay of Bengal are dominating the east and north UP, while dry hot northwesterly winds from Rajasthan are lashing the southern areas. The monsoon arrived in UP on June 13 and in Lucknow on June 18, but lost steam a couple of days thereafter. Since then sultry conditions have been prevailing. The monsoon is yet to cover western parts of the state. “In the absence of any weather system that can energise currents, the monsoon is in a dormant state. However, we expect the formation of favourable conditions in the next 5-6 days,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hottest-start-to-july-in-6-yrs-revival-of-monsoon-on-hold/articleshow/84050786.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Rash driving, snag from disuse possible reasons’||KOLKATA: The mini-bus accident on Red Road on Thursday, in which constable Vivekananda Deb lost his life, could have been caused by the driver’s negligence or a mechanical failure from disuse for past 45 days, police said. So many people on the bus were injured because the seats were wrenched off the vehicle floor and the passengers were violently flung forward. Also, the driver of the mini-bus was rash, given that 89 traffic rule violation cases had been recorded against the private carrier in the 15 months it had been operating, police said. Bus manufacturers, who saw the photographs of the interior of the bus after the accident, said injuries on the vehicle could have been a lot less had it been a factory-fitted bus instead of a chassis, on which a fabricated body was fitted with weak welding and screws. “Buses now manufactured don’t come apart. The bodywork that was not even done at a proper workshop disintegrated in the impact,” said an executive of a bus manufacturing firm. Those in the industry pointed out that the accident might have happened due to a mechanical failure, caused either because the bus was parked for over a month and a half or because of poor maintenance due to lack of earning. “An owner has to spend at least Rs 15,000-Rs 20,000 to make an idle bus road worthy. Several issues occur when a bus does not operate for so many days. The brake shoe can get jammed, the constant waterlogging can damage tyres. Lubricant needs to be changed. Even basic servicing becomes necessary. This mini-bus was one of three vehicles on the Metiabruz-Howrah route that operated as others were not ready to ply,” said Pradip Narayan Bose of West Bengal Bus Minibus Owners’ Association. Transport experts agreed that buses, which remained parked for one-and-a-half months under the sky, on waterlogged streets, would invariably falter on the road and might pose danger to people, apart from own drivers, conductors and passengers. “After suspension of movement for the past one-and-a-half months, the tyres are supposed to lose gripping power. These buses need to undergo fitness tests before hitting roads. Otherwise, the accident by the mini-bus near Fort William East Gate will recur,” said Prabir Bose, an automobile engineering expert. Also, if the fuel injector was clogged, the axle could break away and a disastrous accident could happen, even vehicles could turn turtle, he said. Three things must be checked very thoroughly before allowing a bus to hit the road -- fuel injectors, engine piston, brake and tyres, Bose added. Swapan Ghosh, joint secretary of Minibus Operators’ Coordination Committee, did not agree. “The owner, Khurshid Alam of Metiabruz, has years of experience and maintains his fleet well. This is a new bus that has run barely seven months. My theory is that it was the driver’s error. While turning left into Dufferin Road at high speed, he saw the bike at the last moment. He then hit the brake hard and lost control,” said Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rash-driving-snag-from-disuse-possible-reasons/articleshow/84048909.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

State forest minister Harak Singh Rawat, on Thursday, kicked off the campaign by planting a sapling at Arcadia Grant, Dehradun. He also distributed around 350 saplings to the people present at the event. Besides Van Mahotsav, the Gaurav Devi plantation drive was also launched across school campuses on Thursday. According to forest officials, the state government plans to cover almost 14,000 hectares of area under various afforestation programmes. Rajiv Bhartari, head of forest force of Uttarakhand, told TOI that the forest department has received almost Rs 62 crore for carrying out this plantation drive under different state and Centre schemes. “We are planting fruits and wild trees in the Thano forest and nearby areas. The drive will make the habitat of wild animals richer. This will also reduce human-wildlife conflict in the state,” said Dr Aanchal Sharma and Anku Sharma, founders of The Earth and Climate Initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarkhand-to-plant-1-37-crore-plants-this-monsoon-van-mahotsav-2021-starts/articleshow/84046814.cms||Shivani Azad

Their presence was important for the inspection,” she said after the inspection. Aldona MLA Glenn Ticlo, Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza, Mapusa councillors, officers of several departments and NGOs supporting the river Tar clean-up campaign were present for the inspection. Initially they inspected the immersion site and later the highway area where the bridge is under construction. It was found that the soil, gravel and stones under the bridge were not removed during the work, which affected the flow of water and there was a need to remove this material. The concerned department was instructed to take appropriate steps to deal with the mangroves grown inside the river. The need to cut down the trees growing in the river basin was also suggested. After the inspection, D’Souza said there was a need to go to the root cause of the pollution from the area and action needs to be taken in collaboration with various departments. Aldona MLA said that he would meet the chief minister and try to resolve the issue. He further said that he would try to reach a solution after holding discussions with senior officials of the concerned departments. A week ago, a meeting was held at the municipality with all the stakeholders and government departments concerned to discuss Tar pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/road-contractor-fails-to-attend-tar-inspection/articleshow/84050903.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Rajaram discussed bribe, not CSR funds, says ACB||JAIPUR: Amid claims made by Rajaram Gujjar that he was discussing the CSR funds and not bribe with employees of BVG, the ACB on Thursday replayed the videos and audios seized by it and claimed that nothing related to CSR was discussed in it. While rubbishing the claims, the ACB said for discussing CSR funds, meetings should have been called by the board of the company and not by Rajaram, who has no post in JMC-Greater. Agency officers added that they would examine Gurjar’s bank accounts and transactions of the period from when his wife Somya was elected as JMC-Greater mayor to the time she was suspended. TOI on Thursday spoke to the ACB to find out if there was any substance in the claims made by Rajaram. “No such funds had been discussed in the video and audio which are now in our possession. Even the word CSR has not been used in the talks in the three videos and four audios. This is just a lame defence been taken by the accused. We have incriminating evidence and also verification of the videos from the FSL labs,” said ACB DGP BL Soni. He added as per Section 135 of the companies Act, every company having a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more or a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more during any financial year shall constitute a CSR committee consisting of three of its directors out of which one should be independent. “Those seen in the video are not in the board of directors. So, this meeting had nothing to do with CSR activity,” said a senior officer of ACB. Sleuths of ACB further said they will also sent the mobile phone of Rajaram to retrieve deleted messages and bank transactions. “We will examine his bank accounts from the day Somya was elected mayor to the day she was suspended to see if any transaction by BVG company had been made in Rajaram’s accounts,” the officer added. “We have got incriminating documentary evidence against Rajaram and others in this case. Also, the case was registered only after verifying the complaint and videos after starting a suo motu primary inquiry,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajaram-discussed-bribe-not-csr-funds-says-acb/articleshow/84048940.cms||---

Terming the land deals transparent, Giri compared the so-called whistle-blowers with the infamous dhobi (washerman), whose sarcastic remarks unleashed untold agony on Lord Ram and Sita after their return from exile. Talking to reporters at Mani Ram Chawni, mutt-home of Trust president Nritya Gopal Das, he said, “some politicians and religious leaders are hurling allegations to malign the temple trust and trigger unrest among masses with a clear motive to obstruct construction of Ram temple. We held several rounds of meetings with Trustees over the last three days and examined documents of land deals with help of lawyers and accountants. We found no irregularities in the deals, which are clear and transparent,” he said. Expansion of Ramjanmabhoomi premises is necessary and all Trustees residing in Ayodhya were kept in the loop on procedure adopted to buy land at market value, he said. Responding to a question on acting against the accusers, Giri said, “Personally, I am against action against those who hurled allegations at the Trust. These conspirators are following the tradition of the ‘dhobi' of Rama's time who raised questions on Sita Ji’s character,” he said. Earlier, the Trust summoned Mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay at the several rounds of meetings held in Ayodhya on Wednesday and Thursday to scan the land deals. The mayor was embroiled in controversy after names of his nephew and brother-in-law cropped up in the land deals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/those-maligning-temple-trust-are-like-dhobi-who-doubted-sita/articleshow/84050816.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Kolkata||Long queues, footboard passengers: Bengal buses groan under load as private operators stay away||KOLKATA: Buses were finally back on the streets of the city on Thursday after a gap of one-and-a-half months, much to the relief of commuters. But with very few private buses plying, serpentine queues at stands and passengers hanging out of state-run carriers ruled the day, though government offices were closed for Doctors’ Day. Commute might get more difficult on Friday, when government office-goers will add to the commuter load. “If this was the scene on the road on Thursday, it is going to be worse on Friday,” said a policeman at Jadavapur 8B bus stand. According to private bus operators, not more than 30 private buses plied and many vehicles could not be used because of technical snags as they were not used for over a month. WBTC ran its full fleet and some buses of South Bengal State Transport Corporation (SBSTC) also ferried passengers in the city, but the demand far exceeded the supply. Even on a day state offices were shut, air-conditioned buses from the airport to Esplanade, Howrah and Garia were so crowded that doors could not be shut. Though AC bus operators pleaded with passengers not to board as more than half the seating capacity was full, no one seemed to pay any heed. For non-AC buses, operators managed to maintain the rule of operating at 50% capacity in the morning; they also did not allow any passenger to stand while travelling. The restriction on the number of passengers on board led to long queues at stands, with people hardly getting the opportunity to board the vehicles from non-terminal stops. All hell seemed to break loose in the afternoon, with commuters forcing their way into buses. Many were seen hanging from the footboard of buses on various routes. Across the city from Garia to Dunlop, from Behala to Salt Lake, bus stands witnessed identical scenes with a deluge of passengers waiting for the elusive buses, showing the yawning gap between demand and supply. At Garia, passengers claimed to be waiting for almost two hours. Those who could not avail of buses were forced to travel by Matador vans, many of which plied in the absence of private buses. TOI encountered passengers who were waiting for buses for hours together. “I had to wait for my bus for more than three hours. I had been paying through my nose for the past one month and I can no longer do it. So I have no other option but to wait for a bus,” said Arup Ghosh, who commutes from Sinthee to Bhowanipore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/long-queues-footboard-passengers-state-buses-groan-under-load-as-pvt-operators-stay-away/articleshow/84048930.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The girl’s family hails from Nepal and is currently settled in Rajkot. In the complaint, the 15-year-old’s mother alleged that the accused who is in mid 20s was a resident of Surat and relative of the school security guard. According to the complaint, the girl had come in contact with the accused a few months ago when he had come from Surat to stay with his relative in Rajkot. “The accused raped the minor in March promising her marriage,” said police. On June 12, the girl went to Surat without informing her parents and met the accused. She asked him to marry her, but he reportedly refused to marry her. When the girl’s parents came to know that their daughter was in Surat, they brought her back to Rajkot on Tuesday. After coming home the girl informed her family about the rape.

Both groups have leveled allegations of being attacked by each other using sharp-edge weapons in their plaints. Investigation in this matter has been handed over to the local crime branch. According to sources, in the FIR registered by AAP worker Haresh Savaliya a resident of Surat, a few people associated with BJP have been named as accused. In his complaint, Savaliya stated that AAP leaders Isudan Gadhvi, Mahesh Savani, Pravin Ram, Atul Shekhda, Nimisha Khunt and 50 other workers were on their way to address a Jan Samvedna Yatra in Leriya village, when their convoy was attacked by a mob comrising 40 to 50 people. Attackers were using sticks, pipes and weapons like swords. “They tried to kill me and also issued threats that they want to kill our leaders,” Savaliya said in the FIR, adding, “I believe that the attack was because of the animosity that honest and people with social prestige are joining AAP. I also heard the accused saying ‘this is a BJP area and we won’t allow AAP to organise any meeting’.” Altogether 13 people including Giju Vikma, Krunal Vikma, Hiren Vikma, Abhi Vikma, Jeetu Ravaiya, Parthiv Vikma, Uday Mehta, Kana Gor, Jasmine Shashtri, Abhi Goswami, Jitendra Mehta, Dinesh Vikma and Kishor Dobariya and other unknown people have been named in the FIR registered under IPC sections 307, 323, 324, 294 (b), 506(2), 427, 337, 143, 147, 148, 149. While Abhi Goswami is Visavadar Yuva BJP president, Uday Mehta is a treasurer of Junagadh Yuva Morcha and Abhi Vikma is a party worker. “It was an issue of Bhram Samaj and the party has nothing to do with it, the one accused is also engaged with Congress so they were not acting on behalf of the party,” said Junagadh BJP district president Kirit Patel. Meanwhile, resident of Visavadar, Satish Chavdangar, registered a complaint against AAP party workers Haresh Savaliya, Pravin Ram, Jaysukh Paghdar and 50 other party workers. The FIR stated that they gathered to register their protest against the statement made by party leader Gopal Italiya against the Bhramin community. The accused AAP workers attacked them with sharp-edge weapons, formed an illegal assembly and tried to run them over with their car, the FIR stated which too has been registered under the same IPC sections. AAP workers from across the state reached Visavadar police station late on Wednesday night in around 50 cars that were parked outside the police station. Workers chanting Ram Dhun were demanding registration of FIR and the arrest of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cross-firs-filed-in-aap-convoy-attack-case/articleshow/84046875.cms||---

UGC secretary, Tamil Nadu chief secretary and VC of Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) have also been summoned for hearing in the same case. The post of science dean had fallen vacant last year after the retirement of Prof Kirti Sinha of the physics department. As per rules, the senior most professor of a faculty is appointed as dean. Prof Singh has claimed that he is the seniormost faculty member. However, it was disputed by another teacher on grounds that his teaching years in VIT, a private university in Tamil Nadu, cannot be counted in experience. As the dispute remained pending, LU VC first gave the dean of commerce faculty the additional charge of science and then dean of education. Alleging violation of rules, Prof Singh then approached NCBC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/deans-appointment-in-lu-panel-summons-vc/articleshow/84050854.cms||---

---||Delhi||It’s loud and clear: Up to Rs 1 lakh penalty for sound norm violations in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Playing a loudspeaker or public address system during night hours or without permission from authorities can attract a fine of Rs 10,000 while the violation of noise pollution norms over the use of generator sets can result in a fine of Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh, depending on the size of DG set. In both the cases, the equipment will also be seized. Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) recently directed the authorities concerned to implement the scale of new compensation for violation of noise pollution in Delhi. A senior official of DPCC said, “Last year, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) proposed a set of new fines for violation of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules. It was accepted by the National Green Tribunal. CPCB in April this year gave statutory orders to issue directions for implementation of new compensation scale for violation of noise pollution. DPCC has now directed police and administration to impose fine as per the new compensation scale in Delhi.” According to the new compensation scale, a fine of Rs 50,000 will be imposed for violation of use of sound-emitting construction equipment. The equipment will also be seized. Bursting of firecrackers by an individual or household beyond the prescribed time limit can invite a fine of Rs 1,000 for residential or commercial zone and Rs 3,000 for silence zone. The amount for violation of firecrackers rules during public rallies, marriage processions and religious events can increase to Rs 10,000 for residential or commercial zone and Rs 20,000 for silence zone. The fine will be paid by the organiser. However, if the firecracker violation takes place within a fixed premises like function organised by RWA, marriage function, public function, institution function, banquet hall or open ground functions, the penalty would be Rs 20,000. If there is a violation for the second time within the fixed premises, the fine will be increased to Rs 40,000. More than two violations within the fixed premises will invite the penalty of Rs 1 lakh and sealing of the premises. DPCC also asked the designated authorities to submit monthly action reports on violation of noise pollution. “To ensure the compliance of existing rules and prevent further violations of noise pollution, we have asked designated authorities to impose fines and transfer the amount to DPCC. If the order is enforced properly, it will help in controlling the noise pollution,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-loud-and-clear-up-to-rs-1-lakh-penalty-for-sound-norm-violations/articleshow/84048990.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Agra||Agra: Boy, 16, killed in firing at wedding; family alleges murder||AGRA: A 16-year-old boy was killed when he was hit by a bullet fired from a relative's gun during a wedding function in Agra’s Khandauli area on Thursday morning. After the family claimed the killing was intentional, two persons were booked for murder. Police are examining the CCTV footage recovered from the spot to see if the shooting was deliberate. The victim was identified as Dharmendra Singh, the groom’s cousin who was a Class X student hailing from Rajasthan. The incident took place between 3-4 am at Sri Vrindavan Garden, said police. While the victim’s family accused the suspect of killing Dharmendra, police said it could have been a case of “mishandling” a loaded gun. The gun is owned by a retired Armyman from Hathras, who had reportedly given it to the accused, Vivek, 19, after he insisted on seeing it closely, said police. After taking the loaded gun, Vivek pulled the trigger and a bullet hit Dharmedra in the chest. The CCTV footage shows that the victim was standing with four other people, when the bullet hit him from a point-blank range. Dharmendra was rushed to hospital but he succumbed to injuries on the way. According to police, three bullets were fired and the third hit the boy. The victim’s elder brother, Anil Kumar, said that Dharmendra came to Agra on June 28 to attend the wedding. “He came alone here and on Thursday morning, we were informed about his death,” he said, adding that “someone had killed him deliberately”. Arvind Kumar Nirwal, station house officer of Khandauli police station, told TOI that an FIR had been registered against Vivek and Gyanendra Singh under IPC section 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and further investigations were on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/boy-16-killed-in-firing-at-wedding-family-alleges-murder/articleshow/84044908.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Gulshan case: HC says no leniency in the interest of justice & society in Mumbai||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Thursday upheld the 2002 conviction of one assailant of Gulshan Kumar, Abdul Rauf Dawood Merchant, and declared guilty Abdul Rauf’s brother Abdul Rashid. “It was indeed a coldblooded murder,’’ the HC bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and N R Borkar said, adding, “It was also not a case of a sole eyewitness.” There were five, including a resident nearby, a rickshaw driver and Kumar’s driver of 14 years. Each emphasized the role of the brothers as the attackers, the bench said. The assailants escaped towards Versova Link Road in a taxi they took at gunpoint. Abdul Rauf had “no personal animosity or grudge” against Kumar, said the HC. “He had committed the ghastly act as he was hired by Nadeem Saifee and Abu Salem who wanted to satisfy their personal vendetta against the deceased,” the HC added as the reason for upholding Rauf’s conviction for criminal conspiracy too. Nadeem and Salem were absconding accused then and hence not tried, said the HC. The HC said Abdul Rauf, who had absconded initially for almost 3.5 years before his arrest in January 2001 and (keeping in mind) later his non-surrender for seven years following a two-week release on furlough in 2009, does not deserve any remission. “In the interest of justice and society at large, the appellant does not deserve any leniency,” the HC said. The police said it was a case of business rivalry. There were 19 accused. Charges against two were dropped pending trial. Five years later, the Mumbai sessions court held only Abdul Rauf guilty, acquitting the remaining 16, including Taurani, owner of Tips Cassettes, and Abdul Rashid. Abdul Rauf was also convicted for attempt to murder for firing at Kumar’s driver that day. The HC said it was a case of “direct” and “sterling evidence” from eyewitnesses. The trial court held that “shots were fired by accused No. 19 (Abdul Rauf) and absconding accused”. The HC said the prosecution, represented by additional public prosecutors Madhavi Mhatre and Prajakta Shinde, proved that Rauf murdered Kumar and fired at his driver. It said there was evidence to show Rauf “was in Dubai when the conspiracy was hatched” and executed it with his brother and the third shooter, who is allegedly absconding. A pistol was recovered from Abdul Rashid and two from the brother-duo’s mother, who was also an accused. She was acquitted. Bullets recovered by police tallied with pistols, the court said. Abdul Rauf’s counsel Satish Maneshinde told TOI, “Both judgments, against Abdul Rauf and Abdul Rashid, will be challenged before SC.” The state’s appeal had said Taurani hatched the conspiracy with Nadeem and Salem to kill Kumar. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda and advocate Apoorva Singh denied it. The HC held, “In the present case, there are serious lapses in the investigation and there is no cogent and convincing evidence to hold that (Taurani) had spoken to Abu Salem in Dubai.” The only witness who deposed against Taurani was “also present” when Taurani allegedly called Salem from Juhu. The HC added there was no probe to verify if the phone was Salem’s. A plea to make the witness an accused was rejected by the trial court. “In view of this, the acquittal of the respondent No. 1 (Taurani) calls for no interference,” the HC held. But, for Abdul Rashid, it said there was “cogent evidence” in the form of eyewitnesses and ballistics. “Unwarranted acquittals would not only give wrong signal to society but would pose a threat to law and order,” the HC said, adding hence he deserved to be convicted as his “role cannot be segregated from the role of Abdul Rauf…since both had shot” at Kumar. The HC ordered that “Abdul Rashid Merchant shall surrender forthwith before sessions court or before D N Nagar police station... He shall then surrender his passport to the police”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gulshan-case-hc-says-no-leniency-in-the-interest-of-justice-society-in-mumbai/articleshow/84050944.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court dismisses Hiranandani’s review plea in Powai realty case||Mumbai: The Bombay high court dismissed a review petition filed by Niranjan Hiranandani against its May 2020 order which had set aside an arbitral award that had been in favour of the developer in connection with a real estate construction in Powai. Justice S C Gupte, in his June 28 order, said, “The review petitioner’s case here is neither supported by law or authority of court. If anything, it would set a bizarre precedent, if accepted, that it is open to seek review of an order if the court had indicated its mind one way in court whilst reserving the judgment and the judgment came the other way or that counsel appearing before the court was under an impression that the case would be decided one way and in reality, it was decided otherwise.” Justice Gupte retired as HC judge on June 29. In August 2011, the arbitrator had found no violations by the six landholders and their constituted attorney, Hiranandani, of a tripartite agreement with the state government and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), including in alleged exceeding the size of flats. The MMRDA and state had also claimed breaches committed by landholders and their CA of agreement to lease and several exemption orders by amalgamation of two or more flats. In May 2020, Justice Gupte had set aside the arbitrator’s finding. In the review petition, senior counsel Pradeep Sancheti, for Hiranandani, said what was held by the HC was “different from what was expressed in court at the time of hearing”. Sancheti said he had “desisted from arguing” his case because of the view expressed by the court at the time of hearing the challenge raised by MMRDA to the arbitrator’s award. He submitted that the court had indicated that the arbitral award would be sustained on aspects of breaches. The May 2020 order was passed seven months after it was reserved. Opposing the review petition, senior counsel Prasad Dhakephalkar and advocate Nivit Srivastav for MMRDA denied the allegations. Justice Gupte said Sancheti’s “submission itself is premised on the counsel’s assessment based on what the court expressed or indicated in court or, rather, what he understood to be the court’s expression or indication. There is nothing to show that the court actually expressed itself or indicated the way the counsel submits it did". “Though it is difficult to recall what transpired then in court…there is no way this court would have at any time indicated that it was upholding the award,” said the HC. Dismissing the review plea, it added, “The suggestion that this court had no recollection of the arguments due to passage of time or would have to re-read the matter for passing order or that any such reason was given by the court during the hearing, are nothing short of being mischievous. The hearing and all arguments were not only present to the mind of the court, but also noted down in detail...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-dismisses-hiranandanis-review-plea-in-powai-realty-case/articleshow/84052830.cms||---

Braving searing heat, the family sat on a durrie right beneath a statue of the jawan -- erected on their family's plot -- that has been awaiting unveiling by the officials for over a year now. The family alleged that no road or school has not been named after the jawan and no land has been provided to them, as promised earlier. They, however, said they had received relief of Rs 60 lakh initially. The 45-year-old widow alleged that the district magistrate transferred Rs 65.57 lakh collected by the teachers of the basic education department by contributing Rs 1,000 each from their salaries, for the welfare of her family, to the chief minister’s relief fund. Agra DM Prabhu Nath Singh, however, clarified that the move is purely technical. “Sufficient monetary assistance has been provided to the family of the CRPF jawan killed in Pulwama attack. Private welfare funds in any of the department’s accounts go to the CM’s relief fund first and are redirected towards the intended beneficiary. We will look into the demands of the family. Suitable action will be taken as per the norms,” the DM said. A resident of Kehrai village under Sadar sub-division, Mamta Rawat said, “I have been making rounds of the government offices for over a year. After the death of my husband, the state authorities had promised to provide us with some land near the village. But nothing has happened so far." “A statue of my husband constructed on our personal land has been waiting for a formal unveiling ceremony for the past several months. No school or road has been named after him. To register my protest against the authorities' inaction and their disrespect towards the supreme sacrifice of my husband, I have begun an indefinite sit-in. I will be forced to end my life if time-bound action is not taken by the state government,” she said. Abhishek Rawat, son of the slain CRPF jawan, said, “We have made several rounds to the office and residence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Officials there took our complaint letters, but no action was taken.” Soon after she began her sit-in, ADM Prabhakant Awasthi and SDM VK Gupta visited the family. The officers assured them time-bound consideration of their demands and requested the jawan's widow to end her dharna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/widow-of-jawan-killed-in-pulwama-attack-alleges-delay-in-relief-begins-sit-in/articleshow/84044869.cms||Deepak Lavania

You could be penalised immediately without any human intervention. Almost two years after being conceived, the intelligent traffic management system (ITMS) saw the light of the day at 132 crossings in the city on Thursday. Initially, ITMS had begun at four major crossings in 2019 but due to coordination and technical issues, it suffered several roadblocks. Before July 1, ITMS was only working at Hazratganj, IGP, Polytechnic and Vikramaditya Marg crossings. Until now, the maximum number of challans were done by traffic personnel using body-worn cameras or using mobile handsets. “ITMS is defined as an advanced application that aims to provide innovative solutions related to traffic management,” said deputy commissioner of police, traffic, Raees Akhtar. He said it is the technology of the day and it reduces manual intervention. “With well-equipped cameras, we have better evidence of both traffic violations and also if any crime is committed. We can trace the vehicles if needed,” said Akhtar. “We are monitoring 132 crossings live from a video wall in Lalbagh,” said ACP, traffic, Saifuddin Beg, who monitors the ITMS team. Beg also said that ITMS would ensure smooth flow of traffic, thereby reducing traffic congestion. It will also lead to reduction in accidents and inculcate more caution in riders to follow traffic rules. Minimization of pollution is also an added benefit of this scheme, he said. The officer also said that based on a network of sensors and cameras, the system will ensure that any area with heavy traffic does not get any more vehicles for a required time. Instead, it will divert vehicles to less crowded routes for better flow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hi-tech-eye-on-traffic-violators-at-132-crossings/articleshow/84050931.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The case was registered based on a complaint by the village watchman. On investigating the case, police learnt that the girl was in a relationship with a youth of another caste. Her family had to face taunts and abuse by villagers for the alleged “love affair”. Humiliated that she had brought “shame” to the family, it is suspected that they murdered the girl in name of honour and cremated the body clandestinely, villagers alleged. However, her family claimed that she had fever and succumbed to it. But they could not produce any medical documents to back their claim. K Sharma, Saidnangali station house officer, said a case has been registered against the deceased's father, Madanpal Singh, and other family members under relevant sections of the IPC. A probe is on.

The PM was interacting with individual beneficiaries from across the country and KGMU was the only institute to be made part of the virtual interaction. The medical university was chosen because of its recent feat, undertaking the highest number—over 2 lakh—of telemedicine consultations through the e-Sanjeevani app. The PM later also tweeted his interaction with a patient’s family and KGMU doctors. The hour-long virtual interaction on all Digital India initiatives reserved around eight minutes for KGMU. A 73-year-old Champaran, Bihar resident who has been receiving tele-consultation from KGMU’s geriatric mental health department since April, KGMU vice chancellor Lt Gen (retd) Dr Bipin Puri, treating physician Dr Bhupendra and nodal officer for telemedicine Dr Sheetal Verma participated in the interaction. “KGMU was the only institute in the country to be part of the segment on telemedicine. The PM appreciated our efforts for having completed over 2 lakh consultations through e-Sanjeevani and called it an outstanding public service. He also said that telemedicine was a boon during Covid times. It is a great day for all of KGMU and our team,” said Dr Verma. “E-Sanjeevani also gives us and the patient the advantage to upload and go back to previous test reports,” Dr Bhupendra told the PM. On the other end of the screen from Gawandri village in east Champaran, 73-year-old Kanti Devi sat with her grandson Shubham Kumar. “My grandmother was so ill that doctors referred us to KGMU. We made the first visit in March and after a 10-day medicine course, had to return for a follow-up. But the lockdown began and it was extremely risky to travel in the pandemic. The doctor then suggested that we continue through e-Sanjeevani and it was possible for us to make video calls sitting in the safety of our home,” Shubham told TOI. As the PM spoke to Shubham, Kanti, who is still undergoing treatment, made a gesture expressing that she was doing well. “Another benefit that came with the app was that the prescription was auto- generated. It made getting drugs from any pharmacist in our vicinity easy and hassle-free,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-team-patient-tell-pm-about-telemedicine-success/articleshow/84050978.cms||---

Out of around 1.20 lakh tax payers from both commercial and residential properties, around 80,000 tax payers paid their property tax amount to the civic body authority during the three month rebate period from April to June. Since the civic body authority has set a target of Rs 55 crore for the current financial year (2021-2022), it will now start issuing notices to the remaining around 40,000 tax payers, who did not come forward to pay property tax during the three-month rebate period. Moreover, defaulters will have to pay 25% penalty and 12% interest on their tax amount, failing which strict action will be taken against them. This can go upto sealing properties in case of commercial properties and disconnection of water supply in case of residential properties. “We have received a good amount of money. Apart from private properties and government establishments, those who fall in the tax ambit also paid tax without delay. The results are quite encouraging for us as over half of the taxpayers turned up to pay their tax during the rebate period. We will start issuing notices to defaulting tax payers from next week. If they remain reluctant, strict action will be taken as per laid down norms,” said a senior MC officer. Since the civic body authority received orders from the UT local bodies department last year to waive commercial property tax from 13 villages transferred to the MC from Chandigarh administration in 2019, no notices will be sent to them till further orders. With this, the authority has lost around Rs 76.11 lakh during this financial year. According to records of the civic body authority, there are around 1.10 lakh property tax payers in the city. Out of these, around 85,000 are residential properties, while the rest fall in the commercial category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-earns-rs-36-06-crore-as-property-tax/articleshow/84047034.cms||Deepak Yadav

Some farmers said that a herd of around 150-200 cattle is moving in the vicinity of farmlands where the farmers have undertaken paddy cultivation. They fear that the herd may eat their standing crop. Though farmers have erected fencing, there are chances that the cattle may damage it and gain entry into the farms. “We tried to drive away the herd, but in vain,” said farmer Sadanand Parab. “Cattle are believed to be from Maina, Navelim, Kudne and surrounding areas,” farmer Anant Sinari claimed. One farmer said that they brought the issue to the notice of a panchayat member. Cattle nuisance is not only restricted to fields, but even commuters bear the brunt of it. Herds of cattle are found squatting on the road in many areas of Bicholim, especially during night. The incidence is more along the Bicholim bypass road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholim-farmers-fear-cattle-may-damage-crop/articleshow/84051026.cms||---
---||Agra||UP: Bajrang Dal member held for destroying foundation stone bearing Muslim name in Aligarh temple||AGRA: A member of Bajrang Dal was arrested for barging into a temple in Aligarh and allegedly destroying the foundation stone of a water cooler bearing the name of a local Muslim politician who had donated it. The member, Deepak Rajput, was released on bail on Thursday amid protests by the right wing outfit. Several Bajrang Dal members had reached Aligarh's Lodha police station at midnight on Wednesday where Rajput was being held and protested. On Thursday morning, a large number of Bajrang Dal members gathered at Ramleela Ground demanding Rajput’s release and threatened to court mass arrest. The temple committee had filed a police complaint saying that some “antisocial elements” entered the Khereshwar Mahadev temple on Wednesday and destroyed the foundation stone donated by Samajwadi Party’s (SP) Salman Shahid. The committee head, Satyapal Singh, had demanded a probe into the matter. Rajput was arrested under section 151 of CrPC (arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) and released on bail, according to Lodha police station incharge Gajraj Singh. Meanwhile, BJP MP Satish Gautam also spoke in support of Bajrang Dal activists, claiming that having a Muslim leader’s name inside the temple was an attempt to “hurt the sentiments of Hindu community” and was being done with an eye on elections next year. The temple committee had filed a police complaint saying that some “antisocial elements” entered the Khereshwar Mahadev temple on Wednesday and destroyed the foundation stone donated by Samajwadi Party’s (SP) Salman Shahid. The committee head, Satyapal Singh, had demanded a probe into the matter. Bajrang Dal convenor (city) Gaurav Sharma, who was among those who protested against Rajput’s arrest, told TOI, “There was no need of a foundation stone bearing the name of Muslim leader inside the temple. This was a conspiracy.” The SP leader had donated the water cooler to the temple in Aligarh’s Lodha area on June 28 after discussing it with the temple committee, said Satyapal Singh. He said, “We did not find any problem in installing the foundation stone inside the temple with the politician's name. Unfortunately, after this incident, we apologised to him and returned the water cooler to maintain peace in the town.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bajrang-dal-member-held-for-destroying-foundation-stone-bearing-muslim-name-in-aligarh-temple/articleshow/84044948.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Assistant conservator of forests (ACF) Narendra Chandewar said the tiger was hiding in dense bushes near an agriculture field and was noticed by forest labourer Vasudeo Waghade. Forest teams from North Umred as well as Butibori range reached the spot and took stock of the situation. “The spot falls under Matkazari round and this is perhaps the first record of the tiger in the area. There is already recorded evidence of leopards but not tigers,” said Chandewar. Officials suspect the tiger entered Junapani reserve forest, 2km away from the spot. The forest department has installed camera traps in the Junapani area. “The area is close to the Vena reservoir and is a good tiger habitat. Junapani is also part of the newly notified Munia Conservation Reserve,” said Chandekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-sighted-in-phukeshwar-20km-from-city/articleshow/84049150.cms||---

---||Delhi||Why it’s too early to say if Delta+ variant is more infectious or fatal||NEW DELHI: Is the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 more infectious or fatal? The jury is still out on this. Epidemiologists say there isn’t enough data available to state this yet. Across the country, sources in National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) told TOI, over 50 cases of Delta Plus — a mutated form of Delta variant that was first detected in India last year — have been confirmed. “We have sequenced around 3,500 swab samples of Covid-positive patients from Delhi. None of them have been found positive for Delta Plus yet,” said a senior official from NCDC. He added that most cases of the new mutated variant had been detected from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, among others. Dr Anurag Agarwal, director of Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said the fears were unfounded. “At this time, the cases are too few and Delta also has immune escape properties,” he added. Delta Plus, the IGIB director said, was simply a short form for Delta Plus new mutation, which was seen in two lineages: AY.1 and AY.2. “Once there are sufficient cases with new mutation, especially when the mutation may be important, new lineage names may be given. All such sub-lineages are assumed to have at least the risk level of the parent lineage and are investigated further. Therefore, it starts as a variant of concern. At this time, not much is known about AY.1/2,” he added. Dr Agarwal said they were looking for any effect on immunity by previous infections or vaccines in cases of Covid-19 caused by the Delta Plus variant. Currently, most of the genome sequencing to identify new variants is taking place in the labs at NCDC and Pune’s National Institute of Virology. Many states, including Delhi, are gearing up to set up new labs with the facility for genome sequencing. “We have imported the machine already. Genome sequencing will start at our hospital soon,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital. He added that they had trained manpower available. “We realised the need for this machine when the UK and Brazil variants were reported,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-its-too-early-to-say-if-delta-variant-is-more-infectious-or-fatal/articleshow/84049193.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Kochi||Kochi: Government takes over 600-year-old synagogue||KOCHI: In what can be termed as a boost to heritage conservation efforts in the city, revenue department finally took over the over 600-year-old Kadavumbhagam Synagogue in Mattancherry and handed it over to archaeology department on Thursday. Though the government had allotted funds for taking over the synagogue of Malabari Jews way back in 2016, the authorities took around five years to complete the acquisition process. On Thursday afternoon, officials with the revenue department went to the site and took possession of the synagogue and 3.45 are of land which houses the structure. Officials with the revenue department said they deposited the compensation amount with the court as some court cases are pending regarding the land owner availing of loans. The total compensation amount including the land value, solatium and interest comes to around Rs 1.05 crore. According to professor C Karmachandran, a Jewish historian, the acquisition of the synagogue assumes much historic importance. “When the Jewish community had to leave their homeland centuries ago, India was a country which gave protection to them. It is in Muziris or Kodungallur that they settled first. As the Muziris port and surrounding areas were ravaged in the flood in 1341, the Jewish community who had settled there moved on to other parts of Kerala like north Paravur and Kochi. Some of the Malabari Jews from Kodungallur later constructed a synagogue in Mattancherry. That came to be known as the Kadavumbhagom synagogue,” Karmachandran said. “It is believed to have been constructed in 1344. The Malabari Jews in Mattancherry went back to Israel in the 1950s. Then the synagogue was handed over to a Paradesi (white Jew). Later, the monument changed hands several times,” Karmachandran said. Regina, the last owner of the land and the structure, had availed of loans from private money lenders and later from Punjab National Bank by mortgaging the land. Now, the amount deposited in the court will be given to the land owner, bank and the private money lenders as per the entitlements. The structure has been in a dilapidated condition and may collapse anytime. The archaeology department had started measures to stabilise the structure in October 2020. “Our plan was to construct a roofing which is totally detached from the synagogue’s structure so that it gets protection from rain. But, we couldn’t do it due to objection from local residents and Kochi Corporation,” an official with the archaeology department said. A few local residents had raised objection to the acquisition by the government. Their main contention was that if the archaeology department takes over the synagogue as a monument, 300 metres surrounding the monument will declared construction-ban area and it will affect Mattancherry’s development. But the archaeology department made it clear that there is no such restriction when the state archaeology department takes over a monument. “Still, some of the local money lenders and land sharks, who have an eye on the synagogue land, would try to demolish the existing structure. They had made such attempts earlier as well. So, the authorities should take urgent steps to protect the synagogue from such vested interests,” said Raphael Antony, secretary, International Forum for Cultural Heritage and Tradition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-takes-over-600-yr-old-synagogue/articleshow/84047109.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC cautions Rabari elders over dispute resolution||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has cautioned the leaders of the Rabari community that instead of resolving family disputes on their own without having any legal background, they should approach the local legal services. The bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Gita Gopi cautioned the community leaders while ordering a school teacher to hand over the custody of his 4-year-old to his divorced wife. After customary divorce, the husband retained the child’s custody and the woman moved the HC. The teacher claimed that on the day of divorce, his wife’s parents had made him pay Rs 9.5 lakh for giving up the custody of the child. This happened before a community panch near Unjha to decide on the divorce in October 2020. He submitted a number of affidavits from community members to support his claim. On the other hand, the woman claimed that the amount was given towards permanent alimony. To substantiate this, she also provided various affidavits from community members. The HC also heard the community leaders who were acting as panch to redress the issue. After hearing the case, the judges ordered the father to hand over the child’s custody to the mother. The court ordered that the amount of Rs 9.5 lakh should be placed in fixed deposit for seven years for the child’s welfare. While ordering that the child’s custody be handed over to the mother, the division bench had a word of caution to the community leaders. The court said, “…rather than taking upon themselves this task in future, without any legal background, [they] should approach the Taluka Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987…”. The court said that the “compromise in Lok Adalat and/or at pre-litigation stage shall be worked out, culminating into the decree of the Court.” The court was said that the legal services authority would not only provide the right guidance, but it would also have a legal and binding effect on any such compromise to govern the rights of the parties. The HC directed the member secretary of the Gujarat State Legal Services Authority to spread legal awareness for better handling of such situations by community leaders.  Court quotes Khalil Gibran The Gujarat HC quoted the renowned poet Khalil Gibran in its order on a petition filed by a woman seeking the custody of her daughter from her estranged husband. It cited the poem ‘On Children’ from his famous work ‘The Prophet’. The court reminded the parents, “Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of life’s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you…”. The court discarded the father’s argument that he was remarrying so that the child could be properly looked after. The court said when the mother is so keen to look after the child and is claiming her custody, the child cannot be thrust upon the wife-to-be of the father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-cautions-rabari-elders-over-dispute-resolution/articleshow/84001257.cms||---

Under a mass plantation drive, the state government will plant 30 crore trees this year. The CM said that to raise Ramayan Van (mini-forests with Ramayan-era trees) people in gram sabhas along the route should be made to participate in the drive. The route is the Ram Van Gaman Marg, which lord Ram followed in his exile. Yogi said that conservation of Ram Van Gaman Marg is essential to connecting posterity with its glorious past. It will also help reclaim and restore the mythological look and significance of ancient spots and forests. Valmiki Ramayan has mention of 88 tree species. Many of these are now extinct in UP and are no longer raised in nurseries. The forest department will plant 30 of these species in Ayodhya, Prayagraj and Chitrakoot along Ram Van Gaman Marg as per climatic and soil conditions. In Ayodhya, the Ram Van Gaman Marg starts from Ramjanmabhoomi and extends till Beruganj gram sabha of Bikapur forest range. It is a 34km stretch. At least 27,000 trees will be planted in gram sabhas along the route. Benwa, Jamunipur, Gyasulabad, Ashapur Chandai and Bikapur are the gram sabhas identified for plantation. Besides, Gangaghat Hanuman Mandir and Shravan Ashram are the two sites where at least 220 trees would be planted for beautification. In Chitrakoot, plantation of Ramayan-era trees will be done in a 35-hectare area. The Ramayana-era trees include mango, banyan, jackfruit, bamboo, neem, pomegranate, sandal, Ashok, kalpvriksha, siras, amaltas, semal, aonla, bahera, palash, bel, ber, khair, chitwan, kachnar, arjun, kadamb, mahua and tamaal. Last year, the state government had planted 25 crore trees. In 2019, 22 crore trees were planted and in 2018, the state got 11 crore trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/back-to-roots-ramayan-van-will-link-posterity-with-glorious-past-says-yogi/articleshow/84051082.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Earlier on May 27, fisheries minister Saji Cherian and industries minister P Rajeev, during their joint visit to Chellanam, said that the tendering of seawall construction using tetrapods would be completed by June 25. However, sources with the irrigation department said that the design and estimate of the tetrapod seawall are yet to be completed and the tendering will be initiated only after that. Tetrapods are large concrete structures that are used around the world to break up wave action and absorb the ocean’s eroding energy. During the last sea erosion as part of Tauktae cyclone, the seawall was completely destroyed in many places and there is no barrier between the sea and the houses. The delay in the reconstruction of the seawall makes the area more vulnerable to the sea erosion, which is expected in mid-July again. “The construction of tetrapod seawall involves more complex design and procedures than that of the normal seawall. The effectiveness of the tetrapod interlocking decides the strength of the seawall. National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai, is doing the design works and it is expected to complete soon and based on that the estimate of the project will be finalized. Tendering will be initiated only after that,” said a source. The cost involved in tetrapod construction is much higher than that of the normal seawall. So the Rs16 crore allotted by the state government appears to be not enough for constructing tetrapod seawall along the coast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tendering-for-tetrapod-seawall-yet-to-begin/articleshow/84047123.cms||---
