The joint statement was issued hours after a two-day meeting of a senior delegation of Afghan leaders with the Taliban’s political leadership ended in Doha. A statement issued by the Taliban on Sunday made no mention of a ceasefire, indicating they won't halt violence in the country in the months ahead. The appeal to call a halt to hostilities was issued by Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the European Union delegation, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Britain and the US, besides Nato's senior civilian representative. "We condemn the continued targeted killings taking place throughout Afghanistan, the destruction of vital infrastructure, and threats, declarations and other actions against the gains Afghans have made over the last 20 years, gains which we have strongly supported," the statement said. According to the signatories, the Taliban’s offensive was in direct contradiction to their claim to support a negotiated settlement to the conflict, and to the Doha peace process. "The indiscriminate detaining and killings of civilians and assaults of prisons demonstrates an extremely concerning disregard for the rule of law. In districts occupied by the Taliban, inhabitants and observers also credibly report attempts to repress the human rights of women and girls and to shut down private and public media organisations in an attempt to conceal their human rights abuses and diminish freedom of expression," the statement said. "On behalf of our respective missions, we vehemently condemn these and any other actions that violate the human rights of Afghan citizens. Afghans have made numerous gains over the past 20 years and want to continue building on their achievements in development, human rights, and free speech." Citing the progress made over the past years, the statement said these gains could be sustained "if all parties work together". "We join the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan in calling on the Taliban and all parties to immediately end violence, agree to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, and engage fully in peace negotiations to end the suffering of the Afghan people and pave the way to an inclusive political settlement that benefits all Afghans and ensures that Afghanistan does not again serve as a safe haven for insurgents," it said. Referring to the Eid-ul-Adha holidays in Afghanistan for three days commencing Tuesday, the statement urged the Taliban to lay down their weapons during the festival and "show the world their commitment to the peace process". The Taliban had announced a temporary ceasefire ahead of the last few Eids, saying it wanted to let Afghans spend their holidays in peace. This time, there has been no such announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/15-foreign-missions-nato-envoy-urge-taliban-to-call-a-truce/articleshow/84564657.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

In a separate operation, security forces busted a terrorist hideout and arrested five LeT operatives in central Kashmir’s Budgam district. The slain duo was identified as cop-turned-terrorist Ishfaq Ahmad Dar and Majid Iqbal Bhat, both from Shopian, an official confirmed. Active since 2017, Iqbal was instrumental in planning and executing terror attacks on security establishments, killing civilians, and indoctrinating local youth into militancy. “He was also involved in killing four police personnel at Zainpora in 2018, and murdering two non-local drivers in Shopian’s Chittrigam in 2019,” the official added. Based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in Shopian’s Check-i-Sidique Khan area, a joint team of the Army’s 34RR, J&K Police and CRPF’s 178Bn launched a cordon-and-search operation there. On spotting the security forces, the holed-in terrorists opened fire at the search party, triggering an encounter in which the LeT duo was killed, IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said. Arms and ammunition — including two AK-47 rifles and eight magazines — besides other incriminating material were recovered from the site of the gunfight, police said. Later in the day, a joint team of Army’s 53RR, CRPF’s 43Bn and Budgam Police arrested a Lashkar operative, identified as Mohammad Younis Mir of Choon, Budgam, and recovered arms and ammunition — including a Chinese pistol, one magazine, and eight live pistol rounds — besides other incriminating items from his possession. Based on information revealed by Mir during questioning, the joint team busted a terrorist hideout in the district and arrested four more LeT affiliates — identified as Imran Zahoor Ganie, Umer Farooq Wani, Faizan Qayoom Ganie and Shahnawaz Ahmad Mir — all residents of Budgam. Arms and ammunition, including two grenades, were recovered from their possession. The LeT operatives were involved in providing shelter and logistic support to active terrorists of the outfit, besides transporting arms across Budgam. They were in constant touch with their Pakistan-based handlers and local commanders in Kashmir through social media, police said. Budgam Police have registered a case under relevant sections of law in this regard. An investigation is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cop-turned-terrorist-among-lashkar-duo-killed-in-shopian-encounter/articleshow/84565168.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The government last week said that it is working actively with vaccine manufacturer Moderna to see how its vaccine can be made available in the country. Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation by India's drug regulator last month. "India has been offered 7.5 million doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine through the COVAX global vaccine sharing programme," a source said. However, there is no clarity so far when the shots would be available in India as "the talks are still on and a consensus on the indemnity issue is yet to be reached," a source said. On the availability of Moderna vaccine in the country, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul had recently said the government is working actively with Moderna to see how its vaccine can be imported and made available in the country. "...to and fro (talks) are going on over the contractual specifics. Discussions have not yet concluded. We are making efforts as to it happens at the earliest. We are now expecting to hear from them anytime. Currently, they have to respond to some of the points we have made and we will take it forward," he said on Friday. According to sources, the Indian government has put forth certain conditions for finalising the indemnity clause contract and has sent it to the US drug manufacturer for their perusal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-offered-7-5-million-doses-of-moderna-vaccine-no-consensus-on-indemnity-clause-yet-sources/articleshow/84565729.cms||---
---||World||No ‘proof’ that Afghan envoy's daughter was abducted, Pakistan cries false narrative||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan claimed on Monday that the abduction and torture of Afghan ambassador Najibullah Alikhel’s daughter in Islamabad last Friday wasn't corroborated by the evidence gathered by police, suggesting that the episode was "part of an orchestrated campaign" to "create a narrative" against the country. Flanked by Pakistan’s national security adviser and foreign minister, Islamabad police chief Qazi Jamilur Rehman said at a presser that analysis of CCTV footage of the movements of Selsela Alikhel on that day revealed no evidence of her being abducted at any point. He said the police interviewed more than 200 people in the case, including the drivers of taxis that the Afghan envoy's daughter had hailed, and matched their statements with the camera footage. On Sunday, interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed had said investigators were close to cracking the case in a day or two. National security adviser Dr Moeed Yusuf claimed that Pakistan was currently the target of "hybrid warfare", with an entire network of information being used against it. He said fake social media accounts and bots were being used to further the narrative, including the incident involving the Afghan envoy's daughter. Sharing slides on data gathered by the government, the official said hashtags were trending on a daily basis to "create false impressions" that Pakistan was doing something wrong in Afghanistan and that the security situation was bad. "Various fronts have been opened against Pakistan," he said, adding that the same accounts allegedly responsible for "fake propaganda" regarding Balochistan or Kashmir were at work since the alleged abduction of the ambassador’s daughter. "Some of these accounts are operated from inside Pakistan, while the rest are e-controlled from Afghanistan, India and the West," Yusuf claimed. He said the "spoilers" were trying to create rifts between Pakistan and Afghanistan and added that this narrative reflected that Pakistan was being made a scapegoat in Afghanistan. "Blaming us for the failures of someone else in Afghanistan will not be acceptable to us," he said. According to police chief Rehman, the Afghan envoy's daughter left home on Friday on foot, then hired a taxi from Rana Market (F-7/2 sector, Islamabad) and headed to Khadda Market (G-7 Markaz, Islamabad). "We subsequently identified the taxi and located its driver and interrogated him." He said Selsela hired a second cab from Khadda Market that took her to the garrison city of Rawalpindi. "Similarly, we traced the second taxi and its driver confirmed that he picked up the woman from the market and dropped her off at Saddar, Rawalpindi. We also obtained footage." The Afghan envoy’s daughter went in another cab from Rawalpindi to Daman-e-Koh, a hilltop garden in Islamabad, the police chief said. "Upon reaching there, she hired a fourth taxi for F-9 park (Fatima Jinnah Park), making a brief stopover at Sector F-6," he said. "The driver of this taxi told police that the woman asked him to stop the car at F-6, and made a phone call to someone, but it did not go through. She then asked to be taken to F-9 park," Rehman said. When Selsela reached F-9, she allegedly called someone at the embassy and the staffer picked her up from there. According to the police chief, Selsela contended that she didn't visit Rawalpindi, but her claim was contradicted by the available CCTV footage. According to Selsela's formal complaint, she was returning home in the afternoon by taxi after visiting Islamabad’s Blue Area when the driver picked up another man. The passenger, according to her, abused and assaulted her. She was later dumped unconscious by the roadside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/no-proof-that-afghan-envoys-daughter-was-abducted-pakistan-cries-false-narrative/articleshow/84565327.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||US coronavirus cases rise, fueling fears of resurgence||NEW YORK: A rapid increase in coronavirus cases in the United States and abroad is fueling fears of a pandemic resurgence and sending shockwaves through the stock market as the highly contagious Delta variant takes hold and vaccinations lag in several states.  Largely due to outbreaks in parts of the country with low vaccination rates, the number of new cases, hospitalizations and deaths due to Covid-19 have been on the rise in recent weeks.  The vaccines work against the Delta variant, but lab tests have shown them to be less effective than they were against the original form of coronavirus.  Studies have also shown that two shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and of the AstraZeneca vaccine are much more effective than one shot against being infected with the virus, making it more important for people to be fully vaccinated.  Concerns the outbreaks could derail an economic recovery sent the Dow down more than 2% on Monday.  In a speech about the US economy, President Joe Biden said the recovery hinges on getting the pandemic under control. He said four states with low vaccination rates accounted for 40% of all cases last week.  "So please, please get vaccinated," Biden said. "Get vaccinated now."  The average number of new Covid-19 cases per day has tripled in the past 30 days in the United States, according to an analysis of Reuters data. In the month from June 18 to Sunday, it climbed from 12,004 to 32,136.  The average number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 has gone up 21% over the past 30 days to over 19,000, up from 16,000, according to the same Reuters analysis.  Deaths, which can lag weeks behind a rise in cases, rose 25% last week from the previous seven days with an average of 250 people dying a day.  Some states have been especially hard hit. All but two of the 75 Arkansas counties have substantial or high levels of transmission, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  But even in states with higher vaccination rates, such as New York, officials have expressed concern about fresh outbreaks, pointing to the significantly more contagious Delta variant.  So far, the variant has been detected around 100 countries globally and is now the dominant variant worldwide, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci told reporters last week.  In California, Los Angeles County reimposed a mask mandate at the weekend. It followed six straight days of more than 1,000 new Covid-19 cases in the county, with nearly 400 people hospitalized with Covid-19 as of Wednesday, up 275 from the week before.  While New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged a rise in the number of cases, he told a daily news conference on Monday there were no plans to reintroduce mask mandates. He vowed instead to redouble vaccination efforts.  Overseas, Covid-19 restrictions are being reimposed in countries experiencing worrying spikes. The Netherlands announced it was reimposing work-from-home guidelines due to soaring Covid-19 infections, just weeks after lifting them, as well as some restrictions on bars, restaurants and nightclubs.  Britain ended over a year of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions on Monday but the so-called "Freedom Day" was marred by surging infections and grim forecasts.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday issued a more severe warning against travel to the United Kingdom, elevating the nation to "Level Four: Covid-19 Very High," the CDC's highest level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-coronavirus-cases-rise-fueling-fears-of-resurgence/articleshow/84565215.cms||---
---||World||US had a two-month recession in 2020: Researchers||WASHINGTON: The US economy was in recession for two months in 2020 at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic as businesses shut their doors nationwide and laid off employees, the committee making the determination said on Monday. Economic activity peaked in February 2020 and hit its trough the following April, making the recession that began in March the shortest on record, according to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, non-partisan research organization. The downturn suddenly ended 128 months of expansion in the world's largest economy as cities and states nationwide ordered businesses to close or curtail operations to stop the spread of Covid-19. However increases in employment and economic growth that occurred from May 2020 onwards cut the recession short, the NBER said. "The committee decided that any future downturn of the economy would be a new recession and not a continuation of the recession associated with the February 2020 peak. The basis for this decision was the length and strength of the recovery to date," it said in a statement. The pandemic caused horrific damage to the world's largest economy, with government data showing 22 million jobs lost between February and April 2020 and GDP contracting 31.4 percent, annualized, in the second quarter, when the restrictions were at their worst. However the economy resumed expansion in May 2020, the NBER said, and in the year since has recovered ground. The IMF predicts the US economy could expand seven percent this year, its fastest pace since 1984, after collapsing 3.5 percent in 2020, its worst year since modern record keeping began in 1946.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-had-a-two-month-recession-in-2020-researchers/articleshow/84566269.cms||---
---||World||French cabinet approves measures to incite vaccination||PARIS: The French government approved a draft law Monday that is intended to pressure non-vaccinated people to get a jab against Covid-19 as the country faces a surge in new cases.  The law, which is expected to be presented to parliament at the end of the week, was approved at a cabinet meeting on Monday, said government spokesman Gabriel Attal.  It will massively extend a "health pass" system that will require people to produce evidence of vaccination or a negative test when they visit public venues such as restaurants, bars or shopping centres.  The government has said the legislation is intended to incite people to take up the offer of jabs, and more than three million people have booked appointments since it was outlined by President Emmanuel Macron last Monday.  The proposals have led to mass protests and accusations from some politicians that Macron is abusing his powers and even running a "dictatorship".  A former member of Macron's parliamentary party, Martine Wonner, urged protesters at the weekend to "go lay siege to lawmakers, go invade their headquarters, to tell them you do not agree."  Around 114,000 people rallied around France on Saturday to protest the system, with some wearing a yellow star, seeking to liken the treatment of the non-vaccinated with that of Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe during World War II.  The government and Holocaust survivors have condemned the symbolism.  "This is an odious comparison," Joseph Szwarc, a survivor of a notorious roundup of Jews in Paris, said at a remembrance event on Sunday, adding that the sight of the yellow stars had greatly saddened him.  "I wore the star. I know what it is. It's in my flesh," he said.  Europe Minister Clement Beaune called the comparisons "monstrous".  Elsewhere, a Covid-19 vaccination centre in southwest France was set on fire in a suspected arson attack early Sunday in Urrugne in the southwestern Basque region, local prosecutor Jerome Bourrier announced.  Overnight on Friday, a centre in Lans-en-Vercors, southeast France, was vandalised and tagged with anti-vaccination graffitti.  The government says it has no choice but to urge people to get vaccinated as the country faces a fourth wave of cases linked to the spread of the more contagious Delta variant.  Opinion polls show that most French people approve.  "We have a fourth wave that is taking off, with a rise in cases that is stratospheric," government spokesman Attal told journalists on Monday.  The country reported 12,500 daily cases on Sunday, double the number of a week ago.  Health Minister Olivier Veran has said that nine out of 10 newly infected people are unvaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/french-cabinet-approves-measures-to-incite-vaccination/articleshow/84566756.cms||---
---||World||US: Largest fire grows, force evacuation of wildlife station||PORTLAND: The nation's largest wildfire torched more dry forest in Oregon and forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station Monday as firefighters had to retreat from the flames for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behaviour. Firefighters were forced to pull back as flames, pushed by winds and fuelled by bone-dry conditions, jumped fire-retardant containment lines and pushed up to 4 miles into new territory, authorities said. The destructive Bootleg Fire in south-central Oregon is just north of the California border and grew to more than 476 square miles (1,210 sq km), an area about the size of Los Angeles. Fire crews were also rushing to corral multiple “slop fires” — patches of flames that escaped fire lines meant to contain the blaze — before they grew in size. One of those smaller fires was already nearly 4 square miles (10 sq km) in size. Thunderstorms with dry lightning were possible Monday as well, heightening the dangers. “We are running firefighting operations through the day and all through the night,” said Joe Hessel, incident commander. “This fire is a real challenge, and we are looking at sustained battle for the foreseeable future.” On Monday, the fire reached the southern edge of Sycan Marsh, a privately owned wetland that hosts thousands of migrating birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration. The blaze, which was 25% contained, has burned at least 67 homes and 100 buildings while threatening thousands more in a remote landscape of forests, lakes and wildlife refuges. At the other end of the state, a fire in the mountains of northeast Oregon grew to nearly 19 square miles (49 sq km). The Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, rural communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 km) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. It was 10% contained. Natural features of the area act like a funnel for wind, feeding the flames and making them unpredictable, officials said. In California, a growing wildfire south of Lake Tahoe jumped a highway, prompting more evacuation orders, the closure of the Pacific Crest Trail and the cancellation of an extreme bike ride through the Sierra Nevada. The Tamarack Fire, which was sparked by lightning on July 4, had charred about 36 square miles (93 sq km) of dry brush and timber as of Monday. Crews were improving a line protecting Markleeville, a small town close to the California-Nevada state line. It has destroyed at least two structures, authorities said. About 500 fire personnel were battling the flames Sunday, “focusing on preserving life and property with point protection of structures and putting in containment lines where possible,” the US Forest Service said. Meteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather with lightning possible through at least Monday in both California and southern Oregon. “With the very dry fuels, any thunderstorm has the potential to ignite new fire starts,” the National Weather Service in Sacramento, California, said on Twitter. Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have swept the region, making wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Firefighters said in July they were facing conditions more typical of late summer or fall. Northern California's Dixie Fire roared to new life Sunday, prompting new evacuation orders in rural communities near the Feather River Canyon. The wildfire, near the 2018 site of the deadliest US blaze in recent memory, was 15% contained and covered 39 square miles. The fire is northeast of the town of Paradise, California, and survivors of that horrific fire that killed 85 people watched warily as the new blaze burned. Pacific Gas & Electric equipment may have been involved in the start of the Dixie Fire, the nation's largest utility reported to California regulators. PG&E said in a report Sunday to the California Public Utilities Commission that a repair man responding to a circuit outage on July 13 spotted blown fuses in a conductor atop a pole, a tree leaning into the conductor and fire at the base of the tree. The Dixie Fire has grown to nearly 47 square miles (122 sq km), largely in remote wilderness. The utility said investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection have collected equipment from the location. PG&E equipment has repeatedly been linked to major wildfires, including a 2018 fire that ravaged the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. At least 16 major fires were burning in the Pacific Northwest alone, according to the Forest Service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-largest-fire-grows-force-evacuation-of-wildlife-station/articleshow/84566820.cms||---

Venkatesh of Tavarekere is the second RTI activist to be murdered in the state in four days. A gang had hacked T Sridhar, 40, from Harapanahalli in Vijayanagara district, to death on July 15. The two murders have shaken the community of RTI activists, prompting the Karnataka RTI Activists State Committee to demand a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the killings. Former central information commissioner Shailesh Gandhi and former Karnataka state information commissioner L Krishna Murthy, who were part of the committee, said vested interests are behind the murders as both the activists had information on several issues. Leg, wrist cut offFive miscreants, who came on two bikes, had chopped off Venkatesh’s right leg below his knee and right wrist on July 15. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where his severed limbs were reattached. But he did not respond to treatment and breathed his last on Sunday. According to the committee, Venkatesh had been filing RTI applications seeking information on various government departments. He had also filed many corruption complaints and some projects were stopped because of his complaints.  Sridhar too had filed several RTI queries pertaining to different issues in the area. The committee said Sridhar's wife had named a former minister and son as suspects but the FIR named none of them. Sridhar was also receiving threat calls from the supporters of a former minister and MLA. Home minister Basavaraj Bommai has called for a meeting of police officials to discuss the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/two-rti-activists-killed-in-four-days/articleshow/84563699.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Housekeeper orchestrates Rs 20 lakh burglary, held in 18 hours||BENGALURU: Koramangala police cracked a house-theft case within 18 hours of the incident and less than six hours of the complaint being lodged. They arrested four suspects and recovered booty worth Rs 20 lakh, including expensive wrist watches and gold ornaments. The prime accused, R Chotu Kumar Mukhiya, worked as housekeeping staffer at the residence of industrialist Varun Shah in Koramangala 5th Block. Chotu’s associates P Ranjith Kumar Mukhiya, 19, H Gautam Kumar Mukhiya, 20, and Pankaj Kumar Mukhiya, 22, stayed at a PG in Marathahalli and are from Bihar’s Madhubani district. According to police, the theft took place on July 14 midnight. The complaint was lodged around 12.45pm the next day and by 6pm, all the four accused were arrested. Shah, who is from Kolkata, deals in silk clothes and runs a factory at Bommasandra, Jigani. He and his wife had flown to Kolkata on July 8, police said, adding, “Chotu was in charge of the house. The watchman slept soundly on the night of the incident.” Police said Chotu hatched the conspiracy and roped in three others, working as cooks at a PG in Marathhalli; all four lived together.  Chotu’s elder brother Tulasi Mukhiya was working at Shah’s residence as a housekeeping staffer before quitting the job in April, said police. On Tulasi’s recommendation, Shah had employed 19-year-old Chotu. Around 12.45pm on July 15, Shah’s manager lodged a complaint and Srinath Mahadev Joshi, DCP (southeast), formed four special teams. The first two looked into technical aspects like collecting CCTV footage and tracking call records. “The doors and windows were intact, indicating the thieves had a smooth entry. They walked directly into the bedroom on the first floor, where the valuables were kept in a cupboard. No other item in the house was touched. This proved that someone known to the family was the suspect,” Joshi explained. “CCTV footage showed how the men walked into the compound, used a ladder to access the kitchen on the first floor and jumped into the house through the open window,” he said. Joshi said the suspects were seen making calls from their mobile phones; their body language indicated they were being directed by someone over phone. Booty recovered from their roomPolice checked call details of the three employees of the household, including Chotu. They found that Chotu’s mobile phone was busy the previous midnight. On scanning, police found Chotu’s PG mates had called him several times and their tower location was the same as Chotu’s. “We detained Chotu first and questioned him; we also raided the PG. The hidden booty was recovered from their rooms and all four were arrested,” said Joshi. “Chotu, who knew about Shah’s travel schedule, planned the burglary. He asked his three associates to visit the house at midnight and look for a ladder, which he would place behind the kitchen. Chotu had told them he would keep the kitchen window unlocked to facilitate their entry into the house,” Joshi said. Asked why Chotu did not accompany the three, police said, “Chotu knew that there were CCTV cameras and he could be identified.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/housekeeper-orchestrates-20l-burglary-held-in-18-hrs/articleshow/84563697.cms||---

---||World||New Haiti leader with international backing to take charge||PORT-AU-PRINCE: A new prime minister supported by key international diplomats will take charge of Haiti, an official said Monday — a move that appeared aimed at averting a leadership struggle following the assassination of President Jovenal Moïse. Ariel Henry, who was designated prime minister by Moïse before he was slain but never sworn in, will replace the country's interim prime minister, Haiti Elections Minister Mathias Pierre told The Associated Press. It wasn't immediately clear how quickly Claude Joseph, who has been leading Haiti with the backing of police and the military since the July 7 assassination of Moïse, would step down. “Negotiations are still in course,” Pierre said, adding that Joseph would go back to being minister of foreign affairs. There was no immediate comment from Joseph. In an audio recording, Henry referred to himself as prime minister and called for unity, saying he would soon announce the members of what he called a provisional consensus government to lead the country until elections are held. “I present my compliments to the Haitian people who have shown political maturity in the face of what can be considered a coup...Our Haitian brothers gave peace a chance, while leaving the possibility that the truth could one day be restored," Henry said. “Now it is up to all the national leaders to walk together in unity, towards the same goal, to show that they are responsible.” The political turnover followed a statement Saturday from a key group of international diplomats that appeared to snub Joseph as it called for the creation of "a consensual and inclusive government.” “To this end, it strongly encourages the designated Prime Minister Ariel Henry to continue the mission entrusted to him to form such a government,” the statement from the Core Group said. The Core Group is composed of ambassadors from Germany, Brazil, Canada, Spain, the US, France, the European Union and representatives from the United Nations and the Organisation of American States. On Monday, the UN issued a statement calling on Joseph, Henry and other national stakeholders “to set aside differences and engage in constructive dialogue on ways to end the current impasse”. The UN added that Joseph and Henry made significant progress in the past week and that it supports dialogue to find “minimal consensus” for holding fair legislative and presidential elections. Monique Clesca, a Haitian writer, activist and former UN official, said she doesn't anticipate any changes under Henry, whom she expects to carry on Moïse's legacy. But she warned Henry might be viewed as tainted because of the international backing that preceded his taking power. “There is not only a perception, but the reality that he has been put there by the international community, and I think that's his burden to carry,” she said. “What we're calling for is for Haitians to really say this is unacceptable. We do not want the international community stating who ought to be in power and what ought to be done. It is up to us.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that the Biden administration “welcomes reports that Haitian political actors are working together to determine a path forward in the country”. “We have been encouraging, for several days now, Haitian political actors to work together and find a political way forward,” she said. Earlier, US State Department spokesman Ned Price had said the US would continue to work with Joseph after noting he was the incumbent in the position and was serving as acting prime minister before the assassination. The Core Group statement was issued hours after Moïse's wife, Martine, arrived in Haiti on Saturday aboard a private jet clad in black and wearing a bulletproof vest after being released from a hospital in Miami. She has not issued a statement or spoken publicly since her return to Haiti as the government prepares for the July 23 funeral that will be held in the northern city of Cap-Haitien. Other events to honour Moïse are planned this week in the capital of Port-au-Prince ahead of the funeral. Moïse designated Henry as prime minister shortly before he was killed, but he had not been sworn in. The neurosurgeon was previously minister of social affairs and interior minister. He has belonged to several political parties including Inite, which was founded by former President Rene Preval. The upcoming change in leadership comes as authorities continue to investigate the July 7 attack at Moïse's private home with high-powered rifles that seriously wounded his wife. Authorities say more than 20 suspects directly involved in the killing have been arrested. The majority of them are former Colombian soldiers, most of whom Colombian officials say were duped. Another three suspects were killed, with police still seeking additional ones, including an ex-Haitian rebel leader and a former Haitian senator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/new-haiti-leader-with-international-backing-to-take-charge/articleshow/84567270.cms||---
---||World||Mexico president's entourage among possible spyware victims: Reports||MEXICO CITY: People close to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador were among the possible victims of Israeli spyware at the center of a global surveillance scandal, reports said Monday. Lopez Obrador's wife, children, brother and even his cardiologist were among those selected for potential surveillance using Pegasus malware before he took office in 2018, news website Aristegui Noticias said. Their telephone numbers were entered into the system between 2016 and 2017 for possible use with the software acquired from Israeli firm NSO Group, it reported. At the time Lopez Obrador was the opposition leader and political rival of then president Enrique Pena Nieto. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, cabinet ministers and other officials of the current government were also identified as potential targets, it said. However, a leak of more than 50,000 smartphone numbers believed to have been selected by NSO clients did not include Lopez Obrador himself, according to Aristegui Noticias. The leftist leader "apparently did not use a personal cell phone" and communicated through his aides, it said. The revelations emerged on Sunday as part of a collaborative investigation by The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde and other media outlets. Mexico was the first country in the world to buy Pegasus from NSO "and became something of a laboratory for the spy technology," according to The Guardian. Mexican agencies that have acquired the spyware include the defence ministry, the attorney general's office and the national security intelligence service, it said. NSO insists it is only intended for use in fighting terrorism and other crimes. The Pegasus license in Mexico expired in 2017 and was not renewed, according to the reports. At least 15,000 Mexican telephone numbers were on the list, including those linked to 25 journalists, one of whom was murdered in 2017 after criticizing alleged links between politicians and criminals, the investigation found. It is unclear how many devices were actually spied on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexico-presidents-entourage-among-possible-spyware-victims-reports/articleshow/84566893.cms||---
---||World||Biden clean energy plan key to restoring industry job losses, says US official||The US energy sector lost 10% of its workforce last year due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report unveiled on Monday by US government officials, who said President Joe Biden's clean energy plan was critical to reviving the industry.  The US energy workforce, from fossil fuels to solar power, shed 840,000 jobs in 2020 as the global health crisis sapped demand for transportation fuels and slowed new projects, according to the annual US Energy Employment Report. The largest declines were in petroleum and natural gas fuels with a combined loss of 186,000 jobs, or 21% of their workforce, according to the report. Employment in the wind energy industry was among the only sectors to grow, rising a modest 1.8%. The Biden administration is pushing several initiatives to boost clean energy industries as part of a sweeping infrastructure package being hashed out by Congress, arguing that a transition away from fossil fuels can create millions of good-paying union jobs while countering climate change. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Monday that Biden's plan was an opportunity to revitalize the energy industry while also improving wages, union representation and diversity in the clean energy business. "While we do have work to do to make our energy sector more robust, we also have a lot of work to do in making our energy sector look like America and to make sure that these new clean energy jobs are paying family-sustaining wages, with good benefits and union membership," Granholm said during a virtual event to unveil the report. Wind and solar jobs are currently less likely to be unionized than those in nuclear, natural gas and coal, according to the report. The energy industry as a whole also employs fewer women and people of color than the broader economy, the report found. The report was published by the National Association of State Energy Officials, think tank Energy Futures Initiative and research firm BW Research Partnership, with funding from the US Department of Energy. A report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-energy-jobs/nuclear-coal-oil-jobs -pay-more-than-those-in-wind-solar-report-idUSKBN2BT2OT released earlier this year by the same group also found that workers in nuclear energy and fossil fuel industries earn higher wages than those in renewable energy sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-clean-energy-plan-key-to-restoring-industry-job-losses-says-us-official/articleshow/84567710.cms||---
---||World||Senate Democrats take their case for voting bill to Georgia||ATLANTA: Taking their case for a federal voting bill to Georgia, Senate Democrats argued at a field hearing on Monday that their sweeping elections measure is desperately needed to counter the impact of new GOP state laws that tighten voting rules.  "Congress must take action on voting rights, and we have no time to spare," US Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, said in testimony before the Senate Rules Committee. "We Americans live in a great house that democracy built, and right now that house is on fire."  Democrats used the rare field hearing in Atlanta to gain attention for their voting and elections overhaul, which remains blocked by unified Republican opposition and disagreement among Senate Democrats about whether to change procedural rules in the evenly divided Senate to get it passed.  Without a clear path forward, Democrats are seeking to keep the spotlight on voting issues, as they search for other ways to pass less sweeping voting proposals. On Sunday, committee chair Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Democrats were considering adding financial incentives for states to adopt new voting procedures into a multitrillion-dollar bill bolstering environmental and social programs.  Monday's hearing was held in a conference room at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in downtown Atlanta, which senators called a powerful reminder of the long struggle for voting rights in the US.  "We are here today in Atlanta to shine a spotlight on what has been happening in Georgia and in states around the country to undermine the freedom to vote," said Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota.  The federal bill, known as the For the People Act, would create minimum voting standards in the U.S., such as same-day and automatic voter registration, early voting and no-excuse absentee voting. The bill would also change various campaign finance and ethics laws.  Republicans, though, have united in opposition, calling the bill a Democratic power grab and saying the changes amount to a federal takeover of elections, which are administered in the U.S. at the state and local level.  No Republicans attended the hearing, and they did not provide witnesses.  "This silly stunt is based on the same lie as all the Democrats' phony hysteria from Georgia to Texas to Washington D.C. and beyond - their efforts to pretend that moderate, mainstream state voting laws with more generous early-voting provisions than blue states like New York are some kind of evil assault on our democracy," GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.  Republicans last month blocked an effort to debate the Democratic bill, and Democrats will have to decide whether they want to change Senate filibuster rules to ultimately pass the bill. At least two Democratic senators, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have said they oppose eliminating the filibuster rule.  Manchin, who initially opposed the bill, has crafted a new version that would remove some of the more contentious provisions and add a national ID requirement, something Democrats had not previously advocated for.  Much of Monday's hearing focused on a GOP-backed elections bill that was signed into law by Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp earlier this year.  The Georgia law adds a voter ID requirement for mail ballots, shortens the time period for requesting a mailed ballot and results in fewer ballot drop boxes available in metro Atlanta. Several lawsuits have been filed over the law, including one by the U.S. Department of Justice.  "We desperately need your help," Georgia state Sen. Sally Harrell, a Democrat from metro Atlanta, told the senators during the hearing. "Where you live shouldn't determine how hard it is to vote or whether or not your vote counts. This is the time to take action, to pass national voting standards, and I implore you to do so."  Georgia Republicans have pushed back against claims that their election law makes it harder to vote, noting the state offers many of the measures being sought by Democrats in the federal bill, such as early voting, no-excuse absentee voting and automatic registration.  Kemp, speaking to reporters on a call organized by the Republican National Committee, called Monday's hearing a publicity stunt and defended Georgia's new voting law as a "common-sense reform measure."  "It doesn't matter if it's the DOJ, the DNC or the Senate Democrats, we aren't backing down," he said. "We're going to continue to fight for the truth and we're going to stand up for secure, accessible and fair elections."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senate-democrats-take-their-case-for-voting-bill-to-georgia/articleshow/84568325.cms||---
---||World||Biden meets Jordan's King Abdullah to discuss Middle East issues||WASHINGTON: US president Joe Biden on Monday held Oval Office talks with Jordan's King Abdullah, a key US ally in a volatile region, in the first of three face-to-face meetings expected soon with Middle East leaders. Abdullah, who faced down a challenge to his authority in April from his half-brother, Prince Hamza, met Biden for the first time since the US president took power in January. Biden called the king a "good, loyal, decent friend." "You've always been there, and we will always be there for Jordan," he told reporters during a picture-taking session. He said he wanted to hear about developments in the Middle East from the king. "You live in a tough neighborhood," he said. Abdullah said his region has many challenges. "You can always count on me, my country and many of our colleagues in the region," he told Biden. Abdullah will have a working breakfast with vice president Kamala Harris on Tuesday at the vice president's residence. He will also meet Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department. Abdullah plays a unique role in the Middle East, seen by US officials as a moderate and pragmatic leader who can play a mediating role. He is the first Middle East leader to visit the Biden White House, to be followed on July 26 by Iraqi prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi. US and Israeli officials are working on scheduling a meeting soon between Biden and new Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett. A senior Biden administration official said the president's talks with the king were expected to touch on the way forward for Israel and the Palestinians with Bennett having recently replaced Benjamin Netanyahu as Israeli prime minister. Tensions remain high in the wake of the 11-day war in May between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. Abdullah's standing in his own country may come up in the talks. Jordan's image as an island of stability in the turbulent Middle East was called into question after Prince Hamza was accused of a plot to destabilize the country in April. Biden has offered full support to Abdullah, who was joined at the White House by his wife, Queen Rania. Other potential topics were the future of the Trump-era Abraham Accords, the normalization deals reached between Israel and four Arab states, negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program and Syria's humanitarian crisis, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-meets-jordans-king-abdullah-to-discuss-middle-east-issues/articleshow/84568096.cms||---
---||World||Chief: Bomb squad caused Los Angeles fireworks explosion||LOS ANGELES: Los Angeles bomb technicians grossly miscalculated the weight of homemade fireworks last month when they detonated them in a containment chamber, causing a catastrophic explosion that injured 17 people and rocked a neighborhood, the police chief said Monday.  Chief Michel Moore said five members of the department's bomb squad have been removed from field duties as the investigation continues. They could face discipline.  The explosion was highly unusual, officials say, and has prompted the Los Angeles Police Department to review its protocols regarding the detonation of explosives. Residents in the neighborhood have called for accountability and asked why some people were still in their homes, despite a door-to-door evacuation order. Fireworks are illegal to sell or possess in Los Angeles and in unincorporated areas of the county.  The explosion came after police had spent the day disposing of thousands of pounds (kilograms) of commercial-grade fireworks that were found in a South Los Angeles home following an early-morning tip. Those fireworks were detonated at an off-site location.  However, officers also found homemade fireworks that were leaking and the bomb squad decided to detonate them in the neighborhood - believing they were too unstable to transport elsewhere. They examined them by X-ray and robotics and loaded them into the detonation chamber, officially called a total containment vessel.  The bomb technicians - without using a scale, as is allowed by Los Angeles police procedures - estimated the weight of the homemade explosives and a counter-charge to be about 16.5 pounds (7.48 kilograms).  Federal authorities who weighed the remains after the blast calculated that the weight was actually more than 42 pounds (19 kilograms).  The detonation chamber's maximum capacity is 25 pounds (11 kilograms), Moore said.  The truck-mounted chamber used during the June 30 explosion had been in service for a decade and this was its 42nd time in use.  Authorities say they are also investigating whether the detonation device had a defect.  Nine police officers and a federal agent were among the injured. One officer was taken to the hospital and is now recovering at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/chief-bomb-squad-caused-los-angeles-fireworks-explosion/articleshow/84569183.cms||---

No, there is no server or computer with us where data is stored when our technology is given to a customer,” an unnamed company representative told news agency ANI. It suggested that the claims being made in reports of Pegasus being used for snooping appeared exaggerated and questioned claims of forensic examination showing a breach on the phones. It also said claims regarding many of the countries said to be recipients of its software were wrong. It said its technology helps save lives by tracking terrorists and has firewalls and safeguards against human rights abuse. “Where is the proof? We are used to these accusations. They approached us saying 50,000 targets of Pegasus were noticed. That is ridiculous! We sell the licenses, we know that this is an impossibility... out of 50,000 now they seem to be talking about 180, from 180 it has come down to 37 and...now it seems in actuality it’s 12,” the company representative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/phone-numbers-not-from-our-system-says-israels-nso/articleshow/84568932.cms||---
---||World||Pause in Iran nuclear talks 'uncomfortable': IAEA to AFP||RIO DE JANEIRO: A pause in negotiations to salvage Iran's nuclear deal with world powers has placed the International Atomic Energy Agency in an "uncomfortable position," its boss told AFP on Monday. An Iranian official announced on Saturday that the talks in Vienna will not resume before a new government takes office in August, following presidential elections last month won by ultra-conservative Ebrahim Raisi. "We still have a number of questions, issues that we are trying to clarify with Iran, and we will have to wait and start anew with the new team when they are in office," IAEA director general Rafael Grossi told AFP in an interview in Rio de Janeiro during an official visit to Brazil. The announcement that the process would be resumed only after Raisi takes over "leaves us in a rather uncomfortable situation," he added. "I'm talking about the agency, I don't know about the others, but I suppose they would rather be negotiating than waiting." The Islamic republic has been engaged in indirect negotiations with the United States since April in Vienna on reviving its troubled 2015 nuclear agreement. The accord formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action offered Tehran international sanctions relief in exchange for limiting its nuclear program, but was torpedoed in 2018 when former US president Donald Trump withdrew from it and re-imposed sanctions. Trump's successor Joe Biden has signaled his readiness to return to the deal but his administration has also voiced growing frustration as the talks drag on. "We remain open to continuing and ultimately to completing the JCPOA discussions in a productive manner," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters in Washington. "We recognize, along with the international community, the advantage of a mechanism that ensures permanently and verifiably that Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon," he said. "We've also been clear that this offer won't be on the table indefinitely." Iran has pushed hard for relief of all sanctions but the Biden administration says it is only open to relief on measures taken over its nuclear program, not on other issues including human rights and support for regional militants. A sixth round of talks concluded on June 20. They are being brokered by the European Union, which like Britain, China France, Germany and Russia remains in the deal. Incumbent President Hassan Rouhani had repeatedly promised he would get the United States to lift sanctions before the end of his term but last week indicated this would no longer be possible and negotiations would not be complete before he leaves office. Raisi will take over from Rouhani on August 5. Ultimate political power in Iran rests with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who gave the green light for both the original nuclear agreement and the efforts to revive it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/pause-in-iran-nuclear-talks-uncomfortable-iaea-to-afp/articleshow/84569466.cms||---

Shah said the facts and sequence of events are for the entire nation to see. “Today, the monsoon session has started. In what seemed like a perfect cue, late last evening we saw a report that has been amplified by a few sections with only one aim — to do whatever is possible and humiliate India at the world stage, peddle the same old narratives about our nation and derail India’s development trajectory,” the home minister said in a statement, a few hours after Congress sought his resignation over the controversy. Shah said the people have high hopes from the current session. “Just a few days ago, the council of ministers was expanded with great emphasis given to women, SC, ST and OBC members. But there are forces unable to digest this. They also want to derail national progress. This merits the question — to whose tune are these people dancing, who want to keep showing India in poor light? What pleasure do they get to time and again show India in bad light,” he asked. Shah said to see the rudderless Congress jump on to this bandwagon is not unexpected. “They have good past experience in trampling over democracy and with their own house not in order, they are now trying to derail anything progressive that comes up in Parliament.” He said people have often associated “this phrase with me in lighter vein but today I want to seriously say — the timing of the selective leaks, the disruptions…Aap Chronology Samajhiye! This is a report by the disruptors for the obstructors. Disruptors are global organisations which don’t like India to progress. Obstructors are political players in India, who do not want India to progress. People of India are very good at understanding this chronology and connection”. Earlier, at a presser, former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Congress’s allegations were bereft of political propriety and a new low in political discourse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/disruptors-obstructors-will-fail-to-derail-india-amit-shah/articleshow/84569632.cms||---

Joseph Babli alias Babli, resident of Rajendranagar slum, had stayed away from anti-social activities for many years, his family members said. The last criminal case against Babli, who was into the business of civil contract now, was registered in 2011 with Adugodi police. According to police, Babli arrived on a scooter at the Koramangala branch of Union Bank of India at 1.30pm. His wife and daughter alighted from the scooter and Babli went towards the parking lot where half a dozen rivals brandishing lethal weapons accosted him. Seeing them, Babli ran across the parking lot, entered the bank and locked himself inside an empty chamber. But the armed gang chased him. Babli’s wife and daughter too ran into the bank. The assailants smashed the glass panes of the chamber and broke open the door before attacking Babli with machetes and knives. Babli died instantly. Employees panic, hide inside strongroomThe panic-stricken bank staff, around 12 in number, ran into the strongroom, hoping the gang won’t see them. The attackers fled soon after Babli collapsed. There was no guard in the bank, police said. Bank manager Avalokita said: “I was in my cabin and other staff were preparing to close cash transactions. Suddenly, a man entered the chamber near the entrance. Soon, some armed men smashed the glass panes of the chamber and broke open the door. They attacked the man who was standing in a corner and screaming loudly. As he fell, they fled.” There were 25 customers when the incident took place. “Cashdrawing facility was being closed. We were continuing with cash deposits and other work. As the attackers entered the bank, we Joseph Babli was trying to park his scooter when the gang chased him. He tried to hide inside the bank chamber, but the miscreants broke open the door and attacked him with machetes and knives rushed towards the strongroom. However, they did not turn this side. The customers too ran outside,” a staffer told police. Peter (name changed), elder brother of Babli, said the attackers seemed to have followed the scooter from home. The bank is located 1.5 km from Rajendranagar slum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ex-rowdy-killed-inside-bank-as-wife-kid-watch/articleshow/84569783.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Probe ‘CM-change’ audio clip, says Nalin Kumar Kateel||BENGALURU: State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel on Monday denied that it was his voice in a viral audio clip hinting at leadership change in Karnataka. He said that chief minister BS Yediyurappa was the unanimous leader and soul of the state unit, and he would seek a probe over the clip. “I have written to the CM, requesting a complete inquiry. Let the truth come out through the inquiry,” Kateel told reporters before leaving for Delhi. He has claimed in the letter that the voice in the clip was doctored. “I have already filed a complaint in this connection with the Mangaluru police,” he added. The recording surfaced on Sunday, adding to the speculation about Yediyurappa’s stay in office. The timing raised eyebrows because he had just returned from Delhi after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior BJP members. Yediyurappa had dismissed the chatter about his possible exit while he was in Delhi and after flying back to Bengaluru, he said that the brass had asked him to continue leading Karnataka. But the clip, which also contains comments on ministers Jagadish Shettar and KS Eshwarappa’s stint, revived speculation that BJP was working on a succession plan. “Don’t tell anybody... The entire team of Eshwarappa, Shettar will be removed. Three names are there (for the CM’s post), but they won’t be considered. They will appoint someone from Delhi itself,” a man says in the recording. Some in political circles believe the voice resembles Kateel’s, an observation he rejected on Monday. Denying any link with the clip, Kateel said in Mangaluru that no discussion on leadership or any other change in the party had taken place. “Yediyurappa is the aatma (soul) of our party and our unanimous leader. Senior to all of us, he has built the party to this level after several years of struggle. Eshwarappa and Shettar are like two eyes. Under their guidance, the party and the government will function,” he said. On the viral clip, he said: “I have no one to blame. Let the truth come out.” Eshwarappa, the rural development and panchayat raj minister, said in Shivamogga that he didn’t want to stick to any position forever and would quit if the party asked him, adding that younger people were being given positions across the country. “I am already 72 years old. But that does not mean I will go and resign tomorrow. I am committed to following the party’s decision,” he said. Eshwarappa refused to comment on the contents of the recording, but backed Kateel. “Don’t make him (Kateel) a scapegoat. He has been working hard to strengthen the party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/probe-cm-change-audio-clip-kateel/articleshow/84569786.cms||---

Unesco praised the country's conservation efforts and the government's commitment to ban prospecting for oil in Salonga, the vast central African country's largest public park. The World Heritage Committee cited "improvements towards its conservation state" in its decision, according to a statement Monday. "Regular monitoring of the wild fauna shows that the bonobo (ape) populations remain stable within the territory despite past pressure, and that the forest elephant population is starting to come back," the statement said. The Congolese environment ministry welcomed the move. It would be "an opportunity to rethink the management of the peatland with a view to quantifying its capacity to absorb carbon" emissions, it told AFP in a statement. Salonga is Africa's largest protected rainforest and home to 40 percent of the Earth's bonobo apes, along with several other endangered species. It was created in 1970 by then dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and had been on the endangered list since 1984. The park is also home to slender-snouted crocodiles and Congo peacocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/unesco-removes-dr-congo-park-from-endangered-list/articleshow/84569696.cms||---
---||India||Manipur frees activist after SC gives it 6 hours to comply||NEW DELHI: In another order that protects liberties, the Supreme Court on Monday gave the Manipur government six hours to release activist Leichombam Erendro, detained since May 13 for a social media post on the inefficacy of cow dung and urine against coronavirus after state BJP president Prof Tikendra Singh succumbed to Covid. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah granted bail to Erendro on furnishing a personal bail bond of Rs 1,000 without any sureties and ordered the BJP-governed state government to ensure his release before 5pm. On the request of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for Manipur, the bench adjourned the hearing of Erendro's father L Raghumani's Singh's petition to Tuesday. However, it said the detained person cannot be kept under detention for a day more, even though the petition would be heard on Tuesday. Forty-year-old Erendro was arrested on May 13 for his Facebook post over state BJP chief S Tikendra Singh’s death due to Covid. He had posted: "The cure for Corona is not cow dung & cow urine. The cure is science & common sense. Professor ji RIP." The jibe was at certain functionaries of the party underscoring the medicinal properties of cow dung and urine. Times ViewThere is good reason why the SC has ordered the release of the activist. The activist’s arrest for such an innocuous tweet was a clear case of police arbitrariness. But unless those engaged in carrying out such acts in the garb of law enforcement face consequences, such incidents will continue to happen. The wrongful and shameful arrest also underlines the fact that apart from the sedition law, some other Acts also need a relook."In the meantime, having prima facie considered the contents of the petition, we are of the view that the continued detention of the petitioner would amount to a violation of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. We accordingly direct that the petitioner shall be released forthwith as and by way of an interim direction of this Court, unless he is required to be in custody in any other case, subject to further orders, subject to his filing a personal release bond in the amount of Rs 1,000," the bench said after hearing petitioner's counsel Shadan Farasat. To ensure compliance of its order on releasing Erendro without loss of time, the bench directed SC's Registrar (Judicial) to communicate its order to Sajiwa Central Jail authorities in Imphal. In addition, it asked the state standing counsel Pukhrambam Ramesh Kumar to also communicate the SC's interim bail order to the jail authorities. Erendro was arrested after state BJP vice-president Usham Deben Singh filed a complaint alleging that the post had "deliberately and wilfully insulted and outraged religious feelings and sentiments" of BJP workers and family members of the deceased. Four days later, an Imphal court granted bail to Erendro but even before he could walk out of jail, the Imphal West district magistrate issued an order invoking NSA against Erendro with a specious logic that "his activities were prejudicial to the security of the state and to the maintenance of public order". The SC prima facie found that Erendro's continued detention was prejudicial to the right to life and liberty and that it should not be continued even for a day more. Erendro's father in his petition had said that the authorities misdirected themselves to misuse the provisions of the stringent preventive detention law NSA just to silence his son's constitutionally guaranteed right to free speech and expression of views on public issues. He said Erendro's Facebook post was a "criticism of the unscientific position taken and misinformation being spread by several BJP politicians regarding cow urine and cow dung being effective in preventing/treating Covid-19".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manipur-frees-activist-after-sc-gives-it-6-hours-to-comply/articleshow/84569804.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

It was the first high-level contact made public by the new Israeli government, which was sworn in last month, unseating the country's longest-serving leader, Benjamin Netanyahu.The ruling coalition is made up of left-wing, centrist, right-wing and Arab parties with little in common on the diplomatic front. Officials have said they would focus on domestic reforms and largely avoid sweeping moves on hot-button international issues such as policy toward the Palestinians.Gantz said he shared with Abbas good wishes for Eid al-Adha holiday on Tuesday, one of the two most important festivals of the Islamic calendar."The discussion was positive and the two cited the need to advance trust-building steps between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which will benefit the economy and security of the entire region," Gantz's office said in a statement.Abbas' office confirmed the call but did not give details.Israel's new president, whose role is largely ceremonial, said he spoke last week with Abbas, who congratulated him on the new role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israels-defense-minister-palestinian-president-discuss-trust-building/articleshow/84569742.cms||---
---||World||Size of Oregon wildfire underscores vastness of the US West||PORTLAND: The monstrous wildfire burning in Oregon has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island and spreads miles each day, but evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California.  The fire's jaw-dropping size contrasted with its relatively small impact on people underscores the vastness of the American West and offers a reminder that Oregon, which is larger than Britain, is still a largely rural state, despite being known mostly for its largest city, Portland.  The 476-square-mile (1,210-square-kilometer) Bootleg Fire is burning 300 miles (483 kilometers) southeast of Portland in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges.  If the fire were in densely populated parts of California, "it would have destroyed thousands of homes by now," said James Johnston, a researcher with Oregon State University's College of Forestry who studies historical wildfires. "But it is burning in one of the more remote areas of the lower 48 states. It's not the Bay Area out there."  At least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died.  Pushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that's increasingly remote.  Evacuation orders on the fire's southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it's small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek - both with fewer than 250 people - and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs.  "The Bootleg Fire is threatening ranch houses that are in pretty far-flung areas," Johnston said. "There are no suburbs in that area."  But as big as the Bootleg Fire is, it's not the biggest Oregon has seen. The fire's current size puts it fourth on the list of the state's largest blazes in modern times, including rangeland fires, and second on the list of infernos specifically burning in forest.  These megafires usually burn until the late fall or even early winter, when rain finally puts them out.  The largest forest fire in modern history was the Biscuit Fire, which torched nearly 780 square miles (2,000 square kilometers) in 2002 in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California. The largest fire of any type was the Long Draw Fire in 2012, which incinerated 872 square miles (2,260 square kilometers) of mostly sagebrush and rangeland in the endless expanses of southeastern Oregon, where almost no one lives.  By the time the Bootleg Fire is extinguished months from now, it will likely be as big or bigger than those fires, but research shows that Oregon once experienced megafires much larger than these fairly often, Johnston said.  "I think it's important for us to take the long view of wildfire. In the context of the last couple hundreds years, the Bootleg Fire is not large," he said. "One of the things my lab group does is reconstruct historical fires, and fires that were burning in that area in the 1600s and 1700s were just as big as the Bootleg Fire or bigger."  That's little reassurance for fire crews battling the current blaze, which is 25% contained.  On Monday, flames forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station as firefighters had to retreat from the flames for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Sycan Marsh hosts thousands of migrating and nesting birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration in the upper reaches of the Klamath Basin.  Fire pushed by winds and fueled by bone-dry conditions jumped fire-retardant containment lines and pushed up to 4 miles into new territory, authorities said.  Fire crews were also rushing to corral multiple "slop fires" - patches of flames that escaped fire lines meant to contain the blaze - before they grew in size. One of those smaller fires was already nearly 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) in size. Thunderstorms with dry lightning were possible Monday as well, heightening the dangers.  "We are running firefighting operations through the day and all through the night," said Joe Hessel, incident commander. "This fire is a real challenge, and we are looking at sustained battle for the foreseeable future."  The Bootleg Fire was one of many fires burning in a dozen states, most of them in the U.S. West. Sixteen large uncontained fires burned in Oregon and Washington state alone on Monday, affecting a total of 767 square miles (1,986 square kilometers), the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center said.  Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.  At the other end of Oregon, a fire in the northeast mountains grew to nearly 26 square miles (49 square kilometers).  The Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, rural communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. It was 10% contained.  Natural features of the area act like a funnel for wind, feeding the flames and making them unpredictable, officials said.  A complex of fires where the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho meet also grew, reaching 167 square miles (433 square kilometers). The Snake River Complex was 44% contained. The complex was made up of three fires started by lightning on July 7. Flames were chewing through a mix of grass and timber in an extremely remote area of steep terrain about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Lewiston, Idaho.  Thunderstorms expected to roll through Monday night could bring winds to fan the flames and lightning that could spark new ones, the National Weather Service said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/size-of-oregon-wildfire-underscores-vastness-of-the-us-west/articleshow/84570066.cms||---
---||India||‘Attempt to defame India’: Government pushes back as fresh allegations of snooping emerge||NEW DELHI: A political row broke out over the Pegasus spyware case on Monday with home minister Amit Shah responding to Congress's demand that he step down by saying reports of alleged surveillance were part of a choreographed attempt to defame India. “Today the monsoon session of Parliament has started. In what seemed like a perfect cue, late last evening we saw a report which has been amplified by a few sections with only one aim - to do whatever is possible and humiliate India at the world stage, peddle the same old narratives about our nation and derail India’s development trajectory,” the home minister said. Shah said the development agenda would not be derailed. “Key bills for the welfare of farmers, youngsters, women and backward sections of society are lined up for debate and discussion," he said. The controversy was further fanned by a second tranche of claims that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa, recently-appointed railways, communications and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and junior Jal Shakti minister Prahlad Patel, along with poll strategist Prashant Kishor and Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee were allegedly targeted for surveillance by Pegasus spyware. With Congress and other parties protesting in Parliament, the main opposition said Shah must step down and Prime Minister Narendra Modi be investigated over news reports of alleged illegal hacking of cell phones of several Indian politicians, journalists and constitutional functionaries. Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge asked if Shah should hold his office given the relevations and Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the minister was "responsible" for use of the spyware. In Lok Sabha, Vaishnaw made a statement saying similar claims were made in the past regarding Pegasus on WhatsApp which had no factual basis and were categorically denied by all parties, including in the Supreme Court. The curreny reports, he said, are an attempt to malign the Indian democracy and its well established institutions. He said the procedures for interception of phones are well set out and covered by laws that guard against misuse. He also said the reports admitted that surveillance cannot be established. In an interview with ANI, Isreali firm NSO, makers of Pegasus, said it has no central list of persons surveyed through its software. It said such information was with its clients and it has no master data. It said the list in circulation could be random and that services used to track ownership and location of a phone number might have been used to find out users. .It questioned the claims of forensic examinations and said its technology has firewalls to protect against human rights abuse and the spyware helps save lives by tracking terrorists. Congress alleged that the Modi government was behind the use of the spyware for illegal surveillance of individuals. It asked how a foreign company could have got access to thousands of phone numbers. Shah and later former IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad rebutted the allegations saying there was no evidence of any illegal tapping. "To whose tune are these people dancing, who wants to keep showing India in poor light? What pleasure do they get to time and again show India in bad light?” asked Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/attempt-to-defame-india-government-pushes-back-as-fresh-allegations-of-snooping-emerge/articleshow/84570013.cms||---
---||World||'Worried about what's to come': Fears of Covid resurgence in US as Delta variant spreads rapidly||NEW DELHI: New covid cases in the United States are rising rapidly as the highly contagious Delta variant — first identified in India — is growing more dominant. Nationwide, new US Covid-19 cases surged 69% last week compared with the prior seven days to an average of over 31,000 new infections a day. Deaths have also risen significantly with 26% week-over-week increase to an average of 250 lives lost a day, mostly in unvaccinated patients.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); 'Worried about what lies ahead'With infections now increasing in almost every state, US surgeon general Vivek Murthy said on Sunday that he's concerned about what lies ahead. Noting that nearly all coronavirus deaths now are among the tens of millions of people who haven't received shots, despite widespread vaccine availability, Dr. Vivek Murthy painted an unsettling picture of what the future could hold. "I am worried about what is to come because we are seeing increasing cases among the unvaccinated in particular. And while, if you are vaccinated, you are very well protected against hospitalization and death, unfortunately that is not true if you are not vaccinated," Murthy said on CNN's State of the Union.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); 'Please get vaccinated'The resurgence in Delta-fueled infections has prompted the US government to double down on its vaccination push. Millions of Americans are yet to receive the first shot of the anti-Covid jab. In his recent speech, President Joe Biden said the US economic recovery hinges on getting the pandemic under control. He said four states with low vaccination rates accounted for 40% of all cases last week. "So please, please get vaccinated," Biden said. "Get vaccinated now." The vaccines work against the Delta variant, but lab tests have shown them to be less effective than they were against the original form of coronavirus. Studies have also shown that two shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and of the AstraZeneca vaccine are much more effective than one shot against being infected with the virus, making it more important for people to be fully vaccinated.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); So far, the Delta variant has been detected around 100 countries globally and is now the dominant variant worldwide, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci told reporters last week. To mask, or not to mask?Amid the surge, the US CDC has been criticised, including by Murthy’s predecessor Jerome Adams, for making a decision prematurely that ended up discouraging mask wearing more broadly. Murthy said the decision, in May, was meant to provide more “flexibility” for vaccinated people and local governments to set Covid-19 guidelines specific to their area In California, Los Angeles County reimposed a mask mandate over the weekend. It followed six straight days of more than 1,000 new Covid-19 cases in the county, with nearly 400 people hospitalized with Covid-19 as of Wednesday, up 275 from the week before. There have been calls for New York City to follow the lead of Los Angeles County but it insisted that vaccinations are a better strategy for the nation's most populous city. "Masks have value, unquestionably, but masks are not going at the root of the problem. Vaccination is," the mayor said during an livestreamed press briefing. "So we do not intend a mask mandate. We do intend to double down on vaccination," New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. Overseas, Covid-19 restrictions are being reimposed in countries experiencing worrying spikes. The Netherlands announced it was reimposing work-from-home guidelines due to soaring Covid-19 infections, just weeks after lifting them, as well as some restrictions on bars, restaurants and nightclubs. Britain ended over a year of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions on Monday but the so-called "Freedom Day" was marred by surging infections and grim forecasts. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday issued a more severe warning against travel to the United Kingdom, elevating the nation to "Level Four: Covid-19 Very High," the CDC's highest level.

---||World||Blinken meets Belarus opposition leader as criticism mounts||WASHINGTON: Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Belarus' main opposition leader as the United States steps up criticism of the government in Minsk for a widening crackdown on dissent following disputed elections last year.  Blinken met with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya at the State Department on Monday to show support for her and other protesters demanding an end to repression. Tsikhanouskaya was President Alexander Lukashenko's main challenger in the August 2020 election and was forced to leave the country after the polls that the opposition and the West saw as rigged. "They discussed the ongoing repression, the crackdown by the Lukashenko regime and the steps that we have said, and much of the international community has said, that the Lukashenko regime must take," State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters. "As you know, Ms Tsikhanouskaya has been at the forefront of the opposition movement in Belarus, and we were happy to welcome her to the department today and to continue our efforts to stand with the Belarusian people and their aspirations for human rights, democracy, and their broader Euro-Atlantic aspirations," he said. Tsikhanouskaya is in Washington this week meeting with Biden administration officials and lawmakers to seek their backing. Monday's meeting came after authorities in Belarus widened the crackdown last week by raiding the homes and offices of dozens of independent media outlets and civic leaders, prompting condemnations by the United States and European nations. The country's main security agency, which still goes under its Soviet-era name KGB, said those targeted were suspected of involvement in "extremist activities". "The ongoing crackdown on journalists and civil society is the Lukashenka regime's latest brutality," Price said on Friday. "We call on the Belarusian authorities to release their 550-plus political prisoners and engage in a dialogue with the opposition and civil society. We stand with the people of Belarus." Lukashenko, the longtime authoritarian leader of Belarus, has promised to "deal with" organisations that he accuses of fomenting unrest in the aftermath of the election and months of protests against his rule. Lukashenko was proclaimed the victor, cementing a sixth term in office, despite widespread complaints that the vote was neither free nor fair. Authorities responded to the demonstrations with a massive crackdown, including police beating thousands of demonstrators and arresting more than 35,000 people. Overall, 32 Belarusian journalists are in custody, either serving their sentences or awaiting trial, according to the Belarusian Association of Journalists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/blinken-meets-belarus-opposition-leader-as-criticism-mounts/articleshow/84570101.cms||---
---||India||Hospitals have become a big industry, laments Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Made aware of the hefty hospital bills footed by Covid patients during the second wave that pushed health infrastructure to the brink, the Supreme Court on Monday said hospitals have become a big industry instead of discharging their responsibilities to provide succour to distressed patients. This remark came from a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah, which was taking stock of the implementation of its December 18 last year order directing appointment of nodal officers for each Covid hospital and a district committee for carrying out fire safety audit of all Covid care hospitals. The last year’s order was given in the wake of two back-to-back fire incidents in Gujarat and then one in Maharashtra in which several patients and healthcare workers were burnt alive. Setting the tone for close scrutiny of hospitals, senior advocate Dushyant Dave narrated the frustrating yet enraging experience of the family and relative of his brother who was afflicted with Covid. “The hospital which treated him raised a bill of Rs 17 lakh and yet they could not save him. There should be some cap on the fees charged by the hospitals and the patients must be saved from being fleeced. Many had borrowed money for treatment of their relatives. They are almost bankrupt. There must be some cap on the hospital fees.” The bench said, “Hospitals have become a large industry. Do we look at the hospitals like the real estate industry or a sector which provides succour to patients in distress.” The bench was told by Dave that the Commission headed by Justice (rtd) D A Mehta has submitted a report but complained that it was of no worth as it prohibited the victims of hospital fire from participating in the process meaningfully. Appearing for Gujarat, senior advocate Maninder Singh said the state would file the commission report in sealed cover before the court, as the report is required to be tabled in the assembly. He also said that the state would file an action taken report specifying the level of compliance of the recommendations made by the commission. However, the bench took exception to the Gujarat government’s July 8 notification exempting till June 2022 the compliance of building bye-law regulations by Covid hospitals, which are operating from a portion of non-compliant structures. “If the notification is in breach of our order, see to it that it is withdrawn before action is taken by the SC. If we find that the government breached our December 18 order, we will take it to task,” it warned the Gujarat government. The SC said, “Once there is a mandamus by the SC, it cannot be overruled or nullified by an Executive notification. When you (Gujarat) say that no action for building bye-law infringements would be taken till June 30 next year, do you want more people to die from similar incidents?” Solicitor general Tushar Mehta clarified that the Covid care hospitals have been made fire safety compliant as per the apex court’s order but to close down a hospital for non-correction of minor building bye-law violations during the pandemic would mean losing 30,000 beds meant to treat Covid patients. While Justice Shah turned the heat on the Gujarat government, Justice Chandrachud flagged the fire incident at Nashik’s Zakir Hussain hospital in which 13 Covid patients and healthcare workers were charred to death. Justice Chandrachud said the states should open large stadiums for Covid treatment as was done by Mumbai Municipal Corporation. “An impression should not go to the public that just because of the pandemic, the illegalities are being overlooked and patient-safety is given a backseat,” he said. The bench gave Gujarat two weeks to file the Commission report, the action taken report as well as the logic behind the issuance of the July 8 notification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hospitals-have-become-a-big-industry-laments-supreme-court/articleshow/84570176.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

By May 2021, one in every two cases was in the rural areas, while states like Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan had 75% of their cases in rural areas, the report states. The “Inequality Report 2021- India’s Unequal Healthcare Story” goes on to state that “India’s particularly disastrous Covid-19 second wave-exposed the weakness of the public healthcare system.” Making a strong case for investment in health infrastructure, the report highlights that “state governments with higher expenditure on health had lower confirmed cases of Covid-19. States such as Odisha and Goa, with higher expenditure on health also had higher recovery rate from Covid.” Besides drawing upon various available national data sources and reports, Oxfam shares find of a survey their teams carried out towards the end of 2020. They covered 768 respondents from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala, Bihar and Odisha who were either suffering from Covid-19 or had recovered from it. The survey found that the percentage of respondents in low-income brackets facing discrimination in the community for being Covid positive was five times more than those in the high-income bracket. Also over 50% of SCs and STs among those surveyed faced difficulties in accessing non-Covid medical facilities compared to 18.2% in the general category. The percentage of SCs using an unsafe source of water was three times that of the general category for open wells, and four times for open springs or streams. Among female respondents, 33.9% experienced anxiety, irritation and anger, and sleep deprivation during the lockdown as compared to 18.2% males. The report also highlights that “the second wave is characterised by infrastructure lapse, overcharging at hospitals, black marketing of medicines, and a vaccination drive that is not inclusive. In cities, the virus is affecting the middle and upper-middle class more. On the other hand, the second wave has been harder for the rural populace as compared to the first.” “In the midst of it all, while India’s vaccination drive attempted to tackle the second wave by inoculating its population, its execution was marred due to shortage of vaccine and the operations moving on to mobile applications making it accessible only to those who had internet or a smartphone,” it is stated. The authors of the report point that it was only in June 2021 that the Centre revisited its vaccine policy. “While government-run centres are only now opening walk-in registrations, the vaccine strategy needs to be critically viewed from a gender lens to ensure that the digital divide and lack of information do not hinder the access of vaccines for women and other marginalised groups,” it is reiterated. The report goes on to point that in the 2021-22 union budget, a year following a pandemic, the health ministry was allocated a total of INR 76,901 crore, a decline of 9.8% from Rs 85,250 crore from the revised estimates of 2020-21. Amitabh Behar, CEO, Oxfam India said, “Persistent underfunding of the public health system especially primary health care and inadequate health infrastructure in India remain to be addressed by the government even after the devastating second wave. Otherwise, health emergencies will only aggravate existing inequalities and work as a detriment for the poor and the marginalised. Declaring health as a constitutional right can help to bridge these gaps.” Anjela Taneja, Inequality, Health and Education lead, Oxfam India added that “the current health status of the country is a testament to the unfulfilled dream of ‘Health for All’. The right to the highest attainable health is far from being realised. Even after one year into the pandemic and facing two Covid-19 waves, the government of India has repeated its failure to allocate 2.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for health.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxfam-report-second-wave-hit-rural-india-harder-states-with-higher-health-expenditure-reported-fewer-cases-and-higher-recovery/articleshow/84570225.cms||Ambika Pandit

The 57-year-old cricketer-turned-politician, who had a busy day calling on leaders and ministers, thanked the Congress leadership for appointing him head of the Punjab unit and asserted that he would strengthen the party’s organisation in the state. Assembly polls in Punjab are due next year. Read AlsoWhat worked for Captain Amarinder Singh in 2015 buoys Navjot Singh Sidhu nowThe factor which worked for Captain Amarinder Singh in 2015 — when he could get support of several MLAs to build pressure on the party high command to get Partap Singh Bajwa replaced as the Punjab PCC president — is now working for Navjot Singh Sidhu.“Today, to work further for the same dream and strengthen the invincible fort of Congress in Punjab. I am grateful to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi for bestowing their faith in me and giving me this pivotal responsibility,” he tweeted. Sidhu arrived in Chandigarh on Monday and met several party leaders, including former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhathal, ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Charanjit Singh, Razia Sultana and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. Sidhu, who replaced Sunil Jakhar as Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief, was elevated to the position despite Amarinder Singh’s strong reservations. In Amritsar, several Congress workers and supporters beat drums and broke out in celebratory dance to celebrate the former cricketer taking charge of the state unit. The chief minister’s media advisor, meanwhile, rejected reports of Singh calling a meeting of MLAs and MPs on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/journey-has-just-begun-sidhu-on-meeting-spree-with-netas/articleshow/84570271.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||What worked for Captain Amarinder Singh in 2015 buoys Navjot Singh Sidhu now||JALANDHAR: The factor which worked for Captain Amarinder Singh in 2015 — when he could get support of several MLAs to build pressure on the party high command to get Partap Singh Bajwa replaced as the Punjab PCC president — is now working for Navjot Singh Sidhu.  It is the perception among MLAs and prospective candidates that Sidhu could help them win their seats in the 2022 assembly elections that has made them welcome his appointment as PCC president despite Amarinder’s serious objections and unhappiness. In 2015, they believed that Amarinder, not Bajwa, could lead them to victory. Amarinder enjoyed such support from party MLAs and other senior leaders that Bajwa was isolated and the high command was forced to replace him. However, the CM is now facing anti-incumbency and several questions about his government’s work. The same set of MLAs and a few ministers, especially the Majha brigade of three ministers — Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria — who were in the forefront to organise support for him in 2015, have now sided with Sidhu for the same reason. Unlike Amarinder, who rallied the MLAs behind himself in 2015 and started holding public functions under ‘Mission Punjab -2017’, Sidhu appeared to be plodding alone. He remained inaccessible to most of the party leaders but stood his ground in questioning the CM through his tweets.  It was Amarinder’s direct attack on Sidhu, challenging him to contest from Patiala, that made the ex-cricketer emerge as the main challenger. This was the beginning of Sidhu’s strengthening his fight within the party. It was after Jalandhar Cantt MLA Pargat Singh, who too had picked up the gauntlet against the CM, reached out to Sidhu that the latter met a few ministers and MLAs in Chandigarh. As the party crisis precipitated in Punjab, the Congress high command was forced to intervene, and the balance started tilting. However, most MLAs still did not side with Sidhu even if they did not support Amarinder in their feedback to Congress president Sonia Gandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/what-worked-for-captain-amarinder-singh-in-2015-buoys-sidhu-now/articleshow/84570320.cms||IP Singh

Underscoring job creation as the TMC government’s top priority, Chatterjee also said incentives to companies will depend on ability to generate employment. He said the Mamata Banerjee dispensation wants two large manufacturing units to be set up by any prominent industrial house at the earliest. “We never had any enmity with the Tatas, neither we fought against them. They are one of the most respected and biggest business houses of this country and also abroad. You can’t blame the Tatas (for the Singur fiasco). The problem was with the Left Front government and its forcible land acquisition policy. Tata group is always most welcome to come and invest in Bengal,” Chatterjee said. Chatterjee also added that the salt to steel business conglomerate has shown interest in setting up another Tata centre in Kolkata to house its offices. “We already have the presence of Tata Metaliks, one Tata centre besides the TCS here. But if they are willing to come up with big-ticket investments in manufacturing or other sectors, there is no problem,” he said. When asked whether the state government will go the extra mile to reach out to the Tatas, Chatterjee said he is already in touch with group officials to attract investment. Singur, once known for multiple crop farming, hogged media limelight after Tata Motors set its sight on the land to build its cheapest car Nano in 2006. The Left Front government acquired 997 acres along the National Highway 2 and handed it over to the company. Mamata Banerjee, then in the opposition, called a hunger strike demanding the return of 347 acres of farmland that was “forcibly” acquired. Despite several rounds of meetings between the TMC and the Left Front government, the issue could not be resolved and the Tatas eventually moved out of Singur to Sanand in Gujarat in 2008.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/13-years-after-singur-saga-tmc-government-welcomes-tatas/articleshow/84570342.cms||---

He said that the regulator’s probe focused on compliance of the companies with its regulations but did not disclose the names of the companies that are under the scanner. The DRI was “investigating certain entities belonging to the Adani Group… under laws administered by it,” Parliament was informed. Responding to questions from TMC’s Mahua Moitra, the minister said the government could not disclose information related to income tax but ruled out any probe by the Enforcement Directorate. On Monday, shares of Adani group companies — Adani Total Gas, Adani Power, Adani Transmission, Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, Adani Green Energy and Adani Enterprises — took a beating, closing between 1% and 4.8% lower. Chaudhary said that in 2016, Sebi had frozen the accounts of three of the six Mauritius-based investors, which are seen to have invested most of their money in stocks of Adani Group companies. Read AlsoNo communication from Sebi yet, DRI matter in tribunal: Adani groupThe Adani group on Monday said it had not received any communication from markets regulator Sebi about its investigations relating to investments by foreign investors in group companies.The regulatory action was due to their dealings in Global Depository Receipt (GDR) by some other companies but there was no bar on them for holding shares of other companies. On June 14, stock prices of all the six Adani group companies had nosedived, some by as much as 25% in intra-day trades, after it was found that three Mauritius-based foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) — Albula Investments, APMS Investment and Cresta Fund — were barred by Sebi. Later, the group led by Gautam Adani, the second richest Indian, clarified, citing a communication from NSDL, the depository, that these entities were barred from investing in GDR, for regulatory violations in 2016, but were free to invest in stocks of Indian companies directly. Following the mid-June incident, Moitra had also taken to Twitter to raise the issue of investigations by regulators and investigating agencies about holdings by these FPIs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-dri-probing-adani-group-companies-government-tells-lok-sabha/articleshow/84570362.cms||---

The overall increase, averaging nearly 50% in the wake of high-priced imports and supply disruptions from China, have raised doubts on the availability of drugs and could lead to shortages, particularly of those that are key in Covid therapy. API prices of certain drugs like fever and pain relief drug paracetamol and life-saving antibiotic Meropenem (also used for Covid), and anti-diabetic metformin, have more than doubled to as high as 139%, 127% and 124% respectively, putting the spotlight back on India’s near total-dependence on the Dragon. Nearly 70% of the country’s APIs are imported from China, while the dependence is as high as 90% for certain life-saving antibiotics like cephalosporins, azithromycin and penicillin. Since these medicines are under price control, companies are forced to absorb the higher cost, raising questions about their viability in future. In this scenario, over a period of time, certain medicines could disappear from retail shelves with companies switching to high-value products where margins are protected. In the wake of limited availability, patients may have to bear the brunt and be forced to shift to newer, steeply priced alternatives, industry experts say. Dependence on China for key APIs has been an ongoing concern for the industry, affecting crucial raw materials for manufacturing cardio-vascular, diabetes, antibiotics, anti-allergics and vitamins. But since Covid, the price increase has been sharp. “API prices for some of our products have seen a sharp increase during the year,” a GSK Pharma executive told TOI. The executive added, “Since we have long-term contracts for paracetamol tablets, the percentage increase has been 75%, and for paracetamol suspension 115% (approximately) over the last year.” Adding to the industry’s woes, packaging and freight costs have also jumped manifold. “Industry has been facing a huge cost escalation due to imported raw materials and excipients — in some drugs as steep as 200%. There have also been massive increases in freight rates, transportation and packaging costs,” Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association ED Ashok Madan said. Reeling from this, the industry in March sought a one-time price revision of 20% in ceiling prices across the board, while recently it asked for specific molecules. It has also said that implementation of a revised National List of Essential Medicines be deferred till December to prevent rude shocks, if any. Scheduled drugs are allowed an annual price increase by the drug pricing regulator, in line with the annual Wholesale Price Index. Non-scheduled drugs — prices of which are not controlled — are allowed an annual increase of 10% under the Drug Price Control Order, 2013. Recently, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority allowed a one-time 50% increase in prices in three key drugs — anti-epileptic carbamazepine, antacid ranitidine, and analgesic ibuprofen. Last year, blood thinner Heparin, widely used in Covid therapy, was allowed a similar increase.Significant disruptions caused by the pandemic spurred India’s decision last year to delink from China. With the objective of becoming Atma Nirbhar, the government announced a Rs 6,940-crore scheme for promoting indigenous production. “The government has said that they will help API companies with faster clearances under environmental laws by placing them in a more liberal category. That should help with improving manufacturing and reducing costs in the short term,” PwC India partner & pharma leader Sujay Shetty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/costs-of-raw-material-for-drugs-rise-by-up-to-140/articleshow/84569034.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

A report by SBI’s economic research department said that around 4,000 listed entities reported a 5% decline in the top line, but their ebitda (earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortisation) rose 24% while their profit after tax jumped by 105%. “Most importantly, 15 sectors have now reduced loan funds by around Rs 2.1 lakh crore during pandemic year FY21. Sectors such as refineries, steel, fertilisers, textiles, mining, etc, have reduced their loan funds in the range of 6% to 64% in FY21,” the report said. According to the report, the reduction in the effective tax rate (ETR) in FY20, coupled with a prolonged period of a low-interest rate regime fuelled by the coronavirus seems to have been a blessing in disguise for India Inc during the pandemic year. Last year, the government reduced the ETR for companies to 26% from 35% in FY20. However, the actual tax paid increased by more than Rs 50,000 crore. Many sectors including engineering, realty, automobiles and trading had reported an ETR reduction in the range of 1-24% in FY21 as compared to FY20. Despite this, tax collections in FY22 were at record highs. Sectors like cement, tyres and consumer durables showed significant contribution of even over 50%, the report said. An extended period of low interest rate has also helped companies in massive deleveraging and contributed on an average 5% to the overall top line. Sectors like consumer durables, healthcare and cement have benefited the most. In terms of expenditure reduction, the overall contribution on top line has been as much as 31%. Sectors like apparel and refineries have cut costs by as much as 107% on average. While financing costs came down, the increase in commodity prices pushed up expenditure in sectors like metals and agrochemicals. Employee costs on average have been cut by 3% in FY21. The maximum cut in employee costs has been in sectors facing the consumers. According to SBI, the improved tax collections will widen the gap between gross domestic product and gross value added as GDP growth would be buoyed by the improved tax collection. The report said that an extended period of accommodative policy, as hinted by the RBI, augurs well for better corporate results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tax-rate-cuts-double-india-incs-profit-despite-5-revenue-drop/articleshow/84569071.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan Covid death rate this month at 3% compared to 1% since start||JAIPUR: Mortality rate due to Covid in July has been as high as 3% compared to less than 1% across the state so far. Out of 971 fresh infections in July so far, 30 lives have been lost taking the mortality to 3%. In the last 24 hours, one person died and 33 others tested positive for Covid-19 taking the fatality count to 8,951 and overall tally to 9,53,393. The highest number of deaths reported in July (till 19th) were reported from Udaipur, where13 persons have died in July. However, no Covid-19 death has been reported from Jaipur. In 19 days, Jaipur has not reported any Covid-19 death and its toll stands at 1,970. The last death Jaipur reported was on June 30. In past the nine days, the state has reported only six Covid-19 deaths. The situation in the state seems to be under control. However, some regions are witnessing a high-test positivity rate (TPR) particularly in the north-eastern parts of the country and several districts in the southern states. However, health experts believe that Covid wave diminishes after it successfully infects a large proportion of the population and strikes back when the immunity developed in the people post-natural infection fades. Health department officials appealed to the people to continue following Covid appropriate behavior to ward off risk of getting infected and to keep the third wave at bay. Health experts believe that the cases may go up if a new, more infectious variant comes. In other words, next wave will be driven by a virus variant to which significant proportion of population is susceptible. In the state, districts which reported new cases are Jaipur (10), Ajmer (7), Bikaner (3),Udaipur (3), Sriganganagar (2), Jaisalmer (2), Jodhpur (2), Tonk (2), Hanumangarh (1) and Barmer (1). Sriganganagar reported its 149th Covid-19 death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mortality-rate-for-covid-19-in-july-is-3/articleshow/84567003.cms||---
---||Patna||Follow Covid protocols to avoid third wave: Experts||PATNA: With things becoming normal after the deadly second wave of Covid-19 in the state, a common question being asked is whether the third wave can be avoided altogether. Most of the health experts agree that the impact of the third wave can be minimised if the people as well as the government become vigilant and responsive. Taking lessons from the second wave, sincere efforts should be made by one and all to prevent the onset of any new wave in the state, which has already suffered a lot, they feel. Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC)’s joint director Dr A K Ashu said fortunately the Delta variants are yet to affect the state’s people. So, the chances of the third wave hitting the state are bleak provided the Covid protocols are followed properly and people are vaccinated. He said the greater the transmission of the virus, the more the chances of developing new, deadlier variants. The government should focus more on those pockets where people are still getting infected with the virus, he said. Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s dean of medicine and former PMCH superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said the third wave could be prevented by compelling the people to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour. Anybody found flouting the norms should be heavily penalised. The present speed of vaccination should also be accelerated considerably. For this, the government would have to make sufficient doses of vaccines available at all the places. If need be, door-to-door vaccination programmes should be launched in both urban and rural areas to get the maximum number of people inoculated in the shortest possible time. Besides, voluntary social organisations should come forward to remove certain misconceptions about vaccinations among rural folks, he added. Principal of Government Ayurvedic College Patna, Dr Dineshwar Prasad, said the third wave can be avoided if the people are made to follow the Covid protocols essentially. Besides, people should increase their physical activities by doing yoga or playing indoor games to develop their immunity. They should adopt a healthy lifestyle by focusing on their diets and taking some indigenous immunity boosters, he added. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said if the people observe Covid-appropriate behaviour and get themselves inoculated, the chances of the third wave hitting the state would certainly diminish. According to a serological survey conducted in different metropolitan cities in the country, it has been found that sero-positivity has already developed in at least 50% of children. If the adults adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour and get inoculated, there is very little chance of the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/follow-covid-protocols-to-avoid-third-wave-experts/articleshow/84561584.cms||B K Mishra

The public sector lender has made 100% provisions with respect to the loans and advances classified as fraud. The bank saw its net profits for the quarter at Rs 1,182 crore, up 220% from the profit of Rs 369 crore earned in the corresponding quarter last year. However, its net profit has declined by 31% on a sequential basis. Provisions and contingencies for Q1FY22 were at Rs 2,615 crore (of which provisions of Rs 1,747 crore made for NPAs) as against Rs 2,139 crore (Rs 1,830 crore for NPAs) for the corresponding quarter of previous year. About Rs 840 crore were set aside as provisions in the previous quarter. Among various accounts, MSMEs are the most vulnerable currently, said MD & CEO Padmaja Chunduru. The bank’s asset quality has improved, where gross NPA (bad loans) lowered to 9.69% in June, 2021, as against 10.9% in June, 2020. And net NPA ratio declined to 3.47% from 3.76% in the same period. The bank’s net interest income (NII) saw a marginal growth of 3% YoY to Rs 3,994 crore. Other income (non-interest income) for Q1FY22 was up 41% YoY at Rs 1,877 crore, as against Rs 1,327 crore in Q1FY21 on account of higher recovery in bad debts and rise in forex income. “Post amalgamation (with Allahabad Bank) the synergy benefits are coming in terms of cost efficiencies resulting in cost to income ratio of 40.86% as against 47.06% in the previous year,” she added. Shares of Indian Bank ended up 0.8% at Rs 139.25 apiece on BSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indian-bank-classifies-12-a/cs-as-fraud-in-apr-jun-quarter/articleshow/84564903.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Bihar: Train services resume on Darbhanga-Samastipur route||PATNA: Normal traffic was restored between Muktapur and Samastipur on Darbhanga-Samastipur route under the jurisdiction of East Central Railway (ECR) on Monday. Rail traffic on this route was suspended for about a fortnight due to floodwaters flowing above the danger mark at the rail bridge number 1 between Muktapur and Samastipur. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the decision was taken after receding of floodwaters. Samastipur divisional railway manager Ashok Maheshwari inspected the Samastipur-Darbhanga-Jayanagar route on Sunday, he said. “The engineering and safety staff of the Samastipur division approved fitness of the tracks around 8.15am on Monday to restore normal traffic between Darbhanga and Samastipur,” the CPRO said, adding that at least 12 pairs of special passenger trains would now run again on the route. Among the restored special passenger trains were Jayanagar-Barauni special passenger (05554), Samastipur-Darbhanga special (05589/05590), Amritsar-Jayanagar special (04674), Lokmanya Tilak Mumbai-Jayanagar special (01061/01062), Amritsar-Jayanagar special (04652/04649/04651) and Darbhanga-Secunerabad special train (07008), the CPRO said, adding that railways had withdrawn short-termination and diversion of several pairs of trains from Monday itself. Railways will, however, carry on surveillance on the rail bridge and tracks along the bridge on the Muktapur-Samastipur route . “Railways has kept sand bags, stone chips and boulders in readiness at the site to check floodwaters gushing over rail tracks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/train-services-resume-on-dbhanga-samastipur-route/articleshow/84563381.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Patna||Jagadanand meets Lalu in Delhi, Tejas may be named RJD’s national acting president||PATNA: RJD state president Jagadanand Singh met the party’s chief Lalu Prasad in Delhi on Sunday and Monday, triggering speculations about the elevation of leader of the opposition in Bihar legisltive assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav to the post of the party’s national acting president. Tejashwi, the younger son of Lalu, also reached Delhi later on Monday evening. However, Jagadanand told mediapersons on Monday that it was just a courtesy call on Lalu, besides to know about the latter’s health conditions. As to Tejashwi’s Delhi visit, Jagadanand said it could be in connection with his legal matters, or even to meet his ailing father. Lalu, who has been seriously ill for the last few years, is out on bail in the fodder scam case and has been recuperating at the residence of his daughter and Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti. “It is natural that they also discussed politics. The discussion between them was also about the coming elevation of Tejashwi to the post of the party’s working president. They also discussed the state’s fluid politics, where nothing seems to be permanent and, in fact, anything can happen,” one RJD source said on the meeting of Jagadanand and Lalu. “If Lalu ji decides to make Tejashwi the party’s working national president, he can nominate him. There is no need to convene a national council meeting for its approval,” state RJD spokesman Chitranjan Gagan said on Monday. For the last one month or so, especially after the RJD’s 25th foundation day function on July 5, a “muffled demand” had been building up within the party to make Tejashwi its working president. “In the last one week or so, the demand has become strong,” an RJD source said, disclosing at the same time that Jagadanand, in fact, has been leading the move in this regard. “The demand is so strong that it can happen anytime,” the source stressed. The reasons being adduced for the fast-pacing of the elevation of Tejashwi are five-fold. That the state’s politics has become very fluid, as the relations among the NDA partners are changing, and there has also occurred differences on policy matters, like in the case of BJP’s push for population control law. “The state’s politics is so critical that the RJD has to make its moves very cautiously, and yet it should also be ready to take the lead and advantage when it matters,” Gagan said. The other reason is Lalu’s health. The RJD rank and file had the first direct peep into it, when Lalu addressed the party’s 25th foundation day function from Delhi. “God forbid it, but if something disconcerting happens, there should not be any vacuum. Instead, there should be the chain of command to handle the crisis,” a source said. The third reason is the rise in Tejashwi’s stock and his capacity to take even the elders in the party with him by giving them the respect they deserve. In fact, in his July 5 address, Lalu had praised ‘Jagada Bhai’, and had also said: “Tejashwi has the support of the party’s elders.” The fourth reason is the mass appeal of Tejashwi among the youths and other sections of Bihar, which was reflected in the wins of the RJD and other grand alliance partners in the last assembly elections. Fifth, his political acumen to take critically important decisions in the matters of national politics has also matured, like it was with respect to the West Bengal assembly elections, when he garlanded TMC chief and CM Mamata Banerjee in advance at Calcutta, besides deciding not to field any RJD candidate there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jagadanand-meets-lalu-in-delhi-tejas-may-be-named-rjds-national-acting-president/articleshow/84561544.cms||Abhay Singh

Most of the motorists could not provide any valid explanation for driving after the night deadline. “The prosecutions were completed the help of local police and in each case, we submitted a plea to the police stations to take action against under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC that can attract a month’s imprisonment or a fine,” said DCP (traffic) Arijit Sinha. A large team, including officers from police stations, traffic guards and even Lalbazar, carried out night patrol at hotspots, like EM Bypass, Dalhousie, MG Road, DH Road, Park Street, CR Avenue and AJC Bose Road. Special nakas were held between 9pm and 11pm. Going by the rules, all outdoor activities, including movement of people and vehicles, are prohibited between 9pm and 5am except for those facing health emergency and those in the essential service sector. The total number of vehicles seized or their drivers booked for breaking Covid restrictions stood at 37,319 between May 16 and June 15. But with the government unlocking the clampdown, the number shot up to 50,559 between June 16 to June 30. In the past three days alone, that figure came to 56,741, totalling the tickets issued during the day and night. “While discipline was maintained in May, self-regulation was absent in June. It is worse in July. We are not talking of people who have to go out for work. But there are people who can’t seem to hold back their celebration plans despite fears of a third wave,” said the police. Kolkata Police has recommended suspension of licences in certain cases. “There has been a growing tendency among residents to go for long drives or chat at tea stalls over the last few weekends, especially in July. We regularly conduct drives to stop it but strengthened our exercise from this weekend to deter people from violating safety norms,” said a senior Lalbazar officer. The maximum night-norm violations were reported on Friday and Saturday. Police took action against 351 vehicles between 9pm and 10pm on Friday and in the next hour, 269 motorists were prosecuted. On Saturday, 708 motorists were prosecuted between 9pm and 11pm, 312 of them right after 9pm. In contrast, Sunday witnessed 382 violations, 349 of them flouting Sec 188 of IPC and 33 Sec 200 of CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/13k-vehicles-get-tickets-for-flouting-night-norms-over-weekend/articleshow/84564656.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||Delta strain accounts for 91% cases in Gujarat since May 1||AHMEDABAD: Over 80% of the new cases of Covid-19 in India were of Delta variant (also identified with B.1.617.2), Dr N K Arora, co-chair of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium said on Monday. The ratio is much higher in Gujarat, reveal analysis of the cases in May and June. The genomic sequencing by Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) indicates that more than 90% cases in the state were of Delta variant. According to data available on the GBRC website, out of 174 samples analysed, 158 or 91% of the samples of positive patients was found to be of Delta variant. Other variants found in the state include B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1, B.1.36.8 and B.1. The samples were from Vadodara, Chhota Udepur, Ahmedabad, Mahisagar, Gandhinagar, Anand and Mehsana, among others. “There was more heterogeneity till the start of the second wave, with some cases of Alpha and Beta variants recorded in the state. But after the second wave, the Delta variant has remained the dominant one. In June, the variant was found in more than 95% of the sequencing,” said a genome sequencing expert from Gandhinagar. “The trend would continue in July as well, with all eyes on Delta-plus and other mutations.” Due to the Delta variant, Gujarat witnessed the worst phase of the pandemic with very high daily cases and high mortality rate. What does the result mean for the state? Dr Urvesh Shah, professor & head of Department of Microbiology at GCS Hospital, said that it may become endemic due to its higher adaptability and larger spread. “It’s survival of the fittest for the viruses, too. Delta has become the dominant variant in several countries as it adapted and mutated. Faster replicability and lower virulence can increase life of a variant,” he said. "The Delta variant has somehow adapted to its hosts, and has also exhibited immune escape. Thus, in the longer run, we might not be surprised if it takes the shape of an endemic (recurring health condition) instead of pandemic,” he said. “The RNA viruses like Covid-19 depend on faster mutation for survival. Steps such as vaccination have slowed down the mutations.” Delta variant, first detected in India in October 2020, has been more transmissible and severe compared to its predecessor. Experts said that it is now present in more than 80 countries, and has caused fresh waves in countries like the US. The biggest concern for the experts is its capability of evading immunity, causing re-infection in several cases.

The project will cost approximately Rs6,975 crore. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the entire 1462km route will be covered in hardly 12 hours after increase in the speed limit. The Railway Board has sanctioned Rs408 crore in the current financial year to the ECR to carry out track renewal, signalling and earth filling work on a stretch of about 417km falling under its jurisdiction. Railways is likely to incur an expenditure of about Rs2050 crore while replacing old tracks, earth filling and ballast packing work between Dhanbad and Pt DDU Junction, he said. The Howrah-New Delhi GC route passes through West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The CPRO said the track condition, particularly on each major and small rail bridge on the GC route, needs to be further improved from safety point of view. Railways will have to improve yard remodelling at a few stations for the uninterrupted and smooth flow of traffic on the GC route. Besides, railways is to introduce ‘electronic interlocking’ and ‘European train control system’ on the entire GC route before increasing the speed limit of passenger trains, he said. It will also help faster movement of the goods trains, particularly in the Dhanbad division of the ECR. The eastern dedicated freight corridor on this route is to be made operational next year for the goods trains, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rlys-to-upgrade-tracks-infra-to-increase-speed-limit-of-trains/articleshow/84561813.cms||Kumod Verma

This Rs 40.12 lakhs project of pontoon bridge construction is coming in the midst of former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav’s dream project — Varuna Corridor — that is on the verge of completion after getting delayed for several years due to one or the other reason. TOI on Monday reached Dhelwariya to take stock of the under-construction pontoon bridge. It came to light that after placing pontoons further work of creating a surface for commuting had been started. As per norms, pontoon bridges are dismantled before the monsoon sets in to avoid damage due to floods and strong currents and built again in November when the river currents stabilize. Superintending engineer of PWD SK Agrawal said, “This project had been sanctioned by my department on the initiative of UP minister of state (independent charge) for stamp and revenue Ravindra Jaiswal. It is a small pontoon bridge being constructed with a budget of Rs 40.12 lakhs.” Regarding construction of the 60-mt pontoon bridge in the mid of monsoon season, Agrawal said, “It is a fact that pontoon bridges are dismantled and removed by June 15 when monsoon becomes active in the region and restored in November after the end of flood season.” He added, “But, this pontoon bridge is being constructed in river Varuna, which gets flooded due to backflow of water during flooding in river Ganga. The threat to the pontoon bridge is caused by the current of water in flood season while water remains still in Varuna even during flood.” “If water will increase in the Varuna in case of flooding in the Ganga, we can dismantle the pontoon bridge,” said Agrawal, mentioning that this bridge is being constructed to ease commuting of people who live in localities adjacent to Baghwanala and Dhelwaria. The pontoon bridge is being constructed by removing the railings installed as a part of Rs 201.65 crore Varuna Corridor project, which was launched by Yadav in 2016. As a part of this project, channelization of the river in an 11.30 km area, bank retainment with Geo material, laying pipeline to intercept sewage discharge and footpath construction with development of gardens and green belt had to be done by the UP Project Corporation Limited and irrigation department by January 2017. However, the project lingered mainly due to delay in getting the nod of railways for completing the work related to sewage interception near Chowkaghat railway overbridge. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “Now, most of the work of Varuna Corridor projects has been completed. Only minor work of repairing damages and giving finishing touch is in progress which will be completed by July-end.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/dhelwaria-nakkhighat-pontoon-bridge-being-built-against-norms/articleshow/84563893.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Besides covering all costs during hospitalisation including consumables, the policy — Optima Secure — restores the sum insured even if there is a claim and provides an assured increase in sum insured to keep up with inflation. Deduction of consumables like dressings, gloves, masks and nebulisers have been a major pain point among health insurance claimants as these sometimes added up to over 20% of the hospitalisation bills. Speaking to TOI, Ritesh Kumar, MD & CEO, HDFC Ergo, said that the company has decided to build upon the Optima range of policies offered by the erstwhile Apollo Munich Health Insurance after acquiring the company last year and has decided to build the ‘Optima’ brand by positioning Optima Secure as a flagship health insurance plan. “Health insurance is now 34% of our consolidated book as against 27% for motor and Covid has highlighted the need for adequate health cover,” said Kumar. He pointed out that the industry has already paid out around Rs 16,000 crore toward Covid claims and he believed that 25% of claims arising out of the second wave were yet to be reported as many policyholders were choosing the reimbursement route. The Optima Secure health insurance starts with a sum insured of Rs 5 lakh and can go up to Rs 2 crore. For a 36-year old from Mumbai, the premium would work out to around Rs 14,000. Customers can get a discount of up to 50% of the premium by opting for a deductible. According to Ravi Vishwanath, president, accident and health business, the secure, plus, protect and restore features of the policy, increase the protection by four times compared to basic covers. “We listened to our customers and have developed a product that protects against rising healthcare costs, is simple to understand, and offers tremendous value,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-ergo-issues-health-policy-without-deductions/articleshow/84570068.cms||Mayur Shetty

Several party members could be seen riding bullockcarts, pushing motorbike on carts and carrying cooking gas cylinders on their head to protest against the skyrocketing fuel prices. They also raised slogans against the NDA government. This protest was carried out across the district headquarters on Monday. In Patna, leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav flagged off a procession of party workers from the official bungalow of RJD MLA Ramannad Yadav on Beerchand Patel Path. Tejashwi said people who had promised good days were actually showing the worst days. “Each and everything has become expensive, from fuel to edible commodities. What is surprising is that when the price of crude oil is falling in the international market, the price of petroleum products is being hiked in India. Even in the neighbouring countries, petroleum products are at half the price compared to India,” he said. Tejashwi further lashed out at the NDA leaders for blaming Covid-19 as the reason behind inflation and fuel price hike. “Ours is the party of the poor and common man. We will raise the voice for them from streets to Parliament,” he said. RJD state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said not only the party leaders, but common people in large numbers participated in their protest. He said the NDA government should immediately take steps to control inflation or the RJD will intensify its protest. Another spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said the protest was organised at every district headquarters. “People expressed their anger against the price rise. In spite of the hot and humid climate, people came on the road because they had no option,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-protests-price-rise-on-2nd-consecutive-day/articleshow/84561453.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Varanasi||Hospitals have become like huge real estate industries: SC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court Monday said hospitals have become like huge real estate industries instead of serving humanity in the face of Covid-19 tragedy while directing that 'nursing homes' running from 2-3 room flats in residential colonies which pay little attention to fire and building safety norms should be closed. The apex court also pulled up the Gujarat government for extending the deadline till July next year for hospitals to rectify the building by-laws violations, and said the "carte blanche" notification was in teeth of its order of December 18 last year and people will continue to die in fire incidents. “These hospitals have become like a huge real estate industry instead of serving the cause of humanity in the face of human tragedy. "You (Gujarat government) have been extending the deadline, which cannot be done in view of our December 18, last year order. Hospitals are meant to provide succour to the patients in distress but instead they become money minting machines,” said a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah. Hospitals have become huge industries at the time of this tragedy and “these kinds of nursing homes, running from two-three room flats in a residential colony, should not be allowed to work", it added. “It is better that these hospitals are closed and the state should provide necessary infrastructure. We cannot allow these hospitals and nursing homes to continue working. This is a human tragedy which is taking place,” the bench said while referring to a fire incident in Nashik, Maharashtra, where some nurses and patients were killed last year. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/hospitals-have-become-like-huge-real-estate-industries-sc/articleshow/84563822.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Only second shot at Kolkata Municipal Corporation clinics to clear backlog||KOLKATA: To clear the backlog, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is set to assign the entire daily allocation of Covid vaccines to second-dose recipients across its CVCs. KMC plans to resume first-dose vaccination once the backlog is cleared, particularly for the 18-44 age group. Meanwhile, the allocation of doses at KMC clinics dipped to 150 from 200 on Monday. While this will come as a relief to those who have taken the first dose of Covishield over 84 days ago, there is no solution in sight yet for those who took Covaxin 28 days earlier. The civic health department is worried about the non-availability of Covaxin for the second dose at the 38 KMC vaccination clinics where only Covishield is being administered. A message was sent on Monday to the medical officers posted at the KMC vaccination clinics, asking them to reserve the entire allocation for recipients of the second dose. The message was needed as the allocation per clinic on Monday dipped to 150 doses from 200 doses that had remained constant at most of the clinics for the past five days except Sunday. However, a few clinics also received an allocation of over 200 doses on Monday. “Since we have been struggling to cater to recipients of the second dose, we may need to reserve 100% of the allotted vaccines for them. Our priority at the moment is to clear an ever-growing second dose backlog. The task is getting difficult each passing day due to a supply-demand gap arising out of scarcity of vaccines. This has necessitated a policy of vaccine reservation,” said a KMC health department official. This reservation policy may lead to an indefinite delay in the vaccination for the 18-44 age group, admitted a civic official. “We had planned to introduce inoculation of citizens in the 18-44 group at our vaccination clinics. But scarcity of supply has compelled us to put the project on hold,” said a KMC health official who looks after the supply of vaccines to the KMC-run clinics. The civic body has sent an SOS to the health department, requesting for more Covaxin doses to clear the huge second-dose backlog. “Whatever supply we are receiving from the state health department is grossly inadequate. In case of Covishield, we are struggling to bridge the gap. But in case of Covaxin, we are simply helpless as the supply is nowhere near the demand,” a civic health department official said. According to the official, the daily allocation of Covaxin meets only around 15% of the demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/only-second-shot-at-kmc-clinics-to-clear-backlog/articleshow/84564545.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Patna||Bihar: ‘Celebrate Bakrid at home with kin, avoid gatherings’||PATNA: With a view to avoiding large congregations, mass prayers will not be offered at Gandhi Maidan or any ‘Eidgah’ (an open place where ‘namaz’ is offered by Muslims) in the state capital on the occasion of Bakrid on Wednesday. This is the second consecutive year when Covid-related restrictions will be imposed on devotees during Bakrid celebrations. Mahmood Alam, the president of the Namaz Eidan Committee, told this reporter on Monday that the state government had urged people to follow the Covid safety protocols by offering prayers at home in order to contain the spread of the deadly virus. “Nearly 15,000 devotees come together at Gandhi Maidan for offering Bakrid prayers every year,” he said. Mosques will also remain shut during the celebrations as the government has not allowed religious places to reopen after the Covid-induced lockdown. Imarat Shariah, a Muslim religious body that has jurisdiction over Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, has also asked devotees to celebrate Bakrid at home with family members. Its general secretary, Maulana Shibli Al Quasami, said, “Hand shakes and hugs should be avoided and social distancing maintained during the festivities.” Quasami advised Muslims to “maintain cleanliness while offering ‘qurbani’ (ritual sacrifice) and dispose of the wastes at the designated points”. “Do not perform the ritual on roads or streets. Celebrate the festival peacefully and adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he added. Saran DM for peaceful celebrations: Saran district magistrate (DM) Nilesh Ramchandra Deore has directed the authorities concerned to ensure that Bakrid is celebrated in a peaceful manner on Wednesday. The state government has imposed a ban on large gatherings at holy places till August 6 in light of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The DM told this newspaper on Monday, “Since the holy month of Shravan will begin soon, officials have been asked to keep a watch on bus stops and railway stations and ensure that Covid safety norms are followed during the Kanwar Yatra.” SP Santosh Kumar has also directed the cops to remain alert and make the district control room functional.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Broker casts babu lookalikes in Rs 4.3 crore land con plot||AHMEDABAD: A realtor allegedly staged a daring con by propping lookalikes of a top bureaucrat and an ex-chief secretary of the state to cheat a Vadodara land broker of Rs 4.3 crore on the pretext of clearing three land deals. Complainant Anil Patel, 55, and his two sons deal in land parcels. In his FIR filed on Sunday with Infocity police, Patel said that he had signed multiple MoUs to get various land parcels – acquired by the state in 1976 following the introduction of the urban land ceiling act – de-freezed from government records. Even as Patel was struggling to get some help from the government to relieve the land parcels in Vadodara, he was introduced to Vijaysinh Tank from Raysan in Gandhinagar by a common friend at a musical event in 2016 who agreed to help him get land back from the government. In June 2016, Tank asked Patel to come to Udyog Bhawan in Gandhinagar. He introduced a man dressed in a blue suit and tie as the top IAS officer of the state. Patel alleged in the FIR that he and the bureaucrat discussed the land deals and the babu assured to help him after taking Rs 7 lakh from him directly and another Rs 25 lakh through Tank in the first visit. A month later in July, Tank allegedly introduced Patel to a fake ex-chief secretary who also sought money to clear the land. Patel said that he ended up paying Rs 4.30 crore to Tank and the two fake IAS officers during different visits over four months. In September 2016, Patel got a letter from the revenue department stating that the land parcels were no longer part of government records. When he took this sanction letter to the urban land ceiling office in Vadodara, an officer told Patel that the letter was forged. He was told that his pleas to de-freeze the land parcels had, in fact, been rejected. After this, Tank began avoiding Patel and went incommunicado. Recently, Patel met Mukesh Meghani, a resident of Surat who had also been allegedly cheated by Tank and the two fake IAS officers in a similar manner. Patel gathered the voice recordings of their phone calls and approached Infocity police with the evidence. The police lodged an FIR of cheating, breach of trust and forgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/broker-casts-babu-lookalikes-in-rs-4-3-crore-con-plot/articleshow/84565345.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Allahabad||HC sets aside dismissal of staffer sacked for extra-marital live-in tie||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has set aside the dismissal order of a government employee who was dismissed from service on the ground that he was in a live-in relationship with another woman despite the fact that he is married and his wife is alive. Justice Pankaj Bhatia, while passing the order on July 14, made it clear to the state authorities to pass a fresh order imposing minor penalties. The order of dismissal was passed against the petitioner, Gore Lal Verma, solely on the ground that despite being married to one Laxmi Devi, who is alive, the petitioner maintained an extra-marital relationship with another lady named Hemlata Verma and both are staying together as husband and wife. He also has three children from the said live-in relationship. Passing the impugned order of dismissal, the authorities had recorded that the said conduct is against the provisions of the UP Government Servant Conduct Rules, 1956, and against the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act. As such, the order of dismissal from service was passed. It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that in a similar matter in case of one Aneeta Yadav, this court, after considering, set aside the dismissal order. However, an opportunity was granted to the respondents to award any minor penalty, if they so desire. It was further argued that the said judgment was challenged in special leave to appeal and the Supreme Court refused to interfere. Consequently, the said special leave to appeal was dismissed. After hearing the counsel, the court set aside his order of dismissal observing that considering the fact as well as the judgment of this court in the case of Aneeta Yadav, the petitioner is also entitled to the same benefit. Consequently, the writ petition was allowed and the respondent authority was directed to reinstate the petitioner. However, the petitioner shall not be paid back wages from the date of dismissal till today, the court directed. “It is open to the respondents to pass fresh orders for imposition of minor penalty in accordance with law, if so advised,” the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-sets-aside-dismissal-of-staffer-sacked-for-extra-marital-live-in-tie/articleshow/84562398.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

These were some of the decisions taken in an online meeting of college principals across the state on Sunday. The All Bengal Principals’ Council, which includes more than 400 principals in the state, held the meeting to discuss measures for admissions to undergraduate and postgraduate courses, the process of which are scheduled to begin on August 2. They also iterated that all colleges must adhere to the admission guidelines set by the higher education department and meet the deadlines. “We called for a meeting of college principals on Sunday evening. It was an online meeting given the pandemic and the social distancing guidelines of the government,” said Subires Bhattacharyya, president of All Bengal Principals’ Council and secretary of the West Bengal Vice Chancellors’ Council.“The meeting was to convey to all principals they must follow the admission guidelines recommended by the state higher education department. The government has released a notification and a set of guidelines for UG and PG admissions.” Last year, as college admissions began after the pandemic struck, almost all colleges under the state government had reduced semester as well as admission fees. In some colleges, the slash was almost 40% to 50% of the original amount. This year, too, the fee structure is expected to remain similar. “It was decided in the meeting that we will not increase the fees this year because the pandemic and its consequent economic crisis have taken a heavy toll on many families. Keeping the fee structure low like last year will not add additional financial burden on students and their guardians, who are already going through a tough time. Colleges will also not charge any application fees, as instructed by the state government. Other guidelines recommended by the government will be followed,” said Indrila Guha, principal of Basanti Devi College. The state government has already issued the guidelines, according to which admission portals will open on August 2 and the merit list will be published by September 1. First-semester undergraduate classes are scheduled to start on October1. But University Grants Commission has allowed colleges to continue admitting students till October 31 if seats remain vacant. The institutes have been told to analyse reasons behind seats remaining vacant last year. “Colleges have been asked to draw up a list of departments, where more seats remained vacant compared to other departments. Colleges must start the academic session by October 1. UGC has allowed admissions till October 31. We want to stick to this schedule,” said a member of the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-hike-in-admission-or-semester-fees-principals-decide-at-online-meeting/articleshow/84564734.cms||Zeeshan Javed

This is in addition to the Rs 165 crore it had provided earlier. The private life insurer has said that claims under the second wave have been three to four times those received in the first wave of the pandemic. Addressing the annual general meeting of HDFC Life Insurance, chairman Deepak Parekh said, “It might appear that the second wave has peaked, but the country has already lost four lakh precious lives.” He added that while the country cannot afford to let down its guard, the impact of the second wave of the pandemic on India’s economy is expected to be milder and largely restricted to the June quarter. According to Parekh, the pandemic has heightened consumer awareness of life insurance. “The government move to hike foreign investment in insurance to 74% is also positive for the sector from a long-term perspective,” he said. Announcing the results, the company’s MD & CEO Vibha Padalkar said that the insurer witnessed a steep rise in death claims during the first quarter. “We paid over 70,000 claims in Q1. The gross and net claims provided for amounted to Rs 1,598 crore and Rs 956 crore respectively. Based on our current claims experience, we have set up an additional reserve of Rs 700 crore to service the claims intimations expected to be received,” she said. Parekh said that the company continues to engage with the regulator to hold life insurance accountable towards only one parameter, the expense management limit, rather than have numerous rules over what they can or cannot invest or spend on. In FY21, the company had settled over 2.9 lakh death claims, which resulted in payout of over Rs 3,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-life-hikes-2nd-wave-claims-provisions-by-rs-700cr/articleshow/84569346.cms||---

The active caseload once again crossed the 25,000 mark. After reaching the presumed peak in May, the sustained decline of active caseload continued for the last 55 days. But the streak ended onBut the curve does not seem to be plateauing anytime soon as it happened during the first wave, and the evolution and ebbing of the second wave looks to be more complex with a fluctuation in the confirmed cases. From the peak of 1.8 about two months ago, the Covid-19 reproduction rate currently hovers around 0.8-0.9%. The prolonged second wave has now triggered a concern, hinting at a probable second peak during the second wave itself before the onset of the third wave. However, the same unclear trajectory has become an excuse for some people to lower their guard, including unmasking and not following social distancing norms. Variations in regional distribution of Covid-19 cases continued even in the second wave with districts such as East Godavari, West Godavari and Chittoor being affected the most for reasons unknown even to officials. East Godavari continued to lead the table with 2.73 lakh cumulative cases, followed by Chittoor with 2.27 lakh cases. Even though the state is taking extensive measures to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination drive, only some 42 lakh people are fully vaccinated as of date, while about 1.03 crore people have got their first dose.

Compared to the UK, we were two to two-and-a-half months behind both in the first and second waves. It has been almost one-and-a-half months since the third wave emerged in the UK. The increased economic activity, prolonged second wave, and the increase in daily cases in some Indian states are all alarming signs. We have to prepare for the third wave,” said Dr Rambabu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-sees-upward-trajectory-of-covid-hospitalisations-again/articleshow/84563913.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Unlike the health covers provided by non-life companies, this plan provides fixed benefits against certain specified health risks. Besides the individual buyer, the policy can cover the rest of their family including their spouse, children and parents. The policy provides financial protection in case of hospitalisation or surgery and pays the insured a lump sum benefit irrespective of actual medical costs. It has a no claim benefit under which the health cover is stepped up every year. If more than one member is covered under a policy, the policy will continue to operate and the premium waived if the original principal insured dies during the term of the policy. Also if any of the insured undergoes major surgery, the premium for that year is waived. The policy also has an ambulance benefit which repays the insured for use of ambulance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-health-insurance-plan-from-lic/articleshow/84569420.cms||---

According to sources, they were conned by a vendor who offered to sell 30 eggs at just Rs 100 instead of the market price of Rs 180. Scores of people across villages had come to Andravaripalle to buy the eggs. Speaking to media, locals said that at first, there was nothing suspicious about the eggs. Matters came to light only when they tried to boil the eggs. “We tried to boil it for more than 10 minutes but we found that it was still hard. When we tried to throw it on the ground, instead of cracking, it bounced,” a woman said, addressing the media. After managing to break the plastic shell, they found inside it an orange substance instead of the yolk. Police said they are inquiring into the incident and trying to ascertain the identity of the conman. They appealed to the public to not fall for deals that sound too good to be true. Food safety officials are looking into the issue and have collected samples of the plastic egg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/miscreant-cons-villagers-by-selling-plastic-eggs/articleshow/84564090.cms||---

The accused claimed in his bail application that on May 27, 2021, the case was not registered against him but against Gyanesh Kumar and Prakash Mishra and that he had been fabricated in the case due to business rivalry. Since police did not recover anything from his possession and as one of the co-accused Prakash Mishra had already been released on bail, therefore the court should also release him on bail, he stated in his bail application. When the main accused had not been charged under section 120-B of IPC then how could he be charged under that section, he pleaded. Additional district government counsel Sanjay Jha whike opposing his bail stated that following a tip offf , the Gwaltoli police had arrested Gyanesh Kumar Sharma and Prakash Mishra and recovered 68 Liposomal Amphotericin B Injection Brand Amphinex and a sum of Rs 1.80 lakh from the dashboard of the car. And during the inquiry they told the police that the recovered injections had been supplied by Pankaj Agarwal, Madhuram Bajpai and Shubham Tiwari, Jha stated. Drug Inspector Seema Singh who collected the samples from the spot had recovered 68 injections of Liposomal Amphotericin B Injection Brand Amphonex which the accused used to supply to kin of the needy patients, the prosecution told the court. The ADGC further stated that the main accused told the police that Madhuram Bajpai and others had brought injections from Allahabad and sold them in the market. The government lab after testing the samples of the injection had declared them as counterfeit injections. As at that time the city was reeling under black fungus disease the accused were selling counterfeit Liposomal Amphotericin B Injection Brand Amphinex on premium prices, he further pleaded. The court stated in its order, “Selling counterfeit injections during a crisis is a heinous offence against humanity. This court is not bound to follow the order of the other court. Since the bail application of Gyanesh Kumar Sharma, and Vijay Kumar was rejected therefore the bail application of Madhuram Bajpai is also being rejected as there no appropriate ground to release him on bail”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/court-rejects-bail-application-of-accused-in-black-fungus-injection-case/articleshow/84563943.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: No RT-PCR test for double-dosed flyers||KOLKATA: The state on Monday allowed passengers who are fully vaccinated to fly into Bengal without having to undergo an RT-PCR test. However, those who are partially vaccinated or have not received even one dose yet will have to undergo RT-PCR test before boarding a flight to Kolkata, Bagdogra or Andal. The order, with immediate effect, came as a huge relief for passengers, particularly business travellers who have been avoiding trips into and out of Bengal unless absolutely necessary to avoid the hassle of taking time out for a Covid test. The travel trade industry and the airport operator, who have been lobbying for relaxation of the RT-PCR norm for passengers who have received two Covid vaccine shots, welcomed the move and said it would act as a shot in the arm for the beleaguered industry. Airport officials said passenger count could increase by 8%-10% following the order. “The airlines have been praying for the relaxation of the RT-PCR test rule in case of passengers who have received both doses. Maharashtra did it a week ago; Karnataka did it before that. Now that Bengal has allowed it as well, there will be an immediate growth in travel,” an airport official said. While 25,000-odd passengers are currently travelling on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the count drops to 20,000 on the other four days due to the partial curbs on flights from high-traffic cities, like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai and Ahmedabad. The industry now wants the rule limiting flights coming from these cities to three days a week to be removed. “There is a need for a uniform policy. If a person who is fully vaccinated or RT-PCR cleared can travel on Monday, Wednesday and Friday to Kolkata from Mumbai or the other four cities in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, why can’t the flier get an option to travel on the other four days?” he asked. The fresh order, he felt, will boost domestic tourism and lead to bookings for Puja travel. “Not just businessmen and corporate officials residing in other cities, even those in Kolkata were avoiding travel. Now they can go about their business with peace of mind,” said TAAI chairman (east) Manav Soni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-rt-pcr-test-for-double-dosed-flyers/articleshow/84564511.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Officials plan to permit students for regular class work at school sometime after the second week of August. The 2021-22 academic year commenced from July 12 in the online mode. Despite technical glitches, lecturers and teachers from government schools have been continuing online classes. Government schools, which have started the admission process, are also focusing on conducting in person classes with a 50% student strength. The other 50% will join online classes. Students will attend physical classes on alternate days, according to the proposals of officials. Education minister Adimulapu Suresh said, “We are committed to providing quality education for the students. The academic year has already commenced and many schools have started online classes. We are not sure about starting school work for students. Health wing is predicting a third wave and reopening of schools and class work will be dependent on that,” he said. The government is also analysing the trend of new Covid-19 cases that is being registered in some districts and is meanwhile focusing on completing the vaccination drive for teachers and non-teaching staff at government schools.

Bank of Maharashtra (BoM), which has a small portion of the loan amount, had appealed against the order under which creditors were to get around 4% of the admitted claims of Rs 64,838 crore. BoM had raised two main objections — the sale price was close to the liquidation price, and even the 4% that was being paid was largely in the form of debentures with very little cash coming in. IFCI is also understood to have filed a separate appeal against Videocon. The NCLT, while approving the resolution plan on June 8, had raised questions in respect of the sale, pointing out that the applicant was paying almost nothing and had questioned how the bid had come in marginally above the liquidation value. Lenders are expected to maintain utmost confidentiality about the liquidation value. This is the value below which they will sell the assets rather than sell the company to a bottom-fishing bidder. The NCLT had raised doubts about the confidentiality clause being followed in the case and requested the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India to examine the issue. In terms of bankruptcy laws, the decision of the committee of creditors is considered supreme and NCLT usually approves the deal without going into the merits as long as the process if followed. Typically, a dissenting creditor loses out as they get their share based on liquidation value rather than the sale value. In the current case, the liquidation value and the sale value are almost on a par and BoM should have got a share in line with the other creditors. However, the PSU lender has broken ranks from its peers as the resolution plan sought to pay dissenting creditors with non-convertible debentures (NCDs). The counsel for BoM argued that what the bank would receive would be less than the liquidation value of the company. In terms of the plan submitted by Twin Star, of the Rs 2,962 crore offered, only Rs 200 crore would be paid in cash and the rest would be paid in NCDs. Twin Star had proposed to issue NCDs with a face value of Rs 2,700 crore. The NCDs would be redeemable in 5 instalments — the first instalment of Rs 200 crore will become due 25 months form the closing date of the transaction, the rest would be repaid in instalments of Rs 625 crore in three, four, five and six years from the closing date. The outstanding NCDs would carry a coupon of 6.65% payable annually. In its order, the appellate body gave the respondents two weeks to reply and has listed the appeal for ‘admission hearing’ on September 7. The company would continue to be managed by the resolution professional under the bankruptcy process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclat-stays-videocon-sale-to-vedanta-on-bom-appeal/articleshow/84569208.cms||---
---||Patna||‘New technical varsities to take sheen off Aryabhatta Knowledge University’||PATNA: With the recent state cabinet’s approval for the establishment of separate medical and engineering universities along with the sports university, Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU) faces a bleak future. Established with much fanfare in 2010 by chief minister Nitish Kumar himself, AKU was supposed to govern all the professional institutions, including medical and engineering colleges, of the state more efficiently, ensuring their all-round development. Consequently, all the 54 engineering colleges and 14 medical colleges (both private and government) running under different conventional universities in the state were brought under the umbrella of AKU. Besides, some other professional colleges of nursing and education were also attached to AKU. However, even before the institutions could make some satisfactory progress under their new master, the chief minister himself decided to create separate universities for medical and engineering education. Now, after the establishment of these new universities, AKU will hardly be left with some institutions of substance, feel academicians. The state government recently created four autonomous centres under AKU , but the university has very little to do with the administration of these study centres. All these centres, namely, Centre for Geographical Studies, Patliputra School of Economics, Centre for Journalism and Mass Communications and the Centre for River Studies, are headed by directors who would be the chief custodian of these autonomous centres. AKU’s founder vice-chancellor Shambhu Nath Guha regretted that without paying much attention to AKU’s growth and development steps have been initiated for the establishment of new engineering and medical universities. A full-fledged centre of nanotechnology was started at AKU several years back, but it is still having only one faculty to teach M Tech and Ph D scholars of this centre. How can one expect good quality of teaching and research with just one teacher, he asked. Guha opined that all the four centres established recently should have been placed under the full administrative control of AKU. Some other proposed centres of stem cell research and astrophysics should also be established under the administrative control of AKU itself, he added. Patna University social science faculty’s former dean Nawal Kishore Chaudhary , however, felt that creating new engineering and medical colleges would hardly serve any useful purpose. Unless the government ensured appointment of qualified and competent teachers and provided the desired infrastructural facilities in technical institutions, there would be no significant change in the standard of these institutions. What did PMCH achieve when it was brought from PU to AKU and what would it further achieve when it is brought to yet another new medical university. Institutions matter and not the university, he said. Moreover, Chaudhary pointed out, the idea of creating specialized universities also goes against the provision of the National Education Policy, 2020. For that matter, even IITs are now conducting teaching and research in social sciences, humanities and management in addition to engineering courses. He said instead of setting up new institutions the CM should try to strengthen the existing universities in the state. There is no harm if some specialized centres like that of sports and culture are set up in the state, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/new-technical-varsities-to-take-sheen-off-aku/articleshow/84561775.cms||B K Mishra

Over 50 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered across the state in the month of July so far. This is out of total 2.13 crore doses, both first and second, administered till Monday evening since the vaccination drive started in January. Sources said the number of vaccines administered in a day depends on the availability of the stock. “After the fresh stock arrives, the number of vaccination goes up the next day,” said a source. The data shared by the Union government on vaccination shows that on an average over 2.6 lakh doses have been administered in a day in July in Bihar, which is more than in previous months. It may be because the state government has launched ‘six crore vaccinations in six months’ drive on July 1. As per the official data, the maximum 6,81,776 doses were administered on July 2 and the minimum 22,512 on July 11. District wise break-up till Monday evening shows that the maximum 23.38 lakh doses have been administered in Patna, followed by East Champaran (9.64 lakh), Muzaffarpur (9.29 lakh), Saran (8.74 lakh) and Gaya (8.69 lakh). Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Singh said they are trying to vaccinate more people to achieve 100% vaccination target in the urban areas of the district by the end of this month. “We have increased the manpower involved in the vaccination drive. Earlier, there were 40 teams with total 40 Tika Express. Now, the number of teams has been increased to 75,” she said. She said once the urban population is fully covered, they will penetrate into the rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-leads-in-vaccination-drive/articleshow/84561729.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Nitish was visibly upset after a youth from Panjari in Rohtas district complained that his native village didn't have a pucca (metalled) road and the residents of the village under Dinara block have to take the patients to the hospitals on ‘khatia’ (charpoy) for treatment. “Kamaal hai? Gaon mein abhi tak pakki sadak nahi hai,” Nitish said and directed the rural development department officials to initiate steps in that direction on a priority basis. Complaints related to incomplete roads in villages were also made by the people from Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Rohtas and Samastipur districts. “I have already asked to complete such roads. But complaints were still being received,” he said. A resident of Darauda block in Siwan raised irregularities in the Jal-Jeevan-Haryali and other Saat Nischay schemes of the government. Raju Raj of Darbhanga complained about perennial waterlogging in some localities under Sadar block in the town.

---||Kolkata||E-challan software to make prosecutions more transparent||Kolkata: The Kolkata Traffic Police is set to introduce an e-challan software that is integrated with the national databases for vehicle registration (Vahan) and driver’s licence (Sarathi) that will not only make prosecutions more transparent but also ensure its enforcement not only in Kolkata but across the country. Hence, a person whose licence is either impounded or cancelled due to a major traffic offence will then be unable to issue a licence in another jurisdiction, be in within the state or outside it. The software will recognise e-documents stored in the Digilocker, a virtual storage space that owners and drivers can carry on their cellphones. This will do away with the need for people to carry the original document in the vehicle. Police will be able to digitally seize and suspend these documents and issue e-challans, said joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey. Police will also be able to access all previous cases of the registered vehicle and the driver on the cellphone. Motorists will get the exact GPS-based location where the traffic violation was recorded. “We had planned the integration to the national database. The Covid situation has only expedited it as introducing a system of contactless challan is necessary now. When the e-documents are seized digitally, the motorist will know the exact reason for the prosecution. If the offender does not pay the penalty, the document will stay locked until the dues are cleared. If the person is again caught violating traffic norms, the case can get compounded as cops will be able to see that the document is already locked for traffic-rule violation,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-challan-software-to-make-prosecutions-more-transparent/articleshow/84564577.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Earlier, the UGC had decided to conduct the admission in various courses through the CUCET that was to be conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA). This was the reason that the University had started preparing for the entrance examination in professional courses except for the regular courses of undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Following the recent decision of the UGC, now AU would declare the schedule for conducting admission for all the courses on the campus, including both UG, PG and professional courses. Earlier, when there was some delay from the UGC for instructing the central universities in terms of conducting common entrance tests, AU authorities had floated the tender for conducting the entrance test for the professional courses. “However, we had made a provision in the earlier floated tender for conducting entrance test for all other courses too. Now that the UGC has decided not to conduct CUCET, we have saved around ten days of precious time as the same tender would serve our purpose and we hope that AU would meet the deadline of completing the admission by October 1," said the director of the admission cell, Prof I R Siddiqui. Although there is still time for the opening of the said tender, sources told TOI that AU can declare the admission schedule around August 10 and as there has already been quite a delay in the admission process, the time for applying for different courses in UG, PG and professional courses would be shorter than as provided in previous years. “If the situation remains safe, the last date for closing of applications could be around August 20-22 and entrance test could be conducted in mid-September and results could be declared in another ten days or so. AU would be able to complete the admission process by around the first or second week of October”, said one of the senior faculty members of AU who is closely associated with the admissions on the campus for the past many years. However, those associated with the preparations for conducting admissions on the campus are apprehensive of the third wave of the pandemic and believe that AU can conduct the entrance tests, both in offline and online mode, only if the situation remains conducive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-to-conduct-admissions-for-all-courses-of-its-own/articleshow/84562458.cms||---

Patterns related to Lord Shiva like the trishool (the trident), Mahakal, Shivlinga, Om, Swastikas, serpents, Ram Mandir design and Lord Hanuman are among the most sought after tattoos in the Sangam city. “For youngsters, the most common choices are one square-inch tattoo glorifying Lord Hanuman’s mace, Ram Temple, trishools, Mahakal and Shivlings," said Ajay Kumar Gupta, noted sand artist and student of fine arts (Allahabad University). "The in-thing that is spreading like wildfire currently, particularly among college and school going students are the religious tattoos as the youth seems to be fascinated by them,” he added. He further said, "most of the boys prefer large size tattoos and face painting of Trishools, Shivlings, Mahakal, Lord Hanuman's mace tattoo and Ram Temple design tattoos on their arms, neck and back. Among the girls, small tattoos on arms are most what the customers come for." Moreover, some people prefer script-based tattoos, and mantras like the Maha Mrityunjay mantra, Gayatri mantra, and the Shiva Tandav Strota and prefer getting inked with verses of the mantras. Ahead of the beginning of holy Shrawan month, devotees of Lord Shiva prefer to get symbols and designs related to Lord Shiva inked on their bodies. Vinayak, an engineering student says, “it's all about expressing one's faith and for youngsters, faith has found a new expression in the form of tattoos." He further added, "many budding professionals, who observe fast on Mondays during Shrawan months or actively participate or perform Jalabhishek and other rituals during the holy month of Shrawan, are getting inked with Shiva images and symbols to feel a deeper connection with their 'Mahadev'. Ajay Gupta, meanwhile, said, “For devotees, face painting and tattoos are purely a form of devotion. Whatever the driving force, they are eager to get inked." Interestingly, tattoo and face painting enthusiasts are ready to shell out extra bucks for getting designer tattoos made. “I spent around Rs 3,500 to get a Trishool tattoo on my upper arm. Being inked boosts my devotion for Lord Shiva; it also fires up my soul,” said Ajay Tripathi, a resident of Mumfordganj. "Tattoos are now fascinating devotees and more people want to get inked,” he added. Face painting and tattoo artists admit that there is a sizeable number of people seek temporary face painting or tattoos during the festive seasons thinking that the tattoos can boost their luck and prosperity." Currently, face painting artists also use eyeliners and fabric colours to sketch attractive face paintings and tattoos. Another tattoo artist said, “It takes at least an hour to ink a chosen design. Seekers maintain patience throughout the process and are ready to shell out extra money for their favourite designs."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/tattoo-spiritualism-the-in-thing-ahead-of-shrawan/articleshow/84562334.cms||Kapil Dixit

Chairman of a vernacular TV channel, B Rajagopal Naidu, moved the HC with a public interest litigation (PIL) contending that the police were booking false cases and sending people to judicial remand without uploading the FIRs online, which is against the guidelines issued by the SC. Advocate general S Sriram told the HC that according to the details he received from the office of director general of police (DGP), FIRs are being uploaded within 24 hours of their registration. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya asked the AG to file an affidavit with all details pertaining to the registration and uploading of FIRs. The bench asked the counsel for the petitioner PVG Umesh Chandra to respond after the government filed the affidavit. Umesh Chandra argued that the police were not following SC guidelines set out in the Arnesh Kumar judgment. The bench said the police were aware what would happen if they did not follow the Arnesh Kumar judgment. The matter was posted for further hearing after four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/firs-are-available-online-within-24-hrs-govt-to-hc/articleshow/84564226.cms||Srikanth Aluri

It may develop into a low pressure a day later, triggering intense rain, the Met office said. The monsoon trough, too, is about to slide towards south Bengal that could contribute to the wet weather. Parts of the city received light to moderate rain on Monday with Salt Lake getting 45mm rain between 8.30am and 2.30pm. “The monsoon trough has been fluctuating. It is set to move southward leading to an increase in rain across south Bengal. We are expecting a circulation over north Bay which may turn into a low pressure leading to intense showers,” said RMC director G K Das. He added that this week won’t be dry like last week. Under the impact of the trough, clouds have started floating in from Bangladesh. They have triggered inconsistent rain in the city, with the north and east receiving a heavier downpour than the south which received drizzles. “After Thursday, the showers may not only be more intense but may cover the entire city as well,” added Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-may-get-more-showers-later-this-week-met-office/articleshow/84564782.cms||---

Additional deputy police commissioner Vikas Chandra Tripathi on Monday said, “Two accused, Atar Singh and Raj Bahadur, had been arrested by police and a licenced pistol was also seized from them.

The incident occurred in the dispute of temple land.” A Santoshi Mata temple, which is looked after by a trust, is situated in Shaktinagar of Khojwa locality under Bhelupur police station. Atar Singh and Rajbahadur are trustees and they had an old dispute with temple priest Ramakant Pathak on the issue of property on which the temple exists, said police. On Sunday night, Rajbahadur went inside the temple and had a quarrel with the newly appointed priest Abhishek Pandey, who is also an office-bearer in the local unit of Hindu Yuva Vahini. When they were fighting, Atar Singh also reached there and tried to intervene. It is alleged that during the altercation, Atar Singh opened indiscriminate fire. Abhishek suffered bullet injuries in this incident. On getting information, police reached there and rushed Abhishek and also Rajbahadur, who had suffered injuries during an altercation with priests, to the BHU trauma centre. Angry over the incident, a large number of HYV workers created ruckus at the trauma centre on Monday morning. However, they ended their agitation after the ADCP assured them of appropriate action in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/man-shot-at-by-rivals-in-temple-land-dispute/articleshow/84563854.cms||---
---||Allahabad||ABAP chief slams Rana’s remark, says ‘be prepared to settle in WB’||Prayagraj: Reacting to the recent statement of poet Munawwar Rana that he would “leave UP if Yogi Adityanath becomes the chief minister of the state again”, president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) Mahant Narendra Giri has advised Rana to “get prepared to settle down in West Bengal”. He added that Yogi Adityanath will become the state’s CM again. In a press statement issued on Monday, Giri said, “It seems that Munawwar Rana is playing in the hands of the fundamentalists. During the BJP government of the state led by Yogi Adityanath, there has been no riot in the last four and a half years. Whenever there have been other governments in UP, there have been riots and Muslims have also been unsafe,” said Giri. “In BJP rule, Muslims are also completely safe in UP, but Rana’s statement of leaving UP if BJP wins the next assembly elections (in 2022) and CM Yogi becomes the CM is ridiculous,” said the ABAP president, adding that “from the statement of Rana, it seems that his mental condition is not good”. “Anyone is completely free to go anywhere, and if Munawwar Rana also wants to go to West Bengal, then of course he can. But they should not forget that West Bengal is also a part of India,” said Giri. “As far as the formation of the next government in UP is concerned, the next government will also be formed under the leadership of CM Yogi Adityanath and he will be the next CM of the state,” said Giri. However, Giri said that as a poet, Munawwar Rana has a good reputation throughout the country and both Hindus and Muslims respect him. “But the kind of controversial statements he has been making continuously for the last few days, his image has also been affected. If Rana abandons his controversial statements and returns to the mainstream of nationalism, then he will definitely get the same respect from the people again,” said Giri. Rana has recently said, “If Yogi becomes the chief minister again, then I will assume that the state is no longer fit for Muslims to live and I will have to migrate to some other place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/abap-chief-slams-ranas-remark-says-be-prepared-to-settle-in-wb/articleshow/84562374.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar: 50 CNG buses from July 24||PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar is set to launch the state’s first CNG (compressed natural gas) bus service at Samvad Bhawan on July 24. Earlier, the transport department had been running several diesel-run buses converted into CNG. Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, the secretary of the transport department, told this reporter on Monday that the introduction of green-coloured CNG buses would go a long way in curbing pollution. “The eco-friendly buses, which are cost-efficient, will reduce the city’s carbon footprint,” he said, adding that all the diesel-powered buses would also be converted into CNG by 2022. As part of the new service, which will be launched by the CM on Saturday, altogether 50 buses will ply on three different routes — Bankipore bus depot to Danapur (route number 111A), Patna City (555) and Bihta and IIT-Patna (888). Of these, 20 buses will run on the Bihta and Danapur routes and 10 on the Patna City route. Depending on the distance covered, the minimum fare of the CNG buses will be Rs 5 and the maximum Rs 45. Each non-AC bus with 31 seats will be equipped with CCTV cameras, speed governors, GPS devices, water coolers, first aid kits and fire extinguishers. Agarwal also said the number of CNG-filling stations would go up from eight to 12 in a few months. At present, there are CNG stations in localities like Rukanpura, Transport Nagar, Bahadurpur, Gola Road, Deedarganj, Saguna Mor, Naubatpur and Bypass Road near Bakhtiyarpur toll plaza in Patna. An official of the Gas Authority of India Limited, the company which has been setting up CNG stations in the city, claimed that three more would come up at Bihta, Masaurhi and Danapur in the next two-three months. “We are still in talks with the state government for setting up a CNG-filling station in Phulwarisharif. Once the proposal is passed, we will take six months to set up the station,” he added. The rate of CNG is Rs 61.9 per kg and that of diesel is around Rs 95 per litre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/50-cng-buses-from-july-24/articleshow/84561499.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Patna||Bihar: Huge gatherings not allowed on Guru Purnima for 2nd year||GAYA: In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, huge gatherings will not be allowed on Guru Purnima for the second consecutive year in Gaya. The festival will start at 10.43am on Friday and continue till 8.06am on Saturday. A large number of devotees visit the Vishnupad Temple every year on Guru Purnima to see the footprints of Lord Vishnu in its sanctum sanctorum. However, no offerings will be made this time because the temple is shut due to the pandemic. Acharya Subodh Kumar Mishra of the Bhagwati Tara Tantra Evam Jyotish Anusandhan Kendra in Gaya told this reporter on Monday that more than 2,000 people associated with them had embraced ‘diksha’. “At least 200 of them gather at the kendra to offer their obeisances to their teachers on Guru Purnima every year. However, no such event will be organized this time,” he added. Acharya Krishnadev Mishra, a college teacher in Gaya, pointed out that the festival had a special significance in many people’s lives as their gurus helped them acquire knowledge, both spiritual as well as scientific. “Under a guru’s guidance, one can overcome all sufferings,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/huge-gatherings-not-allowed-on-guru-purnima-for-2nd-yr/articleshow/84561374.cms||---

At $22.5 billion, exits in H1-21 saw more than a seven-fold increase in value terms compared to the same period last year ($3 billion) and also the second half of 2020 ($3.1 billion), as per the latest tracker by Indian Venture Capital Association and EY India. The number of exits in H1-21(118) was 82% higher compared to H1-20 (65 exits) and 37% higher compared to H2-20 (86 deals). This is the highest half-yearly value of exits and second highest on an annual basis after 2018 when exit value stood at $27 billion. H1-21 recorded four $1 billion plus exits- a count equal to that recorded in the previous three years combined. Large exits (value greater than $100 million) accounted for $20.8 billion in value across 24 exits in the period compared to 12 such exits worth $3.8 billion in full year 2020. The half-year period recorded investments worth $26.9 billion- a 45% increase in investments YoY across 518 deals, the report showed. Exits via strategic sale were the highest contributor (57%) with $12.7 billion recorded across 29 deals mainly due to the $8.6 billion large deal where Hitachi acquired GlobalLogic offering exits to CPPIB and Partners Group. Exits via secondary sale (i.e. sale to other PE funds) at $4.5 billion across 31 deals recorded the highest ever half-yearly value and were 4x value recorded in entire 2020. PE-backed IPOs, which saw PE funds garner $1.6 billion in sale proceeds across13 IPOs, was also the highest ever half-yearly value of exits. Sectorally, the technology industry recorded the highest value of exits in H1-21 ($11.8 billion across 11 deals) which is more than the exits recorded by the sector in the preceding eight years combined. “Strategic players see the writing on the wall and are now buying up tech/e-commerce businesses built on the back of PE-VC investments to acquire digital knowhow, talent and data to preserve and increase the value of their traditional businesses,” Vivek Soni, partner and national leader PE services, EY, told TOI. “This, coupled with the rising importance of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), in the eyes of international investors is the main driver of the significant increase in the buyout of tech and renewable energy assets by large strategic players,” he added. A positive response by the markets to the Zomato IPO and the soon-to-follow IPOs by other VC-funded unicorns is also expected to catalyze the investment and exit activity in the Indian startup ecosystem, the IVCA-EY report notes. A possible pandemic resurgence and the Feds response to inflation and a potential spike in commodity prices are a few downside risks that may impact this trend, it adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pe/vc-exits-touch-record-highs-at-23-bn/articleshow/84564979.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Kolkata||NUJS platform to fight sex abuse with Himmat||Kolkata: Students at National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS), Kolkata, have floated a platform, Himmat, to help victims of sexual harassment. The sole platform across 22 national law schools has already got 10 survivors from different campuses, seeking help from counsellors and advisors. These cases are being heard or waiting to be heard by the internal committees of the respective law schools, where the harassment cases took place. In most cases, junior students were allegedly harassed by seniors or even batchmates. While some of the alleged cases took places earlier, when the youngsters attended classes on the campuses, many incidents were reported during the past 16 months, when students have been attending classes online from different locations. The survivors claimed that they were digitally stalked and were sent sexually explicit online material/visuals that include e-mails, WhatsApp messages and phone calls. While internal committees were active in some law school campuses, Himmat founders said, in others, they were present but not active. “Survivors from those campuses have sought our help to push cases through for hearing. These days, physical hearings are not taking place and we are having to depend only on virtual hearings,” said Megha Rana, a fifth-year student at NUJS, who is one of the founder members of Himmat. There are some cases at NUJS, too, which are now being heard virtually. One of them has now moved to the high court. “Sometimes, girl students find it difficult to stand up for their rights and bring up the case to the committee. Even if they are law students and are aware of their legal rights, they are young girls who need a lot of hand-holding. I am happy that our final-year girls have offered such a platform to young victims,” said vice-chancellor of NUJS Nirmal Kanti Chakraborty. Himmat is now launching a handbook, which is a guide for every student at law schools. “They should stop being silent and should know that we are here to help them. We have given all the rules and laws of sexual harassment of students on campus in this handbook. It also gives step-by-step guide on how to reach us and the legal counselling that we can provide,” said Sreeja Sengupta, a final-year student at NUJS and another founder of Himmat. The group of students have already roped in legal counsels, such as Surabhi Dhar and Aakriti Chokhani, both practising lawyers and alumni of NUJS. Other senior counsels who are advising Himmat are Veena Gowda, Adit Pujari, Jawahar Raja and Sonal Mattoo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nujs-platform-to-fight-sex-abuse-with-himmat/articleshow/84564694.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Kochi||Kerala: CPM-ruled Karuvannur co-operative bank secretary, staff siphon off over Rs 100 crore||THRISSUR: A huge loan fraud has been detected in the CPM-ruled Karuvannur Cooperative Service Bank near Irinjalakuda, causing embarrassment to the party which is on a nationwide campaign against the alleged intrusion of the Union government into the cooperative sector. Preliminary estimates indicate that fraudsters who allegedly include bank secretary and other staff, had siphoned off over Rs 100 crore by using the title deeds submitted by the loan applicants as collateral security. Irinjalakuda circle inspector Jijo said the police have registered a case based on the complaint filed by the present bank president, K K Divakaran, and secretary in-charge Sreekala E S. The bank has suspended the secretary, T R Sunilkumar, manager Biju M Kareem and accountant Jils C K. Action has been initiated against three others, Kiran, who was a commission agent, Reji, accountant of the super market and Bijoy, who was also dealer of products like mattress and furniture. According to the complaint, the fraud had taken place at multiple levels. At one level, the fraudsters have taken multiple loans using the collateral submitted by an applicant, who gets only a limited amount. Reports indicate that customers who had applied for smaller loans were found to be having a loan burden of crores of rupees later, the bank sources said. At another level, loans have been availed by overestimating the value of the property surrendered as collateral. Some staff have availed higher loan amounts than permitted by the existing laws. One of the staff members was found to have availed a loan of around Rs 25 crore when law stipulates that staff members can avail only loans less than Rs 50 lakh as housing loan and employees overdraft. The laws also prescribe that the cooperative banks can disburse loans only up to 70% of deposits they have. But in the case of this bank there were occasions when loans of about 110% of the deposits were disbursed. Interestingly, the Karuvannur Cooperative Service Bank was acclaimed as one of the topmost banks in the state in this sector. Its NPA level was also very low and it was making good profits on paper till 2018. But the situation changed after the demonetisation and floods, when the repayments slowed down. Indications of the fraud started emerging during the inspections carried out in this context. Audits conducted later exposed the larger dimensions of the frauds. The customers who had received early hints about the fraud had started withdrawing their deposits, and the bank’s deposits had crashed from Rs 410 crore to Rs 310 crore within a gap of one and a half years, the bank sources said. Joint registrar of the state cooperative department Mohan Mon said steps have been taken to recoup the money lost by auctioning off the properties surrendered as collateral. Asked about the reports that the director board of the bank has been dissolved, he said, “There are some procedures to be followed for taking such actions.” BJP has been quick to seize the opportunity to take on the CPM. Party state secretary A Nagesh said complaints will be sent to Union home minister Amit Shah, who is also handling the newly formed ministry of cooperation. The BJP has also sent complaints to the income tax department and Enforcement Directorate regarding the fraud. Youth Congress district president O J Janeesh has alleged that the fraud could not have taken place without the connivance of the CPM leadership and stern action must be taken against all those involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/karuvannur-co-op-bank-secy-staff-siphon-off-over-rs-100-crore/articleshow/84564658.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Chandigarh||Gang used body language to facilitate cheating in exams: Cops||Chandigarh: In a startling development, it was found that the four-member gang arrested on Sunday had planted its men as in-charge, supervisor or lab attendant at the centre where online Air Force examinations were held. The person stationed at the centre would use body language to give the right answers to the examinee for objective type questions. “If the person put a hand in one pocket, the option was A, if both hands were in the front pockets, it meant option B, if one hand was in the back pocket, it meant option C and if both hands were under the underarms, it meant option D. The stand at ease posture meant turn to the next question,” said an official associated with interrogation of the accused. The moles at the examination centre as well as the candidates who had struck the deal were given special training ahead of exams. Communication was through mobile phones. Those at the centres used bluetooth devices in their ears, the official said. Police expressed surprise at the modus operandi and said that this was the first instance of such a method being used to facilitate cheating in examinations. They said earlier, body language was used in PNDT cases and drugs. A team of the crime investigation agency (CIA) staff headed by Anil Chillar is conducting raids to round up persons deployed at examination centres. One team has started shortlisting candidates who were in touch with gang members before or during the exams. Mobile phones of the accused have been sent to cyber experts for further decoding. In a related development, Panipat police forwarded a copy of the FIR to Air Force headquarters in New Delhi. Further details will be provided to authorities after the police remand and preliminary investigations are over. “As of now, we are in the process of identifying persons who were in touch with this gang for conveying the answers and the candidates who have been benefited by them. This will take a few days and after that, we shall provide complete details to authorities so that they can take their call,’’ said Panipat SP Shashank Kumar Sawan. On Saturday, CIA staff of Panipat headed by inspector Anil Chhilar unearthed the gang of four persons, including history-sheeter Jitender Singh Sangwan and the owner of a coaching centre in Rohtak who helped candidates appear in the entry-level online examinations conducted by Indian Air Force between July 12 and July 18. All the four accused are in police remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gang-used-body-language-to-facilitate-cheating-in-exams-cops/articleshow/84567035.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: MP Diya Kumari pitches for tiger reserve in Kumbhalgarh||JAIPUR: On the very first day of the Monsoon Session in Lok Sabha, Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari put forth the demand for development of Kumbhalgarh as the fifth potential tiger reserve in Rajasthan. Diya said that Kumbhalgarh sanctuary is spread over 1,280sqkm, which is bigger than Sariska and has recorded presence of tigers since 1970s. Speaking under Rule 377 of the Parliament, the MP said that the prey base is sufficient for four tigers in the initial phase and it has capacity to house at least 45 tigers in the coming years. In Ranthambore, the growing tiger population is migrating from protected areas in search of new territory and as a result there is conflict between humans and tigers. The MP added that it is very important to develop new tiger reserves while conserving the existing ones and the process of bringing tigers to Kumbhalgarh should also be accelerated to promote tiger conservation in the country. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) recently had written a letter to Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to conduct a rapid survey of the sanctuary by involving scientists and researchers of project cell. DFO Fateh Singh said, “The WII has sought funds from the NTCA to support the research. The exercise of data collection and field condition will begin soon.” The highlight of the proposed tiger reserve is that there are no revenue villages in the core area. The proposed reserve lies in the districts of Pali, Rajsamand, Udaipur and Ajmer and is located in the oldest range of Aravallis spreading over the tract starting from Khulbrahora (Gujarat) and culminating on Delhi ridge. The forested areas provide habitat to support large carnivores like tiger, leopard, sloth bear, wolf, hyena, wild dog and their prey species such as sambar, chital, four-horned antelope, chinkara, blackbuck, nilgai and wild boar. The draft reads, “To implement this project will require total financial outlay of 6,552.5 lakh for the period of 5 years. Apart from developing soft release enclosure at release site of reintroduced tiger, various habitat development works will be carried out to develop grassland for herbivores. However, these two sanctuaries have sufficient buildings, including forest chowkies, for effective management along with check-post and barriers at required places.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kumbhalgarh-must-be-developed-as-a-tiger-reserve-diya-kumari/articleshow/84567103.cms||---

On July 14, the agency had searched his house in Kannur before issuing a summons asking him to appear before it on Monday. Sources said he was summoned based on the information collected from other accused. Customs has information that Akash had links with Arjun Ayanki, another accused in the case. Thillankery, who has a strong social media presence, claims to be a CPM sympathizer. He had courted controversy through his comments on Facebook (FB) in which he stated that he can’t cosy up to certain leaders of youth organizations who deliberately try to tag him as a person who betrayed the party (CPM). After TV channels flashed his comments as a challenge to CPM, Thillankery claimed on FB that his statements were twisted by the media. Meanwhile, customs filed separate reports before ACJM court (economic offences) Ernakulam on the bail petitions of two accused in the case, Arjun Ayanki and Ajmal V K. Customs submitted in court that Ayanki had used Facebook to attract youths into his fold by picturing himself as an ardent supporter of a political party. “Investigation has further revealed that A2 (Ayanki) is actively involved in smuggling of gold through various airports across Kerala and abducting carriers of other smuggling gangs and threatening them using the names of two convicts sentenced to life imprisonment in a murder case. Investigation is in progress to unearth the veracity of the claims made by A2 (Ayanki) on the role of the said two convicts,” stated the customs report seeking the dismissal of Ayanki’s bail plea. Customs said in the report that during the search at Ayanki’s residence on July 3, officers had recovered some documents which brought out the fact that he was engaged in gold smuggling since 2020. Meanwhile, Malappuram police probing Ramanattukara gold heist bid, purportedly connected to the smuggling case, initiated steps to get permission from the ACJM court in Kochi to question Ayanki. Sarith’s statement recorded: In a separate development, the ACJM court on Monday recorded the confidential statement of Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling case accused P S Sarith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customs-questions-thillankery/articleshow/84564689.cms||---

Ajmer, Kota, Sriganganagar, Churu, Jaipur, Jalore, Jaisalmer, Jhalawar, Jhunjhunu, Dholpur, Pratapgarh, Banswara and Sikar districts have joined the online category. There was a time when land holders had to go to patwar mandal and tehsils for works such as land records, maps and conversion. But after computerisation of land records, it has become very easy due to online availability of records at any time and at any place, according to officials.To implement this multi-purpose programmes with practical success, the revenue department, land management department and registration and stamp department are playing their vital roles separately. In 288 online tehsils, copies of e-signed accounts, khasra girdavari and revenue maps are being issued through e-mitras, while jamabandi (records of rights) is also available online for the public. Under this programme, record rooms maintained in tehsils in the state are being modernised with state-of-the-art facilities and scanning and securing revenue records there. Out of 339 tehsils in the state, work order has been issued for the fourth phase of legacy record scanning for 106 tehsils, while work has been completed in 13 tehsils, said an official. Similarly, scanning of documents already registered in 529 sub-registrar offices of the state was being done and saved on the high technical server of the data centre. Along with the security of the revenue maps, the state government is getting the work of digitisation of khasra maps done for recording the details of account holders and making the record information available online to the owners of land. “E-Dharti” software has been developed by NIC for the availability of revenue records online.

---||Mumbai||400 cars, bikes, autos submerged in Kandivli basement parking lot||MUMBAI: Over 400 cars, motorcycles and autorickshaws were submerged after a BMC basement parking lot near Kandivli’s Thakur Complex was flooded. The fire brigade and civic staff struggled before finally managing to pump out the water close to 48 hours since heavy rains from the early hours of Sunday. The BMC claimed that the 20,000 sq ft parking lot, run by a contractor, had a capacity for around 125 vehicles. Officials said four high-power pumps were deployed to take out around 70 to 80 lakh litres of water on Monday. “There was heavy flow from the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and Thakur village. The 5-ft Asha nullah flows right next to the parking lot building and meets the Poisar river. Since Poisar was already flowing at full capacity, the excess water entered the basement parking,” said deputy municipal commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar. Many reported severely damaged vehicles. “I used to park my car here every night for the last six months. I parked my car here thinking it would be safe in the rains but now the car is totally destroyed. It was submerged fully as there was 12 feet water right up to the ceiling of the underground parking lot. I used to pay Rs 2,000 per month for parking. I’m not even sure if the insurance will pay me back. There is still water and the tyres are still submerged,” said Kandivli resident Shiv Prakash Singh. “The BMC must give us compensation since it was a BMC parking lot. They did not warn us about flooding nor did they close the parking lot. My car was almost brand new and had hardly run for around 15,000km,” Singh said. Local BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar slammed the BMC for poor planning. “The BMC did not stop people from parking inside. This is sheer lack of planning. After I got calls that the parking lot had been flooded, I called BMC chief Iqbal Chahal and asked him to supply the pumps. Only two small pumps were supplied and put into operation. One of the pumps stopped working, so they weren’t able to pump out all the water even till Monday evening,” he said. “The BMC must give compensation to the vehicle owners since their vehicles have been damaged,” he added. Shankarwar said the BMC had drained out all the water by Monday afternoon. “We have now deployed towing vans to get the vehicles out and all the vehicles will be removed.” Watch Watch: BMC pay and park complex completely submerged due to heavy rains in Mumbai's Kandivali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-400-cars-bikes-autos-submerged-in-kandivli-basement-parking-lot/articleshow/84567111.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

If the online classes continue, then he might not be able to clear his exams,” said Rakesh Kumar, elder brother of Rahul.The CWSN is divided into three categories — hearing impaired, visually impaired, and mentally challenged. The state has seven dedicated schools for deaf and dumb students, including one in Jaipur.Bharat Joshi, principal of Seth Anandi Lal Poddar Government Mook Badhir Senior Secondary School has been advocating that the physical classes for at least CWSN students in classes 9-12 should be commenced considering them as a special case. “The online classes offer a limited alternative for these students. If the classes does not resume, it will impact their learning outcome severely,” Joshi said.The school has over 400 students in secondary and senior secondary classes all together making it the biggest school with 710 deaf and dumb students. He said that they have started making a video in sign language in subjects like Hindi, English, and Mathematics. “The only solution to deal with the problem is physical classes in a staggered manner else it will take another two years to fill the vacuum created in 15 months,” Joshi added.K B Kothari, an educationist said that following strict norms, classes for CWSN should be started. “State should carry out a detailed survey on the impact of closure of schools on CWSN. They cannot be treated at par with normal students and the state should develop a fast-paced method to improve their learning outcomes,” said Kothari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kids-with-special-needs-not-able-to-cope-with-online-classes/articleshow/84567113.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Lull goat market ahead of Bakra Eid||JAIPUR: The pandemic has taken away the sheen from goat markets ahead of Bakra Eid for the second consecutive year. The state’s biggest makeshift Bakra Mandi (Goat market) at Transport Nagar here has goats of top breeds but limited buyers. The high-bred goats — Kaithawari, Sirohi and Shekhawati — that usually fetch up to Rs 1 lakh are available for around Rs 50,000 as Eid is just a day away. The pandemic has cast a spell on goat farm owners who had raised only normal goats due to fear of lockdown and poor purchasing power of people. Raising top-breed goats is very expensive since they feed on a special diet from dry fruits to expensive herbs and shrubs. Since the goats are less in the market compared to the pre-pandemic years, the price of normal goats has jumped by 20-30% while the price of high-end goats has gone down. Goat trader Hasan Ali said because of the pandemic, farm owners have spent less on the expensive goats. “The middle class and upper-middle class buy goats in the range of Rs 20,000-40,000 weighing around 30-40kg. Rich people go for goats worth lakhs of rupees,” said Ali, who came to Jaipur from Nagaur. This is the second consecutive year for goat farm owners to suffer losses because of Covid. Buyers who come from nearby districts such as Tonk, Dausa, Sawai Madhopur and Ajmer are also returning disappointed. Syed Shahnawaz Chishty, a priest in Dargah Ajmer who purchases goats every year from Jaipur goat mandi, returned empty-handed last night. “Like the previous year, the goat market is very dull with few goats available of high breed. Since most of the goats are of low breed, I have decided to purchase it from my local mandi,” said Chishty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lull-goat-market-ahead-of-bakra-eid/articleshow/84567120.cms||---

At the same time, the trend of farmers is also increasing towards producing such products. He informed that 90 organic producer groups are registered with Rajasthan State Organic Certification Organization, with which more than 20,000 farmers are associated. These farmers are producing organic grains, organic vegetables, organic spices and organic fruits, but they find it difficult to find buyers to sell their produce. To get rid of this problem, ‘Raj Kisan Organic’ mobile app has been developed to provide an online platform to the farmer and the consumer.Kataria said that by registering on this app, producers and traders-consumers can interact, buy and sell their produce. Farmers can register themselves by downloading this app from Google Play Store and sell their products by bargaining with registered buyers on the app. In this, both individual and group certified farmers can get themselves registered. So far, 160 farmers and 29 buyers have been registered on this app.The state government has been making continuous efforts to promote organic farming and to make it easy to buy and sell. In this sequence, organic product sales promotion site was started by the Agricultural Management Institute located at Durgapura in Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/agri-dept-launches-raj-kisan-organic-app/articleshow/84567132.cms||---

Mantry claimed on various websites and in the media that “Autism is caused by various reasons like deep-rooted anxiety and nervous, emotional, and mental breakdown. There is also no full-proof test for identifying the disease in people. We conducted comprehensive research on it and arrived at the conclusion that autism can be cured 100% without medicine”. Several activists under the aegis of national platform for rights of the disabled have filed a petition with the Maharashtra state medical council seeking action against him. “We have decided to report this to the authorities concerned,” said Seema Lal of Kochi-based NGO TogetherWeCan whose PIL in Kerala high court saw the state issuing guidelines for therapy centres in Kerala. The petition said, “As you are aware, the claims made by Mantry who at times uses various titles and designations, including that of a “Life Coach” are not backed by scientific/medical evidence. Such dubious claims undermine all the work that is ongoing towards empowering families of autistic children and working towards their rights.” “It is such misleading claims that push the families of autistic children into further vulnerability and block their agency. It neither empowers nor enables their journeys... ,” the petition said. Mantry also claims that the said cure is possible within two to three years of his treatment which costs Rs 50-60 lakh, which is nothing but exploitation,the activists said. “There is a need for awareness on the condition. There are doctors in this state who claim to treat autism. Initially, every parent will look for a treatment solution but soon we realise that these children need to be trained and prepared for daily life,” said Sivadas A K, secretary, Autism Club, Thiruvananthapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/health-consultants-claims-on-treating-autism-draw-flak/articleshow/84564730.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Two other children in the family were rescued by neighbours and escaped with minor injuries. Santosh Kadam, chief at Thane regional disaster management cell, said the dead were Prabhu Yadav (45), a mathadi worker in Turbhe, his wife Vidyawati (40) and their three children aged between three and 12 years. Two other daughters of the couple were rescued by neighbours and admitted to Kalwa Chhatrapati Shivaji Memorial hospital. The incident took place around 1pm when the muck on the slopes turned into a torrent and merged with the streams flowing on the hill to come crashing down. This is the third such landslide-related tragedy in Mumbai region in the last 48 hours – torrential rains have caused heavy casualties in shanty settlements along slopes of hills dotting the city and its outskirts. Two of the huts were completely buried in the mire, trapping the Yadavs, while those in neighbouring dwellings escaped, said activist Arvind More, one of the first to reach the site. Rescuers had to trek 500 metres uphill to reach the spot. Since earthmovers could not be taken up, rescue teams had to manually excavate the bodies from the wet mud. “Heavy rains and the hill slope made it difficult for our staff to conduct the rescue operation,” said Girish Jhalke, chief fire officer at the Thane brigade. Two hours before the tragedy, the family had been advised to relocate. “I had spoken to my brother two hours back and asked him to come downhill and stay at my hut for the next few days as it was raining heavily but he didn’t heed my request,” said a teary-eyed Avdhesh, elder brother of the deceased Prabhu. Local NCP corporator Varsha More and some activists said authorities had failed to take any pre-emptive action. “It seems they were waiting for a major disaster to happen,” said a local resident. Cabinet minister and MLA Jitendra Awhad, who represents the area, said he had asked the forest department to remove shanties on the slopes. “A wall was to be built barricading the forest area but the work never took off,” he said. A Rs 5 lakh payment to the kin of the deceased was also announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-day-after-tragedies-in-mum-family-of-5-die-in-landslide-at-parsik-hills/articleshow/84567143.cms||Manoj Badgeri

While it was around 500 MT before DCT was launched, it went over 700 MT in June, although no international cargo is being brought or sent due to the pandemic. The state-of-the-art cargo terminal being operated by AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Limited (AAICLAS), a subsidiary of AAI, is the biggest in north India apart from Delhi. This is the third-largest DCT developed by AAICLAS apart from Kolkata and Chennai. The cargo terminal will also start international operations once the pandemic situation improves, claimed officials. During June, 730 MT of cargo was recorded at the terminal out of which 429 MT was out-bound. In May, cargo movement was of 534 MT. Officials claimed that over the last few years, cargo circulation increased manifold. In 2014-15, 9,265 MT of cargo was handled, which increased to 17,680 MT in 2019-20. The domestic airlines handling cargo are Air Asia, Go First, Indigo Air, SpiceJet and Air India.

---||Mumbai||Ward staff, collector, disaster cell knew about Vikhroli risk||MUMBAI: Sunday’s landslide that killed 10 people on a slope abutting LBS Road in Vikhroli has not come as a surprise to the city and state authorities as they had communicated about the risk as recently as last month. No action could be taken before a tragedy took its toll on squatters on the collector’s land. After the 10 people died in their sleep in the Surya Nagar slums, the BMC shifted about 30 vulnerable residents to a civic school in the vicinity on Monday. But it could be too little, too late. The entire slum belt along the hilly areas of Vikhroli and Powai is occupied by close to 60,000 people, including about 40,000 on the Vikhroli side and 20,000 in Powai. BMC’s S ward authorities had written to the suburban collector and the civic disaster management cell in May and June this year about the possibility of landslides after heavy rain in the hilly areas of Vikhroli, Bhandup and Powai. The ward has a population of nine lakh, of which around three lakh live along these landslide-prone areas, said officials. In the June 7 letter to the suburban collector, the ward office had pointed out the threat posed by heavy rain and sought alternatives. “Rains are coming close and there should be no loss to life or property. Hence, there is a need for alternative arrangements to be made,” it said. Officials in the office of Milind Borikar, collector of Mumbai suburban district, said it’s the BMC’s responsibility to try and prevent and remove encroachments, irrespective of the land title. The S ward also wrote to the disaster management authorities, with a stark subject line, ‘Disastrous situation along hilly areas i.e. west side of LBS road in S ward’ — a copy of the letter is with TOI — saying the west side of LBS road, from Sonapur junction to Vikrohli station road junction, is a hilly area with dense slum population. There is no proper access to the area for fire brigade trucks, other heavy machinery for demolishing dilapidated buildings or ambulances in case of emergency. “The population in these slum pockets is so huge that relocating them is a question mark. The population and access issues led to rescue operations being hampered.” said a senior ward official. But a senior official from BMC’s disaster management cell said it was the ward’s responsibility to draw out a disaster management plan based on a template already given to them. “We finally relocated 30 people, whose homes were damaged, but on Monday they left the municipal shelter saying they would will prefer to live with their relatives,” said the ward official. Amid this buck-passing, activists also highlighted the age-old problem of lack of coordination among the agencies, even within the civic body. Activist Anil Galgali said the authorities should act when the structures are coming up. “Every authority knows that these are illegal and action can be taken against them, but no one wants to initiate action. Passing of the buck following such incidents is only becoming increasingly common with each agency wanting to shift the blame upon another,” said Galgali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ward-staff-collector-disaster-cell-knew-about-vikhroli-risk/articleshow/84567196.cms||Richa Pinto

Except a few dams in the state, majority of them are merely filled up to 15 to 25 per cent of their capacities. Bisalpur Dam that caters to drinking water needs of the districts including Jaipur, Tonk and Ajmer is merely 24 per cent filled and its catchment areas are still awaiting good spell of monsoon. “Against full capacity of 1085.94 M cusec metres, the current water level of the dam is 262.57 M cusec metres, which translates to 23.96 per cent. It still needs heavy monsoon in its catchment areas such as Rajsamand, Chittorgarh and Ajmer,” said a senior engineer at Bisalpur dam. Simiarly, other dams including Jawai Dam (Pali), Mahi Dam (Banswara), Parvati Dam (Dholpur) and others are waiting for good rainfall. “The first two spells of the southwest monsoon since June 19 have not been fruitful for the dams. The revival of the monsoon since Sunday has brought good amount of rainfall. Some of the dams have started getting water. Hope this spell continues for next couple of days,” said an officer with the water resources department. Dams which have seen good amount of rainwater include Rana Pratap Sagar (Chittorgarh), Kota Barrage (Kota ) and Jawahar Sagar (Kota). “These dams have received good amount of water thus they are 70 to 95 per cent filled to their capacity presently. They might attain 100 per cent level when administration might think of releasing excess water,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/water-reservoirs-and-dams-still-filled-just-up-to-25-of-their-capacities-except-some/articleshow/84567181.cms||Ashish Mehta

The council has demanded that the government should clarify if the RTI Act is applicable in state or not. If it is not applicable, the government should frame an appropriate law that would state that information need not be given out based on RTI Act. Punishing officials for giving information under the act is lawlessness, said office-bearers of the action council. The council said that the order withdrawing the good service entry of deputy secretary Salini OG should be withdrawn immediately and Jayathilak should be transferred from the post in order to revive the confidence of officials who work, adhering to laws. Jayathilak had issued an order on Thursday, cancelling the good service entry of Salini, citing that the integrity of the officer is doubtful. “Facts that have been brought to the light subsequently from a preliminary inquiry and examination of certain files clearly show that her integrity is not beyond doubt,” the order issued on Thursday had said, which then said that her good service entry is being cancelled. It was on April 1 2021, that another order was issued by Jayathilak giving her a good service entry by saying that Salini OG ‘was an inspiration, the right guide and good superior officer for the assistants as a section officer’. On July 7, Salini was also forced to avail leave for two months, reportedly after being admonished by higher-ups. Meanwhile, another order was issued by Jayathilak on Monday that modified the earlier order, cancelling her good service entry. In the new order that changed minor wordings of the previous order, it has been said that it is the government that is cancelling the good service entry of the officer and not the revenue secretary. The action council demanded that another additional secretary J Bency, also the president of pro-UDF Kerala Secretariat Association (KSA) and the convener of secretariat action council who was shunted out to a post outside the Secretariat, be reinstated in the Secretariat. He was transferred as the secretary of state farmers’ debt relief commission. The council had planned a protest outside the secretariat annex that houses revenue department. But, Cantonment police had refused permission citing a programme by the CM at Central stadium. The protest was then held on MG Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/council-seeks-revenue-secys-transfer/articleshow/84564859.cms||---
---||India||Stormy start to session: PM Modi unable to introduce new ministers||NEW DELHI: With opposition sloganeering preventing the introduction of newly inducted ministers in the Lok Sabha Monday, PM Modi hit back at BJP’s political rivals, saying certain people are not ready to stomach that a large number of farmers, Dalits, adivasis, women and those from backward castes have been included in his council of ministers. The PM said it would have been a matter of happiness had the induction of ministers from less privileged backgrounds been greeted, but some people are not ready to appreciate their progress. Later, defence minister Rajnath Singh objected to the uproar and said this was the first time he had seen a Prime Minister not being allowed to introduce his new ministers. Opposition leaders like Congress’s Manish Tewari disputed the claim and said former PM Manmohan Singh had faced similar hurdles in Parliament. “In my last 24 years of parliamentary life, I have not seen a single instance where the PM could not introduce his council of ministers. It is sad, unfortunate and most unhealthy,” Singh said in the Lok Sabha. The House was adjourned till 2pm as Congress MPs continued slogan shouting even after repeated warnings of the Speaker. The House was adjourned again and resumed at 3.30 and after a few minutes was adjourned for the day. Modi’s focus on the social background of his new team was in keeping with BJP’s plan to highlight the increase in the representation for non-upper caste sections. Earlier, in his initial remarks before the start of the session, the PM urged all MPs and parties to ask the most difficult and sharpest questions but also allow the government to respond in a disciplined environment. Modi said this would boost democracy, strengthen people’s trust and improve pace of development. The PM said he has urged all floor leaders to take time out on Tuesday evening as he would like to provide detailed information regarding the pandemic. “We want discussion inside Parliament as well with the floor leaders outside,” the PM said, responding to criticism that he should not speak in the Parliament annexe. Modi said, “I hope all of you have been vaccinated at least once. But even then, I pray to all of you and my colleagues in the House to cooperate in following corona protocols. Vaccine is given in ‘baahu’ (arms) and those who take it become ‘Baahubali’. The only way to become Baahubali in the fight against corona is to get vaccinated.” He said over 40 crore people have become ‘Baahubalis’. “It (vaccine drive) is being taken forward rapidly. The pandemic has gripped the entire world, the entire human race. Therefore, we want meaningful debates in the Parliament over the pandemic. It should be given the highest priority so that we get all the practical suggestions from all the honorable MPs so that there can be a lot of innovation in the fight against the pandemic. If there are some shortcomings, then they can be rectified and we can move forward together in this fight,” Modi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stormy-start-to-session-pm-modi-unable-to-introduce-new-ministers/articleshow/84570400.cms||---

The agreement was signed last week by Rajat Kumar Mishra, additional secretary of the department of economic affairs under the ministry of finance, additional chief secretary (finance department) Rajesh Kumar Singh and country director of WB (India)Junaid Ahmad. The Resilient Kerala Program will focus on two key areas. First, it will incorporate disaster risk planning in the master plans of urban and local self-governments to ease financial constraints on the state government when faced with unexpected shocks. Second, it will help make the health, water resources management, agriculture and road sectors more resilient to calamities. The program is part of a programmatic series of the bank-financed operations in the state. The first Resilient Kerala Development Policy Operation (DPO) approved in June 2019 had undertaken several initiatives. It had helped the state draft a river basin conservation and management act, which will conserve and regulate water resources and ensure their sustainable management, allocation and utilization. It had also introduced climate-resilient agriculture, risk-informed land use and disaster management planning. The program laid the foundations for a five-year state partnership framework. The support to key sectors under the program include sustainable fiscal and debt management through establishing a debt management unit in the finance department to support the state’s efforts to scale down its debt-to-GSDP ratio to a sustainable trajectory, providing timely and adequate assistance to vulnerable households, disaster and climate-resilient urban development, create resilient public health systems, ensure an integrated and sustainable water resources management, ensure sustainable and resilient food systems and create a climate-resilient road infrastructure. The loan for reconstruction and development (IBRD) has a final maturity of 14 years, including a grace period of six years. “The objective is not to finance schemes but partner with the government of Kerala to improve the state’s financial health and address natural disasters, climate change and pandemic risks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/wb-sanctions-125m-loan-to-state/articleshow/84564924.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Non-sporting events take a toll on Greenfield Stadium||Thiruvananthapuram: After the Army recruitment rally and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s election rally, Greenfield Stadium at Kariavattom has lost all its glory. Now, the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) says that they would need an additional Rs 60 lakh to bring back the stadium to its past grandeur. The KCA’s annual expenditure in maintaining the field of play is Rs 1 crore, but now after holding non-sporting events, the ground has been completely destroyed. The association needs to raise another Rs 60 lakh besides the annual maintenance cost to make it ready for the games. The ground of India’s first fully eco-friendly stadium, which is the sole venue in the state for hosting international cricket matches has been covered with undergrowth and weeds. Also, the much-appreciated drainage system of the ground is fully damaged and cracks have developed in pipelines too. KCA had signed an agreement with the operators of the stadium, Kariavattom Sports Facilities Ltd (KSFL) four years ago and according to the agreement KCA is in charge of maintaining the ground of the stadium. Though the agreement is valid till 2027, KCA had withdrawn from the agreement with KSFL following the latter’s nod to conduct the Indian Army’s recruitment rally in the stadium, which is a clear violation of the agreement. “We had approached the officials concerned then, to cancel the permission to conduct non-sporting activities in the stadium. But our attempts went in vain. We withdrew from the agreement and after that, we haven’t taken any steps to maintain the play area. In fact, after three matches, the stadium was raised to the status of a world-class stadium. But the present situation is pathetic. We have to relay the entire grass apart from the damage caused to the drainage system”, said KCA vice-president Jaffer Sait. It will take three to four months to set the ground ready for the games. Now, KCA has sought the government to intervene in the matter and to initiate necessary steps to put an end to the holding of activities and events that are not related to sports. According to KCA secretary Sreejith V Nair, they would pursue the maintenance of the ground only after receiving an assurance from the government that the stadium will not be a venue for non-sporting activities anymore. Meanwhile, owing to the pathetic condition of the stadium, the BCCI has avoided the state from hosting international matches now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/non-sporting-events-take-a-toll-on-greenfield-stadium/articleshow/84564932.cms||---

Congress decided to intensify its fight and move court seeking a probe into the alleged “scam of Rs 1,000 crore in the land auction” conducted by the state government recently. Congress would also submit to the Centre and CBI evidence of land parcels being auctioned at a less price than the market value to firms, allegedly close to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s family or connected with the ruling TRS, causing a loss of at least Rs 1,000 crore to the government. “If the NDA government does not order a CBI probe or no other serious action is taken, we will go to the court seeking cancellation of land auction and a probe into the suspected scam,” Revanth Reddy told mediapersons. Revanth, who is also Malkajgiri MP, shot off a letter to the Lok Sabha speaker stating that police were not allowing him to go to airport to fly to Delhi to attend the Parliament session. “Is Kokapet located outside India that we were not allowed to visit the site. This only reflects how the TRS government is suppressing any attempt to expose its corruption,” he alleged. However, police clarified that the MP was told he was free to go to Delhi and that they stopped him only from going to Kokapet land auction site to prevent any untoward incident. TRS leaders denied the charge of any irregularity in land auctions and said the entire bidding process was transparent. Revanth alleged that KCR was meting out injustice to 260 Dalit families, who were given land pattas in and around Kokapet by the previous Congress governments in the combined state. “CM KCR wants to implement Dalita Bandhu scheme in Huzurabad by the money raised from Kokapet land auction. The government should inform people what happened to the land pattas of 260 Dalit families,” Revanth demanded, and threw a challenge at the government to book any number of cases against him if his allegations were proved wrong. Apart from Revanth Reddy, police did not allow CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, TPCC working president T Jayaprakash Reddy, former minister Mohd Ali Shabbir, Youth Congress leader Anil Kumar Yadav and others to proceed towards Kokapet. AICC in-charge of Telangana and MP from Tamil Nadu, Manickam Tagore condemned the house arrest of Revanth and said he would raise the issue in Parliament. However, several Congress activists managed to reach the Kokapet land site and planted party flags. Police took them into custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-put-under-house-arrest-cops-foil-kokapet-visit/articleshow/84569315.cms||Roushan Ali

It was one-and-half years ago that the roads had been dug up for sewage purposes. SHRC chairperson Justice Antony Dominic has asked the managing director of the water authority and the Thiruvananthapuram municipal secretary to examine the complaint and to submit a detailed report which also includes the solutions to the issue within four weeks. The case will be considered only after receiving the report. The roads have turned out to be death traps by causing obstruction to the movement of ambulances and tankers carrying drinking water. The sewage works were initiated as part of the government’s Amrut scheme. Manholes similar to wells have been constructed in different parts of the road. The work has been delayed owing to the negligence of the water authority officials. Also, many residents have relocated to rented houses in the city as they find it impossible to use the roads which have turned muddy. It has been a long time since the supply of drinking water has been disrupted in the area. Not even 25% of the sewage works have been completed yet. Also, the potholes in the middle of Uloor-Akkulam Road create traffic jam and shops cannot be opened due to dust. The action was initiated on the complaint filed by former municipal councillor G S Sreekumar and locals Deepak C and Pradeep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bad-roads-rights-panel-files-case-against-kwa/articleshow/84564982.cms||---

At a press conference in Kochi on Monday, the office-bearers of the academy said a group of Youth Congress workers damaged the cartoons and other valuable things at the venue and created a tense situation. A group of Youth Congress workers barged into the venue and destroyed cartoons and other materials citing that the organizers failed to pay tribute to late cartoonist Ibrahim Badusha. But the academy office-bearers said that the academy had already conducted an online meet to honour the late cartoonist. Varappoottu, a two-day cartoon workshop, was organized for creating awareness on the fight against Covid third wave. Justice Kurian Joseph inaugurated the programme jointly organized by Bengaluru region of the National Institute of Public Corporation and Child Development, Kerala Social Security Mission and DMCI, a Delhi-based NGO.

---||Goa||Goa board’s 30:30:40 formula yields 99.4% results in Class XII||PANAJI: The Goa Board on Monday declared that 18,085 students cleared their higher secondary school certificate, with a pass percentage of 99.4%. With only 75 students flunking, 2021’s pass percentage is over 10% more than last year’s result. Those who failed are eligible for another opportunity by appearing for the supplementary exam to be held soon. Other than the 75 students who did not clear, the results of 35 candidates have been placed in ‘reserve category’ due to non-submission of eligibility documents or internal practical marks. With the Class XII public exam for 2021 cancelled due to the pandemic, the Board had adopted a CBSE-like 30:30:40 evaluation formula for students. The scheme saw weightage being given to the students’ performance in Class X, XI and in the internal assessments carried out by schools in Class XII. Result committees of individual schools tabulated the results, which saw students’ pass percentage drastically rise over 2020 in the subjects of mathematics, chemistry, economics and history. This helped push the overall pass percentage from 89.3% in 2020 to 99.4% in 2021. “Moderation of marks has been carried out so that the subject average scored by students is in line with the individual schools’ historical performance at Class XII board exams,” said Goa Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye. The percentage of students to clear mathematics offered for science and arts stream students jumped to 99.8% this year, over 87.2% in 2020, when a Class XII public exam was last held. The other big jump in pass percentage was seen in the subjects of chemistry, economics and history, which saw over 99% students clear the subjects as against around 92% in 2020. Besides the higher number of students passing, a majority (or over 60% of Class XII students) also registered good scores in Class XII this year, securing either a first class or a distinction. If any student is not satisfied with their result, they will be given an opportunity to appear for an exam conducted by the board when the pandemic situation is conducive, said Shetye. Once students appear for the board exam, they will forfeit the marks allotted by schools through the 30:30:40 evaluation formula, he said. Higher number of girls, 9,187, as compared to 9,008 boys, had registered for Class XII this year, with the girls also recording a better pass percentage of 99.7% as against 99% for boys. Across the streams, the best pass percentage of 99.7% was recorded by science stream students, with only five students not clearing Class XII. In the commerce stream, 99.6% students cleared the class, with 12 not making the cut. Arts saw 99.4% pass and 22 not clearing in the evaluation. The highest number of 36 could not clear Class XII in the vocational stream, which had a pass percentage of 98.5%. “There will be no policy for verification of marks, to provide photocopy of answer books, or re-evaluation this year, as the assessment has been done by the schools,” Shetye said. The National skill qualification framework (NSQF) helped 1,103 students clear Class XII. Under the scheme, students can opt for a seventh subject like logistics management, agriculture, etc. A student has to clear any six of seven subjects to pass the class. The Class XII results pertain to 106 higher secondary schools affiliated to Goa Board across the state, of which nine are government run, 92 are aided and five are unaided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/303040-formula-yields-goa-board-99-4-pass-percentage-in-class-xii/articleshow/84567330.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Dehradun||‘Chamoli most seismically active zone in Uttarakhand Himalayas’||DEHRADUN: Scientists have identified a 2,291 sq km area in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district as the “most seismically active zone in Uttarakhand Himalayas” after they found that it had the highest density of earthquakes and landslides over the study period of eight years. The flash floods in February that killed 200 people in Chamoli had also occurred in an area within this zone. Researchers at the Dehradun-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) studied the Main Central Thrust (MCT) zone, a 2,200 km-long geological fault along the Himalayan belt which demarcates the lesser Himalayas from the higher Himalayas. The zone has been touted as the “geographically weakest” part of the Himalayas since all earthquake-related activity in the Himalayas have happened in and around a 10km periphery of MCT, according to scientists. For the study, researchers looked at the part of MCT which fell in Uttarakhand, a total area of 19,000 sq km. The study, published in Current Science journal, analysed data of earthquakes and landslides in the region between July 2007 and October 2015. Data from seismographs was collected to study earthquakes while landslide data was procured by high resolution satellite images as well as images on the Google Earth platform. The study found 2,260 earthquakes of magnitude ranging between 1.5 and 5.1 in the study area. Among these, 769 tremors were of magnitude ranging between 1.5 and 2.0, 1,335 between 2.1 and 3.0, 129 between 3.1 and 4.0 and 27 between 4.1 and 5.0. The data highlighted that smaller earthquakes of magnitude less than 3.0 — which were leading to frequent landslides — were “clustered” in certain areas. So scientists categorised them into three main clusters: Uttarkashi earthquake rupture zone (3,179 sq km), Chamoli earthquake rupture zone (2,291 sq km) and Munsyari zone cluster (4,220 sq km). These clusters were further studied. The Uttarkashi earthquake rupture zone — which had witnessed a massive earthquake in 1991 that had claimed over 700 lives — had recorded 145 earthquakes and 300 landslides during the study period. The Munsyari cluster recorded 269 earthquakes and 401 landslides. The Chamoli earthquake rupture zone, which had recorded a massive earthquake in 1999 and flash floods in February this year, had witnessed 328 earthquakes. “Our study found that the Chamoli earthquake zone was the most seismically active zone in Uttarakhand Himalayas,” Vikram Gupta, lead author and senior scientist at WIGH, told TOI. Study co-author and senior scientist Ajay Paul added that certain factors in the Chamoli zone showed it had more stress accumulated around it over the years compared with other clusters which was resulting in frequent tremors. The zone also had the highest landslide density, in other words, the number of landslides divided by the area. “The Chamoli zone, at 2,291 sq km, had the lowest area among all clusters but had recorded 313 landslides — a landslide density of 53% compared with Munsyari cluster which had a landslide density of 37%,” Gupta said. Researchers said that further construction in the area should be avoided to prevent tragedies. “No hydropower plants or construction activity should be planned in this area. Existing hydro projects should be intensively monitored,” Gupta said. The flash floods in Chamoli earlier this year had caused major damage to two hydropower plants — Rishiganga and NTPC’s Tapovan-Vishnugad hydro power – in the region. Over 70 people had died in the calamity while more than 130 were reported missing. The state government had later issued a notification that people missing in the disaster would be ‘presumed dead’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chamoli-where-flash-floods-killed-200-in-feb-most-seismically-active-zone-in-ukhand-himalayas-study/articleshow/84562559.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Senior IPS officer R S Praveen Kumar seeks retirement amid buzz of joining politics||HYDERABAD: Senior IPS officer and secretary of Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TSWREIS) R S Praveen Kumar on Monday sought voluntary retirement, six years before his scheduled retirement. Praveen Kumar, known for bringing about a radical change in the educational system of social welfare and tribal schools of Telangana, served the state for 26 years. An officer of additional director general of police rank, Praveen Kumar held various positions including joint commissioner of Hyderabad police, deputy commissioner of police, detective department etc. Soon after his announcement on social media, political and academic circles were rife with speculation about the 1995 batch officer joining politics. Some even claimed that the senior IPS will be TRS’ face in the ensuing Huzurabad bypoll. This, even as Praveen Kumar denied any such move. In his letter addressed to colleagues and well-wishers, he maintained that he was stepping down to pursue his “passion for social justice and equality”. “I shall use the rest of my life to fulfil the unfinished dreams of doyens of social justice Mahatma Phule couple, Babasaheb Dr BR Ambedkar, Manyawar Kanshiram and many more torch-bearers of our country,” Praveen Kumar wrote on Twitter, after mailing his request for VRS to the chief secretary. Academics TOI spoke to expressed their unhappiness over Praveen Kumar’s decision saying it would be better if he remained in service and help students from the downtrodden sections.“If he is considered as the TRS candidate from the region (Huzurabad), he will attract all Dalit votes,” said a source recalling how during his tenure as SP of erstwhile Karimnagar district, the officer introduced ‘Ma ooriki randi, ma tho ne undadi’, a programme aimed at encouraging government teachers to stay in villages (their work place) in Huzurabad, Husnabad, among others places. “In case he is not given ticket from Huzurabad, it is speculated that the ‘Dalita Bandhu’ scheme will be run under his leadership,” the academician, familiar with the IPS officer’s work, added. During his nine years with the social welfare department, Praveen Kumar focused on quality education that changed the lives of several children belonging to socially backward classes. Not such studies, he encouraged these students to take up sports too — horse-riding, archery, sailing etc. As a result, several students from these schools flourished and brought accolades to the country in various fields.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sr-ips-officer-seeks-retirement-amid-buzz-of-joining-politics/articleshow/84569338.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Partagal mutt peethadish, Shrimad Vidyadhiraj Teerth Shripad Vader, passes away at 76||MARGAO: Shrimad Vidyadhiraj Teerth Shripad Vader Swami, the peethadhish or chief pontiff of the Shree Shree Sansthan Gokarn Partagali Jeevottam Mutt, Partagal, died on Monday of a cardiac arrest. Announcing the 76-year-old’s death, president of the central committee of the Partagal mutt, Shrinivas Dempo, said that the swami’s mahanirvan occurred at 12.45pm on the mutt premises. The samadhi rituals of the seer were conducted on Monday under the guidance of disciple-swami Vidyadheesh Teerth. Shree Sansthan Gokarn Partagali Jeevottam Mutt is a prominent spiritual order of the Goud Saraswat Brahmin (GSB) community spread over Goa, Karnataka and Kerala, and Vidyadhiraj Teerth Swami was highly revered by his followers, disciples and devotees from the community. Born in the family of the Acharyas, known for their authority on the dharma shastra and related matters in Gangoli, in Udupi district of Karnataka, Shripad Vader Swami’s birth name was Raghavendra Acharya. He was initiated into the sanyasi order and conferred the sanyas deeksha by his predecessor, Dwarkanath Teerth Swami, at Shri Ram Mandir, Wadala, Mumbai. Upon the mahaparinirvan of his guru on March 25, 1973, Shripad Wader Swami ascended the Gurupeetha on April 5, 1973 and at the age of 29, became the 23rd pontiff of the guru parampara of Shree Gokarn Partagali Jeevottam Mutt, guiding his followers scattered across the country and abroad. Known for his erudition, discipline and devotion, Shripad Vader Swami’s pilgrimages took him far and wide — from the snow-capped Himalayas to the serene shores of Rameshwaram and Kanyakumari. Shripad Vader Swami has been hailed among his devotees as an exceptional pathfinder and credited with several distinctions in his spiritual endeavours. During his Chaturmas at Badarika Ashram in 1986, the swami observed ‘mouna vrita’ (complete silence for all 24 hours) for 30 days, and on the concluding day undertook ‘kashta mouna vrita’ (not even making signs or gestures). Thereafter, he undertook numerous pilgrimages including the Ashta Maha Khetra, Chaturdham, Shatapuri, Varanasi, Kaipavasgat Prayas, etc. However, the seer’s Gandaki Yatra is considered to be the most noteworthy of all, a reference to which was made by Karnataka MLA R V Deshpande in his condolence message. “The Gandaki yatra of Swamiji is a milestone in the community for centuries together and would act as a deepstambha for the younger generation,” Deshpande said. Located in the Himalayan range amidst snow-covered peaks, Gandaki lies 23,000 feet above sea level. Writing in a booklet containing the biographical sketch of the Swami, the late Chandrakant Keni said that the achievements of the swami since he assumed the seat of the Gurupeeth were “multitude in number and diverse in quality and nature.” “Renovation and reconstruction of the temples falling within the jurisdiction of the Mutt, installation of new idols wherever necessary, revival and rejuvenation of the traditional feats and festivals were undertaken. Yagyas, anushtanas were performed to strengthen the faith of the common man and to infuse devotion to family deities and Gurupeethas. Observing Chaturmas Vrita at far and near places, accessible to the followers settled in remote areas and spending the entire period with them was another annual activity,” Keni wrote in the booklet published in 2005. Speaking to TOI in August 2017, the Swami, exuding pride in the four centuries-long history of Gokarn Partagali Jeevottam mutt that saw an unhindered lineage of 23 mathadhipatis, said that the mutt was the “emblem of Saraswat identity” and had “proved to be a rallying point for the unification of the Vaishnav community” where they regularly turn to for solace and advice in matters, both worldly and spiritual. In September 2017, Shripad Vader Swami anointed Uday Bhat Sharma to be his successor and named him Vidyadheesh Teerth Shripad Vader Swami. Partagal mutt sources said that 26-year old Vidyadheesh Teerth Swami will take over the reins of the mutt at the Peetharohan ceremony to be held shortly. PM Narendra Modi, CM Pramod Sawant, opposition leader Digambar Kamat paid rich tributes to the seer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/partagal-swami-passes-away-at-76/articleshow/84567393.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan former CM Vasundhara Raje’s personal secretary’s name surfaces in snoopgate||JAIPUR: The name of former chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s personal secretary surfacing in the list of 300 verified Indian numbers targeted for surveillance during 2017-19 by the Isreal-based NSO group has again made it clear that all’s not well between Raje and the high command. Monday’s revelation has yet again shifted the focus on Raje’s equation with PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. The phone number of the PS, reportedly based out of Delhi, was targeted at a time the state was gearing up for the state assembly polls in December 2018. The election was fought under the leadership of Raje and this was the time her problems with the central leaders over the election strategy and selection of candidates surfaced out in the open. The defeat in the state polls further soured the relations with the central leaders. It touched a new low during the Lok Sabha polls when the BJP election in-charge Prakash Javadekar had forged an alliance with Hanuman Beniwal, a vocal critic of Raje. Repeated rumours of her breaking away with the party have jittered the central leaders. “In the given situation, it was very important to pre-empt accurately what was running in the mind of Raje. If at all the snoop gate is true, it would have helped the party in maintaining a check on Raje’s move,” said a source. TOI spoke to Raje’s Delhi based PS about his name potentially appeared on the list. He said, “I am not sure about this development during 2017-19. I have heard that Whatsapp had alerted whose numbers were targeted but in my case, nobody contacted throughout.” TOI spoke to close aides of Raje said they had a strong feeling of their phones being under surveillance, but never came across any strong evidence. “It is true that we have made a habit of changing our phones frequently to eliminate chances of any snooping,” said Raje’s close aide. Till last reports came in, Raje didn’t react to the development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajes-personal-secretarys-name-surfaces-in-snoopgate/articleshow/84567366.cms||---
---||Dehradun||HC directs police to not take coercive action against BJP MLA accused of rape||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday directed the police to not take any “coercive action” against BJP MLA from Haridwar’s Jwalapur constituency, Suresh Rathore, in the FIR filed against him where he has been accused of raping a woman party worker. The FIR was registered earlier this month after the woman approached the magistrate saying that the police had not taken note of her pleas. The single judge bench of Justice N S Dhanik held that it is undisputed that the FIR has been filed two and half years after the alleged incident and that “it is also undisputed that the petitioner (Rathore) had lodged an FIR against the complainant and her husband, who were sent to judicial custody in connection with that FIR and after their release from the jail after bail”, the complaint was made before the magistrate and then the FIR was filed. The court, therefore, said, “Till the next date of listing, no coercive step shall be taken against the petitioner pursuant to the impugned FIR.” It also directed Rathore to cooperate in the investigation. The court has now listed the case for further hearing after three weeks. The woman had alleged that she met Rathore around two and half years ago for some work. The MLA then asked her to join the women’s wing of the party. After several meetings, Rathore allegedly raped her and threatened to make her intimate videos viral if she disclosed the alleged crime to anyone. He also allegedly threatened to get her children killed if she revealed the alleged crime to anyone. Rathore’s counsel, Aditya Pratap Singh, meanwhile contended the allegations saying the alleged incident is two and half years old and no precise date or time has been mentioned in the FIR. He added that the criminal proceeding against the MLA is “maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused”. Meanwhile, as reported by TOI earlier, the division bench of the HC last week also granted police protection to the woman observing that incidents are not wanting where the complainants in such cases have faced harassment and even been killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-directs-police-to-not-take-coercive-action-against-bjp-mla-accused-of-rape/articleshow/84562584.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Nashik||Nashik receives 11.2mm rain in 24 hours, highest in 20 days||NASHIK: The city received brief spells of showers in the night intervening Sunday and Monday. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) observatory at Nashik recorded 11.2mm rain between 8.30am on Sunday and the same time on Monday. This is highest rainfall in the city in the past 20 days. Incidentally, this was also the third-highest rainfall this season after 27.3mm of rainfall recorded on June 20 and 23.5mm on June 1. Most of the rainfall took place at night as during the day on Sunday, the observatory had recorded only 3.1mm rain. The district administration pointed out that the Igatpuri taluka received 222mm rain on Sunday night. The incessant rain in the region was the primary reason for landslides in the Kasara ghat section (bordering Thane district) that is adjacent to taluka headquarters. The Peth taluka, meanwhile, received 143mm rainfall, followed by the Surgana (117mm). So far this year, the rainfall in Nashik district has been low as it has received only 4,244mm rain against the expected 7,000mm till mid-July. Nashik district usually receives 15,000mm annual rain and the current rainfall works out to be just 29%. Last year, the district had already received 5,635mm (37%) by this time. “None of the talukas have crossed the 50%-mark of average rainfall so far. Dindori has received only 16% (679mm), while the parched region of Baglan has received 42% (207mm) of annual rain yet,” resident deputy collector Bhagwat Doifode said. Low rainfall has also affected sowing activity in the district. Only 57% of the sowing has been completed. While the dry Yeola taluka, known for growing bajra and maize, has achieved the highest sowing percentage (98%), rain-rich Surgana taluka, where paddy is the primary crop, has managed only 1.51% sowing so far. “Sowing is yet to begin in some places, while in others, the failure of rain is likely to cause wilting of the crops,” said the official. Similarly, even the water stocks in the dams across the district have not touched 50% of the capacity. The rainfall in Trimbakeshwar and Igatpuri has increased the water levels to some extent. In the Gangapur dam complex, which provides water to Nashik city, there have been significant inflows due to the showers over the past couple of days. The storage went up from 2,379 mcft (25% of 9,350 mcft capacity) to 3,745 (40%). In Darna too the storage rose from 7,011 mcft (36% of 19,261 mcft) to 8,045 (41%), the statistics available with the district administration show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-receives-11-2mm-rain-in-24-hrs-highest-in-20-days/articleshow/84565048.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Identified as P Samwrith, a resident of Amberpet in Hyderabad, the civil engineer was employed as a technical manager with a private bank since August last year. Police said they have found a two-page “suicide note” from his room where he had written in length about depression and back-to-back deaths of multiple family members and signed off saying “I Quit” and that none was responsible for his death. Cops have sent the body for post mortem and are checking the authenticity of the handwriting on the note. Samwrith was depressed after several deaths in familyHis two roommates-cum-colleagues, who discovered the body, were questioned for long hours at the Bidhannagar North police station. Forensic officials said helium, an inert gas, is often used for suicidal purposes because of its wide availability online as part of party balloon kits and ability to cause rapid, painless death by asphyxiation. Samwrith’s colleagues have told cops that both of them left for work on Monday morning but he had stayed back. They knew he was depressed and they had called to check on him several times but he didn’t answer the calls. The room-mates then returned home and opened the main door with a duplicate key they had with them and walked into his room to find him unconscious – a plastic bag over his head and a large cylinder of helium gas on his bed. “We found the youth unconscious and sent him to Bidhannagar subdivisional hospital where he was declared dead by an attending doctor. Although we have received a suicide note, we are checking its handwriting and have sent the body for post mortem examination to find the exact time and cause of death. We are also trying to find out how the youth procured the helium cylinder,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. A senior official of the private bank where Samwrith was employed said everyone in his family – parents, brother and very recently his sister-inlaw — died in Hyderabad and that left him extremely depressed. “It looks like he has no one left in his family. One of his close friends will be coming to get his body on Tuesday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-bank-exec-found-dead-in-kolkata-flat/articleshow/84569453.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The AP government submitted a report of the FSL in the Supreme Court in connection with a sedition case against Shreya Broadcasting Corporation in which WhatsApp conversations between Raju and Naidu were mentioned. The APFSL submitted its report on June 25 to the government after examining the cellphone of Raju which was seized during his arrest. The MP reportedly shared a draft titled ‘Jagan bail cancellation petition’ with Naidu. A revised version was also reportedly shared with Naidu as requested in the WhatsApp messages. The AP government, while filing its counter in the apex court, said: “It is clear that strings were being pulled by TDP and its chief Naidu. The timing of the calls, chats and documents shared between Raju and Naidu as well as Nara Lokesh (Naidu’s son and former minister) clearly points to a bigger conspiracy against the elected government of YSR Congress Party.” The government further alleged, “WhatsApp chats between Raju and Naidu revealed that the issues were taken up by the MP only after the approval of Naidu. There are also references to calling up each other on various topics.” The FSL report also revealed WhatsApp chats of Raju with Lokesh and owners and journalists of two Telugu TV channels. It said one of the conversations between Raju and Lokesh spoke about a petition filed in the high court regarding cancellation of the Intermediate examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/naidu-raju-discussed-jagan-bail-fsl-report/articleshow/84569515.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The highway police and teams of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) rushed to the incident spot and worked for over three hours to clear the debris to streamline vehicular traffic. Officials of the highway police at the Ghoti traffic aid post (TAP) said mud and boulders fell on the highway around midnight on Sunday. On getting the information, the same was passed on to the NHAI officials . Subsequently, earth-movers were deployed to the spot to clear the debris. Traffic was partially affected as vehicles were able to use only one lane of the road. However, normal traffic movement was restored around 3 am on Monday. The highway police said that it had been raining constantly in the Kasara area on Sunday and the showers continued through the night. The police said there had been no injuries caused by the landslide. The Mumbai-Agra highway witnesses heavy traffic round the clock. During the monsoon, traffic in the ghat sections moves at a slower pace as the road gets wet and slick. A few years ago, a section of the highway had caved in during the monsoon and it had taken the NHAI more than a year to repair the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/midnight-landslide-disrupts-traffic-for-hours-at-kasara-ghat/articleshow/84565165.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Forest officials have failed to ascertain the cause of death after primary investigations. Postmortem of the carcass will be carried out at the Transit Treatment centre (TTC) in Chandrapur on Tuesday. The carcass was first discovered by a local shepherd, who informed Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF). Later, STPF personnel along with local forest guard went to the spot and recovered the dead body. Officials including TATR field director (FD) Jitendra Ramgaonkar, deputy director (core) Nandkishor Kale, deputy director (buffer) Guru Prasad and assistant conservator of forest Mahesh Khore, and wildlife activists Bandu Dhotre and Mukesh Bhandakkar visited the spot too. Ramgaonkar said the semi-decomposed body of the tiger was discovered in Tamsi beat near Ghonsari village under Tadoba range of TATR. All the valuable body parts of the feline were intact, but officials on the spot were unable to determine the reason behind the death from the scene and panchnama. It was hence decided to take the body to TTC for postmortem. However, as it was past 6pm, postmortem was postponed till Tuesday. Field investigation regarding the possible cause of death is underway under the direction of TATR FD, dy director (core) and other forest officials. This is the sixth tiger death in Chandrapur and the 21st in the state this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-found-dead-in-tadoba-range/articleshow/84562759.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mahul hill cleared, dwellers sent to schools, Mhada units||MUMBAI: A day after a huge landslide at the Bharat Nagar slum in Mahul, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) pegged the toll from the tragedy at 21 and estimated the number of injured survivors as two. But Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) confirmed only 19 deaths besides five cases of injuries based on reports from Rajawadi hospital, where the casualties were shifted. A civic official said 112 people residing in 20 shanties in the slum colony were shifted to transit accommodations including BMC-run schools on Monday. Some were also moved to Mhada housing units meant for the project-affected. Another 200-250 people living in the foothills will be shifted to eight other locations identified by the collector, he said. Officials said they plan to barricade the area around the retaining wall of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre complex on the hill as it is dangerous for habitation. “There are also plans to put double fencing around such zones,” they added. “People around the spot were quickly shifted…the hill still poses a risk to the dwellings below,’’ said an NDRF official. Rescue work was called off Sunday night when the search for bodies ended. Mahul-based social worker Mehtab Shaikh said families on the hillock “have locked up their shanties and gone to stay in Mhada accommodations.” Shaikh said electricity has been restored in the lower parts of the hillock. “Affected persons like Kaveri Sathyan, Jaishree Jadhav, Suresh Jagdaonkar, Kausar Bi , who were living very close to the retaining wall on the hill slope, have been given temporary dwelling units in another place in Mahul,” said another resident. “We are offering them food and supplies like medicines besides Covid care,” BMC officials said. Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shewale said it was only this year that the residents refused to shift to a temporary shelter as they were tired of the annual routine of shifting back and forth during the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mahul-hill-cleared-dwellers-sent-to-schools-mhada-units/articleshow/84567504.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Senior forest officials believe the animal seems to have settled down in the biodiversity park, spread over 758 hectares. On July 9, the security personnel had recorded pugmarks of the leopard in Ordnance Factory. On July 15, the leopard was again sighted by the security guards during the wee hours. It is the same Ambazari leopard. “Now, the big cat has returned to Ambazari forest. It was not only recorded in the camera traps but there was also a direct sighting to the patrolling staff on July 16 & 17,” confirmed Bharat Singh Hada, deputy conservator of forests (DyCF), Nagpur. The news of leopard’s presence went viral again when it was spotted on Sunday night in an under-construction building by some residents near Kothari Layout, Kachimet, adjoining the Nagpur University campus on Amravati Road. “The residents alerted police but on learning about it, our team reached the spot immediately and found that the leopard had already left. This was around 10.30pm,” said Hingna RFO Ashish Ninawe. Hada said it seems the leopard has settled down in Ambazari and must be shuffling between nearby areas having good vegetation. It has been moving peacefully and has not harmed any human since it was spotted on May 28 near IT Park on South Ambazari Road. “With the presence of leopard, opening Ambazari Biodiversity Park for visitors poses a risk. Though leopard movement is mostly nocturnal, we will have to see people move inside in groups,” said Hada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-returns-to-ambazari-forest/articleshow/84562763.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Nagpur||Parents find ‘missing’ teen son in police custody||NAGPUR: Vivek Dhote’s parents were heading to Yashodhara Nagar police station to lodge a missing complaint when Tehsil police landed up at their residence in Sanjeevani Colony, Uppalwadi, with him in their custody. Dhote, 18, was arrested for vehicle theft last week and police recovered two stolen scooters from him. The Dhotes had been concerned about the whereabouts of Vivek, who did not turn up at home for the last two months. They could not trace him after searching several places, prompting them to lodge a missing complaint in the end. As the Dhotes were preparing the complaint, cops landed up at their residence with him in custody. Std XII pass and from a middle-class family, Vivek took up a job at a garment shop in Mominpura to earn some pocket money and beat the boredom of lockdown as educational institutions were not permitted to function. The decision proved to be a turning point in his life with the worst possible consequences. After coming in contact with some rowdy youngsters from Mominpura, Vivek first got addicted to narcotics and then turned an expert vehicle thief. This is the second time he has been arrested in the last one year by Tehsil police team under senior police inspector (PI) Jayesh Bhandarkar. Vivek was arrested by Bhandarkar’s team comprising assistant PI Sandeep Bagul, sub-inspector Swapnil Wagh, assistant sub-inspector Rajesh Thakur, constable Sunil Kusram and others. He was nabbed while trying to dispose of a stolen scooter for Rs3,500. It’s learnt that Vivek was stealing to be able to purchase ganja. “Sheltered and mentored by criminals, he became an expert in using wires to start a scooter and flee with it,” said a cop. “His mother and elder brother are employed at private companies and earn well. His father is partially visually impaired,” said the cop who is investigating the vehicle thefts by Vivek. “As family members would lock him up, Vivek started to avoid returning home and had been living the life of a vagabond for his addiction,” said the cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parents-find-missing-teen-son-in-police-custody/articleshow/84562844.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||Kolkata goes on ‘save’ mode as fuel price continues to soar||KOLKATA: Two weeks since petrol prices in the city had breached the century mark, the commercial fuel has continued its forward march as it stood at a record price of Rs 102.14 on Monday. Backed by an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) deal, fuel prices are expected to drop a bit in the coming days but motorists said they had already made large-scale changes in their lifestyle and slashed fuel budget because of rising prices and would try to continue with the same in the future. New Town residents Suresh Sharma and Jayant Sharma — both senior officials at a private firm in Park Street — were used to travel to their offices by car. But since the start of this month, they have made a welcome change in their life and have embraced carpooling for the first time. “There had to be a start from somewhere. The day the petrol price touched Rs 100 in the city, we decided we have to take some step to curtail our expenses. Now, I take out the car three days a week and pick and drop my colleague between home and office and he does the same with me on the other three days. It saves fuel and has also increased valuable bonding. Even if the oil price reduces, we will continue with this system,” said Suresh Sharma. Park Circus resident Abdul Jawad said fuel-price rise made him bring out his old bike from the garage and stop driving lately. “Business is down over the last one-and-a-half years and rising petrol prices are hurting my family budget. Hence, I restarted riding a bike to and from the office and kept my car in the garage. I have started saving a lot and have found my old joy of riding again,” said Jawad, who has a shop near Chowringhee. Fuel prices in the country have been rising almost every alternate day since last month due to a hike in international crude oil prices and high central and state taxes. On July 5, petrol prices hit a century at two fuel stations in Kolkata. Two days later, it breached the century mark across all petrol pumps in the city. Fuel prices are expected to come down shortly as the OPEC+ grouping on Sunday agreed to add more barrels to the market, averting a supply squeeze and reducing the risk of another oil price spike. The OPEC+ deal comes within days of India’s new oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri reaching out to his UAE and Saudi counterparts Ahmed Al Jaber and Abdulaziz bin Salman, respectively. More barrels will ease pump prices and inflation, both of which have risen to record levels. India’s crude cost has already come down to $73 per barrel from a high of $77-$78 as benchmark Brent has been edging lower from its 30-month high on news of a possible Saudi-UAE deal and resurgence in Covid-19 cases in some regions. “Sales have come down heavily across all fuel stations as people are rationing fuel and are driving cars only for emergency purposes. The ones with two-wheelers are also refuelling with limited amounts. Petrol and diesel, in any case, are being sold less due to fewer public transport on the road. We are looking forward to the new oil minister to take some serious steps in bringing down the fuel price or else the entire economy is going to suffer,” said Snehasis Bhowmick, vice-president of West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-goes-on-save-mode-as-fuel-price-continues-to-soar/articleshow/84565248.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

For the past few years, it has been in constant discussion across the country that people are being spied on by getting their phones tapped.  According to the company that makes Pegasus software, this software is sold only to governments. This is a very serious matter whose truth should be brought to the public, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sc-should-take-cognisance-of-pegasus-case-says-gehlot/articleshow/84567588.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro trains burst at seams on first Monday after service resumption||KOLKATA: Despite adding 16 more services along the north-south line, Metro rakes were bursting at the seams with office-goers during peak hours on the first Monday of resumption. On Friday, the carrier restarted with 192 trains after a 61-day Covid-induced service suspension. The morning rush prompted Metro Railway to announce 208 services and reduce the 7 minute peak-hour frequency to 6 minutes. But the effort didn’t ease the passenger load much. RPF personnel watched helplessly as commuters kept pouring in. The passenger load is expected to increase further with buses staying off the road and fuel prices setting new records everyday. “We are trying to raise awareness and help commuters maintain social distance,” a station supervisor said. On Monday, RPF personnel took up a number of measures to raise this “distancing awareness”. There were announcements on loudhailers and the public address system. RPF personnel also paraded inside stations with banners alerting passengers to maintain distance. “Me and my friends went and spoke to the RPF and the staff at the ticket counters to reintroduce the link-based boarding passes. Or the Metro will become a Covid hotspot,” said Laxmi Subramanium, a commuter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-trains-burst-at-seams-on-first-monday-after-service-resumption/articleshow/84565269.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Chandigarh||Navjot Singh Sidhu: Maverick who loves to bounce back in crisis||CHANDIGARH: Navjot Singh Sidhu (57) likes to throw up surprises, resurrecting himself just when he’s written off. His rise as the new Punjab Congress chief from being reduced to one among the crowd of 80 party MLAs in the state, after he quit as minister in protest in 2019, is just another example. “Master of all trades, jack of none,” says his bio on Twitter, the online platform that remained his only link with supporters during this self-imposed exile of nearly two years. Sidhu with CM Amarinder Singh’s once party rival, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal at her residence on MondaySidhu started off as a young cricketer in his hometown Patiala, making a debut in first class cricket in 1981-82. From being labelled a ‘stroke less wonder’ he went on to earn the sobriquet ‘Sixer Sidhu.’ After hanging up his boots, he took up commentary and also appeared as a judge on comedy shows, before he realised that politics was his inner calling. His father Bhagwant Singh, was the district president of Congress in Patiala and also served as the advocate general. “Sidhu belongs to the second generation of Congress leaders. His father was a popular figure in the party and many leaders would go to him for help in drafting statements due to his command over the English language,” recalls former Congress chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal. Sidhu’s native village falls in Dhuri in Sangrur district.  It was his father’s wish to see Sidhu play cricket at international level. Punjab’s former deputy speaker Bir Devinder Singh recalls, “When I joined Congress in 1978, his father was the district president. Navjot used to study in Yadavindra Public School, Patiala, and his father would take him to the school ground to practice in the evenings. His father would call us over for company.” Sidhu’s celebrity status as a firebrand political leader helped when he decided to contest the 2004 Lok Sabha elections on a BJP ticket by shifting base to Amritsar. He defeated Congress heavyweight and sitting Amritsar MP R L Bhatia. “There has never been the need to put up his posters or spend on publicity during elections. He is a household name,” says Shailinder Singh Shelly, a councillor in Amritsar, who switched to Congress in 2017 along with Sidhu. He had to resign due to a court case against him but managed to reclaim the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat after the ruling was stayed. He won the byelection and went on to clinch the seat in the 2009 general elections. The cricleter-turned-politician had a smooth sailing in BJP but his sour relations with the Badals, of the alliance partner SAD remained an irritant. In 2014, BJP heavyweight Arun Jaitley replaced Sidhu as the party nominee for the general elections and Sidhu was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2016. However, he resigned soon after to join Congress before the Punjab assembly elections in 2017. His wife, Navjot Kaur, a doctor, was the sitting Akali MLA who made way for Sidhu to contest the Amritsar (East) seat on a Congress ticket. Before that, Sidhu tried to experiment by forming a new political front, Aawaaz-e-Punjab, in 2016 but the idea was soon shelved. Sidhu joined chief minister Amarinder Singh’s cabinet as the minister for local bodies. However, his caustic remarks while campaigning for the Congress for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections earned the ire of Amarinder, who changed his portfolio to the low-profile power minister, making Sidhu resign in protest. The Amritsar East MLA, however, remained in touch with the party high command, especially Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. It is believed that he was asked to lie low to avoid further escalation in the state unit. Before that Sidhu’s courted controversy during his Pakistan visit for the swearing in for his friend and former cricketer Imran Khan by hugging the Pakistan Army chief General Bajwa in 2018. However, the opening of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor soon brought accolades for Sidhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-maverick-who-loves-to-bounce-back-in-crisis/articleshow/84567669.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Bombay HC slaps Rs 50,000 cost on student who secured bail by suppressing facts||NAGPUR: Coming down heavily on a student-petitioner, who’s accused of a murder and many extortion cases and had obtained a bail by hoodwinking the system, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court slapped Rs 50,000 cost on him. A single-judge bench of justice Rohit Deo also censured his lawyer Chetan Thakur, who pleaded for him in his two bail applications which were filed by suppressing facts. “The disturbing ease with which the applicant secured bail by gross suppression, nay, chicanery is reminiscent of the words spoken by Marcellus in Hamlet, ‘Something is rotten in the state of Denmark’. Something is indeed wrong with the state of affairs in the justice dispensation system, its credibility is in peril, and the enemy lurks within.” Asserting that he considered taking an extremely stern and serious view of the role played by petitioner Shubham Soni’s counsel Thakur in misleading court, the judge said the latter tendered an unconditional apology and also assured to disclose all facts of the case. “I am refraining from initiating further action in the fond hope that an unsavoury incident would only be an aberration. The duty is to make a true and faithful disclosure, and not a half-truth with the intent of subverting the administration of justice. Not only the petitioner, but also his lawyer should share the blame for an attempt to take the judicial process for a ride.” Adding that the 22-year-old petitioner’s application is absolutely frivolous and is liable to be dismissed with exemplary costs, justice Deo directed him to deposit Rs50,000 with High Court Legal Aid Sub-Committee within 15 days. In case of failure, the collector was told to recover it as arrears of land revenue. Soni is arraigned as one of the accused in murder case of Nikhil Lokhande, who was brutally killed by him and his accomplice. He’s booked under Section 302 of IPC for murder along with Sections 307, 326, 143, 145, 147, 148, 149, 504, 506, 120-B. Quoting Covid-19 pandemic, he applied for bail application which was rejected by sessions judge SS Deshpande on June 20, 2020, noting that he’s a history-sheeter and is facing as many as six prosecutions involving serious offences. Additionally, there was overwhelming evidence to link him with the brutal killing and that a weapon was also recovered at his instance. Two days later, he filed a second bail plea before another judge VD Ingle, without disclosing that the first application was already rejected. On June 24, 2020, she granted him bail without realising his nefarious designs. The suppression of facts came to fore after the complainant filed an intervention, after which she cancelled his bail, which he challenged in HC. Flaying the public prosecutor and judge, justice Deo tersely stated that while the former wasn’t alive to her duty, the latter also did not, either consider the deceitful half-truth or Thakur wasn’t asked to produce first order of bail rejection. “The first rejection order was not produced on record. In the note, a statement made was mendacious and mischievous half-truth. The prosecutor was silent and the judge failed to hear alarm bells, which the conveniently and deceptively worded ‘disclosure’ ought to have set ringing.” Justice Deo added that the credibility of the justice dispensation system is the collective responsibility of all the stakeholders — the judges, the bar, the litigants and the common man. “Unfortunately, the erosion of common man’s faith in the justice dispensation system, more often than not, is attributable to stakeholders, who may not be alive to their pious duty and responsibility to ensure that the stream of justice flows unpolluted and unhindered.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-slaps-rs50k-cost-on-student-who-secured-bail-by-suppressing-facts/articleshow/84562892.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Goa||Mapusa, Quepem centres cross 2,000mm rainfall mark||Panaji: Rain gauge stations at Mapusa and Quepem have crossed the 2,000mm mark of cumulative rainfall recorded this season, from June 1 onwards. The increased intensity of rainfall over the past week had resulted in Pernem crossing the cumulative rainfall mark of 2,000mm a few days ago, while the rest of the rain gauge stations in the state were still at 1,000mm. The India meteorological department (IMD) had forecast a significant increase in rainfall from July 10 onwards in the state. “The last 10 days added around 795mm of rain to the state’s average rainfall of this monsoon season. That’s approximately 42% of this whole season’s rainfall,” said IMD scientist Rahul M. Despite this, IMD’s observation shows that the seasonal cumulative rainfall has been slightly behind last year’s figures in some respects. “This year, three stations crossed the 2,000mm cumulative mark on July 19, whereas the same occurred on July 16 in 2020. The cumulative state average rainfall as on July 19, 2021 is 23% higher than normal, but in 2020, on the same date, it was 36% higher than normal,” Rahul said. The reasons for such an increase was initially a low-pressure area over coastal Andhra Pradesh, then a circulation over parts of Gujarat, followed by the formation of a shear zone and offshore trough. Following the increase in rainfall over Goa, the IMD recorded 132.9mm of rainfall on Monday (up to 8.30am) making it the wettest day of the season, so far. Until then, last Monday, July 12 (up to 8.30am) saw the wettest 24-hour spell of the season, having recorded 130.3mm of rainfall. On Monday, moderate rainfall was recorded from 8.30am to 5.45pm at some stations in the state like Panaji (39.2mm) and Old Goa (37.5mm) while Canacona recorded 15mm, Pernem 18.5mm and Mormugao 5mm of rainfall. “Rainfall intensity is likely to slightly reduce for two days, compared to the past 48 hours. It is likely to increase again by July 21. A low-pressure area is likely to form over north-west Bay of Bengal around July 23 which may enhance rainfall activity in the state,” Rahul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-quepem-centres-cross-2000mm-rainfall-mark/articleshow/84567596.cms||Nida Sayed

While a 45-year-old woman, identified as Deepa Roy alias Rupa, a co-owner of the plot, on which the slum has come up, received stitches on her forehead after being hit with a pistol butt, at least three to four houses were ransacked and three bikes damaged during the clash that took place around 10.30pm. Deepa Roy was attacked by goonsAs per the woman’s allegation, some youths from New Ballygunge Road had been demanding that they be allowed to promote their land located at 130, Bosepukur Road near the Kusum Kumari grounds, barely 1km from the Kasba police station. Even as Kasba police claimed that the clash had been triggered by an argument over minibus parking, the victims said that 40-50 men, who had attacked and threatened them to hand over the 22 cottah land — on which the slum is located — for promoting. Cops have registered an FIR and are investigating the case. The incident left the neighbourhood rattled with many scampering to remove their cars and bikes from the area, fearing damage to their vehicles. Locals claimed that several of the youths, who led the attack, were armed with hockey sticks, rods and even pistols. “They first hurled stones at us and then threw glass bottles. They barged into the houses of the Roy family and ransacked everything,” said Swadhin Roy, a local. The Kasba police, however, denied any property or promoting angle. “Some youths from the Bosepukur Road neighbourhood play at the local Kusum Kumari grounds. Some buses of the Picnic Garden-Howrah route are parked in that area. Locals claimed that the youths demanded that the buses, which were parked there, be removed so that they could play. This led to a tension between both sides, which resulted in the clash. A few people were injured in the melee but none of them received serious injuries,” said an officer, adding that some people have been detained in connection with the clash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/late-night-fight-breaks-out-over-kasba-slum-plot-residents-scared/articleshow/84565349.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Fever clinics too have not started. Last week, the civic chief had asked all zones to survey at least 500 homes in the vicinity of each positive patient and conduct fever clinics. The zones were unable to initiate the action as most of the staff was still deployed in Covid duties. Amid this, admissions of dengue cases have gone up at private hospitals and medical colleges. A few private hospitals are unable to admit more dengue patients due to lack of bed. Rush of regular patients too has increased. In such a situation, hospitals are not able to admit more than 15 dengue patients. At the medical colleges, around same number of patients are in admission. Dr Atul Somani, critical care consultant and physician at Kingsway Hospital, said they currently have 10 dengue patients. “The number may probably increase due to rains. Citizens need to take precautions and protect themselves. Comorbid patients having fever and bodyache are suspected dengue patients but testing negative. Yet, not everyone is needing admission. It is recommended when BP or SPO2 is down,” said Dr Somani. Dr Tushar Gawad, director (Administration), Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, said they are getting a steady flow of dengue cases. “Probably, dengue prevalence has increased as compared to last year due to more favourable climatic conditions for breeding of mosquitoes. Also, last year people were at home due to lockdown. This year relatively more people are venturing out though there are restrictions in place,” said Dr Gawad. Dr Gawad further said that numbers may have gone up because due to decline in Covid-19 cases, more people are visiting hospitals and getting themselves tested for dengue, malaria etc. The administration is trying its best to prevent dengue, he said and added, their resources have been stretched due to Covid-19 pandemic. “People need to be educated and take necessary precautions to safeguard themselves from dengue,” he said. IGGMCH deputy medical superintendent Dr Sagar Pandey said that dengue patients have increased as compared to last year. “As flow of regular patients has increased, we have opened three medicine wards,” he said. NMC officials said that field staff couldn’t join till Saturday. Guidelines regarding collection of serum samples and survey have been issued and work would take off from this week, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dengue-cases-growing-nmc-still-stuck-with-covid-work/articleshow/84562884.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

This is in addition to the 70 blue beacons were removed over the weekend. The drive was carried out across Dhakuria, Dalhousie, Burrabazar, Rabindra Sarani and CR Avenue, among other places. The South-east traffic guard and Jorabagan traffic guard removed maximum blue beacons. “Even as we removed the beacons, we have mentioned to the drivers and owners that they will be under watch. Action against a few other vehicles — ones that are privately driven but still used beacons — will be initiated after getting necessary clarification from the home and transport departments. In the meanwhile, vehicle numbers have been noted down for follow up action. Not many seemed to be aware of the rules,” said an officer. According to sources, most of the offenders were found to be cars that had been taken on rent by government offices. “Even when the officers were not travelling, these drivers were using beacons. In some cases, we found that flashers were being used even though that government official is not entitled to flashers. In Kolkata, only eight senior officials are allowed blue beacons with flashers. In all, 45 officials are allowed beacons in Bengal,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-remove-191-blue-beacons/articleshow/84565309.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||Anti-Covid drug 2DG good, but timing is crucial: Investigator||NAGPUR: Defence research and development organization’s (DRDO) anti-Covid-19 drug 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose oral powder or 2-DG, launched with Dr Reddy’s laboratories, may have made a slow start in the city with the positivity rate dropping to almost nil but it’s availability may augur well for patients in the probable third wave. Critical care consultant and ICU director Dr Nirmal Jaiswal, a principal investigator of the 2-DG during trial, said efficacy of the DRDO’s drug seemed to be good for mild to moderate patients but it must be administered at the right time. “The drug does not allow the virus to replicate. The RTPCR turns negative quickly and the scale of the severity is also reduced, enhancing recovery time,” said Dr Jaiswal, who used the drug, priced around Rs 990 per sachet, on around five patients, all of whom recovered. Dr Jaiswal stated that even home isolation patients on oxygen can use the drug. “This drug should not be used with Azithromycin or any such medicine,” he cautioned. On condition of anonymity, a doctor said a patient was given 2DG at an advanced stage but he did not survive. Nitin Gupta of Gupta Agency at Dawa bazaar said hospitals are stocking up the product and there are enquiries too from far off places like Beitul and Chhindwada in Madhya Pradesh. In addition to 2-DG, the Indian-made Baricitinib tablets too are now available in the city. This drug, which is supposed to be used in combination with Remdesivir, can be used in paediatric patients of two years of age too. The foreign-made version of Baricitinib, earlier used for rheumatoid arthritis, cost Rs 21,000 for a strip of 10 tablets. The Hyderabad-based Natco pharma limited, which had entered into a voluntary licensing agreement with the original Baricitinib producer Eli Lilly, has released the oral tablet for Rs 419. Intensivist Dr Amit Khade of East End Hospital, who had used Natco’s Bariticinib, said the oral drug was used as an immunomodulator as a compromise replacement for Tocilizumab when it was in short supply. “Patients were seen improving after the combination of Baricitinib, Remdesivir and steroid had been administered. We cannot pin-pointedly state the improvement was due to Baricitinib but the patients’ overall condition had improved,” he said. Intensivist Dr Sohal Parate, who too had used the local product, said Baricitinib and Remdesivir was a superior combination which helped in reducing te recovery time and improving the clinical status, especially among patients receiving high-flow oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/anti-covid-drug-2dg-good-but-timing-is-crucial-investigator/articleshow/84562919.cms||Soumitra Bose

This was done after the initial post-mortem report could not arrive at a conclusion on the reason behind the death of the youth. “Till now, the poisoning theory is yet to find a traction. However, clarity will come only after the final post-mortem report and the report of the food samples seized from hiss friend’s residence,” said an officer. Cops had arrested Modak’s friend Kaushik Mondal on Sunday. Viscera are preserved to ascertain the cause of death in the cases where autopsies are inconclusive. Cops will also question soon Mondal’s mother and wife, who were present in the room at the time of Modak’s death. “Mondal had claimed to have called over some friends for the party. We will try to trace them and ascertain if Mondal is speaking the truth,” said an investigating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-to-keep-viscera-in-golf-green-case/articleshow/84565378.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Goa||Goa: Week-long rain leaves crops damaged in Divar, farmers morose||DIVAR: For the fourth year in a row, Rama Velingkar has seen his crops destroyed as the weather gods played havoc. The ageing farmer from Sao Mathias village of Divar island says this paddy crops have been spoiled year after year either due to heavy rainfall or ingress of saline water but his pleas to the powers that be to do something have fallen on deaf ears. As the week-long spell of heavy showers ebbs, farmers like Velingkar can only watch as their transplanted paddy seedlings either float or rot in the inundated fields. For paddy cultivators, they get just one shot every year to grow rice, usually the Jyoti or Jaya variety. Already struggling with low profits, increased labour costs and small land holdings, farmers also have to deal with erratic rainfall and damaged bunds. Suryakant Harichandra Bomkar from Sao Mathias, which is also known as Malar, remembers the time when all his ancestral fields were yielding a good crop. Upset by consecutive agricultural setbacks he has given up farming. “For four years I lost everything, almost Rs 50,000 each year. This year I planted rice in one small patch but the heavy rains have flooded my field. If I am lucky, it may be saved,” Velingkar said. Local farmers say that government officials come to inspect their fields but despite running from pillar to post and following up with officials, nothing gets done. They have also said that they never receive any compensation from the government for their agricultural losses. “The government officials come, ministers come, they see the situation and they say that a report will be prepared. We have never seen any report. The government asked us to submit a photo of us in our fields, which we did but nothing,” Bomkar said. Rohidas Krishna Mandrekar, who heads the local Xetkari Sangathan, is frustrated and living in penury after seeing his hard work get washed away for three consecutive years. “This is the first time that I did not grow anything. I am fed up. Everything gets spoiled because of the rain, strong wind which knocks everything down. The water comes over the bund and washes away whatever we plant,” Mandrekar said. Local activist and documentary director Amancio Tomas Rodrigues said that the bunds have been destroyed due to the movement of high-speed vessels along the river. The movement of watersports craft and pleasure crafts, which create a high wake, have weakened the bunds, which subsequently collapse with heavy rainfall, Rodrigues said. “Our main problem is the bund because of which water enters into our fields. When the water level rises, it weakens the bund or where the bunds are already damaged, the saline water flows in,” Rodrigues added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/week-long-rain-leaves-crops-damaged-farmers-morose/articleshow/84567797.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Goa||CM Pramod Sawant meets Narendra Modi, briefs him on ‘political situation’ in Goa||PANAJI: With less than seven months to go for the state assembly election, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday briefed PM Narendra Modi about the “political situation” in Goa. He also invited Modi to visit Goa and inaugurate the Goa Medical College super-specialty block, and the renovated Aguada jail. The political discussion between Modi and Sawant came after some BJP veterans staked claim for their candidature in the upcoming assembly elections. Sources said that Sawant informed Modi about the present strength and weakness of the opposition, and how the party is preparing to secure a majority in the assembly election. BJP has already started the groundwork for the election. Recently, the party’s national general secretary (organization) B L Santosh had visited the state to take stock of the political situation. Senior functionaries such as Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar and former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar have staked claim to contest the next assembly election, while Union minister of state Shripad Naik had said that he is ready to return to the state if the party needs him here. At the recently-concluded BJP state executive committee meeting, the party decided to contest the election on its own, but kept open the gates for a pre-poll alliance. Speaking to TOI, Sawant said that he held a “fruitful meeting” with the PM. “I have informed the PM about the ongoing developmental projects in the state,” he said. Sawant also invited Modi to address the state’s panchayats for undertaking the atmanirbhar-swayampurna programme. He also briefed the PM on the current Covid scenario in Goa, and the ongoing preparations for the third wave. Sawant said that Modi told him that he would convey the schedule of his visit to Goa as soon as possible. Sawant also said that Modi directed officials to fast-track the centrally-funded projects in the state. Sawant also met home minister Amit Shah and requested him to include the Gouly-Dhangar community in the ST category. Earlier, Sawant and other state ministers had met Union tribal welfare minister Arjun Mundaji on the issue. Sawant also met Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari and minister for state V K Singh. Sawant said that during the meeting, various ongoing national highway projects in Goa were reviewed and discussed for speedy completion. The state government has been facing flak from the public over the slow pace of work on national highways. The CM also met Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav, and discussed various issues related to the environment in Goa. And in his meeting with IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, he discussed the implementation of the Bharat Net fibre project in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawants-meets-modi-briefs-him-on-political-situation-in-state/articleshow/84567700.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Kolhapur||Potholed roads trouble Kolhapur residents||KOLHAPUR: The incessant rainfall has exposed the quality of roadwork done in the city. Thousands of potholes have surfaced on the city streets, creating a troubled ride for the motorists, especially bikers. Commuting from one place to another has become a tough task with waterlogged potholes and muddy road in most parts of the city. Roads on Aakhri Rasta, Laxmipuri grain market, Gangawesh chowk, Sasne ground road in Tarabai Park, Shahu Nagar to Panjarpol road, Shahupuri 2nd and 3rd lane, Takala road, Mangalwar Peth main road are in poor condition. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has started filling the potholes with gravel as road construction work can’t be taken up during the monsoon. KMC’s deputy city engineer Harshit Ghadage said, “We had started with the pothole filling activity at major 32 roads in the city. Many roads were dug up again for electricity, drainage, water pipeline work and hence are again left with potholes. KMC has started filling those potholes with gravel as a temporary measure and will carry out the patchwork once the rain intensity decreases. In monsoons, we can’t carry road construction or pothole filling activity”. Citizens are bearing the brunt of the lack of coordination between agencies regarding road digging. Ashok Chougale, who resides near Panchganga hospital, said, “The Aakhri Rasta road from Gangawesh to Shivaji Bridge over Panchganga river has become unbearable. It has been in really bad condition for almost a year now. Several accidents are taking place here daily.” Chougale said that people suddenly halt or change lanes in a bid to dodge the potholes on the road. They end up losing control of their two-wheelers and slip off the road. “KMC administration should look into this matter seriously. They should not only fill gravel on a temporary basis as it further increases the problem. The roads become muddy and uneven to drive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/potholed-roads-trouble-kolhapur-residents/articleshow/84565347.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

A journalist had tweeted that the Congress gets votes in the name of Gandhi family, but when someone like Amarinder Singh or Ashok Gehlot or Sheela Dixit becomes the chief minister, they start thinking that the party won because of them. Maken’s retweet came in support of the elevation of Navjot Singh Sidhu as Punjab PCC chief and questioned the attitude of chief ministers such as Singh, Gehlot and Late Dikshit. किसी भी राज्य में कोई क्षत्रप अपने दम पर नहीं जीतता है। गांधी नेहरू परिवार के नाम पर ही गरीब, कमजोर वर्ग, आम आदमी… https://t.co/Y2zUY8opSN— Shakeel Akhtar (@shakeelNBT) 1626626996000The tweet retweeted by Maken said, “No leader wins on his own. The votes of the poor and weaker section are given in the name of Nehru and Gandhi family. But, be it Amarinder Singh or Gehlot or earlier Sheila or anyone else, as soon as they become the chief minister, they think the party won because of them.” Whether it was mere flattery of the Congress first family or intended to target Gehlot during the latter’s tussle with Sachin Pilot, is not known. Congress President Smt. Sonia Gandhi ji has declared Mr. Navjot Singh Sidhu as the President of Punjab PCC. Congrat… https://t.co/GTnatL44mT— Ashok Gehlot (@ashokgehlot51) 1626687164000Despite being in-charge of the state, the way Maken targeted Gehlot has made it clear that the AICC general secretary’s relationship with the CM was not that easy. There was a discussion in the Congress circles that Gehlot is no longer giving importance to the AICC in-charge as Maken. Gehlot, on the other hand, tweeted congratulating Sidhu. The CM wrote, “It has been the tradition of Congress that before every decision, everyone is consulted and everyone gets a chance to express their views. Keeping everyone's opinion in mind, once the party high command takes a decision, then all Congressmen follow the tradition of unitedly accepting it. This is the biggest strength of Congress even today.” Gehlot added that Captain Amarinder Singh had announced in front of the media last week that he would accept every decision of the Congress president. He hoped that Sidhu will uphold the Congress tradition. It is said Maken, being the in-charge, has given a clear message to Gehlot and his camp through the retweet that the latter will have to obey the party high command’s order on further power sharing in the state. Without the knowledge of the Congress high command, the in-charge cannot openly attack like this. After the show of strength and pressure politics of independent MLAs of Gehlot camp and MLAs who came to Congress from BSP, this stand of Maken indicates big decisions in the politics of Rajasthan Congress in the coming days. A party leader on condition of anonymity said Maken had worked out a formula to resolve the rift in the state unit with Pilot, but Gehlot was not okay with the names suggested by the state in-charge and hence the delay in the cabinet expansion. Maken had given a timeline for political appointments in the past, but could not succeed in it as consensus could not be reached. Many see it as the exasperation of the party in-charge in resolving the differences in the party as resentment was brewing among Congress workers over lack of political participation in governance. The party worker also pointed out that even though the state government had completed half of its term, several political appointments were still pending. The party could not even reconstitute fully the Pradesh Congress committee and district and block level committees after it was dissolved following the rebellion by the Pilot camp last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/makens-retweet-targeting-cm-gehlot-triggers-murmurs-of-punjab-like-move/articleshow/84567683.cms||Joychen Joseph
---||Hyderabad||Telangana wants new tribunal on Krishna, seeks 50:50 share||HYDERABAD: Days after the Centre took control of irrigation projects on Krishna and Godavari rivers and notified jurisdiction of both river management boards, Telangana is planning to focus on insisting on constitution of a new tribunal to resolve sharing of Krishna water while demanding that Krishna waters be allocated 50:50 between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The Telangana government said the new tribunal should be constituted under section 3 of the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act of 1956 to resolve water sharing issues in a time-bound manner. Adding a rider, it said since the tribunal verdict could take several years, Telangana and AP should both get equal share of Krishna unlike the present 66:34 share for AP and Telangana respectively. Water resources special chief secretary Rajat Kumar, who held a key meeting with senior officials, irrigation engineers and legal experts on Monday to decide on the future course of action, said Telangana should get at least 575 tmcft of water out of total 811 tmcft in the Krishna. “The present allocation of 299 tmcft to Telangana is grossly inadequate,” he said. He further said: “Telangana is requesting the Centre to give its rightful share as the sepatate statehood movement was primarily fought on rectification of injustice meted out to the region in water, recruitment and funds.” He said the Telangana government had withdrawn its case against AP in the Supreme Court following an assurance of the Jal Shakti minister at the apex council meeting held in October 2020. The government roped in legal experts on the gazette notification by getting them study various judgments on inter-state water issues such as Kaveri river issue between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-wants-new-tribunal-on-krishna-seeks-5050-share/articleshow/84567682.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Two herds from Nepal damage several acres of crops in elephant corridor of Dudhwa||BAREILLY: Forest department officials are keeping a close watch on two herds of elephants from Nepal that have destroyed several acres of standing sugarcane and tender paddy crops cultivated in forest areas in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR). An estimated 10-15 acres of crops have so far been destroyed. According to forest department officials hundreds of acres of forest land have been given on lease to farmers by the revenue department. The matter pertaining to the department’s efforts to evict them is now pending in court. The cultivated land is part of the corridor used by elephants since time immemorial to move between Nepal and India. Every year, at the onset of the monsoon, herds migrate from Nepal’s forests to Dudhwa. This year, both herds have a young calf each making it all the more important for the officials to closely monitor their movement to ensure safe passage and avert possible man-elephant conflict. One of the herds is camping around the Singahi forest range and appears to be heading towards Katarniyaghat forests. The other one has been sighted in Mailani range of DTR near Sultanpur village. It appears to be migrating towards Pilibhit Tiger Reserve. Anil Patel, divisional forest officer, DTR (buffer), told TOI, “These herds have newborn calves. We have checked their movement pattern and found that they are following the same path which their ancestors had taken. The herds destroyed the cropped fields which were once a part of the buffer forest area but currently encroached upon due to various reasons.” The department’s foremost concern, said Patel, was to ensure that there is no repeat of the 2019 human-elephant confrontation when two wild tuskers killed five men after they strayed from their migratory path and reached Rampur via Bareilly and Pilibhit.

---||Jaipur||ACB claims nexus between narcotics officers, smugglers||(300 words only) Kota: The arrest of four persons including two contractual employees at narcotics office in Jhalawar’s Bhawani Mandi on Saturday last week has verified Kota Anti-Corruption Bureau’s (ACB) claim of nexus between narcotics department officials, touts and smugglers. Bundi city police on Saturday arrested Rohit Kumar and Praveen Jhawa, of narcotics office on a report from Bundi-based ‘paan’ stall vendor Mohanlal Gurjar. Two more persons identified as Imran and Akram were also arrested. Gurjar had filed a report of thrashing and extortion of Rs 2.96 lakhs on July 16. During initial interrogation, the four accused revealed to be working with two inspectors of the department, identified as Arnab Ganguli and Dharmveer Meena. Police have begun investigating the inspectors’ role. Gurjar had alleged that on June 25 around 7-8 persons, (two in 3-star Khaki uniform) in two vehicles took him and two of his companions to Bundi bypass. The three were beaten up and were threatened that they would be framed under false Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, (NDPS) case. They were forced to give Rs 2.96 lakhs in instalments to the group. The victim stated that he could identify the accused if they are brought before him. Meanwhile, Bundi police repeatedly avoided commenting on the matter citing that the case is ‘secret’. “I can comment only after July 23 as the matter is very secret and is under intensive investigation,” said Sahdev Meena, SHO at Bundi city police station. “I can’t comment on the role of narcotics officials in the matter. We are investigating their role and collecting technical evidences,” SP Bundi, Shivraj Vishnoi said. However, SP Meena denied that the matter was linked with organised corruption network between narcotics department, touts and smugglers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-claims-nexus-between-narcotics-officers-smugglers/articleshow/84567726.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The annual pilgrimage began with rituals performed in the early hours though it was raining heavily in Trimbakeshwar town — the home to Nivruttinath Maharaj Samadhi and the famous Lord Shiva temple that is among the 12 jyotirlingas in the country. Since the ‘Dindi’, walking a distance of 400-km from Nashik, till the destination has been banned by the state government due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government permitted a select number of wakaris along with a medical officer and a revenue officer for the non-stop journey to Pandharpur. As many as 40 chosen warkaris’ along with 10 people from the administration were part of the journey till Pandharpur. The day began with rituals as Nivruttinath Samadhi Mandir after which the palkhi was brought to Kushawarta temple where the president of the council Purushottam Lohgaonkar performed the puja. The Palkhi was then taken to Trimbakeshwar temple amidst chanting of ‘Hari Naam’ and Abhangas (hymns). Women also played ‘fugadi’ as the Palkhi started from Kushawart temple to Trimbakeshwar temple and then towards the waiting Shiv Shahi buses. The two buses were washed thoroughly, sanitized and then decorated for the special event. MLA Hiraman Khasokar, superintendent of police Sachin Patil welcomed the warkaris and the palkhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/warkaris-undertake-annual-journey-on-shiv-shahi-buses/articleshow/84565387.cms||---

However, the forest, customs and fisheries departments have not taken any steps yet to take custody of the fish. The fishermen who caught the alligator gar have currently kept it in a barrel and are feeding it small fish. Villagers of the Prayag Chikhali, meanwhile, have been suggesting that the fishermen release the fish back into the river. They are not aware that alligator gar could severely damage the local marine biodiversity. Kishor Dalwi, one of the fishermen who found the fish, said, “It has become a headache now. Thousands turn up at our home to see the exotic fish. To avoid crowding, we have to tell them that we have released the fish back into the river. We have called the forest department, veterinary doctors, fishery department, etc. at least a hundred times. But no one is taking the matter seriously. The forest department has asked us to contact the customs department as this is an exotic breed.” Satish Khade, the assistant commissioner of the fisheries department, said, “This fish has a rare habitat here and its survival rate is also low. But it’s true that it voraciously eats other native fish and is considered dangerous. More research is needed. We plan to keep the fish at Ratnagiri’s college of fisheries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/officials-yet-to-take-custody-of-alligator-gar/articleshow/84565406.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Nagpur Municipal Corporation will make sure you’re jabbed at home||NAGPUR: Two days after the state government allowed Covid-19 vaccination of bedridden patients, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) initiated its plan of a special drive for such citizens in the next couple of days. This is another special effort by the civic body after camps for foreign-bound students, drive-in for elderly, Muslim community and the latest being for the transgender community. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that a Google form would be floated on Tuesday and posted on the NMC website. “Relatives can fill up the form on behalf of a bedridden family member. People who are immobile due to loss of limbs, old age or a particular illness would get the jab at home. They would need to show a medical certificate,” he said. Unlike the government’s move seeking registration through the email id covidvacc2bedridden@gmail.com, NMC allows direct enrolment which will help start the drive at the earliest. Once the civic body gets two or more eligible applicants, it will send a team to inoculate them with Covishield vaccine. Applications will be accepted for a couple of days and if the numbers are high enough, the drive would be started the next day. “For the first three days, we will wait to see how many applications come. No specific schedule has been fixed. It can be in every two days or more,” Joshi said. The beneficiaries would be informed in advance about the arrival of NMC’s inoculation team. They will also wait for 30 minutes after giving the injection, Joshi said. Meanwhile, NMC and district administration started a special drive for transgender people and the homeless at Sarath Trust office in Sitabuldi and Karabi, respectively, on Monday. The vaccination drive again slowed down at all centres as the NMC ran short of Covishield doses. In a press note, the civic body informed that the drive would be held in a limited manner for all age groups on Tuesday. The civic body also ran short of Covaxin doses. The limited drive at a couple of centres too would have come to a halt if the NMC did not receive 1,200 doses of Covaxin. On Friday and Saturday, some of the centres had to shut at 2pm due to lack of Covaxin doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bedridden-nmc-will-make-sure-youre-jabbed-at-home/articleshow/84562987.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Nine of them are still in judicial custody. Meanwhile, the state excise department officials that sealed all nine bars at the Park Street hotel till the end of police investigation are probing into the complaints of similar violation against another star hotel in south Kolkata. They have called the officials of the Minto Park hotel to submit some documents and CCTV footage. The officials of the Park Street hotel, who were questioned on Monday, include senior managers and those directly involved with the party. They had also been questioned twice last week as well. A senior official said they were called again on Monday to re-examine some statements, recorded earlier, because of some disparities. Cops said that several rooms of the Park Street hotel had been booked in the last few months through one agency, mostly in the names of women, said police. The state excise department had conducted a raid at the Minto Park Hotel last week after receiving a complaint about booze being served well past 8pm at a birthday party organised at the hotel bar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/park-st-hotel-staff-questioned-again/articleshow/84565402.cms||---
---||Amritsar||In Amritsar, Congress workers gear up to welcome Navjot Singh Sidhu||AMRITSAR: The Congress unit of Amritsar has geared up to receive newly-appointed president of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC), Navjot Singh Sidhu, who is likely to arrive on Tuesday. On the other hand, a group of Congressmen, aligned to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh are sceptical of Sidhu making the revolutionary changes he promised in his tweets. Congress leaders here are of the view that Sidhu, MLA from Amritsar East assembly constituency, may not be able to deliver much in a short time except for pressurising the Amarinder government to make a few arrests in sacrilege and drug cases. However, they feel that he would surely campaign to be the next CM, so he could have constitutional powers to handle issues directly. District, Rural Congress Committee president Bhagwant Pal Singh Sahar told TOI that Sidhu was likely to arrive in Amritsar on Tuesday and the party had made elaborate arrangements to receive him. “Even today, we celebrated his appointment as PPCC chief by distributing sweets and dancing to the dhol,” said Sachar. While Sidhu’s elevation as PPCC chief has clipped Amarinder Singh’s wings, Sidhu also faces the challenge of delivering on the actions and promises he made in his tweets. Sources said that the decision of the Congress high command to appoint Sidhu as PPCC chief was based on, among other factors, reports of the party’s internal surveys, which portrayed him as the most acceptable face to lead Congress in Punjab. This was attributed mainly to failure to fulfill the promises made by Amarinder Singh in 2017 and Sidhu’s popularity among the youth. “Going soft on Akalis, letting perpetrators of sacrilege incidents roam free, turning a blind eye towards drug menace, unemployment and most importantly, inflation has seriously dented Amarinder’s popularity,” said sources. A senior Congress leader added, “Broken pledges are remembered more than the ones which are fulfilled, so non-fulfillment of Amarinder’s 2017 campaign pledges and his unfinished task will continue to haunt him and will be remembered by voters but this is not be all and end all in politics. Voters will also remember Sidhu’s Twitter battle against his own boss, his quest for power and his self-obsession,” said a senior Congress leader who didn’t wish to be named. When asked about the challenges which Sidhu may face in future, he said keeping his flock together would be the foremost challenge. Senior deputy mayor of Amritsar, Raman Bakshi said, “Presently, all surveys and roads lead to Sidhu’s house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/in-amritsar-cong-workers-gear-up-to-welcome-navjot-sidhu/articleshow/84567786.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The NCB seized 327 kg of ganja worth Rs 2 crore in the international market from a mini-truck as it was being smuggled from Annavaram in AP to Kerala. Two men, one from Tamil Nadu and the main accused from Kerala, have been arrested. Acting on a specific intelligence, NCB sleuths intercepted a mini-truck on Thiruvallur road in Uthukottai in Tamilnadu on July 17 but found the cargo compartment to be empty. The ganja was finally found in a special cavity in the container. “The cavity was difficult to detect and the gang had concealed 150 packets of compressed ganja wrapped in adhesive tape in the secret cavity,” said an NCB official. Interrogation of arrested driver Dubash Sankar, who is from Chennai, revealed that the contraband was sourced from Annavaram in AP and that he was on his way to Thiruvananthapuram. While NCB is yet to identify the source, based on Sankar’s confession, they arrested main accused Sreenath M, a resident of Thiruvananthapuram, from Kalaikavila town on TN-Kerala border on July 18. NCB officials said that Sreenath had been peddling drugs in Vizhinjam area in Kerala’s capital for the past four years Both the accused were arrested under the NDPS Act, 1985.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ncb-seizes-ganja-worth-rs-2cr-on-its-way-from-ap-to-kerala/articleshow/84567771.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa cannot utilise mineral fund: Centre||PANAJI: The Centre has withdrawn the state government’s power to utilise the district mineral fund, which has nearly Rs 190 crore, and kept it with just the district mineral foundation to utilise the fund for various developmental works in the mining belt. The Union government observed that the states have diverted funds collected for the welfare of people in the mining belt. “No sanction or approval of any expenditure out of the fund of the district mineral foundation shall be done at the state level by the state government or any state level agency,” government of India joint secretary Veena Kumari D said. The officer said that the provisions of Section 9B of the Mine and Minerals Development Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2015, should be strictly adhered to in respect of utilisation of funds by the district mineral foundations and no fund shall be transferred in any manner from the district mineral foundations to the state exchequer or any state level fund or Chief Minister’s Relief Fund or any other funds or schemes. She said that the central government has found instances of district mineral funds being transferred for other purposes. District mineral foundations were introduced in the Act in 2015 to create a district level entity for welfare of mining affected persons to which contribution is made directly by the holders of mineral concessions, as opposed to payment of royalty and auction premium, which are deposited with the state exchequer. The act also mandates that the district mineral foundations work for the interest and benefit of the persons and areas affected by mining-related operations. “In fact, such transfer of funds from DMF to a state level agency defeats the very purpose of depositing the contribution and setting DMF at district level. Therefore, transfer of any part of the fund of district mineral foundations to any state level entity for its utilisation is violation of the provision of Section 9B of the Act,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-cannot-utilisemineral-fund-centre/articleshow/84567749.cms||Murari Shetye

At least nine such cases have been confirmed at the Sarojini Naidu Medical College (SNMC). All these patients, above 40 years old, had earlier tested Covid-19 positive. Though they experienced no symptoms of black fungus, their MRI reports indicate reinfection in them, said doctors. Dr Akhil Pratap Singh, district in-charge for black fungus treatment, said, “Over the past two months, 83 patients of black fungus surfaced in Agra district. Out of these, 41 have been cured of the infection. All these patients are called for check-ups after every 15 days. Following an MRI test, reinfection of black fungus was confirmed in nine of these patients. Notably, these patients didn’t experience any symptoms of reinfection. All these patients are being provided anti-fungal treatment.” Meanwhile, two patients were diagnosed with black fungus infection in the lungs in Agra. These patients have been admitted at the medicine ward of SN Medical College. So far, in Agra district, 10 people have died of the black fungus infection and 16 have lost one eye.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two years after Malad landslide, retaining wall yet to be rebuilt||MUMBAI: Two years after a retaining wall around BMC’s Malad (E) reservoir near Kurar village collapsed and 32 slumdwellers died in the subsequent landslide, the civic body is yet to rebuild it. Also 75 families still live at the same spot as they are yet to be rehabilitated. “We are living in a death trap. Every time it rains heavily, rocks as heavy as 40kg roll down the hill slopes,” said Tejpratap Tripathi, who lives in Azad Nagar slum. “Only those 86 families who lost a family member or their shanty in the 2019 incident were rehabilitated in Mahul. The BMC and the state government must provide the remaining 75 families alternative accommodation too.” TimesViewIncidents of landslides and wall collapses are rising every year. The fact that the BMC has not been able to reconstruct the retaining wall that collapsed in 2019 and has failed to relocate the slumdwellers, who continue to live in dangerous conditions, show that the civic body is not serious about this. The BMC must immediately move all residents living in vulnerable areas to safer places and rebuild the wall to avoid landslides in the future.Last weekend, BMC officials had inspected their slum colony which remains vulnerable to landslides, said Tripathi, who had moved here in the 90s. On July 2, 2019, portions of the retaining wall collapsed at two points—Pimpri Pada and Ambedkar Nagar, half a kilometre apart—following heavy downpour. The water gushed out and swept away 3,000 shanties on the hill slope, claiming 32 lives, including 10 children. “We can’t sleep at night when it pours. We can hear water gushing down and rocks falling. We are willing to move out, but we should be given accommodation nearby,” said Kiran Gupta, another resident. The rehabilitation of the 75 slumdwellers is stuck in a dispute between the forest department and BMC. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “Two years on, nothing has changed. The 75 families must be moved to a safer location and the wall must be reconstructed.” According to forest officials, 86 families were allotted flats in Mahul, but eight eligible families could not be moved there due to the Bombay high court orders barring new allotments at Mahul for project-affected persons (PAPs). Also, some of those allotted flats refused to move there. The forest department had requested the BMC to allot flats in other PAP buildings for these eight families. When contacted, BMC’s additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu said he would look into the matter and issue a response. The BMC had spent Rs 21 crore to build the 2.3km long, 15ft high wall around the reservoir, but it collapsed within two years. Soon after the incident, the then BMC chief, Praveen Pardeshi, had appointed a team of experts from NGOs and social organisations to look into the lapses. Portions of the wall that had begun to tilt were also razed. In December 2019, the technical investigation committee, in its report, had not held any authority accountable. It said that heavy rainfall, coupled with holes in the wall blocked by the hutment dwellers, resulted in the incident. The report had also recommended that at the Malad reservoir site, the slope on the upstream side of the stormwater drain should be properly stabilised to avoid any localised landslide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-years-after-malad-landslide-retaining-wall-yet-to-be-rebuilt/articleshow/84567821.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Representatives of BJP, TDP, TJS, Congress, CPI, CPI (M L-New Democracy) and retired engineers—who played a key role in designing irrigation projects in Telangana—participated in an all-party meeting over the gazette notification. All parties except the TRS participated in the meet, organised by Telangana Journalists Adhyana Vedika. TJS founder-president Prof Kodandaram said: “A comprehensive water policy on allocation has to formulated to get justice to Telangana. All parties should unite through ‘Ikya Jala Sadhana’ änd fight for the benefit of Telangana.” AICC spokesperson Dasoju Shravan said, “The gazette notification was issued because of KCR’s political agenda. KCR himself played an engineer and designed the projects for the benefit of Andhra Pradesh.” BJP Telangana spokesperson Prakash Reddy said the Telangana CM has to respond to the gazette notification. “I openly challenge him to announce where TRS stands on it,” he added. Former MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy said the central government took KCR’s “irresponsible attitude” towards water allocation and issued the gazette notification.

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Out for feast, six ‘preachers’ in Kasganj jailed||AGRA: Six men got together to meet their friend at Gangpur village in Kasganj — all of them Dalits who had converted to Christianity. A day later, on Monday, all of them were jailed for "rioting and hurting religious sentiments" after a saffron outfit complained its members were attacked by them when they tried to stop “conversions” in the village. Police later found no evidence that they were preachers. Shrinivas, Kuldeep, Rahul Kumar, Shiv Kumar, Durgesh and Kishan were visiting Rampal — all between 30 and 50 years old and from Kasganj district — on Sunday afternoon. “I got information that a few people were trying to convert Hindu families to Christianity in Gangpur village,” a complaint by Hindu Jagran Manch member Arvind Kumar Gupta, on the basis of which the FIR was filed, said. “When I reached there, I found seven men distributing money and religious literature among villagers.” Gupta wanted them to be charged under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020, which bans “forced” conversions. But police dismissed the conversion theory. “They were not preaching. They were just having food at a friend’s house,” a policeman said on condition of anonymity. Kasganj DSP Deep Kumar Pant, too, said, “For now, there is no evidence to suggest that the group of men was involved in religious conversion.” The six men were, however, booked for other charges listed in Gupta’s complaint — rioting, assault, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, criminal intimidation, mischief and deliberate and malicious act to outrage religious feelings — at the Sikandarpur Vaish police station in Kasganj. The reason for the last, police said, was that “abusive” content about Hindu deities was found on one page in a diary found inside the van the six men had come to Gangpur in. SHO Jitendra Kumar said, “They were not able to provide any explanation about the content.” DSP Pant said, “Six of them were arrested and sent to jail.

---||Ludhiana||What helped Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh in 2015 now works for Navjot Singh Sidhu||JALANDHAR: The factor which worked for Captain Amarinder Singh in 2015, that he could get support of several MLAs to build pressure on the party high command to get Partap Singh Bajwa replaced as the Punjab Congress president, is now working for Navjot Singh Sidhu. It is the perception among MLAs and prospective candidates that Sidhu could help them win their seats in the 2022 assembly elections that has made them welcome his appointment as PCC president despite Amarinder’s serious objections and unhappiness. In 2015, they believed that Amarinder, not Bajwa, could lead them to victory. Amarinder enjoyed such support from party MLAs and other senior leaders that Bajwa was isolated and the high command was forced to replace him. However, the CM is now facing the anti-incumbency and several questions about his government’s working about. The same set of MLAs and a few ministers, especially the Majha brigade of three ministers, who were in the forefront to organise support for him in 2015, have now sided with Sidhu for the same reason. Unlike Amarinder, who rallied the MLAs behind himself in 2015 and started holding public functions under ‘Mission Punjab -2017’, Sidhu appeared to be plodding alone. He remained inaccessible to most of the party leaders but stood his ground in questioning the CM through his tweets. It was Amarinder’s direct attack on Sidhu, challenging him to contest from Patiala, that made the ex-cricketer emerge as the main challenger. This was the beginning of Sidhu’s strengthening his fight within the party. It was after Jalandhar Cantt MLA Pargat Singh, who too had picked up the gauntlet against the CM, reached out to Sidhu that the latter met a few ministers and MLAs in Chandigarh. As the party crisis precipitated in Punjab, the party high command was forced to intervene, and the balance started tilting. However, most of MLAs still did not side with Sidhu even if they did not support Capt Amarinder in their feedback to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Of the several events that made Amarinder lose ground in this battle and worked in Sidhu’s favour, three left a marked impression — warning to Pargat by the CM’s close aide, reported use of dossiers on MLAs which Amarinder later denied and the decision to appoint sons of two MLAs as police inspector and naib tehsildar. Thereafter, outgoing PCC president Sunil Jakhar’s move on Sunday forenoon to call a meeting of party MLAs and District Congress Committee presidents made the central leadership to announce Sidhu’s appointment with four working presidents. Jakhar later cancelled the meeting after the announcement. Others who lost the roundIt is not just Capt Amarinder Singh who has lost this round to Sidhu. Some senior party leaders too have eaten a humble pie. MP Ravneet Bittu was the first to attack Sidhu. He brought in the argument of ‘Taksali’ Congress leaders, which was followed by others, including Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo. However, it failed to work and Pargat even called it hollow. MP Manish Tewari made the last-ditch effort to block Sidhu by playing the ‘social interest groups’ card and even gave out a percentage of Hindus, Sikhs and Dalits, apparently to argue for communal balance. The meeting of nine party MPs at Bajwa’s residence in Delhi, ostensibly to discuss strategy for Parliament session, also failed to make any impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/what-helped-capt-in-15-now-works-for-navjot/articleshow/84567885.cms||IP Singh
---||Nagpur||In Chandrapur, schools reach doorsteps of students||NAGPUR: Elementary education in rural areas had taken a hit due to poor digital connectivity and even access, and now reopening of physical classrooms only for high school students had potential to further increase the learning gap for the younger ones. However, in Chandrapur, zilla parishad school teachers have taken it upon themselves to ensure that such students do not loose out on their studies. Chandrapur district education officer Ulhas Narad said, “Our teachers rode off to villages all across and landed up at their students’ homes. There they are taking regular classes, giving them assignments and following up on their next visit.” Visiting daily is not always possible for every teacher, depending on the distance they travel, hence follow up is done through homework and other practical assignments like craft etc. “Teachers have taken it up as a mission and that’s why this project is so successful. We know many students in rural areas either don’t have a smartphone or financial resources to recharge it even if the connectivity is somewhat okay,” said Narad. Moreover, teachers are not asking for special privileges once they reach the students’ villages. Classes are being taken inside modest dwellings, courtyard or even on the pavement. “These children need one-to-one interaction with their teachers. Familiar faces are very important, especially for the smaller kids, because they need to learn without getting overawed by a stranger,” said Narad. Due to phone connectivity issues, TOI could not get in touch with some parents, but Narad claimed they are happy about this project. “Each parent, from every strata of the society, only wants the best for his/her child. And the priority is education. So teachers are welcomed in every village and the respect which they command among every parent is notable,” he said. In Maharashtra, schools in rural areas can reopen for physical classes if village sarpanch gives permission. The sarpanch has been made head of a special committee at gram panchayat level, which will approve applications for reopening of schools considering the Covid situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-chanda-schools-reach-doorsteps-of-students/articleshow/84565476.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

This is the first step for the legal battle. The case has been filed in the city of Bale in Switzerland. The petitioners include a survivor of the 2017 pesticide poisoning incident and widows of two deceased persons. The case was filed in September last year with the help of an NGO Pesticide Action Network (PAN)-India. The documents were filed after the first step of out of court settlement did not materialize. The petitioners have claimed damages from Syngenta International as they contend that the victims had suffered pesticide poisoning on using Polo — a brand made by Syngenta. “As a part of the process, rounds of online talks were held between the petitioners and the company between May and June. The petitioners had maintained their stance that it was due to Polo that they had suffered the accidental pesticide poisoning. However, as no settlement could be achieved, the matter will have to be fought in the court,” said Narasimha Reddy of PAN-India. As a next step, all the relevant documents were filed in the Swiss court on July 8 and 9. These include medical papers and other reports to support the case, said Reddy. PAN-India has, however, not disclosed names of the petitioners, citing security reasons. As it is summer in Switzerland at present, there is vacation in the courts. The matter is expected to be heard as the courts reopen, he said. In 2017, as much as 80 persons, mainly farm labourers, had died due to accidental inhalation of pesticide fumes while spraying in the fields. Most of the deaths took place in Yavatmal district. Apart from the dead, the number of persons who took ill also ran into hundreds. Five pesticide formulations profenofos-cypermethrin, monocrotophos, profenil-imidachlopr . asataf, and difenthiron were found to be used by the victims. Polo has difenthiron in it. The five formulations were banned by state government for two months from time to time after that. The last ban was imposed in 2019. There was no ban on 2020, as no deaths were reported. A permanent ban has to come from the Centre, however. Even as the field offices of agriculture department can send recommendation, it is up to the state government to issue the ban order. There has been no ban this year either, said sources in the agriculture department. IN A NUTSHELL In 2017, 80 persons — mainly farm — workers had died due to accidental inhalation of pesticides Highest such deaths happened in Yavatmal district Total five formulations were found to be used by the victims The formulations were banned for two months of spraying season from time to time, including in 2019.

Constable Rajendra Shegar was felicitated by joint commissioner, traffic, Yashavi Yadav and was rewarded a sum of Rs 15,000 later the same day. Shegar was on night duty at the Kandivli traffic chowky on SV Road on Sunday. Post midnight, about three to four-feet deep water had accumulated on the road. The water had even entered into the chowky. Shegar and his colleagues were busy moving files and equipment to a dry spot when around 2.20am, a man and his daughter were spotted on the stretch outside the chowky. The man, later identified as Arvind Thakkar, was a local resident. He was headed to his brother’s home with his daughter Dhwani as water had entered their house. “The water was about knee deep. Dhwani was initially holding her father’s hand and walking. Later, Thakkar lifted her up and continued to walk. He was finding it difficult as it was raining heavily all along,” said Shegar. Towards the end of the footpath, Thakkar lost his footing and slipped. “Dhwani fell from his arms straight into the knee-deep water. Thakkar fell on top of her and hurt his knee. I rushed out of the chowky and got the child out before the water could enter her mouth and nose,” said Shegar. A video clip captured the cop carrying the child to her uncle’s residence nearby, with her father walking behind them. “We are thankful to the constable for coming to our rescue,” said Thakkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-traffic-cop-rushes-to-save-6-yr-old-who-fell-on-flooded-rd-rewarded/articleshow/84567862.cms||---

The drain in Kamela road locality here is full of silt and garbage. A team of six people from Meerut Nagar Nigam and four JCB machines were deployed to search for him. Till evening, no trace of the boy had been found. Tasneem Ali, father of Anas who fell into the drain, told TOI that he was eldest among his three children and was last seen crossing the iron bridge over the drain. “My neighbour saw him slipping off the portable bridge. A few locals jumped into the drain to save him but the flow of the water was so swift that he vanished within seconds. The fact that the drain is full of garbage, has made it all the more difficult to find him,” added the wailing man, a daily wager. According to officials, the drain is about 12 feet deep. The iron bridge from where the child slipped into the drain was placed a few years ago though residents had repeatedly complained to the authorities concerned that it was a very unsafe way for commuting as its width is barely 2.5 feet. Ramsajeevan Yadav, Lisadigate police station in-charge, said the boy fell into the drain around 11:30 am and the rescue operation started around noon.“ A team of six workers from Nagar Nigam and four JCB machines continuously searched for the boy in the stretch of around 2 km. The rescue operation continued till late evening but the boy couldn’t be traced,” added the policeman. Meanwhile, the city road turned into a virtual pond with barely 50 mm of rainfall till 5:30 pm on Monday. At many places, drains, including the Abu Nallah, were overflowing with dirty water and filth. Interior areas in Lal Kurt and Hapur Adda witnessed waterlogging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/search-on-for-boy-who-fell-into-flooded-drain-in-meerut/articleshow/84563178.cms||Ishita Mishra

Of then seven accused, five have been arrested. A team led by Sandip Kolekar, the inspector of the Karveer police station, had raided the house on Sunday afternoon. Kolekar said upon instructions from deputy superintendent of police Mangesh Chavan, his team went along with health officials of Karveer tehsil for the raid. “We found one Mahesh Subrao Patil (30) trying to determine the sex of the foetus of a pregnant woman who had come with her relative. We also nabbed the agents who are involved in getting clients for sex determination. The two agents — Bharat Jadhav and Sachin Ghatage — said they get Rs 12,000 as commission for every case they refer. Patil was assisted by Rani Kamble who managed to give us a slip,” he said. The police found some ampoules, injections, cotton swabs with blood, unused syringes, used needles, medicines and Rs 30,000 in a bag left by Kamble. The bag also had two diaries with names of agents and pregnant women who had undergone sex determination tests. “We have also arrested the owner of the house — Satappa Krushna Khade — and Anil Bhimrao Mali, the husband of the pregnant woman. The court has sent all five suspects to police custody till July 22,” Kolekar said. Police claimed the suspects were also carrying out illegal abortion. “Both Patil and Kamble used to claim they are doctors and have degrees to show. However, in reality, they do not have any qualification to carry out sex determination. Patil said he brought the sonography machine from a person named Sunny, alias Gajendra Kusale, from Radhanagari tehsil way back in 2017. We will investigate whether a big racket is involved in this sex determination racket. Also we will dig up the roots by contacting all those who have undergone sex determination,” he added. The woman who had come for sex determination has claimed that she has two daughters and her family members forced her to undergo sex determination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/5-arrested-for-involvement-in-illegal-sex-determination/articleshow/84565490.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Cybercrime cops struggle to get response from app firms||AURANGABAD: With several mobile-based internet calling and social media application companies failing to respond to requests seeking details of certain users, the cybercrime branch is finding it difficult to make a breakthrough in some of the complaints that the police deem to be fit. Cybercrime inspector Geeta Bagwade said, “Some of the social media and internet calling application companies are totally irresponsive to our requests. In some cases, we have been following up for several months, but are yet to receive any response.” The officer said most of the irresponsive application companies neither have their own servers nor any nodal officer in India — which makes it easy for them to evade queries posed by the local police. In one case, a professor is allegedly being harassed with vile and vulgar messages. In another, morphed content is being shared with the intention to defame a married woman. There are other cases of similar nature and the cybercrime police are struggling to get responses in these matters. Bagwade said that in most of the cases, the nodal officers of the said companies have not replied at all, while in some cases, they have replied seeking ‘letters rogatory’ (LRs). Cybercrime police officials suspect that these companies are well aware of the lengthy process involving LRs, and this is their way of avoiding helping the law enforcement agencies here. Cyber police officials said the process of getting LRs is lengthy and time-consuming. LR are basically letters of request sent by the court or competent authority of one country to the court or competent authority of another country to obtain assistance in investigation or prosecution in a criminal matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cybercrime-cops-struggle-to-get-response-from-app-firms/articleshow/84565543.cms||Mohammed Akhef

It will cater to the growing demand for public transport in central and south Mumbai as these areas have seen a huge decline in the number of Kaali Peelis — from 55,000 cabs a few years back to 17,000 plying on road at present,” said Thampy Kurien from Mumbai Rickshawmen’s Union. Another auto union, Nav Bharatiya Shiv Vahtuk Sanghatana also demanded that autos be allowed to ply in island city “In 1973, when the first auto permits opened in the city, it was agreed not to serve island city to protect the business of Kaali Peeli taxis. But now the situation is different and aggregator taxis have entered these areas,The considerations under which the auto services were disallowed from these areas are no longer relevant,” said union leader Maqbool Mujawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/unions-propose-e-autos-on-roads-seek-nod-to-ply-inside-island-mumbai-city/articleshow/84567942.cms||Somit Sen

Fire department sources said that the woman had locked herself up in the balcony of her apartment around 10pm on Sunday. Fearing that she may take the extreme step, the family members called the police control room and the fire department was subsequently informed. On realizing the gravity of the situation, fire department pressed all available sources to save the woman. “We rushed in our turntable ladder truck which can go up to 54 metres. Fearing that she might jump when we try to reach her, we all installed a safety jumping cushion,” said a fire official. Meanwhile, another team of firemen prepared itself to reach the balcony through a rope suspended from the balcony right above 10th floor. All this while, the rescuers were shouting to convince the woman to not jump. “It was a critical situation, so we continuously talked to her to divert her mind,” the official said. However, a fireman was able to jump into the balcony through the rope and he pulled the woman backwards. The operation lasted for about 30 minutes but during the entire time, the family members and the other residents of the complex were nervous and on their toes. Fire officials said that the woman had attempted suicide twice in the past due to her mental health condition. “The family members said that she is a patient of clinical depression because of the death of her uncle some years ago and of her father last year,” the fire official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/woman-saved-from-suicide-bid/articleshow/84563242.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Three years after deadline, SIT quietly submits HT cotton seeds report||NAGPUR: Amid the Covid pandemic, the special investigation team (SIT) probing spread of illegal herbicide tolerant (HT) cotton seeds in the state quietly submitted its report six months ago. The two-member team was headed by special IG of police Krishna Prakash. The SIT was formed in February 2018 and was originally mandated to submit the report after a month of its formation. Earlier, it was headed by Sanjay Barve, an IPS officer who was then commissioner of state’s intelligence department. He was replaced by Prakash in a week of the SIT’s formation. Subhash Nagare, joint director of agriculture for Amravati division, was the member-secretary. Even as it took more than three years for the report to be finalized, the department of agriculture remains clueless about the findings. It has been learnt that the report has been submitted to the principal secretary (agriculture) Eknath Dawale. There have been no further orders on the basis of it, so far. Both Dawale and Prakash could not be contacted for a comment and SMS seeking their response also went unanswered. It has been learnt that even as the report has been put up by the SIT, a little has happened after that down the line in the department. The contents of the report have not been known in the department. The issue of HT cotton seeds came up during the same time when pesticide poisoning cases were reported in the state. HT seeds are a genetical engineered to be resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides (weed killers). The technology has been developed by US seed giant Monsanto, which has now been acquired by Bayer. Monsanto is also one of the major producers of glyphosate. If HT seeds are used in large-scale, then it would also increase the demand for glyphosate, which is legally available in the country. For the Indian market, Monsanto-Mahyco had entered into a tie-up and the latter had conducted trials for HT seeds. In 2016, the trials were withdrawn due to issues related to intellectual property rights (IPR). However, in the meantime, the technology which was yet to be given legal seal in the country was leaked. Since then, the seeds are easily available in the grey market. The SIT was formed to probe how the grey market worked and the network that smuggled the seeds into Maharashtra. There is also a theory, though not proven, that the seeds were stolen during the trial. The SIT, however, took a long time seeking extension after extension as the report could not be prepared. In 2019, Shetkari Sanghatana had protested by openly sowing HT cotton seeds demanding that the technology should be legalized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-yrs-after-deadline-sit-quietly-submits-ht-cotton-seeds-report/articleshow/84565565.cms||Shishir Arya

He quotes Rs 55,000 for his Beetal male weighing over 90kg. K Parimal, a farmer from Hingna tehsil, is ready to sell off his local breed goat weighing over 50kg for even Rs25,000. Despite lowering the asking price, both fail to attract buyers at the traditional bakramandi, which comes up near the now-defunct municipal slaughter house ahead of Eid-ul-Adha every year. Loss of income, Covid-hit families and local restrictions have contributed to the sluggish mood during the festival. Usually, sellers would see brisk business and fetch good prices in the run up to Eid, which falls on Wednesday this time. On Monday at around 5pm, Mominpura markets were open with goat sellers and limited buyers moving around despite Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s 4pm deadline for all non-emergency outdoor activities. “I would be happy if I get Rs45,000. I would have asked for Rs70,000 if things were good,” said Humayun, who travelled over 300km to reach the city. Parimal has been an annual seller at Mominpura. “I may have to return today. I will incur double the transport cost,” he said Over the years, the occasion has offered business opportunity for local residents as the area attracts buyers from many places. Mohd Iqbal, a resident of Boriapura, frets over the loss of some goats to disease due to rains, and rest of them not selling at desired rates. “In 2019, I sold 350 goats at least a week before Eid. This time, I have brought just 50% livestock and still 45 of them are unsold,” he said. Iqbal would earn around Rs1 lakh from the annual sale. For his remaining animals, he is depending on commission agents. “I am selling for a profit ranging from Rs500 to Rs2,500. In case an agent gets me a customer, I have to part with Rs500 as commission,” he said. Iqbal added that because of poor prospects here, many merchants have preferred Raipur and Hyderabad in search of higher rates. Mohammad Shariq, a resident of Mominpura, said the haggling and negotiations go on till 11pm in the open space at the erstwhile slaughter house. “The cops come a couple of times in the day and ask them to leave. Kalmana APMC has a better facility for merchants and animals, but it has been kept shut due to restrictions. There is no place so goats get drenched and become prone to diseases. These fears are on the mind of sellers, which makes them give away goats at lower prices,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mominpura-goat-market-cuts-a-sorry-figure-ahead-of-eid/articleshow/84563220.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

As the Pegasus spyware scandal unravelled within and outside Parliament, the CM termed it a “shocking assault” on India’s democratic polity by the Union government, which had compromised national security with the act, which he described as shameful. The CM said such snooping could not have been undertaken by the Israeli company without the central government’s go-ahead. He said this showed the NDA government had put sensitive information into the hands of global agencies, governments and organisations with the potential to misuse it against the country. “This is not only an attack on individual freedom, but also on the security of our nation,” he said, urging the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter and take action against the NDA government. “The central government cannot get away with this. They have committed a horrendous sin, and they have to be made to pay for it,” said Captain Amarinder. “Nobody has the right to intrude into the lives of its people, leave alone enter their bedrooms, as this government has done.” Terming the developments as part of a pattern of the BJP-led government of India to destroy all democratic institutions and stifle the voice of the opposition, the chief minister lashed out at the central government for the reprehensible act, “which has set a new low in India’s democratic history”. “No government in any part of the world has ever put the security and safety of its own institutions and people at stake in this manner before,” said Amarinder, adding that there appeared to be a global conspiracy to target India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pegasus-scandal-amarinder-says-bjp-govt-risked-national-security/articleshow/84567934.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat’s second Ro-Ro service set for flag off||RAJKOT: Gujarat’s second Ro-Ro ferry service connecting India’s biggest private port Mundra and Vadinar is all set to commence next month. The sea route of 53 km is expected to give major fillip to some of the major industries like ceramics in Morbi, brass parts in Jamnagar and engineering goods in Rajkot. Highly placed sources confirmed to TOI that the cargo vessel to be operated by Adani Group has got most of the clearances to start the service. Vadinar is owned by central government-run Deendayal Port Trust (DPT), formerly Kandla, which passed a proposal in its board meeting held last month to allow Adani Logistics Ltd to use Ro-Ro jetty at Vadinar for commencing this service. It’s learnt that Adani will operate the cargo vessel in a joint venture with a private ferry operator. Talking to TOI, SK Mehta, chairman of DPT, said, “We have given all the permissions and obtained all regulatory approvals too. Mundra and Vadinar both have cargo jetties. We expect to commence the service by the end of this month or beginning of next month.” One pending approval from Directorate General of Shipping is also expected in the next 10 days, sources said. The Ro-Ro vessel will have a capacity to carry 24 trucks. The export cargo from ceramic, engineering, brass, chemical and detergent and import scrap for engineering and brass industry will be benefited in a big way. According to a rough estimate, over 500 trucks ply to and fro from Mundra, Morbi, Rajkot and Jamnagar every day. The cargo imported at Mundra port has to travel 270 km to reach Jamnagar, but if loaded in a Ro-Ro vessel and unloaded at Vadinar, it will take just 53 km to reach Jamnagar. In the same way, the distance of 250 km between Rajkot and Mundra will be reduced to just 140 km from Vadinar. The Ro-Ro service will help reduce traffic on the road, vehicular pollution and provide cost effectiveness. Aashish Joshi, managing committee member of Gandhidham Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) and a custom house agent said, “We are still not clear about how cost effective the service will prove to be. Morbi is in the center and they may prefer to handle cargo by road because Vadinar-Morbi distance is again 150 km.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gujarats-second-ro-ro-service-set-for-flag-off/articleshow/84563307.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

He claimed that in the ongoing battle of chair and existence between chief minister Amarinder Singh and Sidhu, the latter has finally put the former on the mat. Sharma said that Congress has again divided Punjab into Hindus and Sikhs, by making one president and four working presidents. The days of atrocities by the Congress government in Punjab are over and people will teach them such a lesson this time that it will never be able to see the face of power again, he added. The Congress high command has handed over the command of the party in the state to Sidhu, but this fight is not over yet, the BJP leader claimed. Congress’s this condition is not only in Punjab but also in other states, he said. Sharma also wanted to know whether the allegations made by Sidhu against Amarinder have now ended with his appointment as PCC chief or were these limited just to get the chair? Sidhu will have to answer this to the public, he said. Sharma said that Sidhu was missing from his constituency for the last four and a half years and the people has even put up posters of his disappearance. He said a leader who can disappea,r leaving the people of his constituency unclaimed, how will he handle the Congress as its president? Sharma also said that one who cannot do good to the people of his assembly constituency, how will he save the sinking boat of Congress? In the battle for power and the chair waged by Sidhu, only the general public has suffered, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/political-journey-of-jumlas-jokes-has-started-bjp/articleshow/84567972.cms||---

The state education department sends money for the books through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme directly into the registered bank accounts of the students, but there were complaints that students were finding it difficult to buy books especially due to the Covid-induced lockdown. The department, therefore, decided to deliver the books to the students. However, the department is yet to provide schoolbooks to the students which is hampering their education. The tender process is not completed yet and it is expected to take another month to deliver academic books to every child. The plan to carry out this task is yet to be finalised.

Gonishetty Harish was feared dead in a stream close to Pochera waterfalls in Adilabad’s Boath mandal. His body is yet to be traced. Harish of Karanji village in Jainad mandal was married only nine months ago and his father, who was a cancer patient, had passed away recently. Sunday being a holiday, Harish along with three of his friends went to the waterfalls, 47 km from Adilabad, on a picnic in the afternoon. Ramesh and Adepu Venkat came from Maharashtra, while another friend, Ramesh, came from Adilabad. As it rained heavily in the evening, Harish and Adilabad’s Ramesh tried to get back to the place where they had parked their vehicles. As the swirling waters rose, Harish and Ramesh were pushed deep into the flowing water. Both tried to help each other by hanging on to a bridge at the picnic spot but Harish was swept away while trying to rescue Ramesh. The latter could get a grip on the bridge and climbed to safety. Expert divers were pressed to trace the body. “A search was carried out along a 5km stretch by 20 members involved in the operation but we have not been able to trace him,” Boath circle inspector Sailu told TOI. He said heavy rain was hampering their efforts. “We will continue the search operation on Tuesday to trace Harish’s body,” he said. Harish and Ramesh were pushed deep into the water.

He succeeds L Ramana, who has resigned from the TDP and joined the ruling TRS recently. A Dalit leader and a veteran who has been with the party since its inception in 1982, Narasimhulu (71) said he would strive to bring back TDP’s past glory in Telangana. His appointment on Monday was welcomed by party cadre who burst crackers at the party office, NTR Bhavan, here. TDP national president N Chanadrababu Naidu issued a statement on the appointment of Narasimhulu, who served as a legislator between 1994 and 1999. Former Rajya Sabha member Ravula Chandrasekhar Reddy and senior leader Arvind Kumar Goud were among those who were considered for the top post but the party leadership chose the Dalit leader, sources said. Party sources said Naidu selected Narasimhulu to lead the party in Telangana as TDP’s BC plank did not work. Ramana is a BC commnity leader and served as party chief for seven years. Speaking to TOI, Narasimhulu said his priority will be to rebuild the party from scratch. He asserted that his party would fight against corruption of the TRS government. “We will begin the membership drive again. I had taken a vow before Lord Venkateswara that I will never leave the party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ex-mla-bakkani-is-new-ttdp-chief/articleshow/84567976.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

He said that despite being in power for four-and-a-half years, these Congressmen never fought for Punjab and issues faced by the people of Punjab, but only to grab or save the chair. “As the situation prevails, it seems unlikely that Navjot Singh Sidhu as Punjab Congress president will quell the infighting within the Congress,” he added. Chadha, along with leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, were speaking to the media after inducting 2017 Congress candidate Ranjit Singh Rana and Kapurthala District Youth Congress president, advocate Harsimran Singh Ghuman in the party. Responding to a question, Chadha said although it was an internal issue of the Congress, but being the ruling party, its strife had caused a lot of damage to Punjab. “Our best wishes to Sidhu.

Narayan Gayke, the 32-year-old accused currently posted as the child welfare project officer in Paranda, allegedly sought the bribe to clear the LPG bill worth Rs 5.6 lakh. Superintendent of police (ACB) Rahul Khade said one of the LPG agencies had bagged the tender to provide LPG connections to the Aanganwadis in Paranda. The officer allegedly demanded a bribe to clear the bills. As per the complaint lodged with the ACB, the agency proprietor had the contract to provide each connection for Rs 6,533. Gayke, who is just a year into the service, allegedly demanded Rs 563.5 for each connection. Initially, the agency proprietor negotiated the bribe amount. However, after the official refused to accept anything less than Rs 40,000, he decided to contact the ACB. On cross-verifying the authenticity of the complaint, ACB found it to be true and accordingly, a trap was set on Sunday. Soon after arresting the accused, a search was carried out at his residence and he was sent behind bars at the Paranda-based police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/child-welfare-officer-lands-in-acb-net/articleshow/84565666.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: 70 years on, Hastinapur excavations looking for 'Mahabharata' link||MEERUT: In search for the legend of Hastinapur, capital of the Kauravas in the epic ‘Mahabharata’, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will start excavations at the site, about 40km from Meerut — the first major project there in 70 years. The plan is to look for new evidence to ground the ‘Mahabharata’ in history and preserve earlier finds. “As of now, the focus is on conserving exposed areas of the mounds and giving a facelift to old temples. A bit of landscaping, too. We will look into excavations after September, when the Monsoon is over,” superintending archaeologist of the newly-created Meerut circle of ASI, Brajsunder Gadnayak, told TOI. “Hastinapur is among five sites whose development has been proposed by the Centre.” The 2020 Budget had identified Hastinapur, along with Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Sivasagar (Assam), Dholavira (Gujarat) and Adichallanur (Tamil Nadu), to be revamped as “iconic” sites. The first excavation at Hastinapur goes back to 1952, when the archaeologist Prof BB Lal concluded that the “Mahabharata period” was around 900 BCE and the city was washed away by a flooded Ganga. Lal, known for his “discovery” of 12 temple pillars beneath the Babri Masjid that coincided with the revival of the Ram Janmabhoomi demand in 1990 and provided the interpretive framework for the court-appointed Ayodhya excavation team, was a strong believer in the historicity of religious epics and myths. “No concrete development took place after that,” Dr KK Sharma, associate professor of history at Multanimal Modi College in Modinagar, said. Then, in 2006, the discovery of an ancient burial ground in Sinauli, about 90km from Hastinapur, and that of a bronze “horse-driven war chariot” in 2018 catalysed the theory that the findings were from the “Mahabharata period” — because the epic mentioned chariots — and pushed back the period itself to 2000 BCE. Sharma was part of the 2006 Sinauli excavation. In August last year, pottery dating back to the 3rd century BCE was discovered at a Hastinapur mound after incessant rain. “The design was identical to the findings at Ahichchhatra, an ancient mound in Bareilly’s Aonla tehsil,” Sharma said. Ahichchhatra has been mentioned in the ‘Mahabharata’ as the capital of northern Panchala. In fact, it was pottery from “Mahabharata sites” like Hastinapur, Mathura, Kurukshetra and Kampilya that Lal believed was proof that connected them all. When the Meerut circle of ASI was created in January this year, officials had said the new circle would focus on Hastinapur. On Saturday, ASI joint director Dr Sanjay Manjul and regional director Aarti visited Hastinapur. By Monday, ASI officials began camping at the Pandava mound, where the epic says the Pandavas lived. Two sites there have been marked for the expedition kick-off. Could Hastinapur reveal a bigger secret than Sinauli? Gadnayak said, “Only time will tell.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/70-yrs-on-hastinapur-excavations-looking-for-mahabharata-link/articleshow/84563388.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Mumbai||In 4 days, Mumbai receives 65% of rain for July; month average exceeded||MUMBAI: The intense downpour since last Friday has ensured that the city has received more than the entire July average rainfall of 827mm. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)’s Santacruz observatory recorded 920mm of rainfall for the month till 8.30am on Monday. During the day, it recorded another 36.8mm, taking the monthly total to 956.8mm. Almost 65% of the total rainfall in July was recorded after July 15—once again showing how extreme weather events are getting increasingly common in Mumbai. The IMD data shows over a span of 48 hours between July 15-16 and July 17-18, the city recorded triple-digit rainfall (see box). Meanwhile, since June 1 this year, IMD’s Santacruz observatory has recorded a total of 1,881.4mm, which is also 85% of the season’s average rainfall. If the rain continues at this rate, Mumbai could record its wettest July ever, considering that 1,468.5mm in 2014 has been the maximum for the month so far. In 2005, when tragic Mumbai floods had followed 944mm of rain in just 24 hours, the month had recorded 1,454.5mm. On Monday, IMD upgraded its alert for the city from orange to red, indicating extremely heavy rainfall for the entire MMR. The eastern suburbs of the city and adjoining areas such as Thane and Navi Mumbai, including Panvel and Raigad, recorded “massive rainfall”. Officials said this intense spell is likely to continue. IMD scientist Shubhangi Bhute said, “We expect heavy rain in the coming days as well and a red alert has been especially issued for the Ghat areas.” IMD has issued an orange alert, indicating heavy to very heavy rain at a few places, from July 20 to 23. It said due to such heavy rain, the expected impact includes localized flooding in low-lyingareas, the possibility of flash floods in some localities, minor damage to kutcha roads, landslide, mudslide and rock falls in vulnerable spots, and local disruption of water and electricity. Meanwhile, the rainfall has brought down maximum and minimum temperatures. The difference between maximum and minimum temperatures has shrunk too. On Monday, IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded a maximum temperature of 27.9 degree Celsius and Colaba 27.8 degrees while the minimum temperature recorded by IMD’s Colaba and Santacruz observatories was 25.5 degrees and 25 degrees, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-4-days-mumbai-receives-65-of-rain-for-july-mth-avg-exceeded/articleshow/84565689.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Mumbai||2008 Malegaon blast: Bombay HC hears Prasad Purohit appeal||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday concluded hearing Lt Col Prasad Purohit in his appeal against a special trial court order, which said the issue of a prior sanction for his prosecution as an Army officer in discharge of official duties could be considered at the fag end of the 2008 Malegaon blast trial. The blast had claimed six lives. Shrikant Shivade, his counsel, said the Supreme Court had directed that the issue of sanction be decided at the time of framing of charges. By keeping it at the end, though, the trial court is defeating the SC order, said Shivade. He added the trial court be directed to decide whether a prima facie case is made out for grant of sanction at the earliest in consonance with the 2020 SC order. Sandesh Patil, counsel for National Investigation Agency (NIA), opposing any relief to Purohit, said the special court had, in a detailed order, set out “seven different reasons” as to why it cannot be held that Purohit was acting in discharge of official duty. Patil said the trial court has, contrary to the defence counsel submission, considered the issue and Purohit himself has in three separate proceedings agitated the similar issue.  HC has now posted the matter to July 30 for B A Desai, counsel for one of the 2008 Malegaon blast victims’ families, to argue against Purohit’s plea. Purohit, an Army officer, was arrested in the terror case and spent eight to nine years “suffering”, said Shivade. Purohit was granted bail and a “in rare case” taken back into service, said the counsel, citing letters of “commendation” from the ministry of defence. Shivade, in submissions via video-conference before the HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, said Purohit was “running a source network and was operating as he was expected and trained to and in the line of his duty as any field operator of any intelligence agency would do”. He said these documents are after the discharge order by which the court had retained the anti-terror charges under UAPA while dropping some other charges, and hence a sanction be sought on this “new material’’. If a sanction to prosecute is granted, he would have to face trial, but if not, both he and the court would be spared the trial process. The high court was told by NIA counsel 181 witnesses have been examined and 150-odd remain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/08-malegaon-blast-hc-hears-purohit-appeal-in-mumbai/articleshow/84565768.cms||Swati Deshpande

Sheela was referred to Meerut hospital due to her serious condition, police said. The main accused, Dheere, has been arrested. Bijnor’s superintendent of police (SP) Dharamveer Singh said, “Police have registered a case against Dheere and his unidentified relative under SC/ST Act. They have also been booked under IPC sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).” The case was filed on the basis of a complaint filed by Sheela’s daughter Pinki. “During investigation, it came to the fore that both the women ventured into the field of Dheere Singh, who took offence to it. When he objected to it and shouted at the women, they also shouted back. In the rage, Dheere and his relative attacked the women. The matter belongs to different castes,” the SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-dalit-women-attacked-for-entering-into-field-of-upper-caste-men/articleshow/84563436.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Nagpur||4.50 lakh tonne coal ‘missing’, minister orders probe||CHANDRAPUR: District guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Monday ordered probe into 4.50 lakh tonne coal going missing from Baranj opencast mine of Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) near Bhadravati in 2018-19. During a meeting held with collector Ajay Gulhane and others, Wadettiwar claimed he has received complaints about pilferage of 4.50 lakh tonne coal from the KPCL mine. Hence, the inquiry has been ordered to verify how and where this coal was disposed off. Baranj mines of KPCL had carried out mining in Baranj I–IV, Kiloni and Manora blocks in Bhadravati tehsil from September 2008 to March 31, 2015. The mine was shut following de-allocation of coal blocks as per Supreme Court orders in March 2015. As per records with the administration, the company had excavated 1.51 crore tonne coal till February 2015. Out of this, 1.47 crore tonne coal was dispatched and the mine was left with stock of 4.51 lakh tonne, when the mine was closed. However, entire coal had gone missing from the stock in a span of few months in 2018-19. The mining department had carried out inquiry into the matter following complaints by then Union minister of state Hansraj Ahir and former MLA Nana Shamkule. Then additional district collector Sachin Kalantre and district mining officer Gajanan Kambli had inspected the coal stock in July 2019. In their report, they had concluded that around 94,000 tonne coal was burned to ashes and nothing was left to recover. A police complaint was filed in the case, but the matter was thrown on the backburner. Based on the complaints filed with him, Wadettiwar took up the matter afresh and ordered inquiry into the loss of 4.50 lakh tonne coal. He claimed that if such a large quantity of coal had been burned, then locals would have noticed it. But no one has any information about burning of such a huge quantity of coal in the stock yard. The minister claimed there is possibility of large scale misappropriation and hence inquiry is necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-50l-tonne-coal-missing-minister-orders-probe/articleshow/84565710.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Nagpur||Government can’t fix rates for non-Covid patients in private hospitals: Supreme Court||NAGPUR: In a big respite to private hospitals across the state, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld the landmark ruling delivered by Nagpur bench of Bombay high court that the Maharashtra government can’t fix rates for non-Covid patients in such establishments. While refusing to entertain the state’s special leave petition challenging HC’s October 23 verdict, the top court’s division bench comprising justices Dhananjay Chandrachud and MR Shah refused to entertain its arguments that it was vested with powers under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. It’s a big setback to the government as it would become a law after the apex court’s ruling, according to Dr Pradeep Arora, a paediatrician, who had filed a petition in HC along with Vidarbha Hospital Association. Both challenged Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) notices to private hospitals over alleged over-charging of fees from Covid and non-Covid patients in violation of state’s two notifications of April 30 and May 4. Questioning the legality of NMC’s move initiated by its former commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, they termed it as “gross abuse and misuse of powers” by civic officials. Pointing out that the civic body’s notices were issued without any jurisdiction and would hinder medical services offered to patients at a time when entire medical fraternity is battling the deadly virus while risking their lives, the petitioners had contended that the government is neither competent nor have the authority to fix rates for non-Covid patients in private hospitals. “This is an unwarranted interference in running a medical facility that leads to harassment,” they contended. Quashing two government notifications of April 30 and May 4, 2020, for fixing rates for non-Covid patients in such establishments, the HC’s then division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande (retired) and Pushpa Ganediwala ruled that the government isn’t competent to such directives under DMA’s Section 65. This bench further held that the legislature isn’t competent under public health and sanitation, hospitals and dispensaries in Schedule VII’s List II (State List) under the Constitution of India to either frame any law/issue any direction for putting a cap on regulating rates chargeable by private hospitals for non-Covid patients. Stressing that private establishments are denied their control and regulation over 80% isolation and non-isolation beds due to government’s directives, the HC judges stated that they should be compensated under DMA’s Section 66. According to Dr Arora, who argued in person, the apex court bench flayed the government on its failure to provide adequate healthcare services to the patients during peak period of pandemic in April-May and made it clear that when private hospitals were extending their services to non-Covid patients, it has no right to interfere in that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-cant-fix-rates-for-non-covid-patients-in-private-hospitals-sc/articleshow/84565884.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Activists warn Alandi wedding crowd may lead to case surge in Pune||PUNE: Citizens, activists and doctors have claimed that crowding in marriages and violation of social distancing norms may lead to a surge in Covid cases in the temple town of Alandi, about 25km from the city. The pilgrim town has been witnessing weddings in large numbers for the past few weeks. Dr Ganpant Jadha, head of rural hospital, Alandi, said crowding in marriages had led to a surge in Covid cases at many places in the state in the recent past. “We don’t want to face a similar situation in Alandi. Although the cases in the town have reduced significantly in the last few weeks, but it is not completely Covid-free. We still get one or two Covid cases daily. Therefore, people should adhere to Covid norms sincerely to contain the spread of the virus,” he added. Ankush Jadhav, chief officer, AMC, said that at least 25 to 30 marriages take place daily. “We will hold a meeting along with the police with owners of the halls to apprise them of Covid restriction norms and possible consequences,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-warn-alandi-wedding-crowd-may-lead-to-case-surge/articleshow/84565724.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Maharashtra minister Rajesh Tope says focus on caution before any relief in curbs||PUNE: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said the state government would tread cautiously while announcing any relaxation in the Covid-induced restrictions following instructions from the Centre in anticipation of a third wave of the pandemic. “The public health department has been entrusted with the task on deciding relaxations. Unless the number of Covid cases dip significantly, we cannot decide anything. The cases have plateaued, but not dipped,” he said. Maharashtra on Sunday registered around 9,000 cases. The state has been for the past month registering cases between 7,000 and 9,000 a day and currently has 1.03 lakh active cases. On Sunday, the state’s positivity rate was 5%. Public health department records revealed that the weekly positivity rate (WPR) was highest in Nandurbar (16.8%) followed by Sangli (10.2%), Ratnagiri (9.7%), Kolhapur (9%), Gadchiroli (8.5%), Pune (7.4%), Beed (7.3%), Satara (7%) and Sindhudurg (6.6%). The weekly positive rate was based on findings through RT-PCR tests. “The situation is changing and we do not want to be caught off guard. Citizens are expecting some relaxations. But we have to go very slow with the relaxations. The focus is now more on maintaining Covid protocols and improving the situation in districts with high positivity rates,” Tope said. Sources in the government had earlier said plans were afoot to allow some relaxations for the fully vaccinated individuals in colleges, restaurants, malls and on trains. “We cannot take any chances now. All reliefs will be decided after taking experts’ views. The Centre has alerted that the next 100 days will be crucial,” he said. Relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta told TOI that the public health department should decide on the restrictions related to the pandemic. “The state task force also has to give its input. Decisions are not easy. In case of any doubt, we must tilt towards the safer side, that is towards the more stringent restrictions rather than the lenient ones. The Centre’s advice is also on the similar lines,” he said. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said Maharashtra needed to exercise utmost caution while relaxing the curbs. He said, “Maharashtra is registering 8,000-9,000 cases in a day — second highest for any state in the country. We need to intensify steps to bring down thise cases with maximum focus on the districts with a high positivity rate. Districts such as Kolhapur and Nandurbar are a worry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-says-focus-on-caution-before-any-relief-in-curbs/articleshow/84565696.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Hyderabad||Locals have no ‘time’ for Eatala’s wall clocks||Hyderabad: It appears the timing isn’t just right for Eatala Rajender and his wall clocks. While some of the constituents in his Huzurabad constituency are refusing to accept the ‘wall clocks’ as a gift, some others are leaving the gift boxes outside their houses after taking them from Eatala’s supporters. One person even went to the extent of smashing the wall clock right in front of Eatala’s wife Jamuna’s eyes. On July 17, when Jamuna was visiting a colony in Huzurabad town, she was confronted by a local for not looking into their issues. “You came along with Eatala during the last assembly elections. Why have our problems not been resolved till now,” the man asked, referring to civic amenities. The man became furious when one of the supporters accompanying Jamuna told him not to record the conversation. Enraged at this, he flung the wall clock that had been given to him on to the ground and smashed it to pieces. “You are giving us Rs 50 or Rs 100 worth wall clocks and asking us not to question you,” the man shouted at Jamuna, who was left red-faced. In another instance, a man who was distributing the wall clocks was caught by locals in Huzurabad town. They wanted to drag him to the police station. However, the man fled from the spot. Wall clocks carrying Eatala’s photograph and BJP’s symbol ‘lotus’ are being distributed in Huzurabad constituency by the former minister’s supporters as part of electioneering ahead of the forthcoming bypoll. Eatala, who quit the TRS and joined the BJP, is expected to be fielded by the saffron party in the by-election.

Taking strong objection to such an admission process, the office of deputy director of education has asked the colleges concerned not to go ahead with the formalities related to Class XI admissions until the entrance exam is over. “It has come to our notice that some junior colleges have already commenced admissions for Class XI at their level immediately after declaration of SSC result. Such admission should be stopped immediately till further notice. The state education department has already laid down a distinct procedure for admissions to junior colleges and it should be followed,” Anil Sable, deputy director of education for Aurangabad region, said on Monday. Citing two different Government Resolutions (GR) dated June 24 and June 29, Sable said those appearing for the proposed CET in question should get priority in Class XI admissions. The MSBSHSE was scheduled to start registration for CET for class XI from Monday. The entrance, which is getting organised in the wake of cancellation of SSC examination, is scheduled to take place by August 21. Educational activist Tukaram Saraf said college-level admissions without CET into consideration could further make the admission process for Class XI opaque and unaccountable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/education-dept-asks-jr-colleges-to-stop-admission-process-of-class-xi-students/articleshow/84565736.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Pune||Second wave’s ‘thick tail’ in Maharashtra has started to thin: Task force members||PUNE: The “thick tail” of Covid’s second wave in Maharashtra seems to be thinning, with a drop in new cases and increase in daily recoveries and bed availability, state task force members said on Monday. Daily cases have now dropped to 7,000-8,000 compared to the 8,000-9,000 the state was seeing in early July. Concerns about the state’s “thick tail” emerged late last month, when experts said Maharashtra’s caseload, unlike Delhi’s and Karnataka’s, was not slowing down fast enough. Daily cases here seemed to have stagnated between 8,000 and 10,000. Now, however, the fall in cases has become more apparent. “We see a glimmer of hope, except in six districts of the state. The trend of the tail thinning has already started. If it continues for the next three weeks, it could be considered thinned out,” said task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. Joshi added, “Weekly Covid trends over the last three weeks seem to show declining trends, despite high testing. The only worries are the districts of concern.” Joshi said the state’s second-wave tail is still not thinning as quickly as one would expect, with intermittent spikes such as the 9,000 new cases recorded on Sunday. “And because the state is recording the second highest number of cases in the country, curbs are still in force and we cannot afford to be complacent. We need to intensify efforts in the districts of concern,” Joshi said, adding that self-isolation levels have been poor among those testing positive. A state official said the districts of concern include Kolhapur, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sangli, Satara and Sindhudurg. High caseloads in these regions are causing the tail to thin at a slower pace, he said. “If daily cases start to fall in these districts, the state’s daily average could even drop to less than 5,000. Also, if these districts improve, we could see a major improvement by mid-August. Kolhapur is improving, but Sangli continues to see a high number of daily cases.” State’s technical advisor on Covid, Dr Subhash Salunke, who recently visited Sangli, said if districts of concern follow all Covid-appropriate norms and increase vaccination coverage, the fall in the pandemic graph could become steeper within the next three weeks. “By the middle of August, all districts are expected to show a declining trend in cases provided there is strict adherence to containment measures, including aggressive contact tracing, home quarantine and increase in vaccinations,” he said. Salunke said Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli continue to show high caseloads because, besides some super-spreader events, they had started to see second-wave spikes much later than other districts. Another task force member said, “There is no doubt that the thick tail has started to thin. It just continues to wag in some districts. It’s up to us to accelerate vaccination, and adhere to Covid-appropriate behavior to chop off the remaining tail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/second-waves-thick-tail-in-maharashtra-has-started-to-thin/articleshow/84565761.cms||Neha Madaan

The accused, Subhash, is a degree first year student from Haryana. Subhash appeared for the airman online entrance exam conducted at SEZ Technologies in Karmanghat on Monday, Saroornagar police said. “About 40 candidates appeared for the exam and chief invigilator, Varma, caught Subhash redhanded when he was trying to use an electronic device in the exam hall,” Saroornagar sub-inspector (SI) K Sanjeeva Reddy said. Police were informed about the incident and they seized a bluetooth earpiece and a cell phone from the accused. “The earpiece was placed inside the ear and the phone was concealed in his underwear. While Subhash was trying to pull out the cell phone to place it in a secret pocket, the invigilator caught him. Subhash was planning to stay in contact with unknown people to know answers,” the SI said. A case was registered under Section 420 of IPC and the Telangana Public Examinations (Prevention of Malpractice and Unfair means) Act, 1997.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/teen-caught-cheating-using-bluetooth-piece/articleshow/84569634.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Vaccination nose dip amid shortage, hesitancy||HYDERABAD: Despite several advisories about vaccination being the only effective tool against Covid-19, there is still a degree of hesitancy among people, especially in rural areas, say Telangana’s health officials. And the slowdown in the vaccination drive, over the last few days, is partly rooted in this reason along with a shortage of doses, they add. Earlier, the state was administering around 1.75 lakh doses on a daily basis. The number has now slipped to between 1.4 lakh and 1.5 lakh doses per day. According to officials, while most vaccination centres in urban areas have a decent turnout, in rural areas people still have to be persuaded to step out for the jab. “People here still have concerns about what will happen after they take the jab. Health workers have to visit their homes and educate them about the importance of the vaccine to ensure they turn up at the vaccination centres,” said Dr Swarajya Lakhsmi, district medical health officer, Rangareddy. In one case for instance, 200 people took the vaccine shot at the Keshampet primary health centre (PHC) only after being sensitised by officials. On an average, PHCs administer about 100 doses every day. Within the limits of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) too, officials say they at times have to send their staff to peoples homes to convince them about taking the Covid-19 vaccine. “We want to ensure that before another wave hits us, everyone is vaccinated. That is the only way we can restrict the mortality rate,” said a health department official. Another issue: shortage of vaccines at government centres. “Earlier, centres received stock for a week. But now there is day-to-day supply depending on the number of second doses in a particular area,” said an official. At present, no government centre is offering the first dose of Covaxin. It is only available those scheduled for their second dose. The state has even halted the vaccine drive on Wednesdays and Sundays. But not just government centres, vaccination numbers at private hospitals too are on a decline. “This could be because of a laid back attitude kicking in among people, following a dip in Covid-19 cases. Also, government hospitals are offering free vaccines to people of all age groups now. That might also be why people aren’t turning up at private hospitals,” said Amit Adilabadkar, chief brand officer of KIMS Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-nos-dip-amid-shortage-hesitancy/articleshow/84567499.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||165 nurses fired from Gandhi, Niloufer hosps||Hyderabad: As many as 95 nurses from Gandhi Hospital and 70 from Niloufer Hospital have been shown the door even as the threat of a third wave looms. While both these hospitals are identified as nodal centres in preparatory plans, health authorities maintain that the reason for releasing the nurses is the recruitment of over 2,000 permanent staff. “Recruitment of permanent staff has been completed and they have joined duties. That is why (jobs of) outsourcing nurses were terminated. Moreover, they were not given an extension of a year but their services were continued without any formal order,” said a senior official from the state health department. Government orders for recruitment of permanent staff were issued earlier this month. However, as per sources, there is a vacancy of over 7,000 staff nurses in the state currently and nearly half the permanent staff recruited were already working as contract staff. “There is still a huge vacancy in hospitals and there is a need to recruit more nurses as there is always a crunch. We have seen it during both the waves. However from what we know the government is having a cash crunch which is why the termination order was given,” said a source from the Gandhi hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/165-nurses-fired-from-gandhi-niloufer-hosps/articleshow/84567721.cms||---

HC asks Secunderabad Cantonment Board||HYDERABAD: Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili of the Telangana high court on Monday directed the central government and Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) to clarify doubts and apprehensions of the people on the functioning of an incomplete board and the validity of its decisions. The judge was hearing a petition filed by G Vittal Reddy, ex-member of the SCB, who said the authorities were allowing the board to commence functioning without nominating a local representative from the civil society as a member. “Apart from an army commander, the CEO of the board, Centre should nominate a local representative from civil society. Without this location representative, we cannot presume that the board has the quorum to meet and decide issues,” petitioner’s counsel Daraboina Subrahmanyam said. “We gave a representation to the CEO of the board to declare the meeting of the board held on April 17 as invalid but we did not get any response...The two-member board was meeting and taking independent decisions without any public representatives. They even stopped water supply to the local area,” the counsel contended. Refuting the allegations, SCB standing counsel KR Koteswara Rao said that the petitioner has no locus standi and is not an aggrieved party. “A valid board has been constituted. CEO and members were nominated. As far as local member is concerned, Centre will nominate such members to all cantonment boards and would soon notify the same,” he said. “GoI has to nominate one member as per 13 (2) C of the Act. They will issue a separate notification after taking nominated members for all the boards.13(3). Centre shall notify the nomination. In a three-member board, two members form quorum and hence can meet and transact business. We have not stopped the water supply to anyone,” the SCB’s standing counsel said. The judge directed the authorities to take a decision on the representation submitted by the petitioner and give clarity on the issues raised by him within three weeks. The petitioner, an ex-SCB member said that no representative from the civil society had been appointed to the board which had been holding meetings and taking decisions.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: No word on reopening colleges, students irked||HYDERABAD: At a time when several states and Union Territories have reopened medical and dental colleges for physical classes, the Telangana government’s failure to do so has irked several students. In its guidelines issued in November last year, the National Medical Commission (NMC) had asked central and state governments to take steps for reopening of medical and dental colleges from December 1, 2020. While the second wave of Covid-19 delayed physical reopening of colleges, many states and UTs such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Puducherry have recently declared reopening of colleges for practical sessions. Students said that attending only online classes without having any practical exposure is turning out to be a major challenge for many. “We are being taught some very important clinical concepts using PPTs and videos. While they are effective, we have no practical knowledge. How would we become good surgeons or doctors if we don’t have any practical knowledge with patients?” said Mohan Dharavath, a second year student at Osmania Medical College. The NMC, in its recommendations, had stated that the reopening of colleges will relieve the teaching and academic staff, as well as students from uncertainties regarding students’ career, mode of functioning including the conduct of physical classes. Many have taken to social media seeking immediate reopening of medical and dental colleges in Telangana latest by August. “Felt ashamed being a young medico after listening the news of movie theaters reopening in Telangana. Is reopening medical colleges not a worthy thing than theaters?” tweeted Shiva Rayakanti. When TOI reached out to the Kaloji Narayana University of Health Sciences (KNRUHS) authorities, they said that they are deliberating on reopening of colleges. “We have received several representations from the parents and students seeking reopening of colleges for practical lessons. We have forwarded the same to the state government and have sought necessary instructions. In the next few days, we can expect some decision to be taken,” said KNRUHS registrar, Dr D Praveen Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-word-on-reopening-colleges-students-irked/articleshow/84569662.cms||Preeti Biswas

While the current runway capacity of the international facility stands at 36 aircraft per hour, the additions are likely to increase the movements to more than 45 aircraft per hour. Along with this, the GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHAIL) has also successfully commissioned its primary runway after major rehabilitation works. “The new RETs will improve operational efficiency. They are designed to allow aircraft to taxi off the runaway at relatively shorter distance and, hence, increase runway capacity. In addition to this, rehabilitation will increase the Pavement Classification Number (PCN) and friction values of the runway, thereby enhancing safety of aircraft being operated,” GHIAL said in its statement. Apart from this, RGIA hit another green landmark with 98% of its airside lighting (airfield signage, taxiway centerline lights, runway lights) being converted to energy- efficient LED lighting||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/airport-adds-4-rapid-exit-taxiways/articleshow/84569533.cms||---

This is the first time in this wet season that water stocks have increased so rapidly, surpassing the total on the same date last year. Between Sunday and Monday, the catchment areas received 150-300 mm of rain. With heavy rainfall continuing all through Monday as well, officials said they expect a further rise in levels by Tuesday. Total water stocks, as on Monday 6am, stood at 4.15 lakh million litre or 28.7%—up from 3.9 lakh million litre or 19.8% on Sunday at 6am. Bhatsa, the biggest lake supplying water to Mumbai, got 201mm rain in the 24-hour period. Since Friday’s continuous downpour, the catchment areas have recorded significant rain activity with Tulsi and Vihar lakes already overflowing. The useful content currently in Tulsi and Vihar is filled to 100% capacity while Modak Sagar has 51.3%, Tansa 54% and Bhatsa 27.5%. The percentage of water supplied by the seven lakes shows the maximum percentage of water comes from Bhatsa at 48%, Tulsi and Vihar provide around 2% of the city’s needs, Middle Vaitarna 12%, Modak Sagar 11%, Tansa 10% and Upper Vaitarna 16%. Currently, the BMC supplies around 3,420 million litre of water to Mumbai every day.

I was hoping this job will open up chances of being employed as a permanent employee in government sector, getting first priority for seats, but with this sudden termination I lost all hope,” said Sana Kauser, a nurse who was working at Niloufer Hospital. Another nurse, A Mamatha, has been participating in protests across the city ever since she got the call asking her not to return to duty. She had given up her corporate job, better offers and was infected with Covid-19 herself during the second wave. “I never thought of giving up the job despite my family asking me to as this was my only source of income and I hoped to get a permanent seat later on,” Mamata said. The chief minister had recently said that outsourced nurses working during the pandemic will be made permanent. “When the CM announced that nurses will be made permanent three months back...we were sure it will happen. We even got an extension till March 2022 but then this sudden termination came,” said M Mounika, who was working as a staff nurse at Niloufer Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sudden-job-terminations-leave-outsourced-nurses-in-the-lurch/articleshow/84569337.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Delhi||RAIN OF TERROR: YOU HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE||New Delhi: When it rains heavily in Delhi, as it did on Monday, there’s a resigned acceptance of waterlogging across the city. Flooded streets and traffic gridlocks are constants each rainy season, whether PWD and the municipal corporations have claimed to have fully unclogged the stormwater drains or not. On Monday too, it was with a defeated shrug that many Delhiites heard about the death in Pul Prahladpur and rain-related news from Narela, Lampur, Kishanganj and Dwarka plus the inundation of Vikas Marg, ITO, Najafgarh, Ring Road, Uttam Nagar and Ashram.In places like Kirari and Ramesh Enclave, water entered the houses, while shopkeepers grumbled about stocks being damaged by flooding at Sadar Bazar and Azad Market. Despite the general mayhem, a PWD official continued to placidly claim that the engineers responsible for maintaining specific areas were present at the sites from where complaints had been received and were overseeing the pumping work. “We have been working throughout the night and through the day to ensure the roads aren’t clogged,” the official said.PWD officials appeared to validate their claims by citing the conditions at Minto Bridge and Chandni Chowk, the perennial problem spots. “The main road in Chandni Chowk used to be completely submerged if it rained this heavily. Minto Bridge too used to go under. But both were absolutely clean today, thanks to the new drainage,” said one official.In south Delhi, there were complaints of waterlogging at 37 locations. Falling trees were reported from Jangpura, Kalkaji, Amar Colony, Nehru Place, Akshardham Apartments, Greater Kailash II, Chittaranjan Park and Green Park. The incessant rains lead to walls collapsing near Gitanjali Park, Sagarpur, Najafgarh and Gopal Nagar and buildings being damaged in Om Vihar, Madhuban Enclave, Madipur and Jasola Village. North Delhi Municipal Corporation reported waterlogging in Kishanganj, Kanjhawala, Jaunti Road, Ashoka Road and Mubarakpur. In Sadar Bazaar, water flowed into the warehouses and shops at Pratap Market. In east Delhi, there was waterlogging near the Ghazipur chicken market, Mother Dairy and the Pandav Nagar underpass, while a tree fell in Ashok Nagar.In Pul Prahladpur, a man reportedly drowned in the flooded underpass there. But this usual problematic spot wasn’t the only place that suffered after the incessant rainfall. Commuters were frustrated by the trying conditions and were at their wits’ end trying to find a quick route to their offices and destinations, but ended up hours late. In fact, many told TOI of having to return home because it was almost impossible to go where they were headed to.Delhi traffic police tweeted throughout the day on roads that needed to be avoided and diverted vehicles at many points, which only caused the alternative routes to become jammed. After the cave-in near the police station at Sector 17, Dwarka, the traffic cops asked motorists to avoid the stretch. Officers claimed to have increased deployment on the roads to ensure quick resolving of problems. They admitted to receiving a lot of complaints and said personnel were available on the ground to handle any issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-of-terror-you-have-been-here-before/articleshow/84565752.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||On a wing & a prayer as Delhi's infra caves in||NEW DELHI: The incessant showers on Monday led to several road cave-ins, but none so spectacular as the one in Atulya Chowed in Sector 18, Dwarka, in which a Delhi Police constable just about saved his life after his car was sucked into a gaping hole in the macadam. The incident took place around 5pm, when constable Ashwani, who is posted with Delhi Traffic Police, was on his way home after meeting a relative. Suddenly, his car went nose first into the quicksand-like portion on the road. Since the rear of the car wasn’t pulled into the hole, Ashwani shifted to the rear, opened the door there and shouted for help before a person gave him a hand and pulled him free. Soon after his escape, the constable related, “I was driving home and when I reached Atulya Chowk, my car just sank into the road. I had great difficulty opening the rear door to escape. I screamed for help and a passer-by pulled me out.” He was alone in the car when the incident took place. Shankar Choudhary, additional DCP (Dwarka), later said that the i-10 car had fallen into a hole created by a cave-in. “The car was taken out with the help of a crane and the constable escaped unhurt. Commuters are advised not to ply on this road due to the cave in,” said Choudhary. A local resident, who was present when the incident occurred, disclosed that a huge pothole next to the drain along the road hadn’t been fixed for a long time. “Due to the presence of this pothole, the rains were able to weaken the road, leading to the cave-in. The hole is so big now that two cars can fall into it,” he said. The road falls under the jurisdiction of the DDA. An agency official said the portion has been barricaded after removing the trapped vehicle. “The impacted area will be inspected tomorrow and rectification will be carried out with necessary repair,” the official added. After unceasing rainfall for hours on Monday, there were other pitfalls on several roads. Delhi Traffic Police advised commuters to avoid the Sheikh Sarai crossing due to a road cave-in on the BRT stretch. “PWD officials are repairing the damaged road. Please avoid this stretch,” the advisory cautioned. Another incident of a portion of road breaking up was reported from Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg near ITO where a tyre of a Cluster scheme bus was stuck in the hole where the road had caved in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-a-wing-a-prayer-as-city-infra-caves-in/articleshow/84565849.cms||Sakshi Chand

This week, the water will not be supplied on Thursday and from next week, there will be no supply on Wednesdays. The decision to cut water supply was taken due to depleting dam water levels. NMC’s superintending engineer Sandip Nalawade said the Gangapur dam complex, Mukane and Darna are the sources of water for the city. The water level in these dams has reduced a lot due to inadequate rains in the catchment areas. “Hence, we have decided to start a once-a-week dry day on every Wednesday until the water level in the dams increases up to 50% at least,” he added. NMC has a total water reservation of 5,500 mcft for the city, including 3,800 mcft in Gangapur dam complex, 400 mcft in Darna and 1,300 mcft. The water reservation period is between October 15, 2020 and July 31, 2021. The water levels in the Gangapur dam complex, the major source of the water for the Nashik city, has reduced to 25% of the capacity, against 38% during the same period last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-changes-water-cut-day-from-next-week/articleshow/84565796.cms||Tushar Pawar

Based of the complaint from Vijay Prabhu, Khabir Moraes, Dr Jorson Fernandes and Vishwasrao Ulhas Dessai, chief officer Violet Gomes conducted a site inspection and issued an order stating that the builder has contravened the provisions of the TCP authority and also violated municipality permissions. CMC chairperson Laxman Naik said that the town and country planning (TCP) department had not issued a hill cutting permission to the developers. Cuncolim citizens, on Monday, approached the office of the CMC chairperson demanding an immediate issuance of a stop work order to the developers. Member of the Cuncolim Citizen Forum, Fernandes submitted a written complaint to the CMC. All party members, including local BJP MLA Clafacio Dias, Congress Block president Assis Noronha, local activists and councillors were present at the municipal building to voice their protest. Naik said that the TCP has given its approval only for land filling and not hill cutting. “This is completely illegal,” he said. Dias held a meeting with the chief officer and requested that permissions granted to the builder be revoked and demanded that a stop work order be issued. Dias told TOI that he had filed a police complaint against the illegalities earlier, but that no action had been initiated against the developer. Fernandes said that the hill has a groundwater aquifer according to the biodiversity board and needs to be saved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cuncolim-civic-body-issues-notice-to-developers-in-hill-cutting/articleshow/84568279.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Month-end target for districts to set up proposed oxygen plants||PUNE: The public health department has told all districts to set up the proposed oxygen plants by the end of July and ramp up infrastructure for the supply of the gas essential for Covid patients’ treatment. As many as 346 liquid medical oxygen plants were proposed, of which 214 are so far completed. On the other hand, 422 of the proposed 530 pressure swing absorption oxygen plants were yet to be completed, a public health department official said. Maharashtra has set a target of 3,000 metric tonnes supply with all these additional plants ahead of a possible third wave of the pandemic. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed all districts to be prepared in terms of oxygen supply ahead of July 31.  Currently, Maharashtra’s daily medical oxygen production capacity is 1,300 tonnes. During the peak of the Covid pandemic’s second wave, the demand for oxygen had shot up to 1,800 tonnes per day. Maharashtra had to reach out to Gujarat and Odisha for the supply of liquid medical oxygen then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/month-end-target-for-dists-to-set-up-proposed-o2-plants/articleshow/84565806.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Rising inflation, salary cuts derail monthly budgets of households in Pune||PUNE: Steep price rise and shrinking income in Covid times have dealt a major blow to many families already struggling to make both ends meet. Sagar Kasbe, who works for a financial institution, is forced to shell out more than double the amount in travel expenses alone now due to the rise in petrol prices. “I used to spend Rs 3,000 on petrol per month earlier. With the increase in rate, I am spending Rs 7,000-8,000 monthly now as pandemic has left people like me with limited options when it comes to long distance travel. I could earlier take a bus to Hinjewadi and back for just Rs 50. But covering the same distance now costs me nothing less than Rs 300 as I need to travel by my private vehicle due to limited number of buses plying on the route due to Covid-19 curbs,” he said. Not only are professionals with limited or decreased income spending more on commute, they are struggling to manage their kitchen budgets too. “The retail price of cooking oil has escalated from Rs 90/litre earlier to Rs 160-180/litre now. Prices of dry ration and vegetables have also increased by Rs 2-20 per unit. We are cutting corners wherever we can, but we still end up spending 20-25% more in running the household,” Khadija Shaikh said. A driver from Bibvewadi said though the prices of commodities per unit may seem less, it adds up to a lot by the end of the month. “Consider paying Rs 25 more per LPG cylinder, Rs 10 more per kilogram of dal. Coriander, which would cost Rs10 per bunch, is now costing Rs 25. All these and more have shot up the cost of running the house,” he rued. Though many families are coping with the price rise by reducing purchases and usage, there are some items that they simply cannot do without or compromise on. Yesu Jadhav, another working professional, said, “The price of milk has gone up by Rs 2 per litre this month. We need two litres of milk everyday, with young children in the house. This alone has meant spending Rs120 extra on our milk budget per month. Corresponding to this, prices of all dairy products have also increased.” Prices of meat and fish are also on the boil. “There has been a drastic rise in chicken rates. In January it was around Rs200-220/kg but now it has touched Rs 260/kg. These rates will rise to Rs 270-280 and then it might go down during the holy month of Shravan to nothing less than Rs 200. Similar case with fish as well. Since the lockdown, we started a free home delivery service, but we cannot sustain this model due to the rise in petrol prices,” said Vishal Kale, owner of a meat shop in Undri. The situation has gone from bad to worse for professionals who have had their salaries cut. “My suffered a 15% salary cut. But expenses increased as we had to buy a new laptop and a phone for my sons, upgrade our internet plan, among others, to ensure uninterrupted learning from the children and work from home for myself. Where we used to pay Rs 1,000 in electricity bill per moth, we are now shelling out Rs 3,000. This rise in expenses has already eaten into my savings. If the cost of living continues to rise, with no corresponding increase in income, middle class people like me are going to be caught in a vicious cycle of debt,” said a graphic designer from PCMC.

Officials from the civic body said the kiosks will first come up at eight vaccination sites. Beneficiaries can collect their tokens from the machines and submit them at vaccination sites. The move, the officials said, will streamline queues at Covid vaccination centres, many of which have seen arguments break out between staff and beneficiaries. Vikas Dhakane, the PCMC’s additional commissioner, said, “The interactive kiosks will first be installed at eight vaccination centres. We are thinking of installing a few more at the PCMC’s zonal offices. We will come out with detailed guidelines soon. But let me assure you that one person will be able to take only one token at a time.” Dhakane said apart from the kiosks, the PCMC is also planning to introduce biometric devices to verify tokens received by beneficiaries. One official from the PCMC said there have been cases of beneficiaries collecting more than one token. Covid-19 inoculation in the district on Monday continued to be impacted by limited vaccine availability. For Tuesday, due to low Covishield reserves, PMC and PCMC vaccination centres will be holding only Covaxin drives. The PMC said Covaxin will be offered from six sites while the PCMC said it will have four centres operational for the 18 and 60-plus groups. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said the district is likely to receive a fresh batch of vaccines by Tuesday evening. “So far this month, we have received nearly 5.62 lakh doses of both Covaxin and Covishield. We are hoping to get four more batches for the rest of July,” Dr Deshmukh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-plans-special-vaccine-tokens-to-ease-rush-at-sites/articleshow/84565891.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Free cochlear implant gives 6 kids a shot at normal life||NAGPUR: Divya, the maternal aunt of Chhattisgarh’s Bhoomi Patel, was elated as her “five-year-old niece can now have many friends and won’t have to spend time alone with the mobile phone”. Family of four-year-old Naseeb Tarafdar, son of a fisherman from Gondia, said it was a rebirth of sort for him. Hearing and speech impaired Bhoomi had no option but to make the cellphone her friend or play alone as others would soon leave after realizing they can’t communicate with her. Now, with the free cochlear implant done at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) under a central government scheme, Bhoomi would be soon able to hear and speak after two years of training under an audiologist. Dr Jeevan VediExplaining what her niece has been through, Divya said she would talk in signs and gestures, but her friends would turn blank. “And when they spoke, she would go blank. Now, this problem would be no more,” she Divya. Currently, Bhoomi is studying at a special institute. Her mother Anju hoped she can now resume education at a regular school. “Initially, we took treatment at Raipur and came to Nagpur after seeing hope,” she said. Bhoomi, whose father is a farmer, was among the six hearing and speech impaired children who underwent free cochlear implant at IGGMCH last week. Apart from Bhoomi and Naseeb, the implant would help Harsh Bawane, 7, from Yavatmal, two-and-a-half-year-old Mohd Saad, Vihit Bund, 5, from city and Apeksha Rodge, 4, of Bhandara, to lead a normal life. Costing more than Rs seven lakh in private set-up, the surgery was done for free with support from Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Speech and Hearing Disabilities, Bandra, Mumbai. Naseeb’s grandfather Thakur, a fisherman, said they were devastated mentally four years ago when the doctor told them the boy is hearing and speech impaired. “After getting displaced from Bangladesh, we went through a lot of struggle before finding shelter in Gondia with government help. Just as we were trying to fight back our destiny, came this setback,” said Thakur. IGGMCH, which is a centre for Assistance to Disabled Persons (ADIP) scheme, has so far conducted 44 cochlear implants since 2017, said head of the department of ENT, IGGMCH professor Dr Jeevan Vedi. The Bund couple from Nandanvan were shocked after they came to know that their only son Vihit was a hearing and speech impaired. “We were at a marriage party where all the children were crying due to the loud DJ music but Vihit was not. That was the first time we realized our son was having a problem,” said Vihit’s father Pawan who is now hoping for a good life for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/free-cochlear-implant-gives-6-kids-a-shot-at-normal-life/articleshow/84565907.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Delhi||Delhi: 27-year-old drowns taking selfie at Pul Prahladpur, 2 others lose life||NEW DELHI: The showers may have provided relief from the scorching heat, but they proved to be fatal for two men and a nine-year-old boy on Monday. While one man and the boy drowned, the second man was electrocuted. In the first incident that took place in southeast Delhi’s Sarita Vihar, police received information around 6am that a security guard had died due to electrocution. The deceased was identified as Hemant Kuntal (19). There were eight goats lying dead along with him, whom he had been trying to rescue. “During preliminary inquiry, it was found that the goats were purchased by residents of the society for sacrifice (qurbani) on the occasion of Bakrid. The guard was deputed since Sunday to take care of the goats, which were kept in a temporary shed. Due to rain last night, the goats got electrocuted. When the guard tried to rescue them, even he died,” said Meena. A 27-year-old man, identified as Ravi Chautala, drowned while taking selfies near the flooded railway bridge underpass in Pul Prahladpur. He worked at an export house in Okhla. Locals told police he went into the water near the underpass, which had been closed by police, to shoot a video and click photos. However, he got trapped and died before he could be rescued. Delhi Traffic Police had shut vehicular movement there due to waterlogging. They had even tweeted about it from their official Twitter handle. At 1.37pm, cops at Pul Prahladpur police station were informed that a man had drowned near the railway underpass. A police team, fire brigade and disaster management authority personnel soon reached there to carry out a rescue operation. After an hour-long search, the rescuers pulled out Chautala. He was rushed to a hospital where the doctors declared him dead. His body was sent for autopsy to All India Institute of Medical Sciences and his family members were informed about the incident. Deputy commissioner of police (Southeast) RP Meena said Chautala was a resident of Gautampuri in Jaitpur. “Local inquiry revealed that the man had gone deep into the water to take a selfie or shoot a video. Inquest proceedings are being conducted,” he added. Police said the man was survived by his parents, wife, two brothers and three sisters. He was married and had a 10-month-old daughter. In the afternoon, it was reported to police that a nine-year-old boy, who had gone to the fields to relieve himself, fell and drowned in an overflowing drain in outer Delhi’s Narela Industrial Area. Police got a call about the incident around 1.30pm. The victim was later identified as Govind. His father told the cops that his son had gone to relieve himself in the morning. A neighbour later informed him that his son had drowned in the drain, which was flooded with rainwater. By the time the boy was pulled out and rushed to a hospital, he had passed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/27-yr-old-drowns-taking-selfie-at-pul-prahladpur-2-others-lose-life/articleshow/84565879.cms||---

From March to April 30, private vaccination centres registered on CoWIN were being supplied doses at the cost of Rs 150 each after depositing funds in the bank account of the National Health Authority. But that system was stopped after the new liberalised vaccination policy started from May 1 this year. The private hospitals were then asked to return the remaining doses (as on April 30) to the district authority. Officials said the refund process has started via a reverse payment module via the NHA portal. “This includes the refund for the payment the hospitals had made for the doses they were asked to return as well as the amount paid for doses they had placed orders for, but were not supplied,” one official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/refunds-start-for-hosps-that-returned-vax/articleshow/84565908.cms||Neha Madaan

Rahul Rekhawar, the new district collector, said, “Mostly the bread earner of the family comes into contact with people from outside. We will test one such person from every family. If he or she tests positive, then we will test the contacts of the patient. The isolation and treatment measures will be adopted. We will allocate staff for the drive and begin it in the ongoing week itself.” He said the strategy had achieved success when implemented at Beed, where he was a district collector during the first wave. “We will focus on the locality of big towns or villages with a large population.

---||Lucknow||Wear new mask, gloves for sacrifice; don’t upload pictures: Advisory||LUCKNOW: Do not take or upload videos or photos when sacrificing the animal on Bakrid, do not exchange handshakes or embrace one another, wear new masks and new gloves when performing rituals and follow all Covid norms even during namaz. These are some of the points of advisory from the Islamic Centre of India (ICI) laid out ahead of Eid-ul-Zuha to be celebrated on July 21. In its 21-point advisory, ICI has asked people to offer Eid namaz with only 50 people with distancing, as is the government norm during Covid. The festival, like last year, is expected to be a low-key affair with people finding it difficult to procure animals for sacrifice. Goat markets have still not officially come up in and around the city, so unofficial small-scale ones or individual sources have been the way for people to lay their hands on the sacrificial goat. Calling sacrifice an act of esteemed worship, head of ICI Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali said that like all festivals since the pandemic, this one too calls for extreme safety of oneself and others and social distancing and masking should be followed to perfection. “The sacrifice should not be made at a public place or on the side of the road. Blood should be immersed in mud to act as plant fertiliser rather than entered into drains which is unhygienic for all. New masks and new gloves should be worn by the person performing the sacrifice and ritual and namaz should be offered in a group of not more than 50 with distancing. Handshakes and embraces should be avoided,” read the advisory. No Eid namaz at Asafi MosqueIn view of Covid, there will be no Eid namaz at Asafi Mosque this year. The decision was conveyed by Imam-e-Juma Maulana Kalbe Jawad Naqvi. Instead of community namaz, the cleric will offer prayers at his home which will be broadcast live on a local religious channel. The cleric has said that namaz at home should not be offered with the intention of a community prayer, but as an individual one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wear-new-mask-gloves-for-sacrifice-dont-upload-pics-advisory/articleshow/84568236.cms||---

The civic body had removed 97 houses on Ajay Mukerjee Street and 76 on Gokulam Colony along the lake, a corporation official said. “On Monday, we demolished 68 houses on Ex-serviceman Colony along the eastern side of the lake. We have to remove 140 houses and five small temples on Om Sakthi Nagar on the other side.” The Tamil Nadu slum clearance board (TNSCB) has provided alternative accommodation to all families residing along the lake at the housing unit in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar at Kovaipudur.

---||Coimbatore||Trough likely to trigger rainfall in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: While the low-pressure formation over the Bay of Bengal in the first week of July did not bring much rain to the city, a new active trough on the east coast may be more successful in bringing light to moderate showers. Though the trough is predicted to bring rain to areas along the Western Ghats including Pollachi, Kinathukadavu and western Coimbatore, the city may experience some isolated and patchy rain, say weather experts. The regional meteorological centre has predicted heavy showers in the Nilgiris, Theni and Salem districts that may extend to isolated places in Coimbatore until Thursday. “There is an active trough in the west coast, extending from Maharashtra to Kerala. Whenever there is an active trough, all coastal areas and around the Western Ghats receive good rain,” said Skymet Weather Services chief meteorologist Mahesh Palawat. “However, showers will be mostly restricted to foothills and places on the Western Ghats.” Areas most likely to receive showers are the Palakkad Pass, Kinathukidavu, Valparai, Pollachi, Siruvani Ghats and Western parts of Coimbatore, said Coimbatore-based weather blogger Santhosh Krishnan. “Even if the rain is expected to be not too heavy, we will have cloudy weather and windy, chill conditions within the city due to passing showers. However, dams are expected to receive heavy rainfall.” In July first week, experts predicted 15cm to 20cm rain over the fortnight. However, the weather station in Peelamedu recorded hardly 12-13mm. The ghats section, where rainfall is not always cumulatively measured, received heavy rain this monsoon, said Tamil Nadu water supply and drainage board officials. As a result, people living within the western zone of the civic body are benefiting. “Last year during this month, we were hardly able to give 65MLD water from Siruvani to the corporation. But this year, from June 15, we have been giving more than 100MLD, including 101.38MLD on Monday, which is as per the scheme,” said an engineer. “Water level in the dam is 27.65ft, which is healthy. It will go up if we get more rain.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/trough-likely-to-trigger-rainfall/articleshow/84565949.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Employees union demands action against senior Tasmac officials||COIMBATORE: The Tasmac Employees Union, affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, petitioned the collector on Monday against some senior officials of the state-run enterprise, who allegedly forced employees to open sealed shops during the lockdown and sell liquor. As per the government order on May 8, all Tasmac shops were to be shut from May 10 until the lockdown was lifted, the petition said. “Between May eight and 10, Tasmac made Rs 950 crore-worth sales compared to the usual Rs 250 crore, because despite instructions against bulk sales, workers were forced to meet target,” said union leader James. “Since there were suspicions of thieving, Tasmac authorities ordered us to weld shutters and seal locks, which we did. We also submitted a stock list.” “However, when the lockdown got extended, some Tasmac officials, through supervisors, specifically junior assistant to the regional manager, instructed some employees to open shops and sell liquor. While some employees agreed, others refused, fearing that they may get into trouble. Nagachandran of shop 1622 at Hopes refused to open his shop,” said James. After July 5, when shops reopened, Tasmac authorities ordered random inspections to check if all shops had stayed shut and specifically targeted shops that didn’t open, said the petition. “Though stocks were in order, they claimed that 18 crates of alcohol were missing. Nagachandran told us that the senior supervisor and clerks demanded a bribe of Rs 2 lakh to let him off the hook. When he went to meet the regional manager, he was attacked.” The union requested the collector to take action against corrupt Tasmac officials and protect the employees, who followed rules during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/employees-union-demands-action-against-senior-tasmac-officials/articleshow/84565964.cms||---

With the number of people discharged increasing to 2,22,167, the recovery rate grew to 97.8%. Though the second wave is still on descent, in a sign that virus transmissibility is at an all-time low, the test positivity rate, which at one point was as high as 38%, dropped to 2.6% on Monday.

Sometimes, less than 220 people test positive in a 24-hour cycle. This is despite fears of the delta variant. “Besides the 9,000 to 11,000 samples daily, we keep sending a set of samples every fortnight to Chennai or Bengaluru to monitor new variants,” said an official.

---||Ahmedabad||Lockdown FIRs: Sessions court rejects govt appeals||AHMEDABAD: The Gandhinagar sessions court has junked numerous appeals filed by the state government against magisterial courts’ decisions to dismiss criminal cases filed for lockdown violations in 2020. The sessions court rejected the government’s appeals, terming them not maintainable on the ground that the trial court had refused to acknowledge FIRs filed under Sections 188 and 269 of the IPC citing the bar of Section 195 of the CrPC. The sessions court observed that the trial court had not recorded the acquittal of those who had violated lockdown rules, but refused to accept the FIRs and trashed the criminal proceedings. It further said that an appeal is maintainable once the accused is acquitted, but the trial court had not got into the merits of the case and straightaway stopped the proceedings and dismissed the FIRs on the aspect of law. Since purely the legal question was to be decided, the sessions court had not even asked for the case papers from the trial court. The state government had filed appeals challenging the dismissal of criminal cases under Section 188 of IPC terming the orders “perverse, illegal and contrary to the provisions of law”. Last year, a magisterial court in Mansa town stopped criminal proceedings in FIRs lodged for lockdown violations. It pulled up the cops for slapping Section 269 of IPC, for negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life. It had said, “To take a roundabout route, Section 269 of the IPC prima facie seems to have been added in the case so that the police official does not have to file a private complaint.” The state government filed the appeals on instructions issued to all public prosecutors by the director of prosecution that FIR under Section 188 of IPC are liable and in case trial courts refuse to accept the chargesheets, the prosecutors should file appeals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lockdown-firs-sessions-court-rejects-govt-appeals/articleshow/84566070.cms||---

The suspects took money from the businessman in 2017. Police inspector Pramod Waghmare of Sinhagad Road Police Station told TOI, “The businessman stays at Dhayari and has an office on Karve Road. He provides consultancy services and carries out civil work for builders.” “The complainant approached the cybercrime police station about two months ago. The cybercrime police made preliminary investigation into the case and then transferred it to the Sinhagad Road Police Station for further probe,” Waghmare said. “The six persons had good relations with the businessman. In December 2017, the businessman transferred a sum of Rs15lakh to the suspects using e-banking facilities,” Waghmare said. “The six persons, all based in and around Market Yard area, promised to invest the money in two popular cryptocurrencies. They also informed the businessman that the virtual currency was being highly appreciated financially and people were investing in it,” he said. “The businessman waited for about a year but did not receive any returns from the suspects. Since 2019, the businessman has been demanding return of his initial investment, but the suspects failed to return the money,” he said. “They then stopped responding to the calls of the businessman following which he approached the police,” he said.

---||Delhi||Riot case: Court stays order of separate FIR||New Delhi: Setting aside an order by which police were directed to register a separate FIR on the complaint of a man alleging that a mob had attacked him and his family during the northeast Delhi riots, a Delhi court has said the possibility of giving untrue and motivated complaints could not be ruled out, which could be the handiwork of activists from the either community. Mohammad Salman had filed a written complaint to police on March 18, 2020, that during the riots, a mob had allegedly ransacked his house on February 25 and attempted to kill him, his wife and his two sons. When police clubbed his complaint with another against the same mob, Salman approached the court seeking a separate FIR and investigation in his case. A magistrate court had directed police to register the separate case, which it challenged in the sessions court. The sessions court said, prima facie, no fault could be found with registration of a single case with respect to the operation of a single unlawful assembly in a particular area. “In this case, it is noticed that an FIR had already been registered. During investigation, it transpired that the offence against the respondent (Salman) was also committed by the same unlawful assembly, and it was part of the same transaction,” said additional sessions Judge Vinod Yadav. The court said the magistrate court should have stayed the proceedings on Salman’s complaint and given appropriate directions to police after appreciating and evaluating the investigation being conducted in the matter. It further noted that the accused named in his complaint had been chargesheeted by the police in the case and, hence, “once there was already an FIR, the direction for registration of another was unwarranted”. The court, however, added that in several cases, the complaints continued to pour in till the end of March 2020 from various complainants of a particular area, and police were not supposed to keep mum and not register cases when there was clear prima facie evidence of a particular unlawful assembly of rioters having operated there. “The delay in filing the complaints by some people could be justified, but the possibility of giving untrue, exaggerated and motivated account cannot be ruled out. This could be a handiwork of a group of activists from either community, therefore, prima facie no fault can be found with registration of a single case with respect to the operation of a single and distinct unlawful assembly in a particular area,” the judge said. The court also directed the police to act on another complaint filed by Salman on July 25, 2020, alleging that he had received threats from unknown mobile numbers. Just a few days ago, the sessions court had come down heavily on police for “miserably” failing in conducting a fair investigation on a complaint filed by a man who received gunshot injury on his eye during the riots and imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on them. It had further lifted the stay on the magistrate court’s order and paved the way for registration of a separate FIR on the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riot-case-court-stays-order-of-separate-fir/articleshow/84565945.cms||Usha Das

In a late evening response to SC notice, the Kerala government said it relaxed the Covid lockdown norms to address the distressing condition of the traders, who had stocked up for Bakrid. With the economic slowdown haunting the traders, not allowing them to sell their stock during festival would have dealt a crippling blow to their finances, it said justifying the three-day relaxation of lock down norms, which ends on Tuesday. Unlike the suo motu cognisance of a newspaper report on the UP government mulling permission to Kanwar Yatra, a bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai appeared to have missed another report on July 17 titled “Ahead of Bakrid, Kerala relaxes Covid curbs for three days from Sunday”. Already two days of relaxation have gone by and Tuesday is the last day of relaxation. Times ViewKerala has been registering a high number of Covid cases for several weeks now. The state government’s decision to ease the norms for Bakrid is irresponsible. The apex court has rightly issued a notice asking it to explain.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for applicant P K D Nambiar, told the bench that though among states, Kerala is registering the highest number of cases, the state government, out of political considerations, has relaxed the Covid curbs for three days at a time when the SC is expressing serious reservations over Kanwar Yatra. Without making any caustic observations, as made during the hearings on Kanwar Yatra, the bench asked the Kerala government counsel G Prakash to file the state’s response within a day. Prakash said the Covid curbs are in place except for relaxation to open shops during the festivities. The bench in its order recorded the UP government’s statements and efforts in getting the Kanwar Yatra postponed this year too by persuading the Kanwar committees in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/curbs-eased-to-help-distressed-traders-on-eid-kerala-to-sc/articleshow/84570890.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Delhi||CM: Minto Road to serve as model to tackle flooding||New Delhi: In a crucial meeting held to discuss the city’s drains in the aftermath of large-scale waterlogging across the capital after moderate to heavy rainfall, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that a world-class drainage system would be developed in the future. The meeting was chaired by LG Anil Baijal and attended by the chief secretary and officials of Delhi Jal Board, Public Works Department, Irrigation and Flood Control Department (I&FC) and the municipal corporations. The drainage system of the road under Minto Bridge in central Delhi, which has in the past seen people drowning and buses get submerged during monsoon, was also discussed. A patch of the road now has an effective drainage system. Stressing on better coordination among all civic bodies, the CM said Delhi had the capacity to curb waterlogging if the departments worked together. While the municipal corporations are run by BJP, Delhi government is led by AAP. PWD, DJB and I&FC are under Delhi government, but it doesn’t have any direct control over the drains under the municipal corporations. “I’m pleased with the work done by our agencies, and we can see the proof of their work at Minto Bridge. There’s a folklore-benchmark in Delhi, which says the day the road under Minto Bridge gets waterlogged, it means monsoon has arrived. This time, Minto Bridge is the talk of the town. Our officials and engineers have given their best towards ensuring the road does not get waterlogged. This is not being said by me, but the people of Delhi,” said Kejriwal. Mentioning that the drainage work near Minto Bridge had proven that waterlogging at all vulnerable points could be curbed, the CM said, “We know of 147 such vulnerable points. If we conduct extensive mapping, we can list them all. If solutions are planned and worked on just like Minto Bridge, then we can give Delhi freedom from waterlogging.” “While the capital should have the best designed drainage system, unfortunately it doesn’t. There are a lot of places where drains of DJB and the corporations converge, but there is no coordination between them. I suggest that PWD act like the nodal authority and undertake an exercise to redesign Delhi’s drainage system. If an excellent design is in place and all agencies work together, then we can implement it,” Kejriwal said. Asking the officials to make the helpline number popular, the CM said, “Once well-designed drains are in place, they will only require desilting once a year and the system will be free of liability.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-minto-road-to-serve-as-model-to-tackle-flooding/articleshow/84568263.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Covid: Taking steps to assist orphans, Centre informs HC||New Delhi: The Centre informed the Delhi high court on Monday that it was taking all steps to safeguard children affected by the pandemic. It said a communication had been sent to states and Union Territories (UTs) for immediate rehabilitation of the orphaned children. In an affidavit filed on behalf of the Union ministry of woman & child development on a PIL raising concerns over children orphaned due to the pandemic, the Centre assured the court it was constantly engaging with states to discuss the scope and possibility of strengthening the child protection set up during the pandemic. Information about any child, who had been orphaned due to Covid, may be shared with helpline 1098, it submitted, adding that a centrally sponsored scheme, Child Protection Services, was already being implemented to provide financial support to state governments/ UT administrations for delivering services under the JJ Act. The Centre added that, to support the psychosocial and mental health of children impacted by the pandemic, a national initiative called SAMVAD, Support, Advocacy & Mental health interventions for children in Vulnerable circumstances and Distress, has also been launched along with a 24x7 childline for emergency outreach. While the ministry prominently displayed an advisory on its website and was generating awareness through social media on protection of children who have lost their parents to Covid, the state governments have also been requested to issue public notice in local languages to guide public regarding lawful course of action in case of orphaned children, the affidavit said. A request was also made to states to designate one childcare institution in each district to support children whose parents were affected with Covid, and a column was asked to be added in hospitalisation forms seeking name of the person to whom a minor was to be given in case of death of the parents, the Centre submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-taking-steps-to-assist-orphans-centre-informs-hc/articleshow/84566003.cms||---

In a petition to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Subbarayan said that most of the 49 Kendriya Vidyalaya schools in the state do not teach Tamil as a subject. “The schools have been following a three-language formula – English and Hindi as compulsory from Class I to XII. Sanskrit is taught from Class VI to VII and goes on to be optional till Class X. As per rules, if there are a minimum of 20 students who opt to learn Tamil, arrangements should be made to teach it. It is very partisan,” the petition said. “The schools have 109 Hindi teachers and 59 Sanskrit teachers, but no Tamil teacher. It is linguist discrimination,” Subbarayan said. “Tamil is the first language, which is classified as a classical language. It is one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world. Inclusion of regional language in the curriculum and making it mandatory to learn regional languages would ensure social inclusion and strengthen national solidarity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/teach-tamil-in-kv-schools-says-mp/articleshow/84565980.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi’s monsoon deficit all but wiped out in matter of days||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s rainfall deficit, which was 67% in the second week of this month, has been wiped out. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has now placed overall rainfall in the “normal” category this season at a deficit of 3%. Before the onset of monsoon, Delhi was in the “large deficient” category at 67%. So far, there has been 180.4mm of rainfall since June 1 compared with the normal of 185.3mm. Met officials said rainfall was likely to remain in the “normal” category as rain activity was expected to continue. IMD data showed that North district had so far fared the best and was under “large excess” category. It received 270.4mm rainfall between June 1 and July 19. However, the normal mark for the district until July 19 was 161.4mm in “large excess” category at 68%. North East district performed the worst, receiving just 83.8mm of rainfall during this period as opposed to a normal mark of 198.4mm, thereby putting it at a deficit of 58%. Three districts — New Delhi, South West and West — have been placed in the “normal” category. The data of Central district was unavailable. The city recorded one “heavy” rainfall day between 8.30am on Sunday and 8.30am on Monday. Safdarjung, Palam and Lodhi Road stations have all been in the “excess” category so far. This month, Safdarjung station has received 60% excess rainfall, followed by Lodhi Road at 49% and Palam at 24%. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “The monsoon trough is near Delhi and, hence, the region received moderate to heavy rainfall. The rain activity mostly intensifies in Delhi from July 10 to August last week.” Rainfall is deficit when it is -19% and below, large deficit when it is more than -59%. If it falls between -19% and 19%, it is classified as normal, between 20% and 59% above normal as excess and above 60% as large excess.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citys-monsoon-deficit-all-but-wiped-out-in-matter-of-days/articleshow/84566129.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Belong to 45+ year category? Avoid walk-in, book vaccination slot in advance||LUCKNOW: If you are 45 years or above, you should book a slot in advance for Covid-19 vaccination or reach the centre before 11.30am, otherwise chances are that you may have to return without the jab. A city resident, Ram Pratap (56), came to the vaccination centre at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) for the second shot against Covid-19 at 11.30am on Monday. However, he was asked to return as no dose was left for walk-in beneficiaries. “I was puzzled when an employee asked me to book the slot in advance before coming next time. I had read in newspapers that people in the age group of 45 years and above can simply walk-in for inoculation,” Pratap told TOI. Like Pratap, many people aged above 45 years complained about getting a similar response at several vaccination centres, though according to government guidelines, people in the 18-45 years category have to book slot on CoWin portal for vaccinations while those above 45 years can take the jab after on the spot registration. On Monday, TOI did a reality check at six centres – SPM Civil Hospital, Silver Jubilee CHC, BRD Hospital, Jhalkari Bai Hospital, TB Hospital and KGMU. In the last four centres, people aged 45 years or above were sent back after 12pm on the grounds that the “walk-in quota” had been exhausted. Officials at the centres said health department provides fixed quota of doses for walk-in inoculations and for those who book slots in advance. Doses for the 18-59 years age group are provided as per the slots booked, hence there is no problem. “The walk-in facility is available for people in the age group of 45-59 years, senior citizens, healthcare staff and frontline workers. Hence, on days when turnout for walk-in inoculations is more than expected, the stock gets exhausted within a couple of hours,” an official said. Authorities at Jhalkari Bai Hospital confirmed that only 160 doses for on the spot vaccinations were given by the health department, while those at BRD Hospital and KGMU said they were allocated 100 doses each and TB Hospital got 50 doses for walk-in inoculations. District immunisation officer Dr MK Singh said, “Those aged 45 years and above have both the options – advance booking and walk-in. Currently, we have to fix quota because of limited stock, which will be resolved after fresh supplies in the next 3-4 days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/belong-to-45-year-category-avoid-walk-in-book-vax-slot-in-advance/articleshow/84568319.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Monday claimed that a steady supply of 35,000 to 36,000 doses a day is being received by the civic body over the last two days. “Till Saturday we had been receiving 17,000 to 25,000 doses a day because of which only 115 to 120 vaccination centres used to be active,” said a senior AMC health official. The AMC has been assured by the state government that a steady supply of 35,000 vaccine dose will be provided to the civic body for the next few weeks. “If we maintain a vaccination drive of 39,000 to 42,000 a day for the next two months we will have 92% of the city’s population under vaccination cover. This is including the two non-vaccination days declared by the state government,” said a senior AMC health official. Though one of the highest total doses of Covid-19 vaccination were recorded in Ahmedabad on July 3 – with 45,444 vaccine doses administered — the numbers sharply dropped by 20% within the next 15 days in spite of a regular supply. “The city's vaccination trend reveals that within 15 days vaccination dropped by 20%. Our data shows that the average daily vaccinations dropped between June 26 and July 2 from 24,400 to 19,500,” added the AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/39-5k-get-vaccinated-in-the-city-on-monday/articleshow/84566078.cms||---

Level 3 Covid restrictions came into force in the district on Monday and they will remain in place till Friday. The administration and the traders’ associations have appealed to the commercial establishments and shopowners to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour and make it mandatory for the customers too to follow the guidelines. On Monday, the traders had displayed ‘No Mask, No Goods’ boards outside the shops. However, not everyone was complying with the rules. The traders said they can convince the customers on Covid-appropriate behaviour, however, they can’t refuse to sell their wares as they will then lose business. The administration too went easy on the traders and citizens violating the rules since it was the first day after months that the shops had reopened. Police vans, with public address systems, were deployed to the main market towns. Cops were seen requesting citizens to maintain distance and traders to follow the Covid rules. Meanwhile, representatives of the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, met district collector Rahul Rekhawar, requesting him to make vaccine doses available for the traders — especially the pharmacists and medical store employees. Sanjay Shete, the KCCI president, said, “Traders and chemists come in contact with a large number of people. They must be vaccinated at the earliest. We are ready to set up camps to vaccinate the traders and pharmacists. We only need a large number of vaccine doses.” Rekhawar assured he would make arrangements for vaccines for the traders once the administration gets a sufficient quantity of the doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-jaysingpur-gandhinagar-markets-open-vax-sought-for-traders/articleshow/84561253.cms||---

Initially, 10 talukas have been chosen for the exercise which will be extended to other ecologically vulnerable areas of the state. Ecological profiling is an exercise that documents rare and endemic species in a region. “The eco-profiling will study the distribution and the state of the forests and will map vegetation gradients. It will also help us determine hotspots of plant, animal and even insect diversity,” says a senior GEC official who is coordinating with various district collectors for the activity. At present, the GEC has invited expression of interest from interested agencies. The project was first mooted in 2008, mainly to prepare a comprehensive ecological profile of 49 talukas adjoining Gulf of Khambhat, Gulf of Kutch, South Gujarat coast and coastal areas of Saurashtra.  “The main objective of the assignment is to prepare a management decision support document which will help the state plan for development activities, in particular at block levels, with overall overview of ecological conditions of the area,” says the GEC official. A copy of the taluka level eco-profiling project is with TOI. Apart from the ecological survey, even communities living within the vicinity of bio-geographical zones will be profiled. “Right from demography of the area, profile of 25 occupations, income ranges, population growth index, livestock, pressure over resources, conflict over resources sharing will be covered under the study,” adds the GEC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-to-prepare-ecology-data-bank-for-talukas-in-state/articleshow/84566094.cms||---

The value of the seized drug ranges from Rs 90 lakh to Rs 1.10 crore in the international market. According to a press statement issued by Amit Ghawate, zonal director, NCB, Chennai Control Unit, on Monday, a team of NCB, Madurai sub-zone, intercepted Nigerian national Edwin Kingsely, 42, at the Coimbatore railway station on Sunday and seized 2.2kg of white crystals believed to be amphetamine. A kingpin of the syndicate and involved in drug trade for the past three years, Kingsely was travelling in Kerala express from Delhi. It is suspected that the seized amphetamine has been procured from Delhi. The contraband was concealed in eight small packets wrapped with carbon paper. Amit Ghawate said in the statement that the involvement of African nationals, particularly Nigerians, in trafficking narcotic drugs and synthetic drugs is on the rise. Coimbatore, Salem, Erode and Tirupur have become hubs for African nationals. Tirupur being a textile hub is frequented by African nationals under the guise of engaging in textile business. He said amphetamine is made from ephedrine/pseudoephedrine, a controlled substance under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. It affects the central nervous system and is increasingly used as a rave party drug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/2-2kg-amphetamine-seized-from-nigerian-national/articleshow/84566084.cms||---

Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil said it was not a simple case of tax dispute but claim of IGST refunds allegedly based on false, fabricated documents and fraudulent transactions, comprehended through a complex web of fictitious firms apparently created and managed by accused Ritesh Aggarwal.It noted that as per the probe, Aggarwal seemed to be the alleged mastermind and his “dubious conduct” gave clear impression that he was misleading the investigation and influencing the witnesses. The court said in order to unearth the money trail and to ensure that the accused was not able to exert his influence in the case, bail ought not have been granted to him by the magistrate court.

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks whether governor has duty to act on recommendations for MLC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday reserved its order in a public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the eight-month delay by Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari in acting on recommendations of the state council of ministers and nominating 12 members to the legislative council. The almost day-long hearing saw the bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni delving into the issue of whether the governor has a “duty”, whether mandatory or discretionary, under the Constitution to act and speak when such recommendations are made and can send back names, or would not his sitting tight, given no mandated deadline, not amount to being “ultra vires” or unconstitutional. The bench said “mandatory or discretionary, the governor has a duty”. And with every power comes a corresponding duty, it added. Under Article 171 (3) (e), read with 171(5) of the Constitution, those nominated to the Upper House shall be persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of literature, science, art, co-operative movement and social service. However, the provision has been used to accommodate political nominees which the governor can reject if not as per the Constitution. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who began by the questioning the very maintainability of the PIL, said, “The PIL’s contention of the governor being bound by the council of ministers’ advice would mean that he would have no role and nomination will have no meaning and the state will control the nomination also under clause (5) which is not the intent of the Constitution.” Repeatedly asked by the bench whether the governor has a duty under the Constitution to act, Singh said the governor is “empowered” to nominate, but has a “discretionary power” to nominate and a “right to reject name and send for reconsideration”. Singh added that the governor is not bound by the recommendation of the council of ministers. The state and petitioner said the governor has, however, done nothing so far. The PIL by Ratan Luth, who runs two schools in Nashik, contended that Koshiyari’s failure to make the nominations affects the citizens too. Arguing the PIL, senior counsel Aspi Chinoy said the governor has no choice, under the Constitution, but to accept the advice of the council of ministers as the state is expected to send names that do not attract any disqualification. The state, through senior counsel Rafique Dada, supported the PIL’s contention and said the MLC posts have been lying vacant since last June. MLC Vinayak Mete, through his lawyer Siddharth Dharmadhikari, filed an intervention plea to assist in the matter. The plea to make written submissions was questioned by Chinoy as he would need time to resp-ond and the hearing was concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-asks-whether-governor-has-duty-to-act-on-recommendations-for-mlc/articleshow/84566240.cms||Swati Deshpande

The order also mandated the doctors to ensure patients with Covid symptoms undergo either RT-PCR test or rapid antigen test. Rekhawar has taken the decisions to ensure early detection of the Covid patients and provide early treatment. The late detection and delays in the treatment are some of the major causes of high mortality rate among Covid patients in Kolhapur district. Around 22% of Covid patients, who have succumbed to Covid in the district, are admitted late to the hospitals. The order states, “No person seeking medicine for Covid symptoms should be given the medicine without prescription. The person should be convinced to consult their doctors and get tested. The doctors must ensure those with Covid symptoms are tested at the earliest. The doctors and pharmacists have to maintain a separate register to record the details such as the name, address inactive phone number in the register. We are making arrangements to collect the details every day from our staff.” The authorities have found that many patients, who arrive in the government-run Covid care hospitals had already approached the private hospitals but were not properly treated and diagnosed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pharmacists-cant-give-meds-without-prescription/articleshow/84561298.cms||---

The court said that there was no necessity to file anticipatory bail petition as the trial court had only issued summons and directed them to appear before the Thirumayam judicial magistrate court on July 23. The court was hearing the bail petition filed by Raja and V Suryanarayanan, news editor of RSS South Union. Justice G Chandrasekharan observed that the allegation against Raja is that he made derogatory remarks against the HC and the police. The allegations are a subject matter of the trial court. Hence, the judge dismissed the petition. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioners and others by violating the orders of the court proceeded to set up a stage for a meeting as part of the Vinayaga Chaturthi celebrations in Pudukkottai district on September 15, 2018. When the police officials attempted to stop them, Raja picked up an argument in which he passed derogatory comments about the judiciary.  The petitioners stated that they have not committed any offence and their reputation would be affected if they were arrested. The government advocate opposed the grant of anticipatory bail and an intervening petition was also filed opposing the bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-advance-bail-plea-of-bjp-leader-h-raja/articleshow/84566148.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: SC verdict on rates for non-Covid patients ‘a setback for govt’||NAGPUR: The SC verdict upholding the HC order that the state government can’t fix rates for non-Covid patients in private hospitals is a big setback to the government, said Dr Pradeep Arora, a paediatrician who had filed a petition in HC along with Vidarbha Hospital Association. Both had challenged Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) notices to private hospitals over alleged over-charging of fees from Covid and non-Covid patients in violation of the state’s two notifications of April 30 and May 4. Questioning the legality of NMC’s move initiated by its former commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, they had termed it as “gross abuse and misuse of powers” by civic officials. Pointing out that the civic body’s notices were issued without any jurisdiction and would hinder medical services offered to patients at a time when entire medical fraternity is battling the deadly virus while risking their lives, the petitioners had contended that the government is neither competent nor have the authority to fix rates for non-Covid patients in private hospitals. “This is an unwarranted interference in running a medical facility that leads to harassment,” they contended. Quashing two government notifications of April 30 and May 4, 2020, for fixing rates for non-Covid patients in such establishments, the HC’s then division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande (retired) and Pushpa Ganediwala ruled that the government isn’t competent to such directives under DMA’s Section 65. This bench further held that the legislature isn’t competent under public health and sanitation, hospitals and dispensaries in Schedule VII’s List II (State List) under the Constitution of India to either frame any law/issue any direction for putting a cap on regulating rates chargeable by private hospitals for non-Covid patients. Stressing that private establishments are denied their control and regulation over 80% isolation and non-isolation beds due to government’s directives, the HC judges stated that they should be compensated under DMA’s Section 66. According to Dr Arora, who argued in person, the apex court bench flayed the government on its failure to provide adequate healthcare services to the patients during peak period of pandemic in April-May and made it clear that when private hospitals were extending their services to non-Covid patients, it has no right to interfere in that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sc-verdict-on-rates-for-non-covid-patients-a-setback-for-govt/articleshow/84566229.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: CCTV cameras to be used to keep Bopal drains desilted||AHMEDABAD: To end the perennial problem of chocked drainage lines in Bopal areas which have been newly merged in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), a proposal has been sent to the standing committee of the civic body to sanction use of CCTV cameras for monitoring of drainage lines. According to the proposal, the cameras will be fitted in the drains for a clear view of the chocked lines and relaying live feed to the officials concerned. The officials said that the drainage lines frequently get chocked near Sterling City, Sudarshan Tower and Manibhadra Apartment. The AMC has also decided to desilt the existing drainage network using CCTV cameras. The cameras will help the civic body in pinpointing the bottleneck in the drainage system and in constant monitoring for unhindered flow. The standing committee is likely to take up the matter on Thursday and decide on the agency for desiltation work at an estimated cost of Rs 1.04 crore. The officials said that the decision to install CCTV cameras was taken after getting several complaints of overflowing drainage lines in the area. In another move, the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (Auda) has decided to connect the drainage lines in the newly merged areas in Bopal with the main trunk line on the Sardar Patel Ring Road. An Auda official said according to the plan, the drainage line would cross a railway line and approval from the railways authorities is required. “After the railways gave the permission for the drainage line recently, Auda deposited Rs 2 crore with the railways for the under-track drainage work. The work has already begun and it is likely to be over by the end of this month,” said the official. He said that in the absence of any connection with the main trunk line, sewage overflows and reaches the Bopal lake and small ponds in the area. The official said that with this connection, the issue of drainage water flowing into Bopal lake will also be solved. The AMC has already constructed a pumping station for pushing the drainage water to the main trunk line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cctv-cameras-to-be-used-to-keep-bopal-drains-desilted/articleshow/84566233.cms||---

During the previous hearing, the court had directed the state to submit a status report about the progress of CB-CID investigation. Since the counsel appearing for the petitioner sought time to peruse the status report filed by the state and to respond to the same, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi adjourned the case to August 10. The court was hearing two petitions filed by Pavanasam, father of P Muthu Mano, 27. The petitioner sought a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of the high court.

Jadhav has directed to intensify action against those who are not maintaining social distancing and not wearing masks in tourist, religious and market places with the help of police. An official from the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) said currently the daily case count is in the range between 50 and 70, and we want it to reduce further. “The third wave of the pandemic has been projected to begin from next month. We can prevent the pandemic if people follow the Covid appropriate behaviour,” he said.Avesh Palod, city Covid officer and director of the solid waste department of NMC, said huge gatherings are seen in tourist places and religious places.“Moreover, rush of people is also seen at the market places. A section of people is still not maintaining social distancing and not wearing masks which is a major concern for us. At the same time there are some districts in the state where new cases of Covid-19 are increasing,” Palod said.“Hence, the residents need to follow the Covid safety protocols to prevent the third wave.

---||Ahmedabad||AMC to carpet-bomb Bopal with tax bills from September end||AHMEDABAD: Bopal residents will be issued their first municipal property tax bills, based on carpet area formula, between September end and October second week. Most of these bills will be between 2.3 to 2.5 times the existing nagarpalika bills, claim civic officials. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had begun an elaborate carpet area survey of more than 40,000 properties — residential and commercial—over the last four weeks. A senior AMC official told TOI that survey of more than 18,000 properties has been completed and the rest will be completed in a month’s time. The inspecting tax assessors have been demanding the original plans of the individual tenements, bungalows and apartments. After being brought within AMC limits last year, the area will now be taxed under the new carpet area-based property tax system. Right now, 40,000-odd residents of the area are cumulatively paying Rs 5 crore in tax to the nagarpalika. The AMC had earlier estimated a tax of Rs 15 crore from the area, but now this amount may increase to about Rs 20 crore. Most Bopal and Ghuma areas will be in the ‘C’ category of the municipal tax system, where the land jantri value is between Rs 7,000 and Rs 15,000, except for South Bopal which will be under the ‘B’ category. “The property tax system existing in Bopal-Ghuma is quite arbitrary. For instance, apartments which came up over past 4 years are paying based on carpet area while other properties are paying a flat charge according to the old blanket assessment system,” said a senior South West Zone tax assessor. The AMC had recently completed assessment of newly acquired areas of Nana Chiloda and Kathwada, where about 12,000 properties were assessed and issued bills last year. “In the recently concluded carpet area-based tax assessment for industrial clusters for Kathwada, there has been a 14 to 15 times jump in property tax. Some of these cases have come for dispute settlement before the AMC. They ask why they need to pay if they do not have basic civic amenities in place,” said a senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-to-carpet-bomb-bopal-with-tax-bills-from-sept-end/articleshow/84566183.cms||---

On Monday, when the Commission went through RMLIMS’s reply on the second warning, it found that the institute had explained the death of only two patients and not answered specific queries. “The institute has not explained to the Commission on who the remaining three patients were, how they died and who is to be held responsible for it. The Commission has now decided to summon a member of the institute’s internal committee to be physically present before it for proper answers and explanation,” a member of UPSHRC, OP Dixit, told TOI. He said the reply from RMLIMS stated that one of the patients who died was an elderly man suffering from the last stage of cancer and could not be saved because of the severity of his illness. “The other death (in April) was of a female patient. The reply states that the death occurred around 3am while oxygen supply dropped at 5.30am. So both these deaths, RMLIMS has said, were not because of the dip in oxygen level. But RMLIMS fails to give reply on remaining three patients and all other questions put up by the Commission on fixing of responsibility,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shrc-to-summon-rml-hosp-official-to-explain-covid-deaths/articleshow/84568404.cms||---

The bridge is being built as a short-cut for people of a scheduled class community to access various public amenities such as school and bus stop. The district administration planned the bridge in 2019 based on a request from the scheduled caste people. There was a delay in completing the project, and the villagers moved the high court to get an order to complete the work at the earliest. As the work did not start even after many months, a petition was given to the district police to provide required security on behalf of the vigilance and monitoring committee members last week. A caste wall constructed at the southern part of Uthapuram village by people of a BC community to keep away the SC people had created tension a few years ago. When the district administration started the work by excavating the ground on Monday, people from the BC community raised objections and were arrested. Usilampatti deputy superintendent of police C Nallu said that 15 people, including three women were arrested. “85 police personnel have been deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incident,” he said. Meanwhile, the BC members gathered in large numbers to to petition the collector. But they were stopped by police and a few of them left for the district collector’s office to submit the petition. They waited on the office premises till the evening. The scheduled caste members expressed happiness over the construction work and urged the administration not to give way to the pressure. M Muthupandi, a villager belonging to the scheduled caste, said, “Our long-time demand is being completed. It should be completed at the earliest and help us access the public amenities through the short route.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tension-in-pottalpatti-as-mutharaiyars-oppose-bridge-work/articleshow/84566204.cms||---

Fishermen cited that many aspects in the Bill posed a threat to fishing as an occupation. “The Bill should be dropped. If the Union government decides to pass it, lakhs of fishermen across the state will unite and stage indefinite protests,” P Jesuraja, secretary of the All Mechanised Boat Fishermen society in Ramanathapuram district, said. Many fishermen at Rameswaram, Thangachimadam and Pamban in the district held black flags and staged protests in the sea. “Every time we go fishing only after obtaining tokens from the fisheries department officials. But the new Bill says we have to pay for it. It also says that we have to fish only in earmarked areas and in certain limits,” Jesuraja said. Non-compliance will result in imposing fines of Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh and imprisonment of not less than six months. “There is also a cap on the quantity of fish we should catch,” Jesuraja said. On the other hand, the Bill also makes it mandatory for the fishermen to register the type of net they would be using . Fishermen said the type of net they use varies depending on various factors and that it will not be possible to carry a particular type of net. Stating that they are earning several thousand crores as foreign exchange every year and that they are the unpaid guardians of the country. Protesters alleged that the Bill was a direct bid to relocate the coastal population so that the mineral rich shores could be handed over and exploited by corporate giants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tamil-nadu-fishermen-want-centre-to-drop-fisheries-draft-bill-stage-protests/articleshow/84566268.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||No Great Indian Bustard spotted in Kutch sanctuary: Minister||AHMEDABAD: The Great Indian Bustard (GIB), which was the mascot ‘Gibi’ for a UN-backed conservation conference in Gandhinagar, seems to have vanished from its Kutch sanctuary. At least that appeared to be the case on January 1, 2021, when not a single GIB was spotted in the sanctuary. This information was given by Union minister of state for environment, forest and climate change Ashwini Kumar Choubey on Monday. The minister was replying to a question from Congress MP Shaktisinh Gohil on the GIB population in the sanctuary and the number of deaths caused by power lines and windmills in the area. Gohil also inquired about the steps being taken by the government to prevent the deaths. Choubey said that the questions did not arise as the birds were not present in the sanctuary. The Kutch GIB sanctuary, spread over 2 sq km, has often been hailed as one of the finest habitats for the critically endangered species. Gibi was the mascot for the 13th Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), in Gandhinagar in February 2019. The CMS is an environmental treaty agreed under the aegis of the United Nations Environment Programme. The Government of India had moved a proposal in February 2019 at the COP-CMS convention in Gujarat for the inclusion of GIBs in Appendix 1. Once this is done, CMS parties, which include more than 124 countries, will strive to protect the species. This covers actions such as conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration, and controlling other factors that might endanger them. Four female GIBs regularly sighted in Kutch Some wildlife experts said that the Union minister’s statement on missing GIBs was a matter of interpretation of data. Others said that it was an attempt by the government to put to rest the issue of taking overhead power cables underground in line with a recent Supreme Court directive to ensure GIBs’ safety. “Four female GIBs are regularly sighted in Kutch. Also, the area is home to about 20 lesser floricans that are sighted regularly,” said Anita Karn, chief conservator of forests, Kutch (wildlife) circle. “It is a part of the Central Asian Flyway route of migration and a large number of migratory species are sighted here during winters.” While the Kutch bustard sanctuary is spread over 2 sq km, the GIB habitat in Kutch sprawls across 2,000 sq km. The four females have often been spotted in the range of 20-70km from the sanctuary area, said sources. The GIB is a critically endangered bird with its last viable breeding population in India. About 100 of these magnificent grassland birds remain in the world. Though habitat loss and degradation have been responsible for this bird’s decline in the past few decades, their deaths due to collision with overhead power lines are today the biggest direct threat. During the 14th meeting of the State Board for Wildlife in February 2019, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani had said that irrespective of the costs, parties concerned must lay the power lines underground. On April 19, a Supreme Court order directed that power lines be taken underground. The order makes it mandatory for all power lines in both the ‘potential’ and ‘priority’ habitats of GIBs to be laid underground in the future. “Despite the assurance by the Gujarat chief minister, not a single power line has been taken underground in Kutch,” said Devesh Gadhvi, bustard specialist group member, International Union for Conservation of Nature. Gadhvi is also a member of the Supreme Court-appointed committee for determining the feasibility of taking transmission lines underground. The Wildlife Institute of India estimates that 18 GIBs die each year due to collision with power lines. GIBs need grasslands and semi-arid areas to survive. According to the last census of GIBs in Gujarat, in 2016 there were 25 in the wild, a rapid decline from 2007 when 48 were recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-gib-seen-in-kutch-sanctuary/articleshow/84566280.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

A total of 410 voters, all of them girls aged between 10-21 years, casted their votes to elect a sarpanch.All the four contesting candidates campaigned aggressively for a week prior to the election. The newly-elected sarpanch, Garva, who is pursuing her graduation through distance learning, is all geared up for the new role. “The experience of Balika Panchayat will be useful in effective implementation of 50% women reservation in Panchayati raj. We will focus on issues like health, education, nutritional food and we will also organize training for the career enhancement of girls,” Garva said. “Other villages also follow this model. We will form a federation of Balika Panchayats of all the villages and that federation can ask the district administration to take decisions related to women empowerment,” Suresh Chhanga, sarpanch of Kunariya village, said. In Maska village of Mandvi taluka and Mota Angiya village, the sarpanchs were elected unanimously on Monday so elections weren’t needed. A student of 11th standard Vidhi Rajgor was elected as sarpanch of Maska while Puja Garva, a student of Master of Social Work (MSW), was elected as sarpanch of Mota Angiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/20-yr-old-elected-as-first-ever-sarpanch-of-balika-panchayat/articleshow/84563859.cms||---

He said there were instructions from the Centre in this regard as a third wave of the pandemic was not ruled out yet. “The public health department has been entrusted with the task of deciding relaxations. Unless the number of Covid cases dips significantly, we cannot decide anything. The cases have plateaued, but not dipped,” he said. The state on Sunday registered around 9,000 cases. The state has been for the past month registering cases between 7,000 and 9,000 a day and currently has 1.03 lakh active cases.

This, despite the second wave being more severe than the first. According to the health officials of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), the Covid situation in the slums, which were hotspots last year during the peak of the Covid outbreak, has been under control during the second wave. Of the over 80,000 cases reported in the city during the first wave, around 25% cases were from the slums. While during the second wave, less than 10% of the 1.47 lakh cases were from the slum area. The health officials said that a sizeable number of the slum dwellers has developed natural antibodies, which helped in keeping them safe during the second wave. Slums are densely populated and herd immunity develops fast in densely populated areas, said NMC health authorities. NMC’s senior medical officer Jitendra Dhaneshwar said the Covid cases from slum areas were under control in the city during the second wave. Avesh Palod, the Covid officer of NMC, said, at present, the city has 640 active patients, of them, less than 5% are from the slums. During the second wave, the cases mostly were recorded in the residential areas like buildings, rowhouses, standalone bungalows etc. NMC had also increased the RT-PCR tests and rapid antigen tests during the second wave, which helped in the early detection of the patients and providing timely treatment. The city has reported 2.27 lakh cases since April last year. Of which, 45% in the city are from Cidco and Panchavati divisions while the remaining 55% of the cases are from Nashik East, Nashik West, Nashik Road and Satpur divisions||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-fewer-cases-in-city-slums-during-the-2nd-wave/articleshow/84561378.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Allahabad||UP: Court restores govt job of man sacked for having affair||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has set aside the dismissal order of a government employee who was dismissed from service on the ground that he was in a live-in relationship with another woman despite the fact that he is married and his wife is alive. Justice Pankaj Bhatia, while passing the order on July 14, made it clear to the state authorities to pass a fresh order imposing minor penalties. The order of dismissal was passed against the petitioner, Gore Lal Verma, solely on the ground that despite being married to one Laxmi Devi, who is alive, the petitioner maintained an extra-marital relationship with another lady named Hemlata Verma and both are staying together as husband and wife. He also has three children from the said live-in relationship. Passing the impugned order of dismissal, the authorities had recorded that the said conduct is against the provisions of the UP Government Servant Conduct Rules, 1956, and against the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act. As such, the order of dismissal from service was passed. It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that in a similar matter in case of one Aneeta Yadav, this court, after considering, set aside the dismissal order. However, an opportunity was granted to the respondents to award any minor penalty, if they so desire. It was further argued that the said judgment was challenged in special leave to appeal and the Supreme Court refused to interfere. Consequently, the said special leave to appeal was dismissed. After hearing the counsel, the court set aside his order of dismissal observing that considering the fact as well as the judgment of this court in the case of Aneeta Yadav, the petitioner is also entitled to the same benefit. Consequently, the writ petition was allowed and the respondent authority was directed to reinstate the petitioner. However, the petitioner shall not be paid back wages from the date of dismissal till today, the court directed. “It is open to the respondents to pass fresh orders for imposition of minor penalty in accordance with law, if so advised,” the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/dismissal-of-staff-sacked-for-having-live-in-ties-set-aside/articleshow/84568427.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

In a late-night order, the Thane Police Commissioner suspended two senior police inspectors—Anil Mangle, senior inspector of Naupada police station and Sanjay Gaikwad, senior inspector of Vartak Nagar police station. Two ACPs, Neeta Padvi of Naupada division and Pankaj Shirsath of Vartak Nagar division have been transferred with immediate effect on the basis of preliminary inquiry conducted. A news channel aired the revelry inside the three dance bars – Amrapali, Nataraja and Antique palace. Two bars fall under the jurisdiction of Naupada police station while one under the Vartak Nagar police station. The action has been taken on the backdrop of a sting operation carried out by a news channel which aired the entire sequence of the dance bars flouting all the norms during the pandemic with the full strength of the waiters as well as bar girls dancing and liquor being served to the customers. This is happening at a time when people have lost lives due to the pandemic, and shopkeepers and traders have been asked to strictly adhere to the guidelines laid down by the government. However, the dance bars being run right under the nose of the police has raised the question of the efficiency of the police commissioner Jaijeet Singh here. Naupada Division Assistant Commissioner of Police Nita Padvi and Vartaknagar Divisional Assistant Commissioner of Police Pankaj Shirsath have been transferred to the control room. Apart from that, cases have been filed against the orchestra bars and the process has been initiated to suspend their license permanently. Orders have been given to act against all such bars, said senior police officers. Even the state home minister Dilip Walse Patil has taken the incident seriously. Devendra Fadnavis, leader of Opposition, questioned if only these three bars were running and flouting all the norms amid the pandemic or if there were other dance bars as well running in the entire MMR region. "The roots of this corruption should also be probed," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-as-dance-bars-escape-action-4-thane-cops-face-the-music/articleshow/84566382.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Ahmedabad||Chemical exports from Gujarat grow 46% in April-May||AHMEDABAD: Exports of chemicals from grew by 46% in April-May 2021 to $3.4 billion (about Rs 25,160 crore) in April-May 2021, against $2.3 billion (17,020 crore) in the same period last year, shows data compiled by Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil). One of the top chemicals manufacturing states, Gujarat accounts for about 60% of chemical exports from India. The growth is largely attributable to the lower base of exports in April-May 2020 because of the outbreak of Covid-19 and the lockdown imposed. “The growth in chemical exports in April and May is because exports were low during the corresponding period last year,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Gujarat region, Chemexcil. Dyes, dyes intermediates, organic and inorganic chemicals, agrochemicals are among the major chemical products exported from the country. The exports of dyes and intermediates in April and May rose by 34% to $258 million (Rs 1,911 crore) on year-on-year basis from $193 million (Rs 1,428 crore) in the same months last year, according to Chemexcil data. Gujarat has the lion’s share, 70% to 75%, of India’s total exports of dyes and dye intermediates. However, there was a downward trend in chemical exports from India compared to March this year. Chemical exports fell by 6% to $1.7 billion (Rs 12,580) from $1.8 billion (Rs 13,320 crore) in March 2021. “Exports were down sequentially because of the second wave of the pandemic as well as Covid-19-induced restrictions in export markets such as Bangladesh, Turkey, Indonesia and African and European countries,” said an industry player.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chemical-exports-from-state-grow-46-in-april-may/articleshow/84566449.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat awaits Rs 10,000 crore in GST compensation||AHMEDABAD: Reflecting a major shortfall in tax collection, Gujarat still awaits GST compensation of Rs 10,186 crore from the Centre for the period from April 2020 to May 2021. The data issued by the Union finance ministry suggests that in 2020-21, GST compensation to the tune of Rs 6,583 crore remains pending for clearance from the Centre. Moreover, Rs 3,603 crore is due for clearance for the April-May 2021 period. A constitutional amendment made states clocking less than 14% year-on-year growth in their GST collection eligible for compensation for the loss of revenue, over a five-year period from 2017-2022. This was done because several state levies were subsumed under the common national tax. Due to the deficit in funds, compensation to the tune of Rs 1.36 lakh crore is yet to be given by the Centre to various states. “GST compensation of Rs 91,000 crore has been released to all states/UTs to partly meet the compensation payable for the period [from] April 2020 to March 2021 as the amount in GST compensation fund was not adequate to meet the full compensation requirement,” states the response to a question in the parliament tabled by the Union finance ministry. Higher the compensation amount due, deeper is the tax collection shortfall. Gujarat clocked a total GST collection of Rs 34,561.34 crore in 2020-21, down by 3.75% against the 2019-20 collection of Rs 35,908.64 crore. The tax collection went down due to the pandemic-induced lockdown and a slow recovery in demand. Gujarat has the fourth highest amount of compensation pending from the Centre after Maharashtra (Rs 23,133 crore); Karnataka (Rs 12,702 crore) and Uttar Pradesh (Rs 11,157 crore). Being a manufacturing-oriented state, Gujarat is at a loss when it comes to GST collection as compared to the circumstances in the previous tax regime. All manufacturing-heavy states have sought the highest compensation from the Centre. Sources said that a shortfall in tax collection and pending compensation will impact the state’s spending in the days to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-awaits-rs-10k-cr-in-gst-compensation/articleshow/84566409.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||DEO to probe allegations of ‘illegal’ admissions at DPS East||AHMEDABAD: The district education officer (DEO) has decided to send a team to investigate following allegations that controversy-ridden Delhi Public School (DPS) East on the outskirts of Ahmedabad has started enrolling students without proper government approvals in place. Hitendrasinh Padheriya, DEO, Ahmedabad city said that an application by the school to start admission for primary level students has already been turned down by his office. The school authorities had approached the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) for admitting students of secondary and higher secondary classes but their application was rejected as it did not fulfil all the requisite conditions. The school authorities were to get certain clearances from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for affiliation but it remained to be seen whether they had got the necessary approvals in place or not, Padheriya said. “We will send a team of officials on Tuesday at the school to verify if they have reopened and begun enrolling students without proper permission,” said Padheriya. The directorate of primary education (DPE), Gujarat government, had in October last year slapped a fine of Rs 50 lakh on DPS East and ordered the school to shut down after the end of academic year 2020-21. The school was functioning irregularly, without proper no-objection certificate permission from the state government between the year 2008 to 2011, according to DPE. The operations of the DPS East, situated at Hirapur, were taken over by Gujarat state government in December 2019 after the school landed in a controversy in connection to an ashram run by self-styled godman Nithyananda, located on the school premises. In all, there are about 450 students in the primary and secondary section at DPS East.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/deo-to-probe-allegations-of-illegal-admissions-at-dps-east/articleshow/84566417.cms||---

---||Surat||In a first, scientists witness lime butterflies migrating through Gujarat||SURAT: Botanists and environment enthusiasts in Gujarat are witnessing a phenomenon for the first time. The migration of common lime butterflies (Papilio Demoleus) on a large scale through the state. Experts are opining that such large-scale migration through Gujarat has not been scientifically documented or witnessed in the past. Butterfly migration is commonly seen in the southern states but since this is being seen in Gujarat for the first time, enthusiasts across the state observed these butterflies over three days starting Sunday (July 18) for future references and studies. “This is the first time that this kind of large-scale migration is observed in different part of the state like Kutch, Saurashtra, Tapi, Narmada and Dahod. In the past three to four days, it has been noticed that lime butterflies in large numbers are moving from north to south direction,” said Dr Sujit Prajapati, a botanist. Butterfly enthusiasts from different parts of Gujarat will be observing lime butterflies for five minutes every half an hour between 10 am and 5 pm. Besides observing the direction of migration and their numbers, their behaviour whether nectaring, mating, displaying courtship behaviour or simply flying will also be noted. The species of flowers on which these butterflies will be nectaring will also be noted down. All volunteers have been asked to collect their notes and submit through a Google form. “The purpose of this exercise is to understand how healthy our eco-system is. Numbers of butterflies give us an indication of our eco-system. Also, for future studies this will be helpful,” said one of the participants of this exercise. He added that currently Gujarat is being used as a corridor by this species of butterflies to migrate. “Butterflies have been noted moving from north to south at Rajasthan and Maharashtra borders which show that they are passing through Gujarat,” he further said. “Usually, butterflies migrate vertically to lay eggs, but they do migrate wherever they find food. During monsoon and post-monsoon months butterflies appear and they travel,” said Dr Suchi Gandhi, a butterfly expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/in-a-first-scientists-witness-lime-butterflies-migrating-through-gujarat/articleshow/84563887.cms||---

Bhujbal is the NCP MLA from Yeola. The number of active cases has increased from 24 to 70 in the last 20 days. The local health authorities said social gatherings, like weddings and mourning/ funerals, had resulted in the rise of the cases but now it is under control. The spurt in the cases was limited to a couple of villages, where people had gathered and failed to stick to Covid appropriate behaviour. “After we came to know about several cases in two villages, we launched a special operation to trace and test everybody in the village. We also stopped home isolation and moved the Covid patients to Covid facilities to prevent the spread of the infection,” Dr Harshal Nehete, the taluka health officer, Yeola said. The officer said the number of cases appeared to be regulated, but the failure to keep on the mask, maintain social distancing and sharing food are the reasons that primarily led to the spread of the infection. “Now the situation has been under control for the past four days as the number of fresh cases has dropped to zero in those villages, which are still under observation and restrictions are in place,” he said. In Nashik rural, the number of active cases dropped from 1,128 on June 30 to 834 on July 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rise-in-cases-in-bhujbals-home-turf-of-yeola-taluka/articleshow/84561445.cms||Abhilash Botekar

In a statement on Monday, the AIADMK leader stated that fisherfolk play an important role in foreign exchange, providing protein rich food to the people jobs to many but their livelihood is under threat due to attack by the Lankan navy. Stating that fishermen from Rameswaram are constantly under attack since the annual two-month fishing ban came to an end last month, Panneerselvam accused the Lankan navy of not only chasing and threatening the Tamil Nadu fishermen but also damaging their fishing nets, thereby affecting them in the long run as those boats are unable to engage in fishing without nets. According to him, the most recent attack was on Saturday when nearly 400 mechanised boats with nearly 2,000 fishermen had gone fishing close to the Katchatheevu area. He said that such attacks have resulted in very few fishermen going to the sea and they are returning to the shores with very less catch. Continuance of such attacks poses a threat to the income and livelihood, he added. Panneerselvam appealed to the CM to get help from the external affairs ministry to put an end to these attacks by the Lankan navy so that Tamil Nadu fishermen could peacefully engage in fishing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/protect-fishermen-from-lankan-navy-ops-urges-cm/articleshow/84566310.cms||---

The Madras high court, slamming the Centre for its wilful disobedience of the July 27, 2020, judgment favouring BC reservation in AIQ, made it clear that admission into colleges in the state could now be only upon implementing such a quota. The court gave the Union government one week to indicate the mode of implementation of OBC quota in AIQ category. “Not to implement the reservation is not a choice to the Union government,” the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said, concurring with the submissions of senior advocate P Wilson. “The Union government’s attempt to not implement the OBC reservation quota in respect of the All India Quota (AIQ) seats for admission to medical courses in the state in the academic year 2021-22 appears to be contumacious, in derogation of the order dated July 27, 2020, passed by this court and contrary to the representation made before the Supreme Court,” the judges said on Monday.The court made the observations on a contempt plea moved by DMK against the Centre for failing to implement the high court order dated July 27, 2020 to provide OBC reservations in admission to UG and PG medical courses from the present academic year. When the plea came up for hearing, senior advocate P Wilson contended that despite the clear direction of the court to implement the reservation from the present academic year, the union has now taken a stand that it cannot implement the same pending disposal of the Saloni Kumari case before the Supreme Court. The apex court has made it clear that the Saloni Kumari case has nothing to do with the present case. Despite such clarification, the union is refusing to implement the orders of this court, Wilson added. Recording the submissions, the bench said, “It now appears that the union seeks to change track and keep the implementation of the OBC reservation as per the 1993 state act in suspension till the Saloni Kumari case is decided by the Supreme Court.” Prima facie, it is completely unacceptable that despite the union representing before the Supreme Court that the OBC reservation would be implemented in respect of the AIQ seats in this state in terms of the order of July 27, 2020, passed by this court, the union would now not implement the reservation on the specious ruse that the Saloni Kumari matter had first to be decided by the Supreme Court, the bench said. The court then adjourned the hearing to July 26 for the union to file its affidavit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-med-admission-sans-obc-quota-in-aiq-hc/articleshow/84566329.cms||Suresh Kumar

But in the end, after more than a couple of years of persistent follow-up, this stratosphere-troposphere radar was cleared and set up at the main campus in Cusat in December 2016. Now, almost all major institutions looking for wind profile data have tied-up with this centre. “We started running our trials from 2017 to check all the technicalities and now in the last five years, we have had 3-4 PhDs and about 15 publications in top international journals,” said K Mohan Kumar, founder director, ACARR. “It is the world’s first 205 MHz stratosphere-troposphere (ST) wind profiler radar,” he said. Installed with the support of Science Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology, this radar provides a cost-effective and high precision technology capable of monitoring in all weather conditions round the clock. Its primary goal is to understand the characteristics of the Indian summer monsoon at its gateway at Cochin. “Because of its unique facility of reading vertical wind speeds, we can alert the IMD on sudden changes in the wind speeds,” he added. In 2018, when the Cochin airport had to be closed down suddenly because of the cross-winds and one international airliner had to make a tricky landing, the radar facility recorded all the wind changes in the system. “We have linked up with all universities that have ST Radar facilities and share data for academic research,” said Mohan Kumar. “The facility is open to all researchers from national institutes, universities and other academic institutions for conducting regular as well as special experimental campaigns, based on their scientific proposals,” he said. With the back-to-back cyclones increasing in the Arabian Sea and extreme weather events in Kerala, Cusat researchers here are at the forefront of studying any changes and analysing them for future understanding of climate change. “We have started doing a lot of studies on the extreme weather events being reported in Kerala also. Many of the papers will be published soon, said S Abhilash, director- ACARR. Two major papers among them are on the Kerala floods of 2018 and similar extreme rainfall events of 2019. “In 2019, we had described the August single-day rainfall as a cloud burst. But across the world, people refused to believe it because such mesoscale cloud events happen only in North India. So we analysed the entire event and published the work,” he said. Experts say that in the wake of so many changes in the weather systems in the west coast and Kerala, having such high-end equipment will prove advantageous to the IMD in its accurate weather forecasting and warning systems. “Last week, North Paravur and some other parts of Kerala received around 5cm rainfall in two hours. It is an equivalent of a mini-cloud burst which saw several trees uprooted. We can’t predict such an event early, however, we can sound it out in the Nowcast forecast which is a three-hour early warning,” Abhilash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/st-radar-at-the-forefront-of-studying-climate-change/articleshow/84563901.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The woman customer, who had bought a water bottle from the eatery on Platform No. 1 on Sunday night, was stopped by Naresh Salecha, member (finance) in the railway board, to check if she was given a receipt for her purchase. The woman said that she had bought it for Rs 15 and that she had not got a receipt. “Food is free if no receipt is provided,” Salecha told the customer, pointing out to a signboard. He then made the employee at the eatery provide her a receipt and also refund the Rs 15 she had paid. He warned the stall to ensure that they don’t repeat the mistake, else face stringent action. Salecha said such boards have been put up at all the stalls at railway stations across the country and asked the senior officials of Madurai railway division who accompanied him to ensure that customers are given receipts and take action against the erring stalls. Naresh inspected the waiting hall and toilets, CCTV monitoring room, foot over bridges, parcel room and other passenger amenities and development works in the station. The railway board member, who had inspected construction of the new Pamban railway bridge, said there was no fund constraint in constructing the bridge. Stating that the bridge is an important one for the railways, he added that it might be completed between March and June, next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rly-station-eatery-asked-to-refund-rs-15/articleshow/84566362.cms||---

While 40,731 people went to BMC’s free vaccine centres, 32,046 took the shot at private hospitals. “Perhaps the rains prevented people from turning up in higher numbers,” said a civic official. Around 65 lakh shots have been given to people in the city, including the 15 lakh who are fully vaccinated. While 12 pregnant women got vaccinated at BMC centres, nine went to private centres on Monday. Totally, 72 pregnant women have taken the vaccine since the BMC included them in the vaccination drive last week. “We are likely to get fresh stocks and will step up the drive in the next few days,” said the official. Meanwhile, the state government released vaccination details for Sunday when 1,25,463 people took the shot. While 62,000-plus were in the 18-44 age group, almost 60,000 were over 45 years of age. Maharashtra has so far given out 3.95 crore vaccines and leads in India in the mass vaccination drive. Officials said the st-ate is scheduled to cross the 4-cr-ore mark in vaccination on Tuesday. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state needs 3 crore vaccine doses to complete inoculation in the 10 districts with high incidence of Covid-19. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-76000-mumbaikars-brave-rain-to-get-the-jab/articleshow/84566377.cms||---

The truck driver fled the spot and police are trying to trace him. The incident took place around 6am on the Ring Road and cops at Wazirabad police station received a call about the accident. A police team, that reached the spot, found that a container truck had overturned on a Maruti Eeco van. “Six people were found trapped inside the van. While four of them were pulled out easily, the remaining two could only be rescued after lifting the container truck and cutting the roof of the van. All six were rushed to a hospital where they were undergoing treatment. None of them had fatal injuries,” said a senior police officer. Police said the injured people were coming from Dwarka side and were going to Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh. The accident also led to traffic jam on the main Wazirabad road. Both vehicles were removed from the road after which the traffic flow returned to normal.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Part of Kamla Nagar Market shut for Covid violations||NEW DELHI: The district authorities ordered a part of Kamla Nagar Market closed till July 21 for violating Covid-19 norms. In the order, the sub-divisional magistrate, Civil Lines, specified that Kohlapur Road and Inner Circle Market (Bada Gol Chakkar) would remain closed till 8pm on July 21, or until further orders. The shutdown decision was taken on Monday after an inspection of the market found heavy footfall and shopkeepers and showrooms unable to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Meanwhile, traders expecting to get the similarly closed export market in Sarojini Nagar reopened were disappointed after a meeting with the district administration on Monday. At the meeting, the shop owners were instructed to issue identity cards to shopkeepers and their employees within four days to regulate the presence of illegal hawkers and mobile vendors. Business owners were also asked to restrict the employees in the shops. Unhappy with these decisions, the traders decided to keep their market closed on Monday. They claimed that the administration was not taking steps to check crowding or the unrestricted entry of shoppers and expected the shopkeepers to implement the precautionary norms. “No other market in Delhi has been asked to issue identity cards with photos and other details,” grumbled Ashok Randhawa, president, Mini Market Traders’ Association. A Delhi government official said that the decision to have the shops issue identity cards was taken only after the shopkeepers complained about the illegal vendors in the market. “Issuing ID cards will solve this problem to some extent,” the official said. “As far as the number of visitors is concerned, regulating their entry into the market is difficult but it is possible at the shops.” Kuldeep Singh Sawhney, president, Sarojini Nagar Market Association, said that shopkeepers were united on the issue and would keep the shops closed until the export market was reopened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/part-of-kamla-nagar-market-shut-for-covid-violations/articleshow/84568543.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Patna||Flood scenario in Ganga basin likely to worsen||PATNA: The river basins of North Koel, Punpun, Falgu, Sakri-Panchane and other smaller ones in south Bihar and Jharkhand regions are expected to receive moderate to heavy rainfall over the next three days, beginning Monday, according to the flood bulletin released by the water resources department (WRD). While the water levels of these rivers are likely to increase during the period, the water discharge through Indrapuri barrage across Sone will also increase. Consequently, the water level of the Ganga is also expected to increase in the coming days, as it will have to carry water from Sone as well as from the north Bihar rivers which are otherwise on spate. The flood scenario in the Ganga basin is likely to worsen, as its water level was rising downstream from Hathidah onwards to Munger, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon, according to WRD sources. As far as north Bihar rivers are concerned, the WRD flood bulletin said that the water discharge through Birpur barrage across Kosi increased from 1.2 lakh cusecs in the morning to 1.53 lakh cusecs in the afternoon due to light to moderate rainfall received in its catchment areas of Nepal, besides in its basin areas of north Bihar. This, in turn, may lead to increase in the volume of water flowing through Kosi, and consequent flood along the downstream right up to Kursela in Katihar district For similar reasons, water discharge through Valmki Nagar barrage across Gandak kept on fluctuating all through the day from 1.5 lakh cusecs in the morning to 1.47 lakh cusecs around the noon, and then increasing to 1.5lakh cusecs in the afternoon. Among other north Bihar rivers, Burhi Gandak was still flowing above the danger level in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Khagaria districts, but the water level showed decreasing trend. Similarly, the water level of Bagmati was rising in Sitamarhi and Sheohar districts, but was stable in Muzaffarpur. On the other hand, Kamla was still flowing above the danger level at Jainagar and Jhanjharpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flood-scenario-in-ganga-basin-likely-to-worsen/articleshow/84563931.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Lucknow||Group of retired bureaucrats hails Uttar Pradesh’s Covid control steps||LUCKNOW: Praising the UP government for its effective Covid control measures, a group of “concerned citizens from various walks of life” has distanced itself from the criticism by another group of retired civil officers, academics, etc which had condemned the government for a “complete breakdown of governance”. In an open letter on Monday, 151 civil servants and army officers have professed its “unshakable belief in the greatness of Indian democracy and its sacred institutions, the sovereignty and integrity of India, a robust economy and a cohesive society knitted in the fabric woven from the highest human values”. The statement, issued on behalf of retired civil servants, academics, lawyers and retired members of the defence services, by UP's former chief secretary Yogendra Narain, has accused the first group of posing to be non-political but projecting India in a negative light on the international platform. Praising the UP government’s efforts at bringing the second wave of Covid-19 under control, the statement says that “scoring brownie points and flashing some random pictures of dead bodies floating in River Ganga is aimed at damning the hardworking and fearless Corona warriors on the field. Instead of building a disproportionately negative narrative, these whining former civil servants should have opted to work as volunteers in the crisis areas”. It has also questioned the intent behind the statement, asking why this group never questioned previous governments in UP under whom, as per NCRB data of 2017, UP topped the list of states with the highest number of crimes against women. It has also sought to know what the group of 236 has only questioned the UP government while ignoring other state governments. “Alleging that petty criminals or innocent citizens, and predominantly Muslims, Dalits and OBCs are being eliminated through police encounters in UP is a very serious allegation. It has been learnt that from March 20, 2017 to July 11, 2021, 8,367 police encounters took place in UP in which 140 lost their lives. Only 51 out of the 140 criminals killed were from minority communities. Thirteen policemen were killed in the so-called ‘fake’ encounters, and another 1,140 policemen were injured,” the statement says. The statement defends the arrest of journalist Siddiqui Kappan from Kerala, who was arrested from Mathura district while on his way to Hathras to cover a story of a rape victim, saying that Kappan is “allegedly an active member of the radical Popular Front of India (PFI)”, and was sent to judicial custody as per the law of the land, and denied bail on merit by competent courts. Earlier, a group of 236 had condemned the ‘Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance’ in its statement, saying it was open to misuse and since being made into law, had “been used by the state to frame innocent Muslim men who have friendly or romantic relations, or enter into marriage, with Hindu women.” Narain's statement says that even before Independence, princely states had passed laws against religious conversions and after Independence, states like Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand etc had legislated on matters relating to unlawful conversions. The law in UP, it said, applied to everyone irrespective of their religion. Defending against charges by the 236 where it accused the government of misuse of the draconian National Security Act and gave the example of 2020 when 139 people were booked under the draconian National Security Act of which 76 were booked for alleged cow slaughter, 13 for anti-CAA protests and 37 for alleged heinous crimes, the Narain statement alleges that these are incorrect statistics. “The NSA was imposed in 222 matters in 2020, out of which only 88 cases were related to cow slaughter, which fall under the purview of NSA as a serious threat to public order in a sensitive state,” it sought to clarify. It adds that in criticising the UP government for legitimising vigilantism in the state, the group of 236 has forgotten that community policing was not launched by the current government but has been used by previous governments as well. The signatories to the statement include Raj Bhargava, former chief secretary of UP, former UP DGP OP Singh, former Delhi police commissioner BS Bassi, seven former Ambassadors including Lakshmi Puri, wife of civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri, seven former judges, 57 retired members of the armed forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/group-of-retired-bureaucrats-hails-ups-covid-control-steps/articleshow/84568548.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The minister made this statement in response to assembly speaker M Appavu’s request to form a new revenue division with Valliyoor as its headquarters, as people struggled to travel all the way to the revenue division office at Cheranmahadevi that is 75km away in the other end of the district. The speaker also sought forming a new taluk with Panagudi as its headquarters. Ramachandran said that there is a need for the same in the new and bifurcated districts and the announcement in this regard will be made by the chief minister after consulting with the officials concerned. The minister also said that vacancies in the lower ranks in the revenue department will be filled up shortly to ensure effective functioning of the department. Responding to the delay in land survey, he said that surveyors have been instructed to inform the applicants well in advance about the survey date and that it will be done within three weeks from the date of applying for the same. Later, Ramachandran said that 41,803 petitions were received from Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Kanyakumari districts under the Ungal Thoguthiyil Muthalamaichar (chief minister in your constituency) programme, of which 13,462 had been addressed. Officials have been asked to focus on scrutinizing the petitions and redressing grievances and ignore minor mistakes in the petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/revenue-divisions-to-be-formed-in-bifurcated-dists-min/articleshow/84566379.cms||---

As per the amended rules, vintage vehicles which are more than 50 years, with no major alterations, will be registered in the VA registration number series. The registration fee is Rs 20,000 and Rs 5,000 for re-registration. The sale of vintage vehicles is already on top gear in the state following the central government announcing introduction of a scrappage policy. “The new registration rules will further boost sales as people need not to fear about the vehicles being scrapped. People in Kerala are nowadays showing an interest in collecting vintage vehicles. Youngsters are attracted to motorcycles. Those in the middle age or above prefer vintage cars. We receive many calls from people wanting to sell vintage vehicles due to financial issues and difficulties in maintain them,” says Rinesh Ravi, Cochin Vintage Club president. Age and condition determine the price which can run into lakhs of rupees. But many owners do not part with them due to emotional reasons. There were many vintage cars in Kerala. But the number has come down now with people in other parts of India and abroad buying them. “As there are not many vintage vehicles in the state to change hands, most of the vehicles are brought to Kerala from other states. The new registration rules will certainly boost the market. In our workshop, we get vintage vehicles manufactured between 1945 and 1965, for restoration. There are owners who are ready to shell out lakhs,” says Suresh Krishnan who runs a workshop attending only to vintage vehicles in Ernakulam. Those running the vintage vehicle restoration workshops either fabricate parts or import them from other states or abroad. It takes six months to restore a vehicle fully and one will have to shell out Rs 5 to 6 lakhs, depending on various factors. However, Akhil Vishnu, a workshop owner with a collection of 30 vintage vehicles, says he does not believe that the market will change much. “Currently we can run a vintage vehicle on the road any day. But the amended rules do not permit that, though the price of the vehicle will rise. One can take it to road for display and mechanical purposes only,” says Akhil. MVD officials, meanwhile, said the rules implementation will take time since the ministry need to issue further changes to the registration process and also update the registration software.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/amended-rules-to-boost-vintage-vehicle-sales/articleshow/84563921.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Mumbai||Over 50% of Mumbai’s senior citizens have taken both shots: BMC||MUMBAI: Six months into the Covid vaccination drive, every sixth Mumbaikar who is eligible for the shot is fully vaccinated, but a closer look at the city’s vaccination figures reveals over 50% of the city’s senior citizens -- considered most vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-2 virus -- have got both their shots. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said half of Mumbai’s 60-plus population had been fully vaccinated. Of the 11 lakh senior citizens counted during the BMC’s ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ survey last year, the first-shot coverage is 88.8%. As per BMC’s vaccine update on Monday, 9.77 lakh senior citizens in Mumbai have taken at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine as against 5.58 lakh, who have taken both. In all, 55% of the total 90 lakh people in the city who are eligible have taken one shot of either Covishield or Covaxin. In the mass vaccination drive, which began on January 16, the city’s coverage seems higher in terms of percentage than the figures for Maharashtra and India. While 10.7% of Maharashtra’s 8.5 crore eligible population is fully vaccinated, close to 36% have got at least one vaccine. The all-India first-shot coverage is 23%, while 5.9% are fully vaccinated against Covid. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said, “We have covered 15 lakh of the population with two vaccines, but there is a long way ahead.” The 90 lakh population needs 1.8 crore doses, but only 65 lakh doses have been injected so far. There are over 400 vaccine centres in Mumbai which manage between 60,000 and 1.25 lakh doses on most days. A civic hospital doctor said, “The main challenge is the availability of stocks. We have the infrastructure to vaccinate the entire city in two months -- except for adequate vaccine doses.” There is, however, an issue with vaccination coverage data: as India allows every citizen to take a shot in any part of the country, some of those vaccinated in Mumbai could be residents of nearby satellite cities such as Thane and Vasai or distant cities. “While Aadhar card of the recipient is checked before vaccination, CoWin portal doesn’t give a breakup of a person’s domicile or temporary address. So we have no way of knowing if all those vaccinated in Mumbai live in the city or were travelling through,” said a senior BMC official. Kakani said senior citizens are unlikely to have travelled far from their home for the vaccination. “At least in the case of senior citizens, we can say half of Mumbai’s 60-plus population is fully vaccinated,” he said. In the case of the under-60 age-group, he said people travelling from Thane or Kalyan could be Mumbai’s workforce. “During our house-to-house ‘My Family My Responsibility’ survey, we found the city’s population is roughly 1.29 crore,” Kakani said. His health team estimates roughly 45 lakh belong to the 18-45 age-group, while 35 lakh are in the 45-plus age-group. As per Monday’s vaccine update, 50% of the 18-44 age-group, whose vaccination started in fits and bursts on May 1, have got their first shot. In the 45-plus age-group (which includes the 60-plus too), 32% are fully vaccinated while 67% are partially vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-50-of-citys-sr-citizens-have-taken-both-shots-bmc/articleshow/84566469.cms||Malathy Iyer

The guest workers were mostly engaged in redevelopment of Periyar bus terminal carried out at a cost of Rs 167 crore, construction of convention centre at Thamukkam at Rs 47.7 crore, multi-level car parking (MLCP) at Rs 42 crore and underground drainage work in 15 wards north of Vaigai river at Rs 275 crore. While the Periyar bus terminal, convention centre were to be completed by March 2021, the MLCP was to have been completed by December 2020, but all are delayed. Officials said that only 80% of the work at Periyar bus terminal project and the convention centre has been completed, while 90% of the work has been completed in the MLCP. But, only 30% of the work has been completed in the case of the UGD system. An official said that 400 guest workers were involved in the smart city works, of which 250 have left to their native places in the last few months. Since they are yet to come back, works are being carried out using the local workforce. However, this has slowed down the work on the projects, he said. Another official said that with the Covid-19 cases having come down, the projects will gain momentum soon. “The focus is again on the other works including the progress of the smart city works. Although some of the projects have neared completion, they is no discussion yet on their inauguration,” he said. The projects which have neared completion are one part of the Periyar bus terminal, heritage route development, landscaping of Masi streets, construction of tourist plaza at Jansi Rani Park and Kunnathur Chatram buildings, an official said. It maybe noted that the corporation had proposed 14 projects under the smart city scheme at the cost of Rs 974 crore, of which only one project - the smart fruit market - has been completed so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-smart-city-works-slow-down/articleshow/84566407.cms||V Devanathan

Roma Khanna was initially appointed as the local organising committee’s tournament director for both major tournaments. However, that post has been vacant since her resignation in April. The AIFF has now appointed two project directors – Nandini Arora and Ankush Arora – with AIFF general secretary Kushal Das taking a more hands-on approach. “It does not make sense to appoint a tournament director now,” a senior AIFF official told TOI on Tuesday. “The two project directors have been given different roles for the tournaments. The general secretary will have an important role to play in the organisation of these tournaments.” Roma, who spearheaded the bid for the Fifa U-17 World Cup back in 2019, was later appointed as the tournament director, the first Indian in this post at a Fifa event. She resigned citing personal reasons. Nandini and Ankush are already working with the AIFF. While Nandini is head of community engagement and protocol at the LOC, Ankush was head of head of operations at Fifa U-17 Women's World Cup before the tournament got postponed. 2022 will be a busy year for AIFF with two major tournaments lined up. The Women’s Asian Cup will held in Mumbai and Pune from January 20 to February 6 with 12 teams, four more than the last four editions. The U-17 Women's World Cup will be played from October 11 to 30 next year. India were earlier scheduled to host the 2020 U-17 World Cup, but it was postponed to 2021 before being cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aiff-appoints-two-project-directors-for-next-years-major-tournaments/articleshow/84597963.cms||---

They urged the chief minister to keep up his assurance of taking a policy decision against Sterlite and passing a special act to remove the company from Tuticorin. The federation accused Sterlite of producing false data pertaining to oxygen requirement to ensure that their plants remain functional for a few more months, since the three-month deadline ends on July 31. “The sealed copper smelter plant had informed the court that they can produce 1,050 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen every day but have only produced a little more than that till date,” said C Sujith one of the representatives. The petitioners said that they will stage protests if the plant is given extension for oxygen generation. According to Sterlite, a total of 1,914.08 metric tonnes of liquefied oxygen and 7,833 cubic meters of gaseous oxygen in cylinders have been dispatched till Monday evening. Meanwhile, representatives of various associations in support of Sterlite, submitted representations to ministers Thangam Thennarasu (industries) and Ma Subramaniam (health and family welfare) on Monday to continue operating the oxygen generation plants of Sterlite.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sterlites-bid-to-extend-oxygen-generation-in-plant-opposed/articleshow/84566421.cms||---

A circular issued on Monday said Mhada and its Slum Improvement Board, that is responsible for utilisation of MP and MLA funds, will need state government approval to carry out any development work.  Recently, the housing department has issued many government resolutions requiring Mhada to clear projects with it before issuing the NOC and Letter of Intent for redevelopment of buildings on Mhada properties. The circular now specifies plot sizes. TimesViewThe housing department’s plan to take all decisions which Mhada was hitherto responsible for has not come as a surprise. It is evident that the housing authority’s vast land bank and properties are sought to be controlled from Mantralaya. The housing secretary is already a member of Mhada, and all decisions are taken with his concurrence. Hence, it raises suspicion that the department wants to usurp Mhada's powers.Mhada has 104 residential layouts in the city with vast open spaces that are encroached or taken over under the guise of improvement by trusts connected to elected representatives. Many MPs and MLAs often use their local area development funds to build a community hall, gymnasium and such amenities. They ensure that these are leased to their trusts which typically turn them into private enterprises, denying ordinary citizens access to the open spaces, said sources. “The government has learnt from the redevelopment of Patra chawl, a 47 acre Mhada layout in Goregaon that is stalled for 22 years. The developer sold parcels of Mhada land to nine developers and original residents are still to get homes,” said officials. The circular says that in many redevelopment cases, the government can’t do a thing when it gets complaints from residents as it has no control on such projects.  However, observers said the decision may not yield better management or transparency. “It is true there are scams happening under Mhada’s watch, but this is government trying to micromanage. It could have appointed its representatives to Mhada board and sought monthly reports,” said a source.  An architect said, on anonymity, that they would now need to approach Mantralaya for every issue. Mhada ex-president and housing activist Chandrashekar Prabhu said no decisions are taken by Mhada without government’s nod. “The housing secretary and other bureaucrats are members of the Mhada board. Mhada authority does not approve anything without the housing secretary’s consent. The happenings in Patra chawl were always known to the then government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mhada-now-needs-hsg-dept-nod-to-redevelop-plots-over-5k-sq-ft/articleshow/84566628.cms||Clara Lewis

It has 400 beds and 12 operation theatres, among other facilities that are dedicated solely for mother and child care. “Currently, we are starting only OPD services for gynaecology and paediatric units. Installation of equipment is in process. Once everything is complete, admissions as well as surgeries will also be started,” said a senior official. The mother and child block of AIIMS was conceptualised over a decade ago to decongest the main OPD. In 2014, foundation was laid. However, due to various factors, for example paucity of funds and Covid pandemic, operationalisation of the project was delayed, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-opens-mother-child-block-partially/articleshow/84566460.cms||---

The online event, which is aimed as a stress-buster activity for IT professionals by promoting their creative side, is evoking good response from techies. President of PT Aneesh Panthalani said that the contest was launched as following trolls and memes has become a favourite time-killer for most people. The contest also aims at addressing the problems faced by techies during work from home. The organizers believe that humorous approach will be the best way to raise these issues and get the attention of bosses. “Trolling is an art that demands a certain amount of creative and witty skills. There are many creative techies among us but work stress often restrains them from showcasing their creativity. So we thought of giving them a platform to expose their creative side. Due to the pandemic and work- from-home culture all those fun activities, usually held in office, disappeared,” Panthalani said. The theme of the contest is ‘work from home’ and the entries will be accepted for the next three weeks. The techies have to create trolls and post it on the official Facebook page of PT and they will be shortlisted based on the number of likes received. “Judges, mostly from the social media team of PT, will evaluate all the entries and delete if any of the posts are obscene or could kick-off a controversy. Creator of the most-liked troll will be the winner and there will be gifts,” Panthalani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/troll-contest-for-techies-begins/articleshow/84563951.cms||---

The court refused to accept the argument put up by the insurance company and the third-party administrator Genesis India Insurance (TPA) Pvt Ltd.The court in its order stated that the VMC’s notification does not mention any packages, but it only mentions the list of hospitals. “The complainant has taken the policy of the rival company so as per the clauses of the policy, it should approve the claim of the complainant and not cite any notification of VMC to wrongly deduct money,” the court stated in its judgement.In this case, the man had purchased a policy cover of Rs 5 lakh. He incurred expenses of Rs 1.9 lakh on Covid treatment at a private hospital in Karelibaug where he was admitted in last September. The insurance company paid him only Rs 1 lakh and the remaining amount was deducted citing the notification issued by VMC.The court asked the insurance company to return the remaining amount along with 7% interest and also pay Rs 3,000 as compensation to the man.The civic body in the past had issued notification categorizing Covid-designated hospitals based on the facilities they had. The categorization had capped the prices that the hospitals can charge for treating Covid-infected patients. During the second wave, VMC had even publicized a helpline number for patients and their relatives to reach out if they found that the bills were inflated.In April, TOI had highlighted the legal fraternity’s opinion that VMC’s notification is not legally binding and so it cannot be used by insurance companies and TPA to reject claim amounts. Lawyers and experts had said that VMC’s notification is not a law and so it cannot be used by insurance companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmcs-notification-cannot-be-used-to-reject-claims/articleshow/84564010.cms||---
---||Lucknow||35 lakh households got power every year between 2017-21 in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Electrification of households during the BJP regime increased by four times in comparison to that in the SP regime, an internal report of UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has stated. According to the report, an average of 9.55 lakh households were electrified every year between 2012 and 2017, when the SP government was in power. In four years of the BJP rule, an average of 35.2 lakh households have been electrified every year. The report also claims that the aggregate transmission and commercial (AT&C) losses, which also signify incidents of power theft, saw reduction from around 40% during the previous SP regime to around 24% at present. Energy minister Shrikant Sharma said that the report is a ‘precise’ and ‘factual’ description of work done by his department after the BJP came to power in 2017. “Power was largely restricted to a few VIP districts during the previous SP government. We did away with the practice by accelerating electrification of households through various schemes, including the Saubhagya scheme of the Centre,” he told TOI. Under the Saubhagya scheme alone, more than 1.4 crore households have been electrified by the state government since September 2017. Sharma said that effective reforms in the power sector were implemented through close and regular monitoring of the schemes and projects. The report, not surprisingly, drew a sharp riposte from the SP quarters with the party’s chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary questioning the BJP for making such claims despite failing to produce even a single unit of electricity in the last four years. “Whatever electricity is wheeled into the grid is because of the efforts of Akhilesh Yadav during his tenure as UP CM. Even the blueprint of the sub-stations which were constructed in the last four years was laid during the SP government,” he said. Chaudhary squarely accused the BJP government of peddling lies by fabricating such ungrounded reports. According to the report, the total number of majras electrified registered an increase of 71% from 70,877 in 2012-17 to 1,21,324 in the last four years. It further claims that the average rural power supply went up from 12.25 hours during the SP regime to 17.43 hours in the present regime. The transmission capacity increased from 16,500 MW in 2016-17 to 26,500 MW in 2020-21. Sharma said that the department would be able to increase it further up to 28,000 MW by early next year. Significantly, this will also be the time when the UP assembly elections will be round the corner. The report points out that around 4,130 circuit Km (cKm) of underground cabling works have been carried out in 636 towns under the Centre’s flagship Integrated Power Development Scheme. In fact, 7,200 cKm overhead lines have been replaced with underground cabling, the report said. The report has come to the fore even as BJP hammers out an exhaustive plan to take its achievement to the ground level in the run-up to the UP assembly elections due next year. The reforms in power sector, BJP sources said, is a key issue which BJP seeks to flag as an achievement while charting out a deft strategy to take on an unrelenting opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/35-lakh-households-got-power-every-yr-between-2017-21-in-up/articleshow/84568602.cms||Pankaj Shah

Two pistols and 23 live cartridges were also recovered from the spot. The arrested mukhiyas were identified as Raju Paswan (Darigaon), Vijay Paswan (Alampur), Munna Singh (Khudhanu), and Rajvansh Paswan (Ugahani). They were sent to jail after undergoing a medical test. Rohtas district magistrate (DM) Dharmendra Kumar told this reporter on Monday that he had written a letter to the government for taking appropriate action against the mukhiyas, who violated the prohibition law. According to sources, this is the first time when so many elected representatives have been arrested in the state since the implementation of the prohibition law in 2016. Based on a tip off that a booze party was being organised in the house of a mukhiya candidate near the Darigaon police station, Rohtas SP Ashish Bharti formed a team of cops and directed them to raid the village immediately. “The cops rushed to the spot and caught 19 people, including four mukhiyas. They were brought to the Sasaram sadar hospital for a preliminary breath test,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rohtas-dm-writes-to-govt-for-action-against-4-mukhiyas-held-for-boozing/articleshow/84564061.cms||---
---||Trichy||Stray animals still a menace on roads in Trichy||TRICHY: The stray animal menace in the city has resurfaced with easing of lockdown restrictions and is disrupting vehicular movement on roads. The movements of animals during the night hours, that too on arterial roads used by public buses, pose a threat for two-wheeler riders. Without safe houses to seize the stray animals, both the Trichy Corporation and city police are hesitant in taking decisive action. As a result, stray animals roaming on the roads are causing traffic snarls. Stray cattle can often be seen on Collector office road, Vellamandi road and interior roads in KK Nagar and Khajamalai. “In Lingam Nagar and Kulumani road, stray horses cross the narrow road during peak hours. All those animals have owners who are letting their livestock stray on roads,” said V Baskaran, a resident of Woraiyur. Social activists sought the law enforcement agencies to hold livestock owners responsible for the traffic snarls. The civic body, however, does not have a solutions to control the menace. A safe shelter to accommodate the animals seized until the owners arrive and pay a penalty is still missing in the city. Similarly, the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals is yet to be formed in Trichy for overseeing and resolving such grievances. “We will soon arrive at a suitable solution to deal with the stray animals’ menace,” an official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/stray-animals-still-a-menace-on-roads-in-trichy-city/articleshow/84566450.cms||---

Earlier this month, police had to lob 30 tear-gas shells to disperse mobs that turned violent at Doswada village in Tapi district during the public hearing arranged by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB). The hearing was organized according to the environmental rules laid down by the Centre. The public hearing was held after the state government had signed a pact with Hindustan Zinc for a smelter complex with a capacity of 3 lakh tonnes per annum, entailing investment of Rs 10,000 crore, on 415 acres in the village. According to the petitioner’s advocate, Mahesh Vasava, the PIL seeks HC directions to the authorities to follow the terms and conditions of PESA to establish an industrial unit in a tribal area. It requests a resolution from the gram sabha endorsing the project. The public hearing had certain restrictions due to Covid-19 rules and people expressed their protest at it. The MLA urged the HC to direct that PESA provisions, especially those contained in Section 4, be followed. After getting a consensus at the gram sabha, a public hearing can be held by the authorities for the project. The PIL is likely to come up for hearing soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vedanta-project-vasava-moves-hc/articleshow/84566481.cms||---

A portion of the funds earmarked for the scrapped Padmasarovaram project will be used for the construction of the memorial.For the construction of the memorial near Mangalavanam, the corporation will have to shell out a total of around Rs 2.5 crore. The memorial will consist of a wooded area, a lobby, an art gallery, a ‘poet's corner’, a knowledge park, and a ‘tranquility space’.The project to build a memorial for the first Jnanpith awardee from Kerala had been remaining on paper for more than two decades due to the apathy on the part of authorities. Sankara Kurup had won the highest literary honour of the country for “Odakkuzhal” an anthology of poems, in 1965. “In a short span, we have been able to identify land for the project, clear a dispute over the road access to the land and get the design prepared. So, we have completed all the preparatory works for the construction of the memorial. It will be part of the city’s cultural heritage,” said mayor M Anil Kumar, who is taking a special initiative for making the project a reality.“The corporation council has given its nod for including the project under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) scheme. We are awaiting the approval from the Amrut board for using its funds,” the mayor said. The wooded area will look like a sacred grove, providing a green cover for the memorial. The area near to the art gallery has been earmarked for landscaping. The ‘poet's corner’ next to it will have books and other things related to the poet. Audio records of his works will also be played in the ‘poet’s corner’. “Rarely do we get a chance to design a monument. And the fact that we have got an opportunity to design Sankara Kurup’s memorial doubles up our joy. We have given special emphasis on creating an ambience, which is poetic. We have been keen about preparing a design which matches with the atmosphere of Mangalavanam situated nearby,” said architect S Gopakumar of Kumar Group, which prepared the design of the memorial.Facilities will be provided to people to practise yoga and listen to the music of flute at the ‘tranquility space’. The plan is to develop the memorial into a cultural hub. It will be also be a venue for various programmes under Art Space for Kochi (ASK) project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/g-sankara-kurup-memorial-in-city-inches-closer-to-reality/articleshow/84551502.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Rain and gusts of wind reaching 45-55kmph brought down trees across the state damaging homes, walls, electrical infrastructure and cars. Fire and emergency services’ personnel were kept busy with calls for trees and debris to be cleared. The department received 12 reports of tree falls, which included a massive tree in the heart of the state capital. A large tree collapsed on four parked cars. “Nobody was hurt in the incident. The extent of the damage has not been estimated,” said a fire department official. IMD has said that heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places from July 20 to 23 with wind speeds likely to hit 65kmph occasionally. Trees collapsed on a house at Camurlim and on a house in Parra but the residents had a lucky escape. According to the IMD’s ARG network, Old Goa received 181mm of rainfall while Mapusa received 57mm of rainfall. In Khareband, the Sal was flowing close to the danger mark and the fire brigade personnel were on alert. Waterlogging was seen on Margao old station road, Khareband, as well as in Arlem. The state’s southernmost taluka of Canacona saw several instances of waterlogging as incessant rain threw life there out of gear. Low-lying fields and some water bodies were filled as rain pounded the taluka. Messy interior roads also inconvenienced two-wheeler riders as the taluka recorded 2,092mm (82 inches) till 4pm on Monday. With fields inundated, some paddy nurseries have also been washed away, causing losses to farmers. While the three main rivers of the taluka—Talpona, Galgibaga and Saleri—are above the danger mark, the Chapoli dam is gradually reaching its capacity of 38.7m. As of Monday, it was at 37.82m. Water logging was seen at various places in the state. There was a brief respite in the rain pattern for a few hours in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-respite-from-showers-as-trees-fall-damaging-homes-car-and-infra/articleshow/84568690.cms||---

Addressing an RSS-BJP coordination meeting, senior RSS functionaries, including its general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale and joint secretary Dr Krishna Gopal, said the BJP would get a second term only if ‘Sangh, Sangathan and Sarkar’ work in perfect coordination. For the first time, the RSS meeting with the UP BJP was also attended by national general secretary (organization) BL Santhosh though he remained a listener throughout the meeting. Arun Kumar, who was recently given the role of the coordinator between BJP and RSS, was conspicuous by his absence. Sources said UP BJP general secretary (organization), Sunil Bansal, gave a presentation of the programmes undertaken by the party and also those which are on the anvil. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh was also present. From the government’s side, deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma highlighted the achievements in the past four years. Later, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also delved in detail about the works carried out by the government and what needs to be done. The CM reportedly said that despite the best of his efforts, some people-centric works could not be taken up in the past one-and-a-half years due to the coronavirus pandemic. He added that development works would be expedited in whatever time was left before the assembly election. The government representatives also spoke on the adjustment of cadre in various departments. The RSS workers and members of other offshoots, however, said that much was yet to be done on this front. Senior RSS office-bearers didn’t make a comment on this and said that despite shortcomings, due to pandemic or other reasons, the priority should be to remain united and work towards forming the BJP government again in 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-keep-sangh-sangathan-sarkar-in-sync-for-victory/articleshow/84568645.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Trichy||RTE students in Trichy left in the lurch as schools shut down||TRICHY: Four private elementary schools have closed down this year in Trichy district without withstanding the onslaught of Covid-19 lockdown. Students admitted in these schools under RTE Act are left in lurch as there are no provisions for transfer of RTE seats. Under the provisions of Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009 section 12.1(c), private non-minority schools must reserve 25% of seats in the entry level for children from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups. Students admitted in RTE seats need not pay tuition fees for the academic year. The state and central governments reimburse the academic fees to the respective schools. Santhosh Vidhyalaya in T Pettai, Ramakrishnan school in Thiruverumbur, Annai school and BCI school in Trichy west are the four nursery and primary schools that closed down this year. Students in these schools are admitting their children to other nearby schools. “While these schools were admitting these students under RTE over the last few years, each class in these schools had about 10 students enrolled under RTE Act. All the schools had students up to Class 5, of which around 200 lost their RTE seats as they are not transferable according to the Act,” said a senior official from the Trichy district chief education office. S Kishore, 40, who had admitted his son under RTE seat in Annai nursery and primary school said, “It is unfair that we are devoid of RTE benefits for the failure of the school management. I will not be able to get admission for my son in a private school now as I cannot afford the fee.” Educationist V Baskaran from Trichy said that more schools are shutting down in recent months because of Covid. This is expected to increase in the coming days. “To safeguard the interest of the students studying in the RTE seats in these schools, the state and the Union governments take steps to transfer the RTE seats in the nearby schools when their respective schools witness closure,” said Baskaran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rte-students-left-in-the-lurch-as-schools-shut-down/articleshow/84566508.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Delhi||Cabinet nod to one ration card scheme in Delhi||NEW DELHI: In a significant move, the Delhi cabinet has decided to implement the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme that will enable poor migrants, who come to the capital in search of livelihood, to obtain rations by using public distribution system (PDS) cards issued to them in their native states. The pandemic and subsequent lockdowns devastated the poor, especially migrant workers who lost their livelihood options. ONORC would help them tide over the crisis as they would be able to get free rations under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) and under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana from Tuesday onward. In a statement, Delhi government mentioned, “All beneficiaries will get rations free of cost in a phased manner through e-PoS (electronic point of sale) after biometric authentication at all fair price shops. Migrant beneficiaries having proper ration cards and who have been identified under NFSA in their parent state will also get rations for free under this plan.” Free rations would be distributed to around 72 lakh beneficiaries attached to about 17 lakh households. Saurabh Gupta and Shailendra Kumar, who represent the fair price shop owners unions, said ration under ONORC would be distributed from Tuesday based on the food department’s order. The food department issued an order on Monday evening asking fair price shops to ensure hassle-free distribution. They were also asked to mandatorily display a board detailing this entitlement to all beneficiaries. All zonal assistant commissioners, circle food security officers and inspectors have been directed to ensure distribution of specified food articles at all such shops through e-PoS after biometric authentication. Over 2,000 fair price shops in Delhi have successfully conducted trial runs of e-PoS machines. The implementation would come as a blessing to thousands of migrant workers who get deprived of free or subsidised ration when they migrate to Delhi in search of jobs. Currently, all such migrant workers are unable to use the ration cards issued by Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and other states. In Delhi, under NFSA, beneficiaries are provided 5kg of foodgrains every month under regular entitlement, including 4kg wheat and 1kg rice. Regular entitlement under the AAY category is 25kg wheat per household, 10kg rice and 1kg sugar. The cost fixed for entitlement is Rs 2 per kg for wheat, Rs 3 per kg for rice and Rs 13.5 per kg for sugar, which is currently not being charged from NFS and AAY beneficiaries. Food and supply minister Imran Hussain said that during the lockdown, the food department had successfully made efforts towards meeting the requirements of the poor and vulnerable sections of society. “Now, we have implemented the ONORC policy, which will benefit migrants living in Delhi to get rations free of cost,” he added. All fair price shop licensees have also been instructed to observe necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the beneficiaries while distributing rations. They should inform them that supply would be available in sufficient quantity. There should be no chaos and panic in getting rations. The beneficiaries can call the helpline number 1967 for getting their grievances addressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cabinet-nod-to-one-ration-card-scheme/articleshow/84568642.cms||AlokKNMishra

The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati said that the “fact of the case is quite disturbing”. The bench sought reply from the authorities by July 22 on how the councillor could have been awarded the transportation/labour supply contract on mere filing of an application. The petition was filed by a previous contractor, Yashinbhai Solanki, complaining that he was awarded the contract in 2020 after inviting bids for tender and by conducting an e-auction. As the contract came to an end on June 30, the new contract was awarded to the councillor after the latter made an application to the district collector in the month of May that he is ready to undertake the work of transportation and labour work. The court also expressed surprise at finding out that the corporation’s general manager had passed the order by which the contract was awarded to the councillor at the risk and cost of the previous contractor, Solanki. The petitioner has alleged that it was a case of favouritism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-over-contract-to-rajkot-councillor/articleshow/84566533.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Fr Stan Swamy wonderful, had served society: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday said the late Jesuit priest, Fr Stan Swamy, accused in the 2018 Elgar Parishad case, had “rendered services to society.” Addressing the issue of undertrials languishing for long in prisons, the HC said, “(We) cannot keep aside humane considerations while deciding medical bail applications.” “We have respect for his work. Legally, whatever was there against him is (a) different matter,” a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar said while hearing Stan Swamy’s counsel on the need for a detailed enquiry into the run-up to his death. It observed that he was “wonderful,” “the kind of services he rendered to the society.” Justice Shinde added that he usually has no time to watch television, but saw the online funeral service for Stan Swamy. “It was very dignified and graceful. Such graciously and honorably they performed it.” Stan Swamy, 84, died on July 5 while he was in Holy Family Hospital in Bandra, having undergone treatment and having been cured of Covid-19 following his admission. The Justice Shinde-led bench had on May 28 directed that the tribal rights activist from Ranchi be shifted immediately to the private hospital from Taloja prison, where he was housed since his arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) last October. His was the last arrest and he was the oldest of the 16 accused chargesheeted under the stringent anti-terror law, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for being an alleged Maoist. “How many years people will have to languish in jails? Not only this case but others also?” asked the bench on Monday. Senior counsel Mihir Desai, representing the late Stan Swamy, requested the HC to allow Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, former St Xavier’s college principal, to participate in the legally mandated magisterial enquiry into the death, as his next of kin and that the report be submitted to HC. He also said the enquiry be done as per the National Human Rights Commission guidelines. “What has to be considered is what led to the cause of his death,” said Desai. The HC judge said it had no control over what people may say outside the courtroom but expressed that it had ensured that the accused Fr Stan, who was ailing, was given medical attention. “Nobody mentions this court has granted bail to (co-accused) Varavara Rao despite vehement opposition. We allowed his family to meet him in hospital. Even in another case (Hany Babu, co-accused in Elgar Parishad case) we sent (the) accused to hospital of his choice,” the bench said. Desai acknowledged the time given by the bench even to Stan Swamy’s pleas. “On two occasions, even when matter was not on board, the bench graciously granted us time…I had said it then (on July 5, when medical director of Holy Family hospital announced Stan Swamy’s death) and am willing to go on record even now, that there was no complaint against the HC.”  Advocate Sandesh Patil for NIA said HC was hearing Swamy’s bail appeals and had sought time, as ASG Anil Singh was held up before another bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stan-swamy-wonderful-had-served-society-bombay-hc/articleshow/84566531.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||Farm laws: MPs from Punjab move multiple adjournment motions||Bathinda/Chandigarh: Acting on ‘voters’ whip’ issued by farm organisation, Punjab MPs raised farmer issue demanding from the central government to concede their demand of repealing the three contrntious farm laws. Leaders from SAD, Congress and AAP acted as per the wishes of farmers on the opening day of the monsoon session of Parliament on Monday, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha said. Former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and MPs from some other opposition parties moved an adjournment motion in favour of farmers’ demands. Congress MP Manish Tiwari and AAP’s Bhagwant Mann too moved notices “for the adjournment of the business of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent importance of farmer laws”. SAD (Sanyukt) president and Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa moved an adjournment motion for an early solution to the contentious agriculture laws. Harsimrat, who along with husband and Ferozepur MP Sukhbir Singh Badal and BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra held protest by holding placards, claimed in her adjournment motion that nationwide crisis had been raging over the enactment of three laws. “These laws relate to agriculture and are state subject, but the central government enacted these laws through trade entry in list III to browbeat the states. These laws were passed in brazen violation of the spirit of federalism as envisaged by the founding fathers of the Constitution... there is massive national outrage against these laws and the central government should immediately repeal these laws,” she wrote. Mann, who had written to all the opposition parties to oppose the farm laws in Parliament, said farmers had been sitting at the Delhi borders, irrespective of the weather conditions for the last eight months to seek the repeal of the three farm laws. He contended that the Parliament should only discuss these laws and accept the legitimate demands of the farmers. Tiwari too wrote notice was issued to ask for leave for the adjournment of the business of the House for purpose of discussing farm laws as scores of farmers were sitting at borders for long against these laws. Dhindsa demanded that the Parliament’s rest of work should be stopped and the issue of farmers resolved on a priority basis. He also urged the Parliament and the Centre to immediately withdraw the anti-farmer laws which have been brought by the present NDA government. He said that instead of repealing these black laws, the Union government has adopted a stubborn attitude towards the farmers. He claimed that due to these issues, the situation of Punjab and adjoining areas is alarming because of protests by agriculture labourers, arhtiyas and all those who are affected by these anti-farmer laws. Dhindsa appealed to all the MPs to raise the voice for farmers by staying inside the Parliament instead of boycotting or walking out. Shri Fatehgarh Sahib MP Amar Singh, who also protested outside the Parliament building, said he had already put in an adjournment motion before Parliament began to stop all other business and debate the repeal of the farm laws on the first day of the new session. He said he would also be asking a starred question regarding the intolerable increase in fuel prices which was hurting all sections of society and leading to increasing in prices of all commodities. “Over 500 people had sacrificed their lives since the farm agitation began last year and yet the government has shown no sympathy. The ultimate goal of the Modi government is to meet the agenda of certain corporate houses and the farm laws were passed to hand over the farm sector to them just, as the Government had done with various other sectors since 2014,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-laws-mps-from-punjab-move-multiple-adjournment-motions/articleshow/84566534.cms||---
---||Delhi||Drainage master plan on paper as Delhi floods again||NEW DELHI: An IIT-Delhi report that had recommended the Delhi Drainage Master Plan was accepted by Delhi government in 2019, but hardly anything seems to have changed on the ground. Officials from the drain managing agencies argued that some of the initial steps had been taken, but the pandemic halted their implementation. The plan, which took almost a decade to be finalised, still remains largely on paper. In 2009, the then lieutenant governor Tejendra Khanna had asked the civic bodies and all stakeholders to prepare a master plan for Delhi’s watershed and drainage system. “The last drainage master plan was finalised way back in 1976. A new plan must be prepared keeping in view the fast changing scenario of the city’s growth,” former CM Sheila Dikshit had remarked in 2012, while announcing that IIT-Delhi would be making the drainage master plan. Now, almost nine years later, the master plan continues to be stuck, while the city keeps braving massive waterlogging due to even moderate spells of rainfall. The team of experts from IIT submitted the draft plan in December 2016 and its recommendations were finally accepted in 2019. One of the major recommendations was restoration of the natural drain system of Delhi. Manoj Mishra from Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan said that 18 big natural drains, which had been identified in the 1976 drainage plan, were missing. “So much time, resources and money was used to prepare this master plan, but why is it not being implemented?” he asked. “The natural drainage system is in a total mess and a single agency like Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) should be made responsible for managing the drains and implementing the master plan. The need for the storm-water drainage system to remain free of sewage and solid waste was also highlighted in the plan,” said Mishra. Other key recommendations included separation of the sewerage system and storm-water drains, unified framework, laying pipes to take storm-water from the surface to nearby parks or waterbodies, among others. Multiplicity of agencies and absence of a common framework has plagued the city’s drainage year after year. Ten bodies, including the corporations, PWD, DSIIDC, DDA and I&FC department manage over 3,700 kilometres of drains. A senior municipal official said several meetings of a chief secretary-headed joint committee had taken place, but the pandemic had delayed the implementation. PWD did not comment on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drainage-master-plan-on-paper-as-city-floods-again/articleshow/84566576.cms||Paras Singh
---||Pune||Rs 38L siphoned off from man’s bank account; card cloning suspected||Pune: Cybercrooks on Thursday siphoned off Rs38 lakh from the bank account of a 61-year-old man. “The fraudsters transferred the amount through eight transactions. The complainant, however, received an SMS alert only for the last transaction from his bank,” sub-inspector A M Shingare of the Wakad police said. Shingare said the complainant — a consultant with a private company — received an SMS alert stating Rs 2.14 lakh was withdrawn from his bank account. “He was surprised as he did not make any transactions in the past few days,” Shingare said. The man immediately approached his bank and was shocked to know that Rs38 lakh in total had been transferred from his account. “He did not receive any alerts of the earlier transactions,” Shingare said. The officer said their preliminary probe suggested that the suspects may have cloned the complainant’s debit card or his SIM card. “They may have thus got access to his bank account and its password, and made the transfer,” Shingare said. Shingare said that the money was transferred to three different bank accounts. “These bank accounts are in West Bengal. We have registered a case under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal and the relevant sections of the Information Technology Act,” Shingare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rs-38l-siphoned-off-from-mans-bank-account-card-cloning-suspected/articleshow/84566561.cms||---

T-2 will be converted into three utility blocks, which will house an exclusive area for business jets’ operation, a VVIP safe house and budget rooms for passengers’ short stay. Cial managing director S Suhas said the director board chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had given in-principle approval for the conversion plan of T-2. The works will begin in August. “We are lining up several short-term as well as long-term projects for activating new revenue streams. The civil work of the five-star hotel project has gained momentum. The conversion of T-2 is another ambitious idea to tap potential revenue. We plan to accommodate a Business Jet terminal, a VVIP safe house and a transit hotel in the sprawling T-2 which stands unused now,” Suhas said. A meeting convened by the MD has finalized the blueprint which envisages a cost-effective renovation of the interior of T-2 into three blocks. Thirty per cent of the built-up area will be used for block one which will be converted into an exclusive business jet terminal with 3 lounges. This terminal will cater to both international and domestic business jets. Exclusive areas for customs, immigration and security holding operations will be allotted. “Block-2 will have an area of 10,000 sqft and is earmarked to house a VVIP safe house. This concept will ensure a hassle-free movement of passengers during the VVIP movement. Block-3 will have an area of 60,000 sqft. Cial is planning to build 50 budget rooms for short-stay of passengers at the airport. It is planned to apply the dynamic tariff concept; wherein the rent will be calculated on hour-based scale. Cial plans to complete block 1 and 2 in one year,” said a statement. With the commissioning of the new terminal (T-3), the international flight operations were shifted from T-1 to T-3. T-1 then underwent a renovation process and is used for domestic operation since 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cochin-airport-plans-to-renovate-terminal-2/articleshow/84551561.cms||---

The villagers have been demanding for a bus service for the last three decades, but nothing materialised. Up until now they had to either go on foot for about 2km or cross a 1km stretch of Amaravathy riverbed to access public transport. Their demand was fulfilled soon after they stopped district collector T Prabhushankar’s vehicle when he came to the village for inspection on Thursday. Within five days, bus service became a reality for the village. “They never had a bus visiting their village so far. I asked the TNSTC Karur division general manager to study the issue. They managed to start a bus service from Monday morning. The village is now a bus terminus with two services daily. We will add more trips in case there is demand from the villagers,” said the collector. “We will not forget the collector for the rest of our lifetime,” says S Sampoornam, 60, from the village who goes for MNREGA work. She said that there have been several collectors whom they had petitioned for the bus service, but just an oral request to the present collector helped them realise their dream in less than a week. With 220-odd families in the village, a majority of them travel 10km from their village to Karur town to work in textile and bus body building units. Absence of public transport has been affecting them financially as they had to spend extra for taking motorcycles for work or hire vehicles. “We can save up to Rs 2,000 per month with the morning and evening bus services to the village,” says N Meena, 25, from the village, who is working in a textile unit in Karur town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/collector-gets-decades-old-demand-of-village-for-bus-service-ready-in-5-days/articleshow/84566532.cms||Sampath Kumar

The mini-load carrier recently purchased by the corporation was found to be using the siren sound without the light. This has been happening for the past few weeks. Residents said that they initially rushed out to check whether the noise was from an ambulance or patrol vehicles. The sound also disturbs senior citizens and infants in the narrow street, they said. “The problem is even if an ambulance or patrol vehicle arrives at our street someday, people will not take it seriously,” a shopkeeper in Big Kammala Street said. An official source with the corporation said that they will instruct the unit to dismantle the siren.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/corpn-vehicle-with-siren-irks-public/articleshow/84566552.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Kochi||Report points to surge in Covid cases in district||Kochi: With people disregarding social-distancing norms, coronavirus cases are rising in the district. The dismal reality is reflected in the increase in hospitalization cases and ICU admissions as well, according to a surveillance analysis report submitted to the district administration. The number of vacant Covid beds have also been shrinking each day in the district. As many as 3,566 Covid beds were vacant on July 11 and their numbers have reduced to 3,017 on Sunday. At the same time the number of patients undergoing treatment for Covid had come down to 225 on July 11. The caseload has now risen again and touched 263 on Sunday. However, district health authorities maintain that the situation will not spiral out of control as people have been getting vaccinated and a large section of people in the society have already been infected with the disease. They also claim there will not be any shortage of beds for treatment as seen during the peak of the second wave. The report says that there has been a gradual rise in seven-day average of daily cases. It further said restrictions based on test positivity rate alone is not going to help reduce further spread of the infection as TPR does not reflect the real situation at the ground level. “We have doubled the number of beds now compared to the peak of second wave. The wave touched the peak when there were no restrictions in place in the society. Moreover, vaccination coverage was only at 20% at that time. Now, the vaccination has crossed more than 40%. Even if we open fully in the days to come, the cases won’t peak as they did a few months ago,” said Dr Mathew Numpeli, district programme manager of NHM. He said they don’t expect the hospital system will be overburdened in the third wave. Steps should be taken to vaccinate vulnerable people, avoid exposure to the infection and provide treatment at the early stage of infection. Another official said the cases will continue to rise in the current rate. “We are seeing conscious attempts on the part of LSGDs to reduce TPR in order to lift restrictions. When cases will rise gradually, it will prove to be burden on the staff and they will struggle to provide treatment. We cannot say vaccination prevents infection. The relief is that the deaths due to Covid-19 can be reduced drastically if vaccination drive gains speed. We need to postpone the surge at least for two months until 70% of the population is vaccinated,” said the official. The district has been recording an average of 16 Covid deaths daily. The authorities have prepared 40 ICU oxygen beds for paediatric cases in Ernakulam General Hospital and Kalamassery medical college each to treat serious Covid cases in children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/report-points-to-surge-in-covid-cases-in-district/articleshow/84551550.cms||T C Sreemol

The Union government is bagging higher tax revenue from petrol and diesel. We have insisted on reducing the taxes. In the state, CM will implement the promises given in the election manifesto gradually,” Moorthy said on Monday. Moorthy was chairing a consultative meeting at National College in Trichy with state ministers including K N Nehru, S Regupathy, S S Sivasankar, Siva V Meyyanathan and government chief whip Govi Chezhian, MLAs and traders from Trichy, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts. Nehru released the book on GST Rate of tax on goods with HSC code in Tamil. The minister said that opinions elicited from the traders will be brought to the notice of the CM and submitted to the GST councils. The minister also encouraged the traders to enroll themselves as members in the traders’ welfare board. The small traders need not pay the fee for enrollment of Rs 500 for the three months. On the efforts to increase the state’s revenue, he said the government is in the process of clearing shortcomings and anomalies in the GST. Issuing a stern warning against the promoters of the shell companies, the minister appealed to the traders to cooperate with the government to identify such companies to stop tax evasion. Moorthy said that the registration of unapproved plots will land the buyers in serious trouble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/min-blames-centre-for-fuel-price-hike-charges-aiadmk-for-debt/articleshow/84566548.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Two lawyers attacked with swords over property tiff in Mumbai, 3 held||MUMBAI: Two lawyers who were meeting up with their clients at a property in Dahisar (west) were brutally attacked with swords and rods by a group of about 20 people in broad daylight around 3 pm on Sunday. A probe suggests that the motive of the attack was a dispute over the ownership rights of the land. Three people have been arrested by officials of MHB Colony police station after video clips of the assault went viral. Advocate Satyadev Joshi was to meet his client Tauqir Khan and developer Divyesh Desai at Kandarpada along with Desai’s lawyer, Ankit Tandon. Khan and Desai plan to construct a school building on a 4,500 sqm plot at Kandarpada. Khan had purchased the plot in the ’80s from one Deubaee Thakur. But Thakur’s relatives have also claimed ownership of the plot. “A mob of 15 to 20 men and women landed up. A heated argument broke out as they tried to remove a signboard from the property,” Joshi said. Things took a turn when the group started bringing out swords, rods and sticks from autorickshaws. Joshi said he stood behind a car as he was neither acquainted with the group nor was personally involved in the dispute. “But the group still came after me,” added Joshi. “We were hospitalised and I had to be administered stitches on my fingers and legs, besides being treated for serious cuts on my back, head, hand and shoulder. Tandon is unable to open one of his eyes after being struck,” said Joshi. In his police statement, Desai named 11 people including Thakur’s relatives and two builders with whom a dispute is on. A case of attempt to commit murder and rioting has been registered, said additional commissioner of police Dilip Sawant. However, identities of the arrested were not revealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-lawyers-attacked-with-swords-over-property-tiff-3-held/articleshow/84566559.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: She killed husband, cops waited for 10 years to nab her||NEW DELHI: Shakuntala was 18 when she was married to a man, Ravi Kumar, 22, against her wishes. She was dating a youth at that time and hatched a plot to eliminate her husband. They strangled the man in 2011 and buried the body in Alwar where Shakuntala's boyfriend had a business. The case was soon transferred to the crime branch as the local police failed to make a breakthrough. The suspects then exhumed the body and threw the remains across a 70-km stretch between Alwar and Rewari thinking that cops wouldn't be able to establish a murder in the absence of a body. For 10 years, Shakuntala managed to play cat-and-mouse with the police. A year after the murder, she began to live with her boyfriend, Kamal Singla, in Rajasthan. In 2017, the two got married, secure in the belief that the heat was off. However, the cops had not given up. Tipped off by a relative, they managed to track down the couple in Rajasthan in 2019 and arrested Singla from their house. However, Shakuntala managed to give them the slip again. The manhunt has finally ended with the crime branch sleuths managing to arrest Shankuntala, now 28, after another tip-off by an acquaintance blew her cover. According to joint commissioner (crime) Alok Kumar, the police had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 for her arrest. Kumar said that when Shakuntala returned to Alwar, cops from Special Operation Squad-II received a tip-off about the area where she might be staying. "The team spent nearly a fortnight in Alwar and conducted a door-to-door inquiry and finally tracked her down on July 17. She was produced before a court and has been taken on two days remand for interrogation," Kumar added. During her initial questioning, Shakuntala is claimed to have told the cops that her first husband, Ravi, had got to know about her affair with Singla and had put restrictions on her stepping out of home or talking on phone. So, she hatched a plot with Singla to get rid of him. On March 22, 2011, she requested Ravi to take her to her sister's house in the Samalakha area. Singla met them midway and they strangled Ravi with a rope. They drove to Rajasthan with the body and buried it there. Initially, Ravi was supposed to have gone missing and a case of abduction was registered only on April 16. As his family alleged foul play, the case was transferred to the crime branch after which Shakuntala went underground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/she-killed-husband-copswaited-for-10yrs-to-nab-her/articleshow/84568678.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Chandigarh||Our slogan echoed in Parliament premises: SKM||Bathinda: The slogan of ‘kale kanoon radd karo’ (repeal black laws) were heard in Parliament on the first day of the monsoon session on Monday, Sanyukt Kisabn Morcha said. The morcha had issued a ‘voters’ whip’ to parliamentarians urging them to raise voice against farm laws, which they did in both Houses of Parliament. Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to counter the slogans of the opposition MPs by alleging that they were not supportive of women, Dalits, adivasis and other marginalised communities. The PM’s statement was hollow given that the halls of Parliament were echoing with slogans that went straight from the farmers’ movement, SKM opined. The slogans being raised were those of marginalised citizens who were being subjected to the government’s onslaught of laws and policies in various sectors, the morcha alleged, adding it would like to remind the Prime Minister that true respect and dignity would be accorded to marginalised communities of the country only if their interests were protected. “This requires the government to repeal the farm laws, four labour codes and decrease fuel prices,” it said. SKM has condemned some social media posters doing the rounds, asking for a siege of Parliament. All such calls are fake and against the interest of the ongoing farmer movement, it said. Morcha called upon those generating posters and calls for action, to desist from deviating and diverting in any way, their peaceful protests. Delhi Police, despite being informed about Parliament protest plans of the farmers, was terming it ‘Sansad Gherao’. It has been clearly mentioned that there are no plans of laying siege to Parliament thus police are indulging in deliberate misinformation, SKM alleged. SKM stated the Union government was learnt to have listed the Commission for air quality management in national capital region and adjoining areas bill 2021, as well as the electricity amendment bill 2021 under legislative business for the monsoon session. SKM has warned the government against any “reneging of the commitment made to the protesting farmers on December 30, 2020 on these matters”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/our-slogan-echoed-in-parliament-premises-skm/articleshow/84566571.cms||---

---||Trichy||Trichy: Random Covid sampling in busy city streets||TRICHY: Although the test positivity rate of Trichy has been on the decline in the last few days, a surge in commercial streets with textile and home appliances showrooms have put the corporation on alert. The civic body has designated health teams to collect swabs from both people and workers in commercial establishments for RT-PCR tests. The random sampling in commercial streets will be repeated periodically. The movement of people in commercial streets including Singarathope, West Boulevard road, Big Bazaar street, NSB road and Karur bypass road has drastically increased as lockdown restrictions were eased. The Trichy Corporation recently convened a meeting to survey commercial streets to prevent Covid-19 clusters from surfacing. In the first wave, as one textile showroom reported dozens of positive cases, the civic body planned to conduct random tests to prevent it again. “We will collect at least 200 samples per locality. The same street will be tested after 15 days. Non-cooperative shops will be served with notices under the Public Health Act,” said Dr M Yazhini, city health officer. The decision to take action against commercial establishments refusing to comply has come after medical officers reported people protesting against random testing. “On seeing the health vehicle arriving to collect swab, people are even fleeing the streets,” a medical officer said. As the status of vaccination of the salespersons in textile and jewellery shops largely remains unknown, the civic body has planned to insist establishments to enumerate vaccination status reports. It is learnt that due to shortage of vaccines, several shops have not vaccinated their workers who are directly interacting with customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/random-sampling-in-busy-city-streets/articleshow/84566564.cms||Deepak Karthik

He was referring to the controversy over Pegasus spyware allegedly used to keep surveillance on several union ministers, opposition leaders, journalists and businessmen. “In my opinion, it is not good to trouble anybody. Such new technologies are beneficial, but people also misuse them. Ye bahut gandi baat hai. Faltu cheez hai ye sab. Technology ka use kar ke kisi ko pareshan nahi karna chahiye. But Aisa hota rehta hai...ye galat hai,” he told the media on the sidelines of his weekly ‘janata ke darbar mein mukhyamantri’ programme. Nitish also said the Centre should initiate a fresh dialogue with the protesting farmers over the new farm bills. “I will urge the Centre to start a fresh dialogue with the farmers to reach an amicable solution,” he said while expressing concern over the congregation of a large number of farmers outside Delhi when the threat of a third wave of Covid-19 was looming large in the country. Nitish said though the farmers' agitation didn't have any impact in Bihar because its case was different from other states. “We have already taken several steps in the farmers’ interest. Their production has enhanced as well as their produce is being procured by the government agencies,” he said. The CM also took a swipe at Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s statement that the BJP should withdraw its support from the Nitish Kumar government if the JD(U) leader opposed legislation on the population control. “I don't take notice of such people. Where they stand today is known to all. ‘Usko kuchh samajh mein aata hai kya (Does he understand such things)?,” he sarcastically asked. To drive home his point, the CM referred to the controversy over a CBI probe recommended by the Bihar government into the mysterious death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput in Mumbai last year. “What happened in that case is known to all,” he said. Nitish said he has already made his stand clear on the issue of population control. “I am least bothered about other states’ measures to control the birth rate,” he added. He revealed that the Bihar government decided to open 10+2 schools in every panchayat with an objective to educate girls. Even some middle schools were upgraded to higher secondary level to achieve the objective. “It’s a proven fact that girl's education plays a significant role in birth control,” he asserted. Nitish had earlier said mere framing laws would not help to control the population. The issue has snowballed into a controversy following a draft bill prepared by the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tech-should-not-be-used-to-trouble-someone-nitish/articleshow/84564086.cms||Ramashankar

Situated about 5km from Chathiram bus stand, the Mutharasanallur panchayat falling under Andanallur union, a suburb of the city situated on the Karur national highway has seven villages with a combined population of 10,000 people. Recently, the corporation had made a preliminary move to identify potential village panchayats and other civic bodies to increase the city area which includes Mutharasanallur. Learning about the developments, the villagers said that adding their locality to the corporation will become detrimental to the agriculture fields. “We are farming paddy, black gram and sugarcane relying on the Cauvery water. These land parcels may fall victim to urbanisation. Our people will lose employment opportunities available through MGNREGA once our village is added to the city,” T Adisivan, president of Mutharasanallur panchayat said. The villagers also said that rural cooperative societies that were offering quick loans will be merged with the central cooperative society which may delay the process. “Even the taxation for properties and vacant plots will be increased. Already people are not paying the minimal tax levied by the panchayat,” Adisivan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpns-expansion-plan-opposed-by-villagers/articleshow/84566580.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Nurse who allegedly aborted fetus nabbed in Gujarat||VADODARA: Three days after a video of an alleged illegal abortion went viral in Mahisagar, the police nabbed the nurse who is seen in the video. The cops tracked down Kali Sangada, who works for a private hospital, on Monday from a village in Santrampur taluka. Sangada has been sent for Covid test and she will be arrested if her results are negative. “Sangada had gone into hiding after the video went viral. We received a tip-off about her whereabouts on Monday,” said P Bhoi, police inspector, Santrampur police station. Sangada denied having aborted the fetus of the woman who was seen in the video. “She claimed that some women came to her with a young unmarried girl a few years ago. They said that the girl had delivered a child at home but her womb needs to be cleaned. Sangada said that they didn’t want to take her to hospital as the girl would have faced embarrassment in her community,” Bhoi said. “The women requested Sangada to clean her womb and she agreed to do it at her residence. We are verifying her claims. Efforts are also on to track down the young girl whose fetus was allegedly aborted,” Bhoi added. The cops also tracked down the contractor who had constructed a veranda in Sangada’s house. “The workers said that they constructed the veranda walls in 2019. These walls are not seen in the video which means the film was shot more than two years ago,” Bhoi said. Four days ago, a video of Sangada allegedly aborting a fetus in her house in Santrampur went viral following which the health officials swung into action. A police complaint was registered under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act on Saturday night by the health officials. The district women’s commission members too reached the spot and demanded strict action against the culprits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nurse-who-allegedly-aborted-fetus-nabbed/articleshow/84564125.cms||---
---||Kochi||Broadway shops open on Sunday after gap||Kochi: Shops in Ernakulam Broadway were opened on a Sunday after a gap of more than two-and-a-half months. The shops had not been allowed to open on Sundays after mid-April due to Covid restrictions. According to merchants, it may take some time for business to pick up. “The number of buses plying on Sundays is less and it seems to have affected our business. We expect more customers in the coming days,” said Mohammed Kamran, secretary, Ernakulam Merchants’ Union. The merchants fear that their shops may be closed down by the police citing crowding. “Street vendors would start occupying the footpaths on Broadway. On Sunday, there were almost 100 street vendors. This will cause crowding,” Kamran said. “Most of the 500 merchants at Broadway find it difficult to resume business. We expect good sales during Onam. But, many of the merchants don’t have money with them to buy stocks for the Onam sale. As business is dull, even the money lenders wouldn’t give loans. Banks have already started to ask us to repay the overdraft we took. It is really a difficult situation,” Kamran said. “Some of the shop owners have sold their shops while another group has shut their shops indefinitely. Non-payment of rentals and the legal disputes stemming out of it have resulted in the closure of yet another section of shops,” Kamran said. Retail dealers from Alappuzha, Idukki, Kottayam and Thrissur districts depend on wholesalers in Kochi for purchase. Though the vegetable merchants in Ernakulam market had been allowed to open every day, the business is very dull. “Earlier, around 23-23 truckloads of vegetables, mainly from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, would reach the market daily. Now, it is less than 13 truckloads. At the same time, the continuous surge in diesel price has resulted in an increase in transportation charges. Earlier, we had to shell out Rs 65 per sack of vegetable for transportation. Now, it is almost double the amount,” said Salam K A, a vegetable stall owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/broadway-shops-open-on-sunday-after-gap/articleshow/84551595.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Pune||Series on stories & songs of Pandit Bhimsen Joshi goes on air||Pune: The All India Radio on July 18 launched a programme to broadcast a series on the city’s renowned vocalist Pandit Bhimsen Joshi to celebrate his birth centenary. The programme will comprise a panel of artistes including tabla player Bharat Kamat, compere Sudhir Gadgil, and vocalists Anand Bhate, Upendra Bhat and Jayateerth Mevundi. Pandit Bhimsen Joshi’s son Shrinivas Joshi, who is also a Hindustani classical vocalist, will share memories of his father and some of his favourite compositions. The series will be broadcast every Sunday at noon on All India Radio Pune’s various Bharati stations (101 FM) and at 11am on All India Radio’s Ahmednagar, Nashik, Kolhapur, Amravati, Sangli, Solapur and Dharwad stations (100.1 FM). The series will be presented by Pradip Halasgikar. “This year we celebrate Bhimsen Joshi’s birth centenary. The programme is called ‘Athvani ani Gaani,’ which translates to memories and melodies. It will be interesting for listeners, who do not know much about Panditji’s work, to listen to the stories about him, the stories behind some of his famous compositions before being introduced, or reintroduced, to his songs,” he said. “Anand Bhate talked about how Bhimsen Joshi used to say that many people recogized him as their guru (teacher), but only few names used to come to his mind when asked who his students were, which included Bhate. Sudhir Gadgil talks about his experiences over 50-60 programmes he did with the guru. Mukund Sangoram, who was Bhimsen Joshi’s neighbour when they were growing up, shared childhood memories of them together. Upendra Bhat spoke of the lessons in music and in life that he learnt from his guru,” he added. Shrinivas Joshi said, “AIR has a treasure trove of my father’s recordings, which is a treat for audiences. They will be playing these recordings in the programme as well.” While Bhimsen Joshi was instrumental in organising the annual Sawai Gandharva Music Festival in Pune since 1953 as homage to his guru, Pandit Sawai Gandharva, his son Shrinivas Joshi has kept the tradition on. Even though the programme was cancelled last year because of the pandemic, Joshi had his fingers crossed in hope of when the programme could be organized in all its glory. “Last year, we decided to put the festival on hold. We are hoping to bring it back as soon as we can,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/series-on-stories-songs-of-pt-bhimsen-joshi-goes-on-air/articleshow/84566632.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The issue was discussed at a meeting held in Altinho, Panaji, where officers of telecom companies, Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes and Shiroda MLA Subhash Shirodkar were present. Fernandes who was present for the discussion during the meeting said that Sawant directed two internet companies to provide network connectivity in all remote areas of the state on priority basis. The chief minister also highlighted difficulties faced by students while attending online classes, Fernandes said. The officials of both companies providing telecom services agreed to visit and carry out technical assessment in Shiroda and Cotigao at the earliest. Fernandes said that Sawant also told the mobile telecommunication officials about reduced rates, taxes to provide mobile telecommunication services in remote areas, while also assuring single-window clearance for required permissions. Previously, Fernandes had been requesting telecommunication companies over the past few years to provide mobile connectivity at Cotigao, as the lone private network tower had been been disconnected. as a result, children from these areas and Marlim Tirval in Poinguinim, besides the interior parts of Gaondongrim do not have any mobile connectivity. These students and those working from home are among the worst sufferers and affected during the pandemic, Isidore said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-meets-mobile-network-cos-asks-to-help-students/articleshow/84568753.cms||---

This amount was to be paid for the conversion of the land parcel to freehold. The project timeline for Wipro to set up its second campus on the plot (the first campus being in Sector V) would start once this process gets completed. Senior officials of Wipro recently met Hidco officials along with the agency’s consultants and other senior officials in Kolkata where the IT major’s New Town project was discussed. Hidco officials said that it was a step forward for Wipro to start the work on their second campus. “The leasehold land is being converted into freehold land on certain terms and conditions. For this a documentation and legal process is required to be followed. The letter for paying the lease rent was handed over to them and once the fees are paid, the documentation process would be completed after which the project timeline will commence,” said Hidco chairman-cum-managing director Debashis Sen. Earlier in 2019 the state government had decided to provide freehold land rights to Wipro for its 50-acre land allotted at New Town. It was during the previous Left front government’s regime back in 2009 that the total price of the 50-acre plot earmarked to both Wipro and Infosys at Action Area III in New Town was settled at Rs 75 crore (Rs 1.5 crore per acre). Wipro had paid the first instalment of Rs 18.9 crore to Hidco in January 2010 and the remaining amount of about Rs 58.9 crore was paid to Hidco in 2014. The state government had also decided to waive the penalty on Wipro for the delayed payment following a request by the IT major. The state government is also setting up the Bengal Silicon Valley in New Town which was launched in August, 2018 with the CM laying the foundation stone. Out of the total 200 acres land, there are about 169 acres of allottable land, excluding the roads and commercial space. Some companies, who have already applied for plots in the Silicon Valley hub, are Reliance Jio (40 acres), CTS (25 acres), TCS (20 acres), Capgemini (7 acres) and Indian Statistical Institute. Several others have also evinced interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wipro-second-campus-plan-takes-a-step-closer-to-reality/articleshow/84564129.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Sukhbir staged a protest outside Parliament with his wife and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and BSP MPs, including its national general secretary Satish Mishra. He asserted that the SAD-BSP alliance would continue to demand a discussion on farmers’ demands in Parliament. The Akali leader also urged all political parties to force a discussion on the agri laws. “We must prioritise this issue. There is nothing more important than this at this moment. Farmers have been agitating for their demands for more than eight months now. More than 500 farmers have been martyred,” said Sukhbir. He said that the SAD-BSP had even moved a resolution demanding that tributes be paid to farmers martyred during the agitation. He said it was unfortunate that there were no obituaries in Parliament. Sukhbir asked the NDA government to show sensitivity towards farmers by acting in a responsible manner befitting an elected government. He accused the Central government of trying to defame farmers and repressing their peaceful movement instead of listening to them. “Even now, no attempt is being made to talk to farmers and resolve their grievances. Such an attitude does not hold well for a democracy,” he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-condemns-nda-govt-for-turning-down-adjournment-motion/articleshow/84566596.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Sebi, DRI probing Adani Group cos, govt tells LS||MUMBAI: Market regulator Sebi and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) are investigating companies belonging to the Adani group for violations of some of the regulations, junior minister for finance Pankaj Chaudhary told the Lok Sabha on Monday. He said that the regulator’s probe focused on compliance of the companies with its regulations but did not disclose the names of the companies that are under the scanner. The DRI was “investigating certain entities belonging to the Adani Group… under laws administered by it,” Parliament was informed. Responding to questions from TMC’s Mahua Moitra, the minister said the government could not disclose information related to income tax but ruled out any probe by the Enforcement Directorate. On Monday, shares of Adani group companies — Adani Total Gas, Adani Power, Adani Transmission, Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, Adani Green Energy and Adani Enterprises — took a beating, closing between 1% and 4.8% lower. Chaudhary said that in 2016, Sebi had frozen the accounts of three of the six Mauritius-based investors, which are seen to have invested most of their money in stocks of Adani Group companies. The regulatory action was due to their dealings in Global Depository Receipt (GDR) by some other companies but there was no bar on them for holding shares of other companies. On June 14, stock prices of all the six Adani group companies had nosedived, some by as much as 25% in intra-day trades, after it was found that three Mauritius-based foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) — Albula Investments, APMS Investment and Cresta Fund — were barred by Sebi. Later, the group led by Gautam Adani, the second richest Indian, clarified, citing a communication from NSDL, the depository, that these entities were barred from investing in GDR, for regulatory violations in 2016, but were free to invest in stocks of Indian companies directly. Following the mid-June incident, Moitra had also taken to Twitter to raise the issue of investigations by regulators and investigating agencies about holdings by these FPIs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sebi-dri-probing-adani-group-cos-govt-tells-ls/articleshow/84568777.cms||---

Based on the tenability definition of slums laid down by the Union ministry of housing and urban poverty alleviation, seven slums in the city fall under untenable category and 16 slums under semi-tenable category.As per the definition, untenable slums are those near major stormwater drains, railway lines, major transport alignments, and rivers or water bodies, among others. All slum-pockets located on non-objectionable and non-hazardous sites and all slum settlements which do not fall within the definition of untenable settlements come under tenable category. Semi-tenable slums are located on sites which are earmarked for non-residential uses as per the master plan. Slums on Central government land can also be classified as semi-tenable till such time as a decision is taken by a competent authority.Out of the seven untenable slums in the city, five are in government-owned land and two in railway-owned land. Plamoodu bund colony, one of the untenable slums has got 106 households. Kaithamukku and Karali Attuvarambu colony located on railway and state government lands respectively, have nearly 180 cumulative households.An analysis of housing profile of slums in the city shows that 76% of slums are not connected to city-wide stormwater drainage and 17% slums have additional toilet requirements. Only 10% of slums in the city have roads of more than 5 metre width and 75% slums have roads less than 3 metre.As for waste management, only 22% waste is managed by the corporation and 50% do not have waste disposal facility. According to the document, rest of the slum population manage waste by themselves. Over the years, a slew of slum rehabilitation programmes were implemented in the city. However, the recent study shows that many of the slum dwellers continue to be deprived of basic sanitation facilities and even proper access.The study document says that while planning for city level infrastructure like water supply, storm water drainage, adequate consideration has to be given to slums as well. Many of the slum dwellers depend on public transport for work and adequate connectivity has to be ensured. It also calls for convergence of schemes of socially-backward people with slum development programmes. As per the survey, 68 wards in the city have slums of which Punjakkari and Kottapuram have the highest number of slums. Majority of slums are in private land, while 59 slums are in government-owned land and four in corporation-owned land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/seven-city-slums-fall-under-untenable-category-study/articleshow/84551633.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Kundra’s name surfaced after the property cell probing the case stumbled upon the involvement of a UK production company, Kenrin, and police arrested its executive, Umesh Kamat. The former employee of Kundra was accused of uploading at least eight “pornographic and obscene” videos shot by Vasisth on a social media app for monetary consideration. Police showed Pradeep Bakshi, the proprietor of Kenrin, and Yash Thakur as absconding accused. Police suspect Kundra has a stake in Kenrin. In February, the property cell led by inspector Kedar Pawar and assistant inspector Laxmikant Salunkhe raided a bungalow at Madh Island in Malad and busted a live porn video film-making racket, and rescued a woman. Police arrested Yasmin Rowa Khan, Pratibha Nalawade, Monu Gopaldas Joshi, Bhanusuryam Thakur and Mohammed Asif alias Saify under IPC sections for cheating, indulging in obscene acts in public places and publicly exhibiting or circulating obscene books or literature, and under the Information Technology Act. This is the second time police questioned Kundra. Sources said on Monday crime branch picked up Kundra and detained him at the property cell’s office at Byculla. He will be produced before the 37th Esplanade metropolitan magistrate’s court on Tuesday. “Kundra appears to be the key conspirator. We have sufficient evidence,’’ Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said in a text message. The victim rescued by police said under the pretext of giving a break in movies the accused would lure candidates, sign an agreement and force them to act in porn movies. During investigations it transpired that they would upload the video clips on their apps and other social media and would generate huge amounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bizman-raj-kundra-held-in-pornographic-video-case/articleshow/84566630.cms||Ahmed Ali

Addressing the issue of undertrials languishing for long in prisons, the HC said, “(We) cannot keep aside humane considerations while deciding medical bail applications.” “We have respect for his work. Legally, whatever was there against him is (a) different matter,” a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar said while hearing Stan Swamy’s counsel on the need for a detailed inquiry into the run-up to his death. It observed that he was “wonderful,” “the kind of services he rendered to the society.” Justice Shinde added that he usually has no time to watch TV, but saw the online funeral service for Stan Swamy. “It was very dignified and graceful. Such graciously and honorably they performed it.” Stan Swamy, 84, died on July 5 while he was in a hospital in Bandra, having undergone treatment and having been cured of Covid-19 following his admission. The Justice Shinde-led bench had on May 28 directed that the tribal rights activist from Ranchi be shifted immediately to the private hospital from prison. “How many years people will have to languish in jails? Not only this case but others also?” asked the bench on Monday. Senior counsel Mihir Desai, representing the late Stan Swamy, requested the HC to allow Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, former St Xavier’s college principal, to participate in the legally mandated magisterial inquiry into the death, as his next of kin and that the report be submitted to the HC. “What has to be considered is what led to the cause of his death,” said Desai. The high court judge said that it had no control over what people may say outside the courtroom but expressed that it had ensured that the accused Fr Stan, who was ailing, was given medical attention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stan-swamy-was-wonderful-have-respect-for-his-services-bombay-high-court/articleshow/84570933.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Dehradun||HC orders police protection for U’khand activist who raised riverbed encroachment||Nainital: A social activist who brought up the encroachment of riverbeds in Dehradun — riverbed land was being dried and sold as “barren” land — has been granted police protection by the Uttarakhand high court. The state government has been given four weeks’ time to respond on the case. Ajay Narain Sharma told the court he had been attacked twice, once sustaining head injuries, and threatened four times since he filed the petition in April. He said he had complained to the police and district administration thrice but “no action” was taken. Sharma had alleged that the bed of the Aamwala Ki Rao rivulet in the eco-sensitive Doon Valley was being dried up and revenue records were being tweaked to show that “jal magan bhoomi” (water holding) was “banjar bhoomi” (barren land). It was then being sold off. “Construction has been allowed to come up and flourish, which is changing the very character of the said rivulets in a pristine area of Doon Valley,” the petition had said. Rivers in the valley are seasonal, because of which the beds run dry for a part of the year. When they do flow again, the construction in their path forces them to change course. On hearing the petition, the high court had on April 8 ordered a stay on all construction on riverbeds near Sahastradhara in the valley. On May 25, a group of unidentified persons landed at Sharma’s house and threatened him — they wanted him to back down, he told the court. Sharma filed a complaint with the SSP and DM that day. A month later, on June 25, he was threatened again. A week passed by. On July 1, a group of men came to his house — four unidentified men — and attacked him in his courtyard. He filed another complaint. In another week, on July 8, he was targeted again — this time with stones — in an attack that left him with head injuries. He wrote another complaint. When "no action" was taken, he approached the court. Last Thursday, the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar asked the Dehradun SSP to provide protection to Sharma and his family, and the property they own. “If anti-social elements were to carry out any threat against Sharma, action should be taken against them,” the bench added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-orders-police-protection-for-ukhand-activist-who-raised-riverbed-encroachment/articleshow/84561847.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Gurgaon||BKU (Mann) demands arrest of Tikait, Charuni||Kurukshetra: Bhartiya Kisan Union (Mann) Haryana unit president Guni Parkash on Monday held a protest against BKU (Charuni) and burnt the effigy of its chief, Gurnam Singh Charuni at Mathana village on Kurukshetra-Saharanpur road in Kurukshetra district. Guni Parkash and his union have been supporting the Centre’s three agri-marketing laws from the beginning. They accused Charuni and BKU (Arajnaitik) national president Rakesh Tikait of misleading farmers. Guni led a brief protest at Mathana village with hardly 40 supporters sitting on Kurukshetra-Saharanpur road. He demanded the arrest of Charuni and Tikait with immediate effect saying that “criminal cases were registered against them.” He also handed over a memorandum of demands to the district administration officer. “In the name of the farmers’ protest, these leaders (Charuni and Tikait) have murdered over 500 farmers by misleading them. They have disturbed law and order in Haryana by committing riots. We demand immediate arrests of Rakesh Tikait and Gurnam Charuni as cases have been registered against them already. They are doing political stunts and have nothing to do with the issues of farmers. If they are not arrested, then Kurukshetra SP will have to give an answer on July 22. We will permanently block the road here and until our demands are accepted we will keep holding the protest at Mathana”, said Guni. Supporting the farm laws of the Centre government, Guni said, “There is nothing black in these laws and they are in the interest of farmers. The leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) are doing politics and they should tell us what is black and white in these laws.” BKU (Mann) Haryana unit also held a meeting with regards to the arrest of Kurukshetra’s Vishal Jood, who has been arrested by the New South Wales (NSW) police in Australia over criminal cases. “Vishal Jood should be released from jail after meeting the Australian government”, said Guni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/bku-mann-demands-arrest-of-tikait-charuni/articleshow/84566639.cms||---

A tender was issued then, inviting bids from companies to curate and run cultural and culinary experiences for its members. The winning bid came from Old World Hospitality. “My wife Rashmi and I were inexperienced entrepreneurs without much money but we decided to bid for the project. We landed up with the highest bid and so started a 23-year-old journey,” recalled entrepreneur Rohit Khattar of Old World Hospitality on a call from Mexico, where he is quarantining on his way to the US. Old World Hospitality’s eventful tenure at the complex recently came to an end. IHC will undertake the culinary and cultural curating directly. On Sunday, The All American Diner, conceived by the Khattars partly to showcase their huge collection of Americana, was replaced by the new all-day-dining outlet called Habitat Hub — with a new look and menu catering to millennial sensibilities. “I went to Michigan to study as a 19-year-old and my school’s orientation was held in a diner. I was dazzled and thus began my obsession with Hollywood memorabilia,” said Khattar. “When we were thinking of a concept at IHC, it was natural to think of a diner. We got a chef from Denny’s (the chain operates 1,700 outlets in the US) to train our team.” That original menu and team trained by the Denny’s chef endured for over two decades even as tastes and generations changed. While some of the Diner’s much-loved hotdogs, malts and shakes, a draw with Delhi’s Gen X and Y seeking a slice of globalisation before travel and exposure became more accessible, are still on the menu, there is a contemporary international experience via offering such as tofu akuri with maska pav, avocado on toast, Turkish shakshuka, ratatouille and ciabatta, a range of pizzas and a much more extensive drinks list. Changes are in the offing elsewhere too. As Sunit Tandon, director, IHC, revealed, “While hospitality and programming services will continue as before, we will be rebranding the restaurants. We hope to introduce many more concepts and ideas.” The erstwhile The Deck offering salubrious views of the Lodhi greens is now The Med, focused on clean Mediterranean flavours. Delhi O Delhi, the much-loved member’s-only restaurant, whose first menu (and introduction to the menu) had been done by former diplomat-author-politician Pavan K Varma, is to be replaced by a newer brand. The old pictures of the Nehruvian era sourced by architect Mohit Gujral will go. Oriental Octopus, where India’s top chef Manish Mehrotra once cut his teeth as a Thai cook, too is in for a shakeup. Meanwhile, Khattar is taking his restaurant brands to other locations in Delhi-NCR. IHC’s new restaurants will, however, be run by many of the veterans he had employed at Old World Hospitality, including senior chef Rajeev Malhotra. Now, it remains for Delhiites to savour the new.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-little-bit-more-than-just-american-now-at-ihc/articleshow/84568817.cms||Anoothi Vishal
---||Pune||Pune: Eatery attacked with sword, slips into coma||PUNE: A 38-year-old eatery owner slipped into a coma after a mask-wearing man attacked him with a sword while he was speaking on his cellphone outside Garva hotel at Khedkarmala on Pune-Solapur highway on Sunday night. “Ramadas Akhade sustained serious injuries on his head and hands. He slipped into a coma and his condition is stated to be serious,” said senior inspector Rajendra Mokashi from the Loni Kalbhor police on Monday. Mokashi said, “The motive behind the attack could not be established immediately. The family members of Akhade have not named any person responsible for the incident in the FIR. A CCTV camera at the eatery has captured images of the assailant fleeing on a waiting motorcycle towards Pune.” Akhade’s brother, Santosh (47), has registered an FIR against two unidentified men on the charge of attempting to murder his brother under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Law Amendment Act, Arms Act and Maharashtra Police Act. Mokashi said, “Akhade and his brother were busy handing food parcels to customers. Akhade walked out of the eatery and was busy talking on the phone when the assailant, brandishing a sword, brutally attacked him three to four times and took to heels. After Akhade raised an alarm, the eatery staff chased the assailant, but he threatened them with the sword and sped away on a waiting bike.” Santosh stated in his FIR that a CCTV camera has captured images of the assailant wearing a face mask, but he and his staffers could not identify him. The registration number of the assailant’s bike could not be jotted down because of the darkness, he said. Mokashi said, “The doctor treating Akhade has told us that his condition is serious, and his health will be monitored for 48 hours. We will record his statement relating to the incident after he regains consciousness.” “We are analysing CCTV footages at other places to establish the routes taken by the suspects before and after the crime. We are working on certain clues and hope to detect the case at the earliest,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eatery-attacked-with-sword-slips-into-coma/articleshow/84566660.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Cut a tree 20 years ago? You may have to pay several lakhs in fine||NEW DELHI: If you had cut a tree about two decades ago and did not submit a fine or carry out compensatory plantation for the same, you may receive a notice asking you to pay a penalty. The forest and wildlife department has initiated a drive to collect arrears from the year 2002 onwards with notices so far issued to violations occurring in the south division from 2002 to 2010. These include non-payment of amount for felling a tree, non-payment of amount for compensatory planting of saplings or not carrying out the mandatory plantation. Officials said the fines could range from Rs 34,500 to several lakhs. A senior forest official in the south division said the drive was initiated to recover dues that stretched over several years, with mandatory inspections carried out at sites after seven years of giving permission to carry out the felling. “There are two options given to an individual who wants to fell a tree. A security deposit is collected, followed by the actual amount to fell the tree. Money is also collected for plantation and upkeep of saplings for five years. For each tree being felled, 10 saplings are planted by us and maintained over five years for which money is collected from the applicant. In some cases, people say they will carry out the compensatory plantation of saplings themselves, but they don’t do it,” said a senior official. “In other cases, people cut the tree and do not pay us the amount for compensatory plantation of saplings,” the official added. According to the forest department, an amount of Rs 34,500 has been fixed to plant and maintain 10 saplings over a period of five years. A forest official in the south division said more notices were to be issued for violations that occurred between 2011 and 2020. A forest official in the north division said they would also launch a similar drive soon. “Notices have been issued prior to this as well, but in most cases, applicants do not reply or submit the necessary information. After multiple lapses, fines can be imposed upon them,” said the official. Forest officials say hundreds of violators have been identified so far and lakhs of rupees are expected to be recovered from the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cut-a-tree-20-yrs-ago-you-may-have-to-pay-several-lakhs-in-fine/articleshow/84566668.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Roma Khanna was initially appointed as the local organising committee’s tournament director for both major tournaments. However, that post has been vacant since her resignation in April. The AIFF has now appointed two project directors – Nandini Arora and Ankush Arora – with AIFF general secretary Kushal Das taking a more hands-on approach. “It does not make sense to appoint a tournament director now,” a senior AIFF official told TOI on Tuesday. “The two project directors have been given different roles for the tournaments. The general secretary will have an important role to play in the organisation of these tournaments.” Roma, who spearheaded the bid for the Fifa U-17 World Cup back in 2019, was later appointed as the tournament director, the first Indian in this post at a Fifa event. She resigned citing personal reasons. Nandini and Ankush are already working with the local organising committee. 2022 will be a busy year for AIFF with two major tournaments lined up. The Women’s Asian Cup will held in Mumbai and Pune from January 20 to February 6 with 12 teams, four more than the last four editions. The U-17 Women's World Cup will be played from October 11 to 30 next year. India were earlier scheduled to host the 2020 U-17 World Cup, but it was postponed to 2021 before being cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aiff-appoints-two-project-directors-for-next-years-major-tournaments/articleshow/84598200.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||11 gang members wanted for attack on police held||Thiruvananthapuram: Eleven members of a criminal gang---allegedly involved in an attack on local residents and policemen on duty at Neyyardam and Kottur were arrested by rural police on Sunday. They had hurled petrol bombs at the cops on Thursday and had gone into hiding. One of the policemen was injured in the attack. The arrested persons were identified as Asif, 25, of Uzhamalakkal, Waseem, 22, of Poovachal, Ashiq, 19, of Perukulam, Sibi Vijayan, 22, of Aruvikkara, Renjith, 22, and Ahijith, 22, of Veeranakavu, Ratheesh, 22, and Anu, 31, of Amboori, Sambhu, 23, of Kulathummal, Ajith, 23, of Vazhichal and Harikrishnan, 23, of Veeranakavu. The gang attacked the police team after the cops made a few arrests following reports about the sale of ganja and illicit liquor. Many of the gang members had earlier been imprisoned after being convicted in various cases. They are accused in cases pertaining to murder, attempt at murder, housebreak and chain-snatching at different stations of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Vysakh who was remanded into custody on charges of attempt at murder on a motorist is also a member of the gang. Police said they supply drugs and arrange hideouts for criminals wanted in many cases. Sources said they attacked the policemen fearing that a combing operation would deprive them of their safe hideouts used for brewing illicit liquor and other criminal activities.  Some of these members are allegedly involved in attacks on police at Kattakada, Panniyode and Thiruvananthapuram. The police recovered weapons and motorcycles from the forest near Nellikkunnu Colony. According to the police officers, after they began a hunt for the gang members, they scattered into different groups. However, as they went deeper into the forests, they lost their way. Police were assisted by forest department officials in nabbing the accused. Kattakada DSP Prasanth, Nedumangadu DSP M Anilkumar, Neyyardam SI S Bijoy, GSIs Sasikumaran Nair, Rameshan, Mahadeva Marar, Rajasekharan, ASIs Unnikrishnan Potti, civil police officer Tino Joseph, and shadow cops Shafi, Jyothish, and Mahesh were part of the team that arrested the gang members. In the attack on the cops that happened on Thursday night, a few members of the gang threatened a three-member night patrol squad at Kottoor junction, brandishing swords at them. Though the cops tried to catch them, they fled on their motorcycles. Later, they returned with even more members and hurled stones at the police vehicle, injuring civil police officer Jino Joseph who was immediately taken to a nearby hospital. Following the incident, the rural SP pressed all vehicle units under Kattakkada and Nedumangad police subdivisions into service to nab the assailants. Though the cops cornered the assailants at Nellikkunnu Colony, the latter launched an attack using petrol bombs and stones. In this attack, a police vehicle attached to Malayinkeezh station was destroyed. The accused then managed to escape into the forest near the colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/11-gang-members-wanted-for-attack-on-police-held/articleshow/84551650.cms||---

SFSMA’s state-level body had appealed its members to submit such memorandums to respective DEOs. In Vadodara, more than 100 representatives, office-bearers and members of private school management submitted a memorandum to Vadodara DEO at Karelibaug. The memorandum states that the state government had given green signal to coaching classes, government schools, religious places to reopen as per standard operating procedures (SOPs) but the demand of self-financed schools to reopen classes for 9- 12 students is not being taken into consideration. “Students are missing out on interaction with peers and teachers. There is also a learning gap. We will have to test the efficacy of online studies for which schools need to reopen. If one is looking at risk factors, there is risk in opening swimming pools and cinema halls as well,” said educationist Tejal Amin. “Compared to coaching classes, schools have bigger rooms with proper air circulation. Why cannot self-financed schools be allowed to reopen for classes 9-12? If ‘sheri shalas’ can be reopened, why cannot self-finance schools reopen” questioned Utpal Shah, Vadodara zone president of SFSMA. SFSMA has threatened to intensify their stir and even halt online education if its demand is not addressed. The memorandum states that the majority of state governments have prepared a roadmap to reopen schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/self-financed-schools-demand-reopening-threaten-to-halt-online-classes/articleshow/84564250.cms||---
---||Kolkata||State to step up TB screening amid Cov pandemic, give spl kits to check spread||Kolkata: In a bid to strengthen surveillance and control spread of tuberculosis (TB) in the state, all patients diagnosed with the disease will get Airborne Infection Control (AIC) kits. The state health department has asked all district health heads and the chief municipal health officer at Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) to procure such kits. The step comes two days after the Union health ministry recommended dual screening of patients for both Covid and TB amidst an apprehension of a rise in number of TB cases during the pandemic. Supply of the AIC kits will be done under the National TB Elimination programme (NTEP). The kit containing five pieces of double layered cotton masks, two pieces of spittoons and phenyl, will be given to each microbiologically confirmed TB patient. “Due to the pandemic, TB screening has taken a backseat. We will now intensify screening patients to detect the infection. This AIC kit is one of the measures under NTEP to prevent the infected from transmitting the virus,” said a state government official. According to the Union health ministry, there was about 25% decline in notifications for TB in 2020 due to pandemic restrictions. State health officials also said that as Covid-19 took the centre stage, TB burden could have escalated in the state as everywhere else. According to pulmonologist Raja Dhar of CMRI, wearing masks during Covid has helped lower chances of TB transmission. “At the same time, TB screening has come down drastically during the pandemic due to which undiagnosed cases in the community could be on the rise. Moreover, someone who has been infected by Covid is susceptible to any secondary infection including TB. Therefore, mask could go a long way in controlling the spread.” said Dhar who is the director of the pulmonology wing. Chest medicine specialists said that a TB infected person can transmit the bacteria to at least 15 persons when in a closed space. “A mask will prevent the bacteria from becoming airborne. The reusable masks will reduce chances of people discarding them otherwise,” said RG Kar Medical College respiratory medicine head Susmita Kundu, who is heading centre of excellence for TB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-to-step-up-tb-screening-amid-cov-pandemic-give-spl-kits-to-check-spread/articleshow/84564206.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The members urged the government to allow online classes for students only if they provide proper network facilities in remote talukas. Member Anant Naik said that in Sattari many students struggle to get proper network, so considering this, the government must resolve the issue as soon as possible. “Sattari is the most-affected taluka where students even have to risk their lives by trekking in the forest and hills in search of network.” Naik said. Another member said that many parents in the state can’t afford to buy mobile phones and requested the government to give smartphones to each and every student free of cost. The delegation further said that online education is new to rural students. It is stressful to these students and difficult for them to cope with online learning.

Akali functionary Bikram Singh Majithia said AAP had always pursued an anti-Punjabi agenda, be it demanding a share in the state’s river waters for Delhi and Haryana, petitioning in the court to register criminal cases against farmers of Punjab for burning stubble and even trying to force closure of the thermal plants in Punjab. “Now, we have witnessed AAP following the policy of majoritism in Delhi by ordering the demolition of the Little Flower Church in south Delhi. This is proof that AAP believes in subjugating the minority communities in a systematic manner,” he added. The AAP government had earlier demolished a historic ‘Piao Sahib’ at Sisganj Gurdwara in Delhi, he alleged.  He said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had gone to the extent of lying in Goa by claiming that the Delhi Development Board was responsible for demolishing the church. “The truth is that the church was demolished on the orders of the AAP government without giving any notice,” said Majithia. He said the church was situated on gram sabha land owned by the Delhi government and the government demolished it in an arbitrary manner without even referring the matter to its religious committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-condemns-delhis-aap-govt-for-demolishing-church/articleshow/84566679.cms||---

Rain wreaked havoc across Uttarakhand on Monday as well, with another cloudburst washing away half a dozen houses and a bridge in Tehri district while landslides blocked at least 100 roads, including national highways, in the hill state. The cloudburst in Uttarkashi occured in Mando village following which teams of the local administration, State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and police reached the spot for rescue operations. Three bodies were recovered from the debris while three others were rescued and taken to the district hospital. One was reported missing in the nearby Kakraari village. The deceased have been identified as Madhuri Devi (42), Ritu (38) and Ishu (6). District magistrate Mayur Dixit said, "Several hectares of agricultural land, a few houses and roads have been damaged in the incident. Teams are working hard to bring back normalcy in the affected areas.” According to the regional meteorological centre, 180mm of rain lashed Uttarkashi in the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. In a separate incident on Monday, one person was injured and half a dozen houses damaged in a cloudburst in Med village in Bhilangana block of Tehri district. A wooden bridge was also washed away. Meanwhile, over 100 roads, including Badrinath, Kedarnath and Yamunotri national highways, were blocked due to landslides triggered by incessant rainfall. The Rishikesh-Badrinath national highway remained obstructed at Sirobagad and Narkota in Chamoli district, while Rishikesh-Kedarnath highway was blocked between Rampur and Sitapur. Yamunotri national highway was out of bounds beyond Kharadi in Uttarkashi district. According to the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC), Border Roads Organisation (BRO) and the Public Works Department (PWD) are working round the clock to clear the blocked roads. The hill station of Mussoorie also recorded landslides at several places. Landslides occurred on the Mussoorie-Dehradun Road, near Galogi, on Monday. “There were landslides at the site but traffic movement was not obstructed. We have an earthmover permanently deployed at the site to clear the debris,” said Sansar Chand, junior engineer of PWD. Local residents said that cutting the hill to widen the road had left the area landslide-prone. “The area has become highly fragile and prone to landslides. Over the past week, there have been several landslides here,” said a resident. Several stretches suffered damage due to heavy rain. These included the Mall Road, Gandhi Chowk to LBSNAA Road, Gandhi Chowk to Kincraig Road and Motilal Nehru Road.

He further said his appearance before ED will depend on the outcome of his petition filed in the Supreme Court. Deshmukh said the properties purchased by his son Salil’s company in 2006 are worth Rs 2.67 crore, which is among the properties worth Rs 4 crore attached by ED. “Some media reports mentioned ED attached Salil’s assets worth Rs 300 crore, which is misleading.” A real estate broker said the current market value of the properties is Rs 300 crore. “The plot can be used for residential, commercial and industrial purposes, with no land reduction for road infrastructure. Its proximity to Navi Mumbai international airport has added value in terms of commercial exploitation like FSI, five-star hotel, etc. Hence, the over 8-acre plot is valued at more than Rs 300 crore in current market prices,” said real estate broker R Mishra from Ulwe in Navi Mumbai. ED has tried to find Deshmukh by raiding his premises in Nagpur and Mumbai on different occasions recently to record his statement but he or his family members have been untraceable. Deshmukh is not at home and released the video from an undisclosed location through a close confidante. Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh approach the Supreme Court seeking protection from arrest in the laundering case. ED is probing a money laundering case against Deshmukh following allegations that he had asked dismissed police officer Sachin Waze, then heading CIU branch of Mumbai police, to collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month. ED investigation found Waze paid Rs 4.7 crore (collected from bar owners) to Deshumukh’s PA Kundan Shinde. Out of that money, Rs 4.2 crore was routed through a series of questionable transactions before it was shown as a donation to Deshmukh’s Nagpur-based trust. ED is trying to trace the donation money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sons-property-value-hyped-says-deshmukh-in-video/articleshow/84566746.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Delhi||MPD-41: Govt for multi-level parking lots under parks||New Delhi: The Delhi government has suggested that multi-level parking lots might be permitted under parks near residential areas to provide ample parking space, among other suggestions for the Master Plan for Delhi 2041. The draft plan is in the public domain for receiving suggestions and objections and the state government has suggested many other measures related to affordable housing, boosting the economy, incentivising green areas, etc. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal chaired a review meeting on Monday regarding suggestions for the MPD-2041, in the presence of PWD minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary and officials of PWD, transport, power and industries departments, apart from Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Transport Corporation, etc. The state government has proposed allowing multi-level car parking under existing parks, where the parks can be reconstructed at top of the structures and the cost can be subsidised by allowing the construction of indoor sports clubs, community halls for public use at the upper basement or stilt level of such structures. “This will help in removing cars and two-wheelers from roads and provide parking within 300 metres from the individual’s residence,” Jain said. To increase affordable housing, the government has suggested that EWS or affordable housing up to a carpet area of 50 sqm may be allowed in all land use categories subject to a minimum plot area of 2,000 sqm, he said, apart from increasing maximum ground coverage for affordable public rental housing like studio apartments. The government has also made several suggestions aimed towards enhancing the economy, which include a FAR of 325 for budget hotels located next to 30-metre-wide roads and 375 for those located along wider roads. It has also suggested that FAR for service apartments should be the same as for the hotels. It has also proposed increasing maximum ground coverage for guest houses, lodging and boarding houses. The government has also suggested allowing educational, sports and cultural coaching centres in all types of commercial buildings and in the case of plotted development abutting 24 metres or above ROW, professional activity shall be permissible to the extent of 100% of the permissible or sanctioned FAR on that plot. Jain also suggested that all utilities land of Delhi Jal Board should be allowed to be monetised as it is allowed in case of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mpd-41-govt-for-multi-level-parking-lots-under-parks/articleshow/84566721.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The health department will now enhance teaching manpower in 27 such schools through 87 posts in various teaching capacity. “To overcome shortage of nursing personnel and also upgrade status of nursing education, the state had earlier decided to set up 27 more schools to train GNM (general nursing and midwifery) courses. Now the process of recruitment in these nursing schools will begin,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. The 87 posts sanctioned include that of principal nursing officer, senior tutors and tutors. The GNM course takes three years and the state was churning out about 2,400 such nurses each year. Now the government will raise number of seats by about 400 each year. Private nursing colleges too add a pool of about 2,000 nurses each year. “Ideally there should be one nurse for every three patients in the general ward. . DDue to pandemic, authorities are finally realising the nursing personnel crisis,” said retired government nurse Parbati Pal of Nurses’ Unity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/27-nursing-schools-to-hire-87-teachers/articleshow/84564247.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||Walking The Talk With Site-Specific Plans||New Delhi: Delhi Development Authority (DDA), in collaboration with other agencies, has prepared walk plans for 15 busy and popular areas of the capital. Out of these, walk plans for seven locations were approved recently. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Thursday chaired the 63rd governing body meeting of the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre with the vice-chairman of DDA and other senior officials of stakeholder departments, where the walk plans of INA market/Metro station, ITO junction, Hauz Khas-IIT Delhi, Delhi University’s north and south campuses, Kamla Nagar and Lajpat Nagar were approved. The plans aim at improving walking infrastructure customised to specific needs of the respective areas and there is a specific roadmap for each location. Other locations, for which similar walk plans are in the process of being finalised include Nehru Place, Bhikaji Cama Place, Karol Bagh, Saket-Malviya Nagar, Lakshmi Nagar, Dwarka Sector-21 Metro station, Uttam Nagar crossing, Adhchini area on Aurobindo Marg etc. Walk plans have also been prepared for the three Inter-State Bus Terminals of Delhi and Old and New Delhi railway stations, DDA officials said. “The general concept and idea for the project includes improving overall walkability, which is an important initiative for any city that aspires to become a healthy, safe, vibrant and ecologically sustainable city,” an official said. He said that the plans aim development of barrier-free pedestrian infrastructure near Delhi Metro stations, creating an active public realm, offering safe and active mobility options for all users irrespective of age or ability, facilitating seamless intermodal connectivity and enriching the overall urban experience in the city. “The walkability plan objectives include covering an influence zone of around 400-500 metre or 5 to 10 minutes of walking distance around identified areas, including mass transit stations and high pedestrian footfall areas,” he said. The walk plans take into account comfortable last mile connectivity from mass transit stations, to increase ridership of buses and Delhi Metro and reduce dependence on the private modes of transport. Prioritisation of non-motorised private modes and public transport in street design are also planned to reduce car usage, leading to reduced congestion and pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/walking-the-talk-with-site-specific-plans/articleshow/84566784.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The Goan referee from Moira has accomplished the feat 17 years after making his debut in the state league. “I am very happy. My hard work has paid off. I made lot of sacrifices. Without making sacrifices, it was not possible,” Tejas told TOI on Tuesday. Tejas was only 18 when he made his debut in the state league. With his uncles, Goculdas and Jayendra, accomplished referees, and full backing from his family, there was never looking back for Tejas. He made his national debut in 2010, the same year he officiated the I-League which was the country's premier competition then. Four years later, he became a Fifa referee. Such is Tejas’ command over the game that it was no surprise he became the first Indian referee to officiate the Indian Super League (ISL) final between ATK Mohun Bagan and eventual champions Mumbai City FC last season. His feat, though, didn’t come easy. “I had to wake up every morning and go on the ground to work on my fitness. I could hardly attend any occasions of friends and relatives. Had to keep interaction to players minimal because I know that point of sympathy can come while officiating,” said Tejas. Then there is non-stop travel all over the country. After being inducted in the AFC referees’ panel in 2016, the workload only increased for Tejas as he had to travel all over Asia. Currently, only four Indian referees are in the AFC panel. He remains the only Goan. Tejas completed his bachelor’s degree in physical education in 2012 and followed it with a masters two years later. However, Tejas only focused on officiating and let go of job opportunities. The 35-year-old took up a post only recently, after the ISL final as a physical teacher at Sridora Caculo College, Mapusa. Even marriage had to wait until this month when he finally tied the knot. Officiating at a Fifa World Cup is Tejas’ dream, but he will have to wait little longer as the referee’s panel for the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 has already been finalised. “India is not bad, but at some point there are no proper facilities, standards maintained. That is why we are lacking in this path,” said Tejas. For now, due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Tejas has little time to savour his achievements before another tough season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/referee-tejas-is-indias-best/articleshow/84598293.cms||---

The irrigation department and district administration installed flood sensors on various bridges and nullahs in Pune city to provide timely alerts to the administration in case of any flood situation. The Sinhagad Road police said such flood sensors have been installed on different bridges over Mutha and Mula rivers and various nullahs. Sumit Mahadik (28), an employee of the company which maintains these flood monitoring sensors, lodged a complaint with the police. Senior inspector Devidas Gheware said, “The area does not have CCTV surveillance but police teams are trying to find out CCTVs located on the roads leading to the bridge to nail the suspects.” “The flood sensor has a digital camera, a SIM card, and other water sensors,” he added. Last year, such sensors were reported stolen from Vishrantwadi, Khadki and Shivajinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/flood-sensor-stolen-from-bridge/articleshow/84566749.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: All college students promoted but where are the seats?||MUMBAI: Colleges across Mumbai are facing a peculiar problem. After promoting all students to higher grades, they are posed with a challenge of excess students and not as many seats. Mumbai University’s solution? Stuff all additional students in existing divisions, ignoring per class capacity or student-teacher ratio, and bar external students once the sanctioned intake is reached. Most colleges affiliated to Mumbai University have maximum seats in their first year. The college capacity reduces as several factors are at play during natural academic progression: Low retention rate and drop-out, failure and migration. But this year, with all students being promoted, there is no space in higher years of degree colleges to accommodate so many students. “Many college principals wrote to Mumbai University regarding the problem of in-house students. As all students were promoted, most colleges did not have as many seats in their second and third year to accommodate their own students,” said Association of Non-Government Colleges chairman T A Shiware. Most large colleges usually have five to six divisions in the first year. But class population falls as one advances to higher years. “In the second year, colleges’ student capacity often reduces by a third. To increase divisions, institutes need to apply to the state government. This year, as all students were promoted, the problem of more students and fewer seats was faced by almost all colleges,” explained Shiware. On Saturday, Mumbai University issued a circular asking colleges to admit all eligible in-house students, even if they are “in excess of sanctioned intake capacity”. Director of board of evaluation and exam, Vinod Patil, clarified: “Students must be admitted within the divisions sanctioned, such that there is no increase in workload or rise in demand for additional staff. No additional staff will be sanctioned for additional students admitted.” Faculty members said, “Class capacity is very high already. Now MU is asking colleges to take all additional students in existing classes. How does that not increase workload? By not sanctioning additional faculty, they are expecting us to have more students per class,” said a BUCTU member. Students also felt that with colleges exceeding sanctioned intake, migrating to a better college would not be possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-college-students-promoted-but-where-are-the-seats/articleshow/84566753.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Sirsa is fasting for the release of five farmers arrested in a sedition case and withdrawal of the “secret FIR” registered against 100 farmers who stormed the July 11 meeting of the BJP district executive body. District administration officials held a meeting with the delegation of farmers and advised them to present their case before the court under judicial process. A health department team also examined Baldev Singh Sirsa. Deputy commissioner Anish Yadav (DC), superintendent of police (SP) Arpit Jain and SDM Jaiveer Yadav were present in the meeting between farmers and administration held in the meeting room of the Sirsa mini- secretariat on Monday. Farmers were represented by Lakhwinder Singh, Manjit Singh, Prahlad Singh Bharukhera, Swarna Singh Virk, Gurprem Singh Desujodha and Kamaljit Kaur. For the first time on Monday, the district administration issued a release about the interaction with the farmers and said that representatives of the farmers’ movement had submitted a letter listing their demands to the deputy commissioner in the meeting. The DC said that it was wrong to pelt stones and vandalise the deputy speaker’s vehicle on July 11 and action has been taken against the guilty on the basis of complete investigations and facts. He asked farmers to keep their word according to the judicial process so that the matter is resolved and the general public did not have to face trouble. “It is wrong to block the National Highway, which leads to traffic jams and inconvenience to citizens. Farmers have been provided a place in the local Shaheed Bhagat Singh Stadium by the district administration, so they can express their views in a peaceful manner,” the DC said. He said representatives leading the farmers’ movement should form a five-member committee and inform the administration so that the round of talks continued. He also urged farmers to keep in mind that law and order was to be maintained. SP Arpit Jain said the July 11 violence took place despite assurances made by farmers in Tohana and Hisar that they would protest peacefully. He asserted that the police administration had taken action against the culprits in full transparency and after thorough investigations. Therefore, he said farmers should present their case before court under the judicial process. He assured that no action had been taken against any innocent person. On Saturday, farm activists started their indefinite protest at the mini-secretariat in Sirsa after holding a mahapanchayat under the leadership of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Rakesh Tikait. On Sunday morning, farmers started a dharna by putting up tents on one side of Barnala road and SKM leader Baldev Singh Sirsa went on fast unto death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/admn-meets-farmers-on-day-2-of-skm-leaders-fast-unto-death/articleshow/84566720.cms||---

The police personnel of Vithura Janamaithri police station and a group of Student Police Cadets (SPCs) of Government Vocational Higher Secondary School, Vithura, have set up a ‘Kuttipallikoodam’ for the tribal students. The 320 sqft makeshift classroom, constructed with the efforts of parents in five days using reeds and bamboo, would benefit 18 students hailing from two tribal settlements at Kongamarathinmoodu. “These students didn’t have access to online learning. They don’t have internet facilities as their settlements are inside the forest. To reach the road they have to tread a difficult path through the forest for more than six kilometres,” said Vithura police station sub-inspector S L Sudheesh. In the Kuttipallikoodam they have set up a television, whiteboard, chairs and other study materials, including books. Most of these learning materials are contributed by various well-wishers. Besides teachers from Vithura school, police personnel and two tribal students who had passed Plus Two will take classes for the students. The police personnel would teach them twice a week. It was during a visit made by the officers of Vithura police station in connection with the ‘Oru Vayaroottaam’ scheme of the SPC that the families of the settlement shared their concerns about their children who lacked access to online learning. Sudheesh with the support of Vithura station house officer S Sreejith took the initiative to set up the classroom. Also, during the last academic year, the same team had set up a similar classroom for the students from the Kalloopara tribal hamlet. The team is also planning to arrange personality development programmes and PSC coaching for the students. The ‘Kuttipallikoodam’ was inaugurated by Thiruvananthapuram Rural additional SP E S Bijumon via online and the first class was taken by excise vigilance SP and state additional nodal officer of SPC Mohammad Shafi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cops-set-up-learning-centre-for-children-at-tribal-hamlet/articleshow/84551726.cms||---

The incident came to light when the farmer, Bapurao Pawar (69), visited the fish pond on July 18. He then lodged a complaint with the Bhigwan police station in the afternoon. The Bhigwan police said Pawar had constructed a farm pond on his farmland in Pondhawadi to have more water for farming purposes. He then decided to venture into fish farming. “Pawar then bought fish eggs and put them in the pond waters around three months ago. Around 7,000 and 5,000 fish of Chilapi and Saparnis breeds, respectively, worth Rs5 lakh were stolen from the pond,” an officer from the Bhigwan police said, adding that the nearby CCTV cameras showed that four thieves had stolen the fish. “The Chilapi and Saparnis fish are popular in the Bhigwan-Daund area. Many people from Pune and Mumbai travel to the area to eat the freshwater fish at the eateries there. Both fish breeds are popular and many farmers have ventured into fish farming to earn a good livelihood,” the officer added. Police said that Pawar lived in the village and the farm was located about 3km from his home. Pawar visited the pond once a week to feed the fish. The police have registered a theft complaint against the unidentified suspects. Police were questioning the local eatery owners and other farmers in connection with fish theft. “Our probe is on,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fish-worth-rs5-lakh-stolen-4-booked/articleshow/84566779.cms||---

The Sanskarinagri that sports many buildings and palaces designed on the lines of European architecture is now inspired by the concept of public places in western countries. The police department and civic body has come together to plan a first-of-its-kind public space for the citizens in Gujarat. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh said that he has proposed a plan to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). “Vadodara is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the state and citizens here like to enjoy their pace of life. Such cities should have a good public space where people can unwind and spend quality time,” Singh said. “The number of open spaces and grounds is shrinking in the city. So, we thought to have a couple of public spaces where no vehicles will be allowed for a few hours in the day. People can take a walk inside, children can play and youngsters can hang-out,” Singh told TOI. He added that the area around M S University and Sayajibaug Road is a perfect spot to develop such a public space. “This area is popular among Barodians, especially youngsters as the university and students’ hostels are in the vicinity. The police department and VMC will develop a plan together to identify more such spots. We will provide police patrolling to ensure that such hang-out zones are safe for women apart from blocking the traffic movement. I had a word about it with the mayor too,” Singh added. When contacted, mayor Keyur Rokadia said, “We have discussed the plan after the meeting with police commissioner. The concept of having a public place amid all urban development is very good and VMC will work on it. I suggested, Sursagar Lake is a good spot to develop a public place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/green-hang-out-spaces-for-barodians-soon/articleshow/84564264.cms||Tushar Tere

We have been requesting help from various departments to put shelter shade and have addressed this request through letters to the chief minister, transport minister, Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC) and yet have not received a positive response,” president of the Goa motorcycle taxi rider’s association, Suresh Thakur said. The association has therefore put forth this request before the corporation to help them in laying a shelter shade for pilots to protect them from both – the hot summers as well as the monsoons. Members of the association also requested the CCP to organise a vaccination drive for the motorcycle pilots and autorickshaw drivers operating in Panaji.

---||Jaipur||Road safety council bats for removal of Jaipur bus corridors||JAIPUR: The meeting of the State Road Safety Council was held on Monday to discuss proposals to reduce accidents in the state. During the meeting, it was proposed that the Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS) corridors should be removed from Jaipur since accidents were occuring on those stretches. State transport minister Pratapsingh Khachariyawas emphasised that Rajasthan should aim to become a ‘model state’ in terms of road safety. It was also directed that all the departments should set deadlines for road safety related budget announcements and complete them as soon as possible. At the meeting, a proposal was mooted to build hospitals near toll plazas operated in the state. A letter will be written by the State Road Safety Council to Union minister Nitin Gadkari in this connection. Khachariyawas said most of the accidents happen on highways. With hospitals and ambulances near toll gates, injured will be able to get immediate treatment. “There are many issues which the NHAI has to take care of and the black spots on highways should be rectified by taking action on a war-footing. Speed up the ongoing road construction works on all highways including Jaipur-Delhi. NHAI should take strict action if the toll operating agency does not work according to the conditions. Police, transport, public works department and road construction agencies should immediately fix the black spots. Illegal cuts on the road should be closed”, said Khachariyawas. It was also directed that lights should be installed in villages at the intersections and the roads connecting to their highways and primary trauma centres to be started soon. During the meeting, it was discussed that apart from the main roads, accidents are also increasing on the streets of the colonies. For preventing this, speed breakers should be built at the entrance of all municipal colonies as well as installing cameras on highways and main roads to monitor speeding vehicles and auto-generate challans. Abhay Kumar, principal secretary, transport department said more accidents are caused by trucks and cameras should be placed on the dashboards to monitor their speed. Deliberating over the Good Samaritan scheme, transport commissioner Mahendra Soni said ‘Jeevan Rakshak Yojna’ was announced in the budget to encourage people to take accident victims to hospitals. In this, Rs 5,000 and a certificate will be given to the helper, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/road-safety-council-reiterates-removal-of-bus-corridors-in-city/articleshow/84566787.cms||---

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government did not allow the pilgrimage on foot and permitted 40 warkaris with each palkhi this year. As per the plan, the palkhis travelled under police protection to prevent any disruption during the journey. People welcomed the decorated buses by showering flowers and cracking firecrackers at many places along the route. Some of them even tried to touch the buses. At some locations, people queued along the route with cellphone in their hands to capture the journey of the palkhis. “This is the second consecutive year when we couldn’t participate in the palkhi procession due to the Covid situation. We are hopeful for the next year,” said Bhausaheb Karhe from Indapur tehsil. Vikas Dhagepatil, the trustee of Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Temple trust, said, “The journey has been completed as per the state government guidelines. All rituals will be done as per the schedule in the next two days.” Sanjay More, president of the Sant Tukaram Maharaj temple trust, said, “The condition of roads ahead of Akluj in Solapur district was bad so the palkhi reached two hours late. Thousands of people had gathered almost in all villages along the route.” Milind Shambharkar, Solapur district collector, said all the palkhis were received at Wakhari village. “We have conducted RT-PCR tests of the people at Vitthal Rukmini temple. We will permit limited representatives of each tehsil to enter the sanctum sanctorum on the Ekadashi to prevent crowding. We have taken enough measures to prevent mass gathering on the temple premises,” he told TOI. “We have deployed enough police bandobast in the town to prevent gathering in and around the temple for the next couple of days,” said superintendent of police Tejaswini Satpute of Solapur district. The padukas of all the saints will be taken to the Vitthal Rukmini temple to perform pooja on Ashadhi Ekadashi on Tuesday. As per the tradition, chief minister Udhhav Thackeray, along with his wife, will perform ‘Mahapooja’ in the early hours of Tuesday in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/palkhis-reach-pandharpur-by-bus-amid-covid-restrictions/articleshow/84566825.cms||Sandip Dighe

The court has asked the government to reply within three weeks and posted the matter for hearing on August 24. Somya had challenged her suspension in the high court, but it upheld the decision of the government. Then she approached the Supreme Court through an appeal petition. Former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi, while arguing for Gurjar, said she had been accused of speaking loudly according to the FIR lodged by the commissioner. She was suspended by the state government which treated it as misbehaviour. Rohatgi said a public representative could not be suspended from the post for speaking in loud voice to an official as misbehaviour and it amounted to abuse of power. Gurjar had challenged her suspension in the Rajasthan High Court earlier under Section 39 (1d) of the Municipalities Act 2009. Commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh had alleged that Gurjar and four councillors misbehaved him at the mayor’s chamber after calling him for a meeting June 4. He had complained to the director of local bodies alleging that he had been assaulted and misbehaved. An FIR was loaded at Jyoti Nagar police station against the mayor and four councillors. The government had ordered a probe into the incident and based on the injury report, suspended the mayor and three councillors from their posts on June 6. The government also ordered a judicial probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sc-notice-to-govt-on-somya-gurjars-suspension/articleshow/84566816.cms||---

Abhijit, a Class VII student of St Mary’s Higher Secondary School, Pattom and his sister Amritha, a Class VIII student, have been living with their maternal grandmother Sudha Devi at Punchakari near Thiruvallam ever since they were abandoned by their parents. Every day, with a basket on the back of his bicycle, Abhijit sets off from home in the morning for doorstep delivery of fish soon after his grandmother returns from Vizhinjam with the day’s load. The family had seen better times. That was before the pandemic. Sudha Devi was employed in teashops and used to do the job of a housemaid too. In the wake of Covid-19, she lost her means of living and had no other source of income. “Fish sales do not fetch you a decent income. Earlier, at least at times, I was able to buy them the food they liked. But now, it is not possible for me to do so,” said Sudha Devi. Abhijit, however, is full of hopes. “I want to become a police officer. I am happy to help my grandma who has been selling fish for the past one year to look after us. I know well she is struggling to make the ends meet. She bought me a bicycle with her small savings so that I can carry the fish in my cycle. By afternoons I am free,” said Abhijit. When Abhijit and Sudha Devi leave for work, his sister Amritha does the household work. “My biggest dream is to look after my grandma and sister once I grow up. Our parents abandoned us in an Anganwadi. Since then, grandma has been everything for us,” said Abhijit. Abhijit who is very studious, wishes to join a swimming class, but he has to put it off owing to financial concerns. Once he reaches home, after selling fish, he attends online classes without any fail.

Despite written complaints by the survivors in all three cases, officials set up single-person inquiry committees instead of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), which is mandatory for redressal of sexual harassment complaints at the workplace. KK Singh, leader of the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) in WCL Chandrapur which has backed the survivors, shared copies of the complaints with TOI. A clerical employee working in WCL Lalpeth sub-area was allegedly sexually harassed by her manager Naga Shankar Rao for over two years. In her complaint, the employee has charged her boss of sending unsolicited text messages on WhatsApp and Facebook messenger, commenting on her appearance, calling her frequently to his cabin and making her sit in front of him for hours. When she refused to comply, he used to shout at her, the complaint adds. She has also charged him of humiliating her in a casteist manner and threatening to “throw (transfer)” her to a secluded place so as to ruin her career. The complaint states that Rao used to follow her home after office hours, purposely touch her when no one was around in the office and also check her phone to see whom she talks to. Adding that her boss would be responsible if anything untoward happened to her, the survivor sent the complaint to the area general manager (AGM) in August 2020. Despite the seriousness of the case, then AGM Abhaschandra Singh set up a one-member inquiry committee comprising a male officer, instead of handing over the case to ICC. The officer took statements of the survivor and witnesses, but the latter are unaware of any action taken post that. “The management has not replied to my complaint and the matter has been suppressed,” the complainant told TOI. Another employee from Rayyatwari sub-area had filed a sexual harassment complaint against senior officer SN Ojha in April 2020. She stated that he used to make scurrilous claims and talk to her in obscene language. The complaint described Ojha’s comments on the survivor’s clothes, body and sexual life, and how she was mentally harassed at the workplace. The employee had demanded transfer to Nagpur to escape the torture. A single-member committee of a woman officer carried out inquiry, but no outcome was reported to the INTUC. “The survivor was transferred to Nagpur and her case suppressed,” said KK Singh. Yet another employee from Padmapur sub-area filed a complaint on April 1, 2021, accusing seniors and co-workers of exploitation, public insult and mental torture. The management neither initiated any inquiry nor forwarded her case to ICC. Dhanorkar said she took up all three cases with AGM Muhammad Sabir, who assured to resolve them in 15 days. Sabir, who is on leave, said he had instructed officials to gather details of each case, and that he would review the complaints and issue appropriate directives on his return.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Forest worker gets a leg-up with prosthetic limb, walks after 8 years||KOLKATA: A 35-year-old daily labourer with the forest department, who lost his leg during patrolling in the Sunderbans eight years ago, got an artificial limb on Monday. City-based NGO Society for Heritage and Ecological Researches (SHER), with the help of the forest department, was behind this noble endeavour. Sanjay Shil, a resident of Kumirmari, lost his left leg when a service gun was fired by accident while he was patrolling the Dakshin Chara canal in Kathuajhuri forest under Basirhat range in 2013. “Ever since, I have been doing office work. But today, I can dream of a better life and hope that someday I can even return to field work,” said Shil. Chief wildlife warden VK Yadav appreciated the step and said though Shil had a temporary limb earlier, the one he got on Monday is much better that would help him perform his duty in a more efficient manner. Sunderbans Tiger Reserve field director Tapas Das said Shil till now was depending on a crutch and a temporary limb. “But this is an improved quality limb from a German firm. The move will boost the morale of field workers and help them understand that the department is always by their side,” he said. SHER was helped in this initiative by Rotary Club of Kolkata Urbana and orthopaedic surgeon Sudipta Bandyopadhyay. “We believe, with improvement in his gait pattern and foot functions, his life will become easier, particularly while negotiating the terrain of the Sunderbans,” said SHER’s Joydip Kundu, adding that Shil has already taken part in three trial sessions with the artificial limb. The German firm from where the limb was procured is the same firm that gave prosthetic limbs to Oscar Pistorius, the 10th athlete to compete in both Paralympic and Olympic games.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/forest-worker-gets-a-leg-up-with-prosthetic-limb-walks-after-8-years/articleshow/84564295.cms||---

Farmers across the state have been protesting against land acquisition in 13 districts and demanding higher compensation from NHAI. They have been requesting the state government to get the acquisition process halted. Recently, the district administration in Patiala announced high compensation amounting to up to Rs 1 crore per acre of land to farmers, following which farmers of Patiala lifted their protest. Thereafter, farmers from other districts reached Patiala’s YPS chowk and decided to continue the agitation for the remaining farmers affected by acquisition in the state. State coordinator, Road Sangharsh Kisan committee Harman Singh Jeji claimed that farmers from Rupnagar, Sangrur, Malerkotla and other districts was sitting on protest in Patiala while farmers of Malerkotla district had blocked the National Highway near Ahmedgarh on Monday noon. “We sat on protest by 12 noon on Monday but no one from the district administration approached us to resolve our issues or to pay heed to our demands. We are demanding a valid compensation that amounts to Rs 1.5 crore record of our agriculture land. Farmers were drenched in the rain but kept sitting in the protest, however later in the evening we started installing tents,” Jeji said. According to Malerkotla DC Amrit Gill “Farmers have blocked the road since afternoon. These are farmers from Ahmedgarh, where the compensation amount being given is up to 57 lakh per acre for their agricultural land. We are trying to resolve the issue.’ BOX: Patiala farmers get up to Rs 1 crore As per the award passed by SDM Patran on May 31, 2021 for land acquired in 11 villages of Tehsil Patran, Rs 1 crore per acre compensation has been given for land along the Ghagga main road and Rs 58 lakh per acre for other villages. For the distribution of this compensation, a limit of Rs 250 crore has already been released to the SDM Patiala, out of which Rs 100 crore has been disbursed to farmers and landowners. The official revealed that around 20 acres of land fell alongside highway Ghagga and collector rate for land near the highway was more than the other land, which was the reason for the higher compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/expressway-protest-farmers-block-highway-demand-higher-compensation/articleshow/84566798.cms||---

A case of unauthorized and illegal phone tapping has already come to light. In fact, the home department has set up a committee headed by DGP Sanjay Pandey to probe into illegal and unauthorized phone-tapping of cabinet members,” Sawant said. Sawant asked if a high-ranking IPS officer had been working on the snooping and phone-tapping assignment “I am told a team of senior officials of DGIPR were on visit to Israel during the tenure of Fadnavis for training. We are keen to know what kind of training they receive and did they submit a report to the government on their Israel visit.

---||Navi-mumbai||Outskirts bear force of rain, Mumbai is spared its fury||MUMBAI: The intense graph of the weekend rain spilled over into the first working day of the week. Monday's showers peaked on the outskirts in areas like Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli rather than within city limits. These localities recorded over 100 mm rains in the 12 hours ending 6pm Monday. The premises of the Ambernath municipal council, Uran court house and Turbhe police station were among the worst-affected by floods along with low-lying streets and homes. In comparison, Mumbai recorded 36.8mm rain at the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s Santacruz observatory and 26.4mm at Colaba between 8.30am and 8.30 pm. IMD later upgraded its weather warning for the city from an orange alert issued the previous day to a red alert up to 8.30am Tuesday. For July 20-23, weather officials have issued a lower orange alert indicating heavy to very heavy rain at a few places. A day after two landslides in Mahul and Vikhroli killed 33 people, five more landslides were reported citywide, but there were no casualties. Among 11 incidents of tree fall, 31-year-old Dhanaji Hatiyani was injured in one such accident in Mulund. He was admitted to a hospital in stable condition. Eight incidents of short circuit occurred. Rail and road traffic was disrupted for brief spells. Suburban train services were suspended briefly between Thane and Diva due to water logging at Kalwa station. Western Express Highway had snarls partly owing to vehicle breakdowns. A bridge over a nullah at Goregaon connecting Mrinaltai Gore flyover to S V Road washed away Sunday. Unlike the fierce downpour of July 16 when BEST was forced to divert 87 routes, on Monday there were six detours in three waterlogged areas of Bhandup, Andheri and Thane. As compared to Sunday when it operated 2,175 buses and suffered multiple breakdowns, BEST was able to run 3,082 buses of its total fleet of 3,300 Monday. Power cuts were experienced in Dadar, Antop Hill, Girgaum, Mulund and Andheri. These were local faults caused by waterlogging of cables. With abundant showers in catchment areas, the city's water stock rose by 9% in a single day. Civic officials were hopeful of a more bountiful figure on Tuesday due to the downpour in Thane where lakes are located. Bhatsa, the biggest reservoir supplying water to Mumbai, recorded a robust 201 mm rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/outskirts-bear-force-of-rain-mumbai-is-spared-its-fury/articleshow/84572987.cms||---
---||Rajkot||One held in Rajkot for securing Rs 4.6 crore loans on ‘non-existent’ buses||RAJKOT: A travel bus operator, aged around 40 years, was arrested for securing bank loans on travel buses which never existed. According to Special Operations Group (SOG) officials, they arrested one Bhalugiri Goswami, a resident of Narayan Nagar, who owns Khodiyar Travels in Rajkot city on Monday. As per the primary details, Goswami secured bank loans worth Rs 4.6 crore from different banks by producing forged Registration Certificate (RC) books of 28 luxury buses. Police lodged a complaint against three persons — Bholagiri Goswami, Irshad Pathan and Hosang Bhagvagar — under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including criminal conspiracy and have launched a probe. Both Pathan and Bhagvagar hail from Surat. “Pathan was the one who provided forged RC books of vehicles while Bhagvagar works as a valuer. Goswami came in contact with Pathan around four years ago when one of his buses developed a technical snag in Surat. He had some financial trouble and shared it with Pathan who told him about illegal ways of earning money. Later, Pathan started supplying RC books of vehicles which were scrapped and no longer in use to Goswami,” a police official said. “Goswami secured bank loans from HDFC, IKF Finance Ltd, Orix Finance, Tata Finance and IIFL worth Rs 4.06 crore in 2019. Goswami repaid instalments for the initial few months and later started defaulting. Banks issued notices to produce vehicles on which he had taken loans but he didn’t respond to them,” the police official added. Police said that one of the accused Pathan has already been arrested for a similar scam in Surat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/one-held-for-securing-rs-4-6-cr-loans-on-non-existent-buses/articleshow/84564388.cms||---

The girl, now a major, on Sunday approached the Wakad police and filed an FIR against him. Her stepfather was arrested under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. An officer from the Wakad police said, “The girl stated in her complaint that her stepfather talked to her in lewd and abusive language when she stayed with him. He also tried to force himself on her.” The officer said the arrested man used to beat up and scold the girl because she never paid heed to his advances. “The girl had suffered injuries on her head when she was beaten up by her stepfather,” he said. The officer said the man always tried to touch the complainant inappropriately. “The girl suffered the harassment for five years as the man threatened her,” he said.

---||Kolkata||Bhawani Bhavan protest holds up traffic in south, central Kolkata||KOLKATA: Cops had to resort to lathicharge to disperse hundreds of police constable job seekers demonstrating outside the state police headquarters at Bhawani Bhavan in Alipore on Monday morning. The protest blocked several key thoroughfares in the heart of south Kolkata, resulting in a traffic logjam across south and central Kolkata for at least two hours. The protestors from different districts were demanding immediate employment of 6,500-odd young men who had passed police recruitment examination for the post of constable. Majority of them were reportedly handed over joining letters which were held back at the last moment. According to sources, 8,419 persons had passed the examination last October and 2,871 were already inducted into service following which the employment status got caught in a legal tangle and the Calcutta High Court had put a stay on the recruitment. The case is under hearing at the state administrative tribunal (SAT). “We cleared physical and written examination followed by an interview in 2019. The result was announced in October 2020. We were told first 4,500 successful candidates would be employed before polls and the rest after that. Thus, 2,871 were employed but then some 400 examinees, who couldn’t clear the exam, filed a case in HC in January 2021,” said Abhijit Baidya, a Shyamnagar resident. Baidya said the court had asked SAT to file a report by April 19. Around 30 protestors were later arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bhawani-bhavan-protest-holds-up-traffic-in-south-central-kol/articleshow/84564424.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC dismisses sacrilege accused’s plea against handwriting comparison||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday dismissed the plea filed by a Dera Sacha Sauda follower and one of the accused in the sacrilege cases in Punjab against the special investigation team (SIT) taking handwriting samples in relation to the case. With this, the stay granted by the HC on SIT submitting charge-sheet in these cases has also been vacated. “Accused could not show as to what prejudice is caused to the rights of the petitioner by objecting to obtaining his handwriting samples and sending them for comparison. Rather, by raising such an objection, mid-way the investigation, the petitioner is pre-empting his guilt,” the HC observed in its detailed order. Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill passed these orders while dismissing the plea filed by Sukjinder Singh alias Sunny. The petitioner had challenged the June 8, 2021, order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class (JMIC), Faridkot, whereby an application moved by him objecting to the comparison of the handwriting samples with those present on the alleged posters, was dismissed. His counsel submitted that the investigation conducted by the CBI in the sacrilege case still holds good and the same must be taken into consideration by the now constituted SIT. Earlier, the petitioner’s handwriting samples obtained by the CBI and sent to the CFSL, Delhi, for comparison with those on the incriminating posters did not match. “Having already ordained such a course, it is not open to the prosecution to repeat the same course of action. Such process would amount to re-investigation, which the prosecution legally is not allowed to do and what the prosecution could do in the matter, is only to further investigate the matter,” the petitioner had submitted. Opposing his plea, the counsel for the Punjab government argued that the prosecution agency is bound to collect the evidence to reach a logical conclusion and that there cannot be any prohibition or restraint against it. The necessity to obtain the handwriting samples of the petitioner again has arisen as the earlier samples were not taken properly and were not taken with ‘Marker’ as the said posters were found to be written with ‘Black Marker’, the state had contended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-dismisses-sacrilege-accuseds-plea-against-handwriting-comparison/articleshow/84566862.cms||---
---||Pune||Contractors held on charge of causing worker’s death due to negligence||Pune: A centring contractor and a sub-labour contractor were arrested on Monday on the charge of causing the death of a construction worker (43) due to negligence after he fell from the fifth floor of a six-storied building in Yeolewadi on July 17. The arrested duo are centring contractor Manilal Rathod (35) and sub-labour contractor Ajay Mistry (40). The Kondhwa police identified the deceased as Neelkamal Gurugopal Chaktravarthy, having his roots in West Bengal. He resided at the construction site labour camp at Kamthe Vasti. Inspector Shabbir Sayyed from the Kondhwa police said, “Chakravarthy was doing centring work of one of the pillars on the fifth floor when he lost balance and fell into the duct. He was critically injured. He was rushed to the Sassoon General Hospital, but doctors declared him dead on arrival.” Sayyed said, “We had initially registered a complaint related to accidental death. An inquiry revealed that the suspects had not taken safety measures like installing nets and providing helmets to workers at the construction site as per the agreement signed with a local builder. We arrested the suspects after an inspection of the site established that there were no safety measures in place to protect the workers.” He said the hospital in its advance post-mortem report stated that the victim died due to multiple injuries. The victim’s son in-law, Ananda Ghosh (29) from Bhor, lodged an FIR on Sunday night under Section 304 (A) of the Indian Penal Code. Ghosh in his FIR said that his father-in-law fell on the centring goods kept in the duct between two staircases and suffered serious injuries to head, face and other body parts. He came to know about the incident from a telephone call from a known person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/contractors-held-on-charge-of-causing-workers-death-due-to-negligence/articleshow/84566876.cms||---
---||Pune||Cantt metered water supply system hit by damaged, missing devices||Pune: The metered water supply system introduced by Pune Municipal Corporation in Pune and Khadki cantonments has been hobbled by missing and damaged water meters. Of the 7,000 meters installed in these areas, at least 30% are missing or dysfunctional, making it difficult for the civic body to monitor water consumption in Pune Cantonment Board and Khadki Cantonment Board limits. PMC provides water to these areas and has received a lukewarm response to entreaties to consumers affected, to get the meters repaired or installed. “The owners of these properties (commercial and residential) should come forward to install the meters or get them repaired. Defaulters will face action, like supply disconnection,” Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of PMC’s water supply department, said. PMC said faulty meters were also causing a loss of revenue for the civic body — Rs 25 crore in arrears has accumulated over the past few years. Officials said these meters pre-dated the 24x7 water supply project. The new meters that are to be installed under this project will be state-of-the-art, an official said. “We have started a drive to recover dues and are sending notices to defaulters. They must clear the dues at the earliest or face disconnection,” a senior PMC official said, adding action has been taken against 10 defaulters already. PMC has also started an amnesty scheme for those who have illegal water connections. These connections can be regularised by paying a one-time penalty. Illegal connections — commercial and residential — up to one-inch diameter will be regularised. Such connections in cantonments too will be considered if they meet the parameters of the scheme, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cantt-metered-water-supply-system-hit-by-damaged-missing-devices/articleshow/84566910.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Cases against MPs, MLAs: HC says check if disposal is expeditious||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday directed the registrar general of the Punjab and Haryana high court to examine if trial courts in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh were following directions passed by the Supreme Court (SC) to ensure expeditious disposal of cases pending before them against sitting or former MPs/MLAs. “Registrar (general) to examine the order dated May 27, 2021, and the order passed today by this court and report whether all concerned are abiding by the directions given by SC in letter and spirit,” observed a division bench comprising Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh. Satya Pal Jain, additional solicitor general of India, informed the HC that he had received information from Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) about pendency of a case against Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh pending before CJM, Ludhiana, at the pre-summoning evidence. Jain submitted he shall furnish details thereof by way of an affidavit within three days. The matter has now been fixed for July 27. During the hearing of the case on Monday, senior advocate Rupinder Singh Khosla, who has been assisting the HC as Amicus Curiae in this case, referred the SC guidelines for speedy disposal of such cases. He submitted that the courts should proceed with the trial notwithstanding any stay granted by the high court unless fresh order is passed extending the stay by recording reasons. Amicus also informed the HC that the proceedings of the cases pending against former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda before the special CBI and ED court, Panchkula, has been deferred on the directions of the HC. Senior advocate Sumeet Goel, while representing the CBI, also informed the bench about some instructions given by SC for speedy disposal of cases against MP/MLAs. Pointing to the instructions, Goel submitted that upon being listed, the court must first decide whether the stay was granted, if any, should continue. In the event that a stay is considered necessary, the court should hear the matter on a day-to-day basis and dispose of the same expeditiously, preferably within two months, without any unnecessary adjournment, he stated. The Covid-19 condition should not be an impediment to the compliance of this direction, as these matters could be conveniently heard through video conferencing, the HC was informed. After hearing all counsels, the high court asked the registrar general of the HC to inform the court if these instructions/guidelines are being followed while hearing the cases against MP/MLAs. The matter is pending before the HC in a suo motu petition where the HC sought details from both the states of Punjab, Haryana and UT Chandigarh about the pendency of cases against the leaders in their respective states. The HC had taken cognizance of the matter in following the directions of the SC and appointed senior advocate Rupinder Khosla as amicus curiae to assist the court on the issue. A total of 68 cases, registered against 34 former and sitting MPs/MLAs in the state of Haryana, are pending. Of them, 21 cases are under trial in the state, three cases have been transferred to CBI, and 44 cases are under investigation. As many as 96 MLAs or MPs, sitting and former, in the state of Punjab are facing criminal cases in 163 FIRs registered at various police stations of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cases-against-mps-mlas-hc-says-check-if-disposal-is-expeditious/articleshow/84566900.cms||---

The seat numbers were also provided to the students at the same time. However, there are some shortcomings in the details of some students which they can provide to their respective schools for changes.” The state board has also stated that students who have spotted errors in their forms such as subjects, medium, photo, signature, name, birth date or other such errors can get them corrected by sending an application to their respective divisional boards. The board officials had made it clear that the results will be final and no revaluation will be allowed.  In a normal year, students are allowed to apply for revaluation if they feel they have not got the marks in their board exam. After checking the answer sheets, the board makes the correction if needed. Such a process will not be followed this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/students-can-get-name-sign-photo-corrected/articleshow/84564442.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Talking to media here on Monday, the jathedar said Sikh scholars and high priests would contemplate on the issue and go into the genesis of sacrilege incidents and try to find a solution to bring an end to such incidents. About the finding of underground ‘bungas’, the officiating jathedar said the family who lived here had taken compensation from the government in 1988 before vacating the same. Stating that the structure was known as Bunga Gianian, he said, “The four stories of the bunga were razed by the government under the Galliara Project. If anybody had objections, they could have raised the issue then.” He added a few people were doing politics on a facility being created for the Sangat who would have the facility of jora ghar, gathri ghar, and a parking . “It’s not a dera or the house of Jagir Kaur (SGPC president) or the Golden Temple manager being constructed, but a facility for sangat,” he said. Why Kartarpur corridor is not being opened? The officiating jathedar of Akal Takht, Harpreet Singh, asked why the Kartarpur corridor was not being opened by the Indian government . “The government should open the corridor for pilgrims,” he added. Earlier, Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) extended an invitation to Harpreet Singh and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib, Pakistan via corridor which had been closed since March 16, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sacrilege-incidents-akal-takht-jathedar-calls-meeting-of-sikh-outfits-on-july-26/articleshow/84566944.cms||---

Both children are neighbours. Police, counsellors and data security experts have pointed to the recent easy exposure to the internet, lack of awareness about software that help the parents keep inappropriate content away from children’s cellphone and poor supervision for children getting involved in such behaviour. Investigating officer senior inspector Devidas Gheware said, “She is just three and half years old but she was taught well by her mother that she cannot be touched by anyone, including her father. Hence, the child was able to narrate the harassment she faced. Both the families are neighbours and the children play together. Nowadays, almost all children have a cellphone. Parents cannot monitor what the child is up to all the time. It is possible that the boy could have accidentally seen inappropriate content and got influenced.” Gheware said such cases were increasing and that it was important to educate children, both girls and boys about what is appropriate behaviour and what is not acceptable. The FIR has been filed under IPC section 376 and POCSO section 4, 8. “The boy will be produced before the child welfare committee and counselling will be done. Most such cases happen with known people and if your child is saying that they do not like an uncle or shows any different behaviour to a person, the parents need to take notice instead of ignoring it. Always take your children seriously,” Gheware said. Anuradha Sahasrabudhe, founder of Dnyana Devi Childline said sexual crimes are increasing in children and the age group that indulges in it and is made a victim of is decreasing. “In online games, there are sometimes malicious pop-ups of sexual content. Once the child sees this, they want to try it. Most of the time, they do not even know what it is but they just want to try it and a younger sibling or a young neighbour becomes their victim. Hence, parental supervision is very important. Secondly, they should be taught that nobody can touch their private parts or anywhere and if they still do, they should shout and run. They should be made confident enough to confide and the parents need to be ever vigilant,” Sahasrabudhe said. Sonali Kale, a psychologist working with Muktangan, said, "In the last 4-5 months, I have counselled three children with porn addiction and all of them are in the 10-12 age group. Through counselling, we came to know that the first time they came in contact with porn is on cellphones. As a parent, when you give children your phones, you have to wipe out your history and activities. Parents need to supervise younger children when they have accessed the internet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/inapt-touch-of-a-child-by-another-raises-concerns/articleshow/84564457.cms||Ardhra Nair

The 18 inch-dia gas pipeline and 40 mm HDPE duct to lay optical fibre cable work got affected in Purulia, Bankura, West Burdwan, Hooghly, Howrah, East Midnapore, Nadia and North 24 Parganas, said Subhas Datta, petitioner in the case and a green activist. The bench also asked the government to mention the deadline for permission from the authorities, including Bandel Thermal Power Station (BTPS). The pipeline is supposed to pass through BTPS land to cross the Hooghly. The GCGSC sought 4 weeks’ time to file the affidavit informing the NGT that GAIL India and state held a meeting on July17 and that two more meetings are scheduled on July 23 and July 27. CNG, a clean fuel, will be a lot cheaper than petrol. Even though Jagdishpur-Haldia-Bokaro-Dhamra CNG pipeline was approved in 2015, the laying faced land hurdles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ngt-asks-for-cng-pipeline-plan/articleshow/84564482.cms||---

The pitbull, besides crushing the facial bones of victim Vishal Meena, also inflicted grievous injuries on his head, neck, thighs and hand during the attack. Based on a complaint by the neighbor, a case was registered against the dog’s owner and caretaker in Chitrakoot police station. A police official said, “A case has been registered under IPC Section 289 that deals with negligent conduct.” Vishal’s father Jagdish works as a labourer in pet owner’s Durgesh Hada’s residence. The incident occurred around 10.30am when the dog reached the backyard where Meena family lives on rent. It was alleged that the dog was not on a leash and attacked the boy unprovoked when he was playing. After the mother and the boy cried for help, residents rushed to the spot and rescued the child. However, by then he was seriously injured. Following this, Meena was rushed to the SMS Hospital. After primary treatment, he was shifted to a private hospital. The condition of the child was reported critical. Meanwhile, the JMC-Greater took custody of the dog and sent it to a rescue centre at Jai Singh Pura Khor. Rajesh Gupta , in-charge livestock at JMC-Greater said, “The dog will be kept under observation for two days. Based on doctors advise’ we will decide our next step.” Though the breeds is in demand for the macho image, experts claim ferocious guard dogs with killer consequences should not be kept at home. Veterinary doctor Arvind Mathur said, “We always discourage people from purchasing ferocious breeds of dogs for their homes. The behaviour of these foreign breeds is unpredictable and its constant threat for owners and people living in surroundings.” Activists claimed these breeds is either banned or restricted in many countries and to keep these aggressive dogs, the owners have to follow certain regulations. In Rajasthan, many of these owners are keeping them as pets illegally. Shubhamoy Kumar, secretary, People for Earth said, “To earn money, breeders are selling these dogs. Pitbull is not registered with Kennel Club of India (KCI). The administration should take action against all the breeders and owners.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dog-critically-injures-11-year-old-kid/articleshow/84566968.cms||---

Many students and parents of non-state board schools said they preferred to take admission in their own schools as they did not want to study a new syllabus for admissions. The CBSE, ICSE, IB and other non-state board students usually have to get their marks transcript from the board if they wish to apply for Std XI admissions in state board schools. Once the transcript is provided, they are eligible to participate in the common admissions process. “Every year, nearly 10,000 students from other boards including out of Maharashtra state boards participate in the admission rounds for junior college,” said assistant director of education, Pune, Meena Shendkar. Ameya Purohit, a CBSE student, said, “I have decided to continue to study in the school from where I passed out. I am preparing for IIT entrance, so I prefer my school as they have special coaching. It would be waste of time to study separately for the FYJC entrance for shifting to the SSC board.” Divya Jain, another student, said she expects another year of remote education considering the Covid situation. “Hence, I and my family decided that after the results are announced, we shall take admission in the same board where I am studying now. I will be saving time and effort, as I do not wish to study SSC syllabus now.” Jessica Sibloon, an ICSE school principal, said, “We have a list of 90% of our students who wish to continue with the school for FYJC. As soon as the results are announced we will be drawing a merit list based on the seats available. Those who do not figure in the merit list will have to look for a seat outside.” Universal rule for all to follow, say officials State board chairman Dinkar Patil said, “There have been some discussions on why the non-state board students have to study SSC syllabus. They are going to continue with the state board syllabus and will have to switch over and take that extra effort and study for the entrance. The rule is universal and there cannot be any preferences over it. Students from various private educational boards and also other state boards will appear for the exam, so we cannot have a syllabus based on each of these boards. So they have to study the syllabus of which students are going to study further.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pupils-of-other-boards-against-change-prefer-focus-on-studies/articleshow/84564548.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

I think CCTVs are installed in the ward and my statement can be verified after watching the footage.” Meera further said both the doctor and the nurse scolded her for rushing to them every now and then. “Instead of attending to the patient, they shouted at me for disturbing them saying my sister’s situation is not serious. Both of them told me to first arrange for blood and come to them.

JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the matter concerned national security and must be investigated by a join parliamentary committee. Addressing the media here on Monday, Bhattacharya said that the investigation was done by a consortium of international media houses and it has been proved that mobile phones across the globe were compromised using Pegasus spyware. “We are more concerned about the snooping going on in our country as people from different walks of life including, opposition leaders, journalists, activists and even a sitting judge of the supreme court, were targeted,” he said. The JMM has also linked the exposure with the recent sacking of former IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. “We can now join the dots and understand the purpose of the cabinet reshuffle. The IT minister was removed by the government so that after the expose, he doesn’t require to face Parliament,” Bhattacharya said. JMM said that since the Israel-based company, NSO, has categorically said that it provides the software only to vetted governments, there was no chance of the software being used by any private party. “From the admission of the spyware developer, we can understand that it was either the government or any of its agencies which was involved in the illegal spying,” Bhattacharya said. He stressed that there was a lawful provision for phone tapping by the government but that requires due diligence. “Phone tapping is possible on the recommendation of a high-powered committee formed by the Union home secretary, but this kind of uninformed planting of spyware has no legal sanction,” he added. Calling upon anti-BJP parties, Bhattacharya said: “The vindictive centre has used draconian laws like NSA and UAPA against activists and journalists who have criticised the government or have expressed disagreement. This was evident in the Bhima-Koregaon case in which Stan Swamy was falsely implicated. The government might be using such tactics against political opponents also, which is dangerous for democracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-demands-jpc-probe-into-pegasus-snooping-case/articleshow/84564573.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

He added, “We have communicated the decision to all our mosques across the state to make sure that Eid-Ul-Adha celebrations do not become a threat to public health.” The chief of Imarat-e-shariah (Ranchi chapter), Mufti Mohhamed Anwar Qasmi, said, “We had issued a directive to all the mosques in Hindi as well as in Urdu during Eid, asking the devotees to refrain from offering namaz in groups, avoid hugs and handshakes because of the pandemic. A similar protocol will be followed tomorrow for Bakrid.” He added, “The festival commemorates the sacrifice of Prophet Ibrahim who was ready to sacrifice his first born on God’s command and later, sacrificed a sheep as per the almighty’s instructions. So people should also try to sacrifice congregations amid such tough times.” Even the usual hustle and bustle was missing from the Bakrid market in Ranchi on Monday with traders complaining of losses. Manish Singh, who sells goats here, said, “I have been feeding Kallu Dada (a goat which is priced at Rs1,10,000) for more than four months to fetch a good amount this Bakrid but no buyer has approached me yet.

State finance minister Rameshwar Oraon is currently the state party president. One of the first-time MLAs, who has been pressing hard for the removal of the state president, said requesting anonymity, “I have got information that state Congress will be revamped in another two months. Many of us have been demanding the party leadership to implement the ‘one-man, one-post’ policy. By that logic, the present state president must be removed from his position.” Another MLA said the functioning of the state party leadership must be questioned when majority of the MLAs and the workers seem unhappy. “I have nothing personal against the state president but there must be something wrong when so many voices of dissent are coming from different sections within the party. Moreover, implementing the ‘one-man, one-post’ policy would help a deserving person become the state party president,” he said. Oraon couldn’t be contacted for his comments as his phone remained out of range. Speaking earlier, he had said that he was bound to do whatever was asked by the central leadership. Meanwhile, three former state party presidents — Sukhdeo Bhagat, Pradeep Balmuchu and Ajoy Kumar — were reportedly lobbying for different positions. While Bhagat and Balmuchu were trying hard to rejoin the party, which they had deserted before the assembly polls, Kumar, who rejoined in Delhi last year, is said to be lobbying for the state president post again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-dissenters-hopeful-after-change-of-guard-in-punjab/articleshow/84563018.cms||ASRP Mukesh

We will continue with the stir till the prices are reduced.” The party claimed that in the last one year, fuel price was hiked at least 67 times. Currently, petrol costs Rs 96.68 in Ranchi and diesel is priced at Rs 94.84, both hiked by close to Rs 2 since last week. While the grand old party, which is a coalition partner of the mahagathbandhan government, has ruled out any immediate possibility of reducing the state’s VAT on fuel (which is about Rs 22) in view of ‘lack of funds’, it is pressing the Centre to reduce the prices by striking out the quantum of central taxes imposed on fuel and LPG. When asked why the state government isn’t ready to cut down its VAT on fuel, Oraon, who is also the finance minister, said the onus of slashing its price lies with the Centre. “I have been repeatedly saying that after introduction of Goods and Services Taxes (GST), all the taxes get directly credited to central coffers, which later gets redistributed to the states. Moreover, we are not getting our rightful GST dues from the Centre properly. How can we function in such a scenario? States hardly have any other avenues to garner their resources for running the government. Therefore, the Centre must slash the price by decreasing the tax on petrol.” Patralekh, on the other hand, demanded the Union government to announce subsidies for farmers. “Besides the common people, the farmers are hit hard today due to the rise in prices of diesel and petrol, which is leading to a rise in the cost of farming and marketing of their products,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-holds-signature-drive-against-fuel-lpg-price-rise/articleshow/84563076.cms||ASRP Mukesh

He added, “We have communicated the decision to all our mosques across the state to make sure that Eid-ul-Adha celebrations do not become a threat to public health.” The chief of Imarat-e-shariah (Ranchi chapter), Mufti Mohhamed Anwar Qasmi, said, “We had issued a directive to all the mosques in Hindi as well as in Urdu during Eid, asking the devotees to refrain from offering namaz in groups, avoid hugs and handshakes because of the pandemic. A similar protocol will be followed for Bakrid.” He added, “The festival commemorates the sacrifice of Prophet Ibrahim who was ready to sacrifice his first born on God’s command and later, sacrificed a sheep as per the almighty’s instructions. So people should also try to sacrifice congregations amid such tough times.” Even the usual hustle and bustle was missing from the Bakrid market in Ranchi on Monday with traders complaining of sales being down this year. Manish Singh, who sells goats, said, “I have been feeding Kallu Dada (a goat which is priced at Rs 1,10,000) for more than four months to fetch a good amount this Bakrid but no buyer has approached me yet. Earlier, there used to be an auction for such goats. Today, only a few have approached me for cattle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/covid-takes-charm-out-of-eid-drives-faithful-indoors/articleshow/84564260.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Weather office predicts heavy rainfall today, issues yellow alert||RANCHI: The state is likely to receive heavy rainfall in the next three days, starting from Tuesday, in some parts and the IMD has issued a yellow alert since there are chances of thunderstorms on those days. “North-western and southwestern parts of the state are likely to receive heavy rainfall on Tuesday while the south eastern parts would receive heavy rainfall on Wednesday. On Thursday, northern, central and south eastern parts of Jharkhand will receive heavy rainfall. We have issued a yellow alert for all the three days as there are chance of thunderstorms,” the IMD said on Monday. Despite the timely arrival of monsoon, the spatial distribution of rainfall has remained quite uneven in Jharkhand and on Monday, the state received 380.6mm of rainfall as against the seasonal average of 399.4mm, indicating a negative departure of around 5%. The IMD said that the monsoon activity over Jharkhand is near normal. “Several parts of the state received light to medium showers during the last 24 hours. Hendegir in Hazaribag recorded highest rainfall of 113.4mm,” the weather office said. Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Daltonganj recorded 5.8, 8.8 and 2.2mm rainfall, respectively, while Bokaro recorded 64mm. Out of the 24 districts, 13 are in the normal rainfall category where the deviation of rainfall is in the range of -19 to +19%. Four districts have received excess rainfall while seven are in the rainfall deficit category. So far, Gumla and Chatra have received 33% and 35% lesser than average rainfall while the neighbouring district of Lohardaga recorded 63% excess rainfall. Dhanbad, Lohardaga, Koderma and Jamtara have received excess rainfall while Chatra, Godda, Gumla, Khunti, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Simdega and West Singhbhum are staring at deficit rainfall, which can lead to a drought-like situation in some places. However, the rainfall distribution in the beginning of the month was quite even. On July 1, the state had received 34% excess rainfall — Jamtara, Palamu and Dhanbad being the three districts with the highest quantum of rain. But even then three districts — Gumla, West Singhbhum and Seraikela Kharsawan -- were in the rainfall deficit category. By the end of first week of July, the average rainfall of state came down but it was still excess by 18%. On July 14, eight districts were in the negative category while the state average remained at 4% excess rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/weather-office-predicts-heavy-rainfall-today-issues-yellow-alert/articleshow/84562928.cms||---

The brother of the woman that the deceased, Amar Naik, was in a relationship with, had engaged a contract killer. Both families were opposed to their relationship and had tried to convince them to break up. “The victim is said to have been in a relationship with a girl from Vasco for a few years. It had angered the brother of the girl to the extent that he planned to murder him,” Singh said. The brother was a friend of the victim and is said to have helped him some years ago when he was undergoing some crisis. The fact that his sister was in a relationship with his friend did not go down well with the accused, sources said. Singh said that the brother “contacted one of his old friends Ravi Shanker Yadav and offered him Rs 5 lakh to kill Naik”. “Yadav in turn brought in the two other shooters to carry out the task,” Singh said, adding that the murder was planned five to six months ago. Yadav resided in New Vaddem about a decade ago and he and Naik were known to each other. Yadav was arrested on Saturday. The brother lives abroad and police will arrest him soon, Singh said. “The fourth accused is absconding as of now. We will be carrying out all legal procedures by contacting the ministry of external affairs to bring the accused to India.” “We are finding out whether more money was to be paid after the crime to the contract killers and are trying to find out how they procured the weapons,” Singh said. It may be recalled that Naik was shot dead at an elite colony at Bogmalo on Thursday evening. Naik was into small-time mining, transportation and property business. He was accompanied by a friend when he was killed. The two men from UP — Shailesh Gupta, 29, and Shivam Sarvajeet Singh, 22 — who were engaged by Yadav to kill Naik, had lured the victim into meeting them for a property deal. Yadav brought the two accused from UP to Goa. They travelled to Maharashtra by train and then to Goa by bus. He accompanied them and kept them in Anjuna. He also made them call Naik and crack a false deal to lure him to the site of the crime. Yadav’s brother had taken up a hotel on lease in Anjuna and Yadav, who is unemployed, had taken shelter there. On Friday, the police had arrested the two contract killers from UP. Police confirmed that Gupta had shot Naik. Both are in police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/love-in-the-time-of-covid-1-dead-3-held/articleshow/84567095.cms||Ruvina Khan

If you have the backing of the state government, I have the central government with me… Don’t think that BJP is weak,” he said from a makeshift dais built close to the SP’s office at Nimtouri. His outburst came in the wake of east Midnapore police starting probe into complaints against him, including a tarpaulin theft case in which he has been accused of criminal conspiracy and a murder case involving his security guard in 2018. The murder case is now being investigated by CID. The state government has also moved the Calcutta HC against alleged irregularities at the Contai Cooperative Bank, of which Adhikari is the chairman. Issuing a call against “continuing torture of and slapping of false charges on BJP workers”, Adhikari also announced his intention to file a PIL in HC urging a CBI probe into the false cases. He announced a gathering of 1 lakh people in front of the SP’s office on August 9, in an attempt to build counter-pressure on the state government. In Kolkata, Bengal BJP’s Rahul Sinha was arrested for leading an agitation during pandemic. Party supporters were agitating against fake vaccination camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suvendu-adhikari-warns-cop-dont-do-anything-to-risk-transfer-to-jk/articleshow/84570982.cms||Suman Mandal

We have worked on it and it will be out within the next eight to 10 days. We want to keep an open policy where if a student is talented in writing and if he has contributed to any publication through write ups, he can be allotted marks for it. We will hold exams too, but at the same time students will get marks for these other skills they possess,” Goa Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye said. This will reduce the reliance on formal tests to evaluate students. In 2021, the Class X and the Class XII state board public exams were cancelled due to the pandemic in view of students’ safety. The Goa Board had to devise a policy to evaluate students in this situation. Individual school results committees were formed and the Board provided them with a formula by which to evaluate students by taking into consideration their performance during the previous years and their internal assessment marks. Shetye said that in such circumstances a policy is needed which can evaluate students specifically within a pandemic situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/board-to-ready-evaluation-policy-in-next-10-days/articleshow/84567137.cms||---
