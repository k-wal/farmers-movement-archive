An SGPGI spokesman said the 89-year-old leader showed mild signs of improvement on Monday and a team of experts was monitoring him round the clock. “Since admission, his condition is stable and all his parameters are being monitored intensely by the panel of senior doctors. There is slight improvement in his condition today as compared to yesterday,” SGPGI director Prof RK Dhiman said in a statement. Wishes for his speedy recovery are pouring in from all quarters, Rajveer, a former MP, said. He added that CM Yogi Adityanath was personally keeping tabs on his father’s health. “Yesterday, the CM came to see him and today he called up twice to enquire if any additional support was needed,” Rajveer said. On Sunday, both Yogi and defence minister Rajnath Singh had visited SGPGI to meet the ailing leader. “I am thankful and would request all his followers to continue to pray for him,” Rajveer said. Kalyan Singh, who also served as Rajasthan governor, has been suffering from age related complications for the past few days. He was admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences on Saturday night and shifted to SGPGI ICU on Sunday. The doctors at RMLIMS had diagnosed deranged renal parameters and inflammation. The family confirmed that Singh was shifted to SGPGI after his blood pressure went up to alarming levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-dials-kalyans-son-enquires-about-ex-cm/articleshow/84154242.cms||Shailvee Sharda

While last year AFC cancelled the tournament due to the Covid-19 pandemic and Chennai City missed out on their debut, there could be more bad news for Indian clubs this year. According to sources, AFC is likely to cancel group D (South zone) citing a force majeure situation, which will deal a heavy blow to ATK Mohun Bagan, who are among the direct entries in the group, and Bengaluru FC, who are one step away from qualification. “It was decided (by the AFC executive committee) that the AFC Cup will continue with the remaining matches and groups as much as possible. At the same time, matches across all stages which cannot be played due to matters arising from the Covid-19 pandemic will be cancelled. Such cancellations will be recognised as an event of force majeure,” the AFC said in a statement on Monday. Group D games were originally scheduled to be played at a centralised venue in Maldives in May. However, sports minister Ahmed Mahloof alleged "breach of Covid-19 protocols" by Bengaluru players and revoked permission. Left with no choice, AFC announced postponement of the matches. AFC later rescheduled the group games for August 18-24 and asked teams to submit their bids latest by July 5. Maldives have shown interest to host the tournament again. Sources said India have not offered to host, while Bangladesh extended its strictest lockdown till next week to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. “The tournament will go ahead for sure, but if the organisers cannot find a suitable venue, the group will be cancelled,” a source who has been tracking the development told TOI. “Bangladesh are trying to host the games in Sylhet. We have to see how AFC reacts to the bid. Maldives looks difficult, given what happened in May.” ATK Mohun Bagan have strengthened themselves considerably and told all players that pre-season will start later this month in preparation for the AFC Cup. Finland midfielder Joni Kauko, who featured at Euro 2020, was expected to play a role in the tournament, along with new big-name domestic signings like Amrinder Singh, Ashutosh Mehta and Liston Colaco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/afc-cup-indian-clubs-in-danger-as-group-likely-to-be-cancelled/articleshow/84154745.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||Former Congo PM has immunity lifted over corruption allegations||KINSHASA: Democratic Republic of Congo's former prime minister Matata Ponyo Mapon's parliamentary immunity was lifted on Monday, as the Senate leadership announced it had authorised a criminal investigation into allegations he misappropriated $140 million. Congo's public prosecutor last month accused Matata of ordering payments to people without valid claims to government compensation under a law meant to reimburse foreign businesspeople who had their properties seized in the 1970s. The prosecutor, Jean-Paul Mukolo, said Matata personally benefited from the payments while serving as finance minister in 2011, but Mukolo did not provide evidence of this. Matata, who served as prime minister from 2012-2016, has not responded to requests for comment about the accusations. Senate president Modeste Bahati informed the prosecutor of the Senate leadership's decision in a letter seen by Reuters. The investigation could lead to eventual criminal charges. Last month, the Senate rejected a request by prosecutors to lift Matata's immunity over allegations he misappropriated funds from a failed agriculture project. Matata denied those allegations and said they are part of a smear campaign against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/former-congo-pm-has-immunity-lifted-over-corruption-allegations/articleshow/84153466.cms||---

The government has put more focus on making the PMGKAY more popular among people as a mega welfare scheme to help the poor who have been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. While each of the nearly 81 crore beneficiaries are entitled to get 5 kg of foodgrain every month at highly subsidized rates under NFSA, the similar quantity grain is provided to them till November for free. “We are insisting states to distribute grains allocated under the NFSA and PMGKAY separately,” Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said. Responding to a question from TOI about the rationale behind such insistence, Pandey said the beneficiaries are not misled. He added the entire quantity under NFSA and PMGKAY can be distributed simultaneously by the ration shop owners, but they must complete two separate transactions; one for free grain and another for the grain brought at subsidized rate. So far seven states have distributed about 14,700 tonnes of food grain under the fourth phase of PMGKAY. Pandey said there was a delay as states follow different cycles of distribution of ration. However, the distribution is picking up in Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Jharkhand, he added. On the wheat procurement, the food secretary said the Centre transferred Rs 84,369 crore to the accounts of 49.16 lakh wheat farmers during the current Rabi Marketing Season (RMS), with a maximum Rs 26,000 crore paid to 8.85 lakh farmers in Punjab. Similarly, nearly 7.6 lakh farmers in Haryana have got Rs 16,706 crore in their bank accounts due to direct transfer of the MSP amount. It also said the quantity of paddy procured this year for the Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2020-21 has been 862 lakh tonnes procured surpassing last year’s 771 lakh tonnes. It said the procurement continues and may reach around 900 lakh tonnes. Nearly 1.27 crore paddy farmers have received Rs 1.52 lakh crore of MSP for paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-asks-states-to-distribute-free-foodgrain-separately-to-distinguish-from-nfsa/articleshow/84154606.cms||Dipak K Dash

While one woman fell for the offer of ‘costly gifts’, another lost money while trying to ‘help’ her online friend’s relative. Suma (name changed), 30, from Shantiniketan Layout near Whitefield posted her profile on a matrimonial site on March 24. A person identifying himself as Siddartha Prakash expressed his interest to marry her. Both shared their mobile numbers and were in constant touch. On April 4, Prakash sought Suma’s help claiming his relative had fallen ill in India. She trusted him and transferred Rs 7.7 lakh to a bank account he had shared with her. After that Prakash went incommunicado and Suma realised that she had been cheated. Whitefield CEN Crime police have taken up a case. In the other incident, 31-year-old Rama (name changed) lost Rs 5 lakh while trying to collect a gift sent by a social media friend who identified himself as Jordan Milot. Within a few weeks of them becoming friends, Milot, who claimed to be a pilot with an airline in France, told Rama he had sent her a diamond ring, two i-Phones and $50,000 . She received a call on June 15, and the caller introduced herself as Anita, a customs official at Delhi airport and asked her to pay various fees to claim the gifts sent by Milot.

One of the jawans was injured in the attack. His condition is stated to be out of danger,” a source said, adding that a civilian also suffered injuries in the explosion. Police, CRPF, SOG and Army cordoned off the whole area and launched an intense search operation immediately after the attack to trace the unidentified perpetrators. Doda district in Jammu Zone was declared militancy-free on June 29, 2020, after security forces killed top Hizbul Mujahideen commander Masood alias Rahi in Anantnag in an encounter.

---||Business||Amazon begins new chapter as Bezos hands over CEO role||NEW YORK: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stepped down as CEO on Monday, handing over the reins as the company navigates the challenges of a world fighting to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic. Andy Jassy, who ran Amazon's cloud-computing business, replaced Bezos, a change the company announced in February. Bezos, Amazon's biggest shareholder with a stake worth about $180 billion, will still hold sway over the company he started out of his Seattle garage in 1995. He takes over the role of executive chair, with plans to focus on new products and initiatives. Jassy takes the helm of a $1.7 trillion company that benefited greatly from the pandemic, more than tripling its profits in the first quarter of 2021 and posting record revenue as customers grew ever more dependent on online shopping. At the same time, Amazon faces activism from a restive workforce just as a rapid economic recovery causes a labour crunch that has retailers, manufacturers and other companies competing for workers with higher wages and other benefits. The company defeated an attempt by workers to unionize at an Alabama warehouse earlier this year, but faces a more formidable challenge as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters launches a broader effort to unionize Amazon workers. In a blog post to employees earlier this year, Bezos said he planned to devote more time to side projects, including his space exploration company Blue Origin, his philanthropic initiatives and overseeing The Washington Post, which he owns. First up, the richest man in the world by Forbes' estimate will fulfill his childhood dream of traveling to space. Bezos, 57, will blast into space on July 20 when Blue Origin makes its first flight with a crew, bringing along his younger brother Mark, an investor and volunteer firefighter. Bezos founded Amazon as an online bookstore and built it into a shopping and entertainment empire that is the second-largest private employer in the US, behind Walmart. Amazon, which is buying the MGM movie studio in its latest major acquisition, now makes movies and sofas, owns a grocery chain and has plans to send satellites into space to beam internet service to Earth. Jassy, who has been with Amazon since 1997, ran the cloud-computing business that powers video-streaming site Netflix and many other companies, making it one of Amazon's most profitable businesses. Among Jassy's challenges are growing calls for tighter regulation on tech giants. A report by the House Judiciary Committee in October called for possibly breaking up Amazon and others, making it harder for them to acquire companies and imposing new rules to safeguard competition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/amazon-begins-new-chapter-as-bezos-hands-over-ceo-role/articleshow/84156067.cms||---
---||World||Tropical storm Elsa makes landfall in Cuba, on track to Florida||HAVANA: Tropical storm Elsa made landfall near Cuba's Bay of Pigs on its south-central coast on Monday and started plowing through the island nation, on track to Florida after causing at least three deaths elsewhere in the Caribbean. Cuba's Meteorology Institute said Elsa, which had previously wreaked havoc in parts of Barbados, St. Lucia, Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, was moving northwest at 22 km (14 miles) per hour, and that sustained winds were peaking near 95 mph (59 mph) Storm surges were affecting Cuba's southern coast, while parts of the country experienced strong rain and winds, the institute said. Meteorologists said the rains from Elsa could prove positive for agriculture as long as they were not too intense. Elsa comes as the Caribbean's island nations are already struggling with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their tourism-reliant economies and bracing for another especially active hurricane season. Authorities and locals in some countries had already started work by Monday on repairing damage caused by Elsa such as removing toppled trees and other debris and restoring power. "We continue with maximum attention focused on the track of storm Elsa through Cuba," President Miguel Diaz-Canel tweeted early in the morning. "Authorities are working all over the country." The storm was expected to exit the country overnight just east of Havana between Mayabeque and the city of Matanzas, Cuba's meteorology institute said. More than 100,000 people in Cuba have been evacuated from flood-prone areas or unsafe housing in the potential path of the storm, most going to homes of family and friends, but thousands also to government shelters, state-run media reported. While such preparedness has typically enabled Cuba to avoid the kind of casualties from storms seen elsewhere, it comes amid Cuba's worst coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic, raising fears that evacuations could fuel infections. Farmers sped up harvesting of fruit and vegetables to save them from the storm while local authorities removed debris from streets to prevent them flying around in the wind, and some inhabitants along the coast moved their furniture to higher ground. Rainfall of 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 cm) with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches (38 cm) was forecast across parts of Cuba on Monday and expected to result in "significant flash flooding and mudslides," the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. "The rain has worsened a lot and the winds feel strong," said Kenia Otano, a radio reporter who lives on the coast where Elsa made landfall. A tropical storm watch and storm surge watch were in place for much of the western coast of Florida, the NHC said, with Elsa expected to pass near the Florida Keys early Tuesday and move near or over portions of the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday. The NHC said amounts of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of rain with localized maximum amounts up to 6 inches (15 cm) were expected across Florida and coastal Georgia through Wednesday, which might trigger isolated flash, urban and minor river flooding. A few tornadoes were possible across south Florida on Monday night and across the Florida peninsula on Tuesday, the agency added. "All Floridians should prepare for the possibility of heavy rain, flooding and potential power outages," Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wrote on Twitter. "Now is the time to restock your supplies and review your hurricane plan." The approach of the storm forced Florida officials to demolish the remaining portion of a condo building that collapsed 11 days ago, killing at least 24 people with over 120 still missing. Meteorologists are forecasting an above-normal 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, after a 2020 season that was the most active on record, producing 30 named tropical storms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/tropical-storm-elsa-makes-landfall-in-cuba-on-track-to-florida/articleshow/84156090.cms||---
---||India||Gupkar alliance talks statehood before polls, to reach out to other parties||SRINAGAR: The five-party People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) has decided to engage with other parties in J&K to jointly pitch for restoration of statehood as a precursor to assembly elections, charting the course of what could be a long and rocky road to delimitation of constituencies and restoration of democracy in the Union Territory. In another confusing signal, the alliance announced after a meeting at Srinagar MP Farooq Abdullah's residence late on Sunday that each of the constituents would decide on its own whether to participate in the delimitation exercise. Barring former CM Mehbooba Mufti's PDP, all the other parties in the PAGD — including National Conference — are likely to be a part of the process despite appearing to set a precondition to elections, sources said. PAGD's chief spokesperson and CPM central committee member Yousuf Tarigami expressed dismay over the outcome of the June 24 all-party meet with PM Narendra Modi in New Delhi, although none of the participants apparently broached the topic of restoration of J&K's special status during the dialogue. "As far as restoration of statehood is concerned, it has been BJP's commitment on the floor of Parliament, and they must honour their word. So, any assembly election must be held only after restoration of full statehood for J&K," the alliance said in a formal statement. "To this end, the PAGD has decided to reach out to other political parties with a view to take a common position on the issue." The alliance also reiterated its commitment to fight for reversal of the "unconstitutional and unacceptable" changes foisted on the people of J&K on August 5, 2019. It said the constituents would use all constitutional, legal and political means at their disposal to fulfil this objective. On what exactly went wrong at the dialogue with the PM, Tarigami pointed to "the absence of any substantial confidence-building measures such as releasing political and other prisoners from jails and taking concrete steps to end the siege and atmosphere of suppression that has choked J&K since 2019". "This (release of detainees) would have initiated the much-needed process of reaching out to the people of J&K, who are the biggest stakeholders and sufferers," he said. PAGD's decision to allow its constituents to individually take a call on the delimitation exercise comes close on the heels of the National Conference brass holding multiple meetings over the weekend to decide what to do. Party insiders said there was a consensus among the top rung on joining the delimitation process, which will be conducted on the basis of the 2011 census. Headed by retired Supreme Court judge Ranjana Desai, the Delimitation Commission has several members representing various parties, including Farooq and NC MPs Masood Husinan and Akbar Lone. The commission and the additional electoral officer have invited all parties on July 6 to simultaneous meetings in Srinagar and Jammu on increasing assembly and parliamentary seats in accordance with the 2011 census. The commission will separately meet members of social organisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gupkar-alliance-talks-statehood-before-polls-to-reach-out-to-other-parties/articleshow/84156834.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Monsoon lull slows down sowing of kharif crops||BENGALURU: Monsoon, which began on a brisk note after setting in on time in June first week, has slowed down over the past 10 days, affecting sowing activities across Karnataka and leaving farmers worried. The state had witnessed copious rain in the first half of June. But it received just 17 mm of rainfall as against the normal of 59 mm between June 29 and July 5, according to data released by Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre. Rain deficit is over 80 per cent in Malnad and coastal regions during the period. While Malnad districts received just 15mm of rainfall as against the normal of 138mm, coastal areas recorded only 45mm as opposed to the normal of 272 mm. The lull in the monsoon has impacted sowing of kharif crops. Farmers in Kalyana-Karnataka and Old Mysuru region are desperately waiting for a good spell of rain to take up the activity. According to sources in the agriculture department, sowing has taken place in over 37.5 lakh hectares of land as against the targeted 77 lakh hectares as on July 1. “By this time, the exercise would have been completed in over 40 lakh hectares as June is the peak month for sowing in most districts of North Karnataka,” said a senior officer. Farmers who have already completed sowing fear the lull in monsoon will affect growth of crops. “We need one good spell of rain to sustain. Crops like jowar, soyabean and groundnut can survive for some time, but vegetables like carrot, garlic, beans and green chilli need immediate rain,” said Basavaraj, a farmer from Hunasikatti village in Belagavi district. Brijesh Kumar Dixit, commissioner, agriculture department, says it’s too early to come to a conclusion about the impact of monsoon slowdown. “No doubt the slow progress has impacted sowing activities. But the pace of sowing is still fast when compared to last year. As far as crops are concerned, soil still has residual moisture, which can help them survive. We can assess the real impact only after another one or two weeks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/monsoon-lull-slows-down-sowing-of-kharif-crops/articleshow/84157426.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HD Kumaraswamy and Sumalatha Ambareesh spar over Krishna Raja Sagar dam safety, Mysore Sugar factory||BENGALURU: Former chief minister and JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy on Monday courted controversy when he exhorted independent MP from Mandya, Sumalatha Ambareesh, to “sleep in front of the sluice gates of Krishna Raja Sagar (KRS) reservoir in the district to prevent seepage”. Kumaraswamy’s comments came soon after he led a delegation of MLAs to chief minister BS Yediyurappa to impress upon him that the state-owned “MySugar” (Mysore Sugar) factory in Mandya should not be leased out to private industrial units. There were reports that it may be leased for 40 years to a sugar factory baron in Yediyurappa’s cabinet. “If the gates are leaking, make her (Sumalatha) sleep in front of the sluice gates to prevent seepage,” the former CM told reporters in response to her concern over leakage at the KRS reservoir owing to mining activities in its vicinity. “Mandya never had an MP like her, nor will it get one like her in future. She has been elected on sympathy. Let her work properly as she will not get another opportunity,” Kumaraswamy added. It may be recalled that Sumalatha had defeated Nikhil Kumaraswamy, son of Kumaraswamy, by nearly 1.3 lakh votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. During the election campaign, several JD(S) MLAs, including Kumaraswamy himself, had indulged in personal attacks against Sumalatha, the wife of late actor-turned-politician MH Ambareesh. Hitting back at Kumaraswamy, Sumalatha said this shows his culture and personality. “Leave aside that I’m an MP... Making personal attacks against a woman, what kind of culture is this? You were a former CM; don’t you have control over your language? Don’t you have basic knowledge about how to speak in public?” she retorted. Sumalatha said she had raised the issue during a discussion on the Dam Safety Bill in parliament over threat to KRS dam due to illegal mining activities in its vicinity. “It is an open secret in Mandya on who is involved in illegal mining,” the MP said said, adding: “I am not opposed to mining, but opposed to illegal mining.” On Mysore Sugar factory, Kumarswamy earlier said the factory built during the times of maharajas of Mysuru and Sir M Visvesvaraya has a history and it is everyone’s wish that it be under government control. “The chief minister has assured me that he will not allow the factory to go into private hands,” Kumaraswamy said. Later in the day, Sumalatha met the CM and requested him to reopen the factory and bear the additional transport cost incurred by sugarcane farmers. Rejecting Kumarswamy’s charges that she was pushing for handing over of the factory to private industries, the first-time MP later said: “I had only requested the CM to reopen the factory; I don’t mind under what model.” Sources said this renewed rivalry between Kumaraswamy and Sumalatha is a direct fallout of the closure of illegal mines in the vicinity of KRS dam. After Sumalatha personally took mines minister Murugesh Nirani to Baby Betta in Mandya to apprise him of illegal mining activity, the government conducted a detailed inquiry and levied a fine of Rs 100 crore on a company allegedly run by a senior JD(S) functionary. In Tumakuru, Nirani reaffirmed the actions taken by the mines department around KRS dam and said all mining activities have been shut down within a 10-km radius of the dam and Baby Betta. He said there is no leakage of any sort at KRS dam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hdk-and-sumalatha-spar-over-krs-dam-safety-mysore-sugar-factory/articleshow/84157489.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Rajiv Gandhi Housing Corporation uses geotags to monitor building of 10 lakh houses||BENGALURU: Housing projects often suffer due to weak monitoring systems. The challenge is even bigger when it’s about keeping track of constructing 10 lakh houses. To address this issue, Rajiv Gandhi Housing Corporation (RGHC), a nodal agency for construction of affordable houses, has come up with a mobile application and control room to monitor all its construction activities. “We can monitor our projects on a real-time basis using a simple mobile technology — geographical tagging (geotagging) using photographs and videos of houses under construction,” said housing department secretary Manoj Kumar Meena. RGHC is presently monitoring as many as 10 lakh housing constructions across 27,000 villages and 279 urban local bodies. The Centre has taken a cue and implemented a similar system across the country. The geotagging method has also been listed as one of 20 best practices across government departments by the state’s planning and statistics department to motivate others to use technology. How it worksUnder this system, every construction site is geotagged before work begins. Next, the local panchayat development officer inspects it for physical verification and uploads pictures real-time on the Indira mane mobile application. This is done at every stage of construction so that beneficiaries can claim subsidy. “Without geo-tagged pictures, neither the state, nor the Centre releases the subsidy amount,” said RGHCL managing director S Basavaraju. On average, the application allows uploading of 7,000-10,000 pictures every day. The final disbursal of the subsidy is done through direct benefit transfer (DBT), which is linked to Aadhaar. Call centre takes plaintsThe housing department launched a call centre called Spandana, wherein it receives close to 2,000 requests every day for registering various complaints, including delay in release of funds. The state government in its overall audit of the scheme has found that the system has led to 50,000-70,000 beneficiaries having received their subsidy amount weekly through direct bank transfer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/corpn-uses-geotags-to-monitor-building-of-10-lakh-houses/articleshow/84157496.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

Engineering as a subject has become more interdisciplinary over the years, said professor S Sadagopoan, former director of IIIT-Bangalore. “Electric vehicles are a buzzword today but the person most needed for it might be a software engineer, while previously, automobiles was the domain of a mechanical engineer. The divisions have now blurred. There are new programmes on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and things are getting interdisciplinary. So keep your eyes open but do not tag yourself. What you learn in college will not be enough in your long career, so you should be learning to learn,” he said. Sriram Devanathan, principal of Amrita School of Engineering in Bengaluru, said students should be allowed to explore even if they take a couple of years extra, and find the areas of their interest. “The moment you place enormous pressure on them that there are only two viable professions, engineering and medicine, it becomes very stressful. That thinking has sunk in so much among parents and students. In order to have flexibility, this mindset has to change in line with the new education policy,” he said. Venkatraman Umakanth, head — market development & learner success, FutureSkills at Nasscom, said IT has become a horizontal discipline – spread across industries. While previously, recruiters were looking for domain skills, technology and soft skills, in the post-pandemic world, the mix of all three has become important. “If you’re in any other branch of engineering, you can switch to IT. If you have the domain skills, you will be taught IT skills as well. It is going to be an added advantage. In the last one and a half years, one of the words commonly heard is resilience. You can’t be taught this with a crash course. It comes over a period of time. One of the core things that’s close to my heart is embracing failures, and as a culture, we don’t embrace failure,” Umakanth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/critical-thinking-re-learning-fast-key-to-engg/articleshow/84157586.cms||---

Three more victims were discovered in the new pile, Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah told family members, raising the death toll to 27 people. Another 118 people remain unaccounted for. The demolition late Sunday was crucial to the search-and-rescue effort, officials said, and raised the prospect that crews could increase both the pace of their work and the number of searchers at the site, although the chance of finding survivors 12 days after the June 24 collapse has diminished. “We know that with every day that goes by, it is harder to see a miracle happening,” said Maggie Castro, a firefighter and paramedic with the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue who briefs families daily. Teams had been unable to access areas closest to the remaining structure because of its instability, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said. “Truly we could not continue without bringing this building down,” she said at a news conference. Part of the existing debris pile was also helping to support the remaining structure, City of Miami Fire Rescue Captain Ignatius Carroll said, rescuers were still holding out hope of reuniting loved ones. “We continue to remain focused on our primary mission, and that is to leave no stone unturned and to find as many people as we can and to help bring either some answers to family and loved ones or to bring some closure to them,” Carroll said. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the newly accessible area includes master bedrooms where people were believed to be sleeping when the building collapsed. “We will be able to access every part of that pile, which they hadn't been able to do up to this point,” DeSantis said. “I think it's going to move the pace. I think the momentum is very strong.” Crews could be seen climbing a mound of debris at the site Monday alongside a piece of heavy equipment that was picking up rubble. Workers immediately began clearing some of the new debris after the demolition so rescuers could start making their way into parts of the underground garage that is of particular interest. Officials said the search effort resumed around midnight. It had been called off Saturday to allow specialists to drill holes for explosives needed for the demolition. “As a result of the contractor who brought it down, he did it in such a way that literally we actually were back on the original pile in less than 20 minutes,” Jadallah told family members of those missing, drawing applause in a rare upbeat moment for the twice-daily meetings. Rescuers hoped to get a clearer picture of voids that may exist in the rubble as they search for those believed to be trapped under the fallen wing of the Champlain Towers South. No one has been rescued alive since the first hours after the collapse. During the demolition, a loud rat-a-tat of explosions echoed from the structure. Then the building began to fall, one floor after another, cascading into an explosion of dust. Plumes billowed into the air as crowds watched the scene from afar. Levine Cava told the Associated Press that the demolition went “exactly as planned.” “It was picture-perfect. Exactly what we were told would happen,” she said in an interview. Some residents had pleaded to return to their homes one last time before the demolition to retrieve belongings, but they were denied. Others wondered about the pets left behind. Officials said they found no signs of animals after making three final sweeps, including the use of drones to peer into the abandoned structure. Levine Cava said teams are working to save personal items and have asked residents to catalog what they're missing to match with items as soon as they are recovered. “The world is mourning for those who lost their loved ones and for those who are waiting for news from the collapse,” she said at the news conference. “To lose your home and all your belongings in this manner is a great loss as well.” The decision to demolish the remnants of the building came after concerns mounted that the damaged structure was at risk of falling, endangering the crews below. Parts of the remaining building shifted on Thursday, prompting a 15-hour suspension in the work. Approaching Tropical Storm Elsa added urgency to the demolition plans. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in Florida because of the storm, making federal aid possible. The latest forecasts showed the storm moving westward, mostly sparing South Florida, but the area could still experience heavy rains and winds. Jadallah said that weather was not expected to affect the search efforts. “Now that we don't have an issue with the building, the only time that we're stopping is lightning,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/condo-demolition-opens-up-fresh-rubble-in-collapse-search/articleshow/84157977.cms||---

According to Global Times, the leaders of France and Germany expressed their support behind an EU-China investment agreement, which European Parliament voted to freeze the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in May. They agreed to continue to work together on issues such as climate change, the Covid-19 pandemic, and international trade. This came at an increasingly tense moment for EU-China ties, with growing concerns about human rights violations in China, particularly the persecution of the Uyghur minority in the province of Xinjiang. Earlier in March, the EU imposed sanctions on China marking the EU's first punitive measures on Beijing since it imposed an arms embargo after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. In retaliation to the sanctions, China also introduced sanctions against 10 European Union officials and four European organisations after accusing them of spreading lies and false information about the Xinjiang region. There is a growing concern in Europe over China's human rights record on issues, including alleged forced labour camps and a crackdown in Hong Kong against anti-government protestors. Xinjiang is a province in Communist China where an estimated two million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have been detained since 2016. They are believed to have been placed in detention centres across Xinjiang. Many former detainees allege they were subjected to attempted indoctrination, physical abuse and even sterilisation. However, China regularly denies such mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/xi-jinping-holds-video-conference-with-french-german-leaders-amid-strained-ties-with-eu/articleshow/84157134.cms||---
---||World||Canada, US are easing pandemic border-crossing restrictions||TORONTO: Pandemic restrictions on travel between Canada and the US began to loosen Monday for some Canadians, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said plans to totally reopen the border would be announced over the next few weeks. Canadian citizens and permanent residents who have had a full dose of a coronavirus vaccine approved for use in Canada can skip a 14-day quarantine that has been a requirement since March 2020. Eligible air travelers also no longer have to spend their first three days in the country at a government-approved hotel. Restrictions barring all non-essential trips between Canada and the United States, including tourism, will remain in place until at least July 21. Trudeau said the easing of the rules marks a big step toward re-opening the border. "We're very hopeful that we're going to see new steps on reopening announced in the coming weeks," he said at a news conference in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. "We're going to make sure that we're not seeing a resurgence of Covid-19 cases because nobody wants to go back to further restrictions, after having done so much and sacrificed so much to get to this point." Julia Dunn, who landed at Toronto's Pearson International Airport from the United States while on her way to Halifax, said she was glad the restrictions had eased. "It's very freeing being able to get home to family without having to spend those two weeks alone? she said. Dunn, who is originally from Cape Breton but now lives in Houston, said she booked her trip to Canada after learning about the planned easing of quarantine rules a few weeks ago. Trudeau said he understands how eager people are to see the border reopen but noted that the pandemic continues and "things aren't normal yet? "Nobody wants us to move too fast and have to reimpose restrictions as case numbers rise like we're seeing elsewhere in the world? he said. "We need to do this right."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/canada-us-are-easing-pandemic-border-crossing-restrictions/articleshow/84158408.cms||---
---||World||Russian food retailer apologises for advertisement that included lesbians||MOSCOW: A high-end Russian food retailer has angered both gay rights campaigners and opponents by running and then apologising for an ad that included a profile of a family in which a mother and her adult daughter both have female partners. A 2013 Russian law, decried by Western countries as state-enforced bigotry, bans the “promotion of non-traditional sexual relations to minors”. Many politicians from the ruling party are stridently anti-gay. The advert for Vkusvill, a chain of more than 1,250 food shops, pictured four women from the family in a kitchen, and said they liked the shop's Japanese rice balls with mushrooms and its humus. It initially appeared with an “18+” warning indicating it should not be read by children. Vkusvill initially defended the advert, saying, “We think it would be hypocritical not to talk about the real families of our customers. We advise you to weigh up all pros and cons before reading this report.” But on Sunday, after threats of a boycott, it deleted it from its website and issued what it called an apology to customers, employees, partners and suppliers on behalf of senior management. “We regret that this happened and consider this publication to be a mistake, which became a display of unprofessionalism from certain employees,” the statement said. More than 35,000 people commented on the company's Instagram feed, some of them angry at the decision to run the advert in the first place, others angry at the move to pull it. “We are not a mistake,” wrote user @russiaforgays, calling the decision to take down the ad “cowardly”. Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of state news network RT, tweeted that the reversal had pleased nobody. “The audience of traditionalists like myself have been lost, and now the very audience they were flirting with has been severely disappointed,” she wrote on Telegram on Sunday. Vkusvill said in 2019 it was considering floating its shares on the stock market in New York. It has since opened its first shops abroad in the Netherlands and says it aims to expand beyond Russia. It declined to comment on Monday on whether the incident would affect its expansion plans or its valuation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/russian-food-retailer-apologises-for-advertisement-that-included-lesbians/articleshow/84159251.cms||---
---||India||Deaths up in city, birth certificates issued fall sharply||NEW DELHI: Ironically, while the number of deaths in Delhi shot up due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a sharp decline in birth registrations has been registered in the first six months of this year, at least on the basis of death and birth certificates issued. Between January and June, only 1.1 lakh birth certificates were issued, 30,000 fewer than in the same period in 2020 and almost 70,000 less than in 2019, according to data from the public health departments of the three municipal corporations. Experts surmise that the drop in birth registrations may be due to an increase in home births due to the pandemic, delay in planned pregnancies due to adverse social and healthcare conditions, travel restrictions and large-scale migration of informal sector workers out of Delhi. Birth registration data for the first six months of 2021 shows that 22,936 births were registered in East Delhi Municipal Corporation, 46,102 in the north corporation and 42,604 registrations in SDMC. In case of east Delhi, the drop in birth registrations has been 38% of the pre-pandemic levels. EDMC had registered 38,218 births in January-June in 2018 and 37,081 births in 2019, with the periodic figures falling after that to 32,647 in 2020 and 22,936 in 2021. The birth rate during the period from 2001 to 2019 has hovered between 18 and 22 births per 1,000 population. Delhi government’s annual report on birth and death registration states that 3.6 lakh birth registrations took place in 2019, 3.6 lakh in 2018 and 3.7 lakh in 2017. Delhi has historically had a very high percentage of institutional deliveries, that is birth in hospitals, nursing homes and mother and child welfare centres. In 2019, for instance, out of 3.6 lakh registered births, more than 91% took place in an institutional set up. TOI had reported in February how the pandemic had reversed the decadal trend of consistent increase in institutional deliveries in the city. A municipal official reasoned that the increase in home delivery of babies due to hospitals being closed for general procedures in the pandemic period could also be a reason behind the drop in birth registrations in Delhi. Delhi has a robust civil registration system in which 100% of births are normally registered. "Many children who were born at home instead of in a hospital may still not have been registered yet," the official said. "Most of the major hospitals were overburdened by Covid cases and people probably opted not to take the expecting mother to hospital in cases where there were no medical complications. Additionally, the large-scale migration from the city of unorganised sector workers could also have contributed to the downward trend." Dr Shivani Sachdev, general secretary, Indian Society of Assisted Reproduction, said that this might be a temporary fall in births with many couples postponing their planned pregnancies. "Everyone was in distress and potential parents said they were putting off immediate plans of starting families," said Sachdev. "Pregnant women need family support and all plans would have been affected by the travel restrictions and paucity of medical facilities. Now, couples have once again started coming for consultations in big numbers."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deaths-up-in-city-birth-certificates-issued-fall-sharply/articleshow/84157521.cms||Paras Singh
---||India||Let unruly legislators in House face action: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: In a test case to hold unruly legislators accountable, the Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine the liability of people’s representatives under the Prevention of Destruction of Public Properties Act while detesting rising incidents of indiscipline by protesting MLAs and MPs who break mikes and furnitures on the floor of the House. The secretary of Kerala assembly had sent a complaint to police after Vaikom CPI MLA K Ajith threw a mike and broke furniture in the House on March 13, 2015, to protest presentation of budget by the then finance minister of the Oommen Chandy government. The secretary quantified the cost of the damage at Rs 2.20 lakh. The police lodged an FIR under the Prevention of Destruction of Public Property Act. In 2018, the trial court rejected the Pinarayi Vijayan government’s plea to withdraw the case. On appeal, the Kerala HC upheld the trial court’s decision. When the Kerala government’s appeal arguing that “no case is made out against Ajith” was taken up by the SC, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said, “If the MLAs throw mike and destroy public property, let them face trial under the law. What message are you sending to the public whom you represent? If they are not held accountable for their unruly and violent acts, there will be no deterrence to this kind of behaviour.” Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar said it was a matter for the House to decide and that the courts are barred from interfering in the matter, which could be dealt by the Speaker, who he said had not sanctioned lodging of the FIR against Ajith. He said withdrawal of prosecution against the MLA was in public interest, which is a legally available ground to the public prosecutor for withdrawal of a case, after he independently applied his mind to it. Kumar said it was a political protest as the MLA had a right to protest inside the House without being subjected to persecution being protected under Article 194(2) of the Constitution. He said the MLAs were protesting against the presentation of the budget by a “corrupt” finance minister. “The domain of the legislature must be protected,” he said. But, Justices Chandrchud and Shah, while adjourning the hearing of the case to July 15, said, “What is the larger public interest the public prosecutor felt when the case related to obstruction of presentation of the finance bill, which is of utmost importance. Some modicum of decorum must be maintained in the temple of democracy. Such incidents are on the rise in the Assemblies and even witnessed inside Parliament.” The Kerala government’s appeal stated that on March 13, 2015, “at about 8.55 am, while the finance minister of the state was presenting the budget for the financial year 2015-2016 in the Kerala legislative assembly hall, the accused, who, at that time were opposition MLAs, disrupted the budget presentation, climbed over to the Speaker’s dais, damaged articles like the Speaker’s chair, computer, mike, emergency lamp etc. and thereby caused a loss of Rs.2,20,093 to the government.” The assistant public prosecutor, Ernakulam, filed an application under section 321 of the criminal procedure code on July 21, 2018 seeking to withdraw the case against all accused persons and told the trial court that it was a bonafide request in the interest of justice. The Thiruvananthapuram chief judicial magistrate rejected the application on September 22, 2019 and said the application was filed “without good faith and on external influence”. The Kerala government’s appeal was dismissed by the HC on March 12 this year. The HC had said, “Interestingly, Clause 44 in the ‘Code of Conduct for the Members of the Kerala Legislative Assembly’ exhorts the members to keep the fundamental duties listed in Part IV-A of the Constitution uppermost in their minds. One among the fundamental duties, as postulated by Article 51A (I), is to safeguard public property and to abjure violence.” In its appeal against the HC decision in the SC, the Pinarayi Vijayan government asked, “When the alleged offences under Section 447 and 427 of IPC and Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act happened in connection with an incident on the floor of the Legislative Assembly during the budget session of the legislature while making a protest by opposition MLA against the budget presentation by the then finance minister due to the then prevailing political reason, is it proper to dismiss an application filed by the prosecutor under Section 321 by the Court on the ground that the application submitted by the public prosecutor was not in good faith and not supported by any cogent reason?” “When the alleged incident had occurred while the assembly was in session and no crime could have been registered without previous sanction of the Speaker, the FIR registered by the Secretary of the Legislative Assembly without the consent of the Speaker is wrong and therefore the application filed under Section 321 is liable to be allowed,” it pleaded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/let-unruly-legislators-in-house-face-action-supreme-court/articleshow/84159403.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||World||Blue Jackets G Matiss Kivlenieks dies from fireworks blast||COLUMBUS: Blue Jackets goaltender Matiss Kivlenieks died Sunday night of chest trauma, not a head injury from a fall, caused by a fireworks mortar blast. He was 24. The Oakland County Medical Examiner's office reported preliminary results Monday after an autopsy. Police in Novi, Mich., now say the mortar-style device began to tilt and fire at a group of people at a Fourth of July party. Kivlenieks was in a hot tub and among those trying to exit the tub to get out of the way, police Lt. Jason Meier said. Investigators are calling his death accidental. The Detroit News said he was taken to Ascension Providence Hospital in Novi, where he was pronounced dead. "We are shocked and saddened by the loss of Matiss Kivlenieks, and we extend our deepest sympathies to his mother, Astrida, his family and friends during this devastating time," John Davidson, president of hockey operations, said in a team statement. "Kivi was an outstanding young man who greeted every day and everyone with a smile and the impact he had during his four years with our organization will not be forgotten." Police originally said the Latvian died from a head injury while hurriedly trying to get out of the hot tub amid a fireworks malfunction. Police deemed it a "tragic accident," saying Kivlenieks fell and hit his head on the concrete. An undrafted free agent from Riga, Latvia, Kivlenieks signed with the Blue Jackets in May 2017 and spent most of his time with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. With the Blue Jackets, he played in two games in 2020-21 and six (four starts) in the prior season and had a career record of 2-2-2 with a 3.09 goals-against average and .899 save percentage. He made his NHL debut on the road against the New York Rangers on Jan. 19, 2020, getting the win in the 2-1 game after saving 31 of 32 shots. He played for Team Latvia in the 2021 IIHF World Championships this spring and was 1-2 with a 2.18 GAA, .922 save percentage and one shutout in four games. "One thing I loved and appreciated about him was he had a great smile and always was in a good mood," Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno told ESPN. "I know it's cliche, but that's exactly the kind of guy he was. Just enjoying his life as a 24-year-old living out his dream and you could tell he didn't take one day for granted, which makes this tragedy even more hard to bear, Praying for his family and all of us who knew him. Hard day for a lot of people in that organization."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/blue-jackets-g-matiss-kivlenieks-dies-from-fireworks-blast/articleshow/84159344.cms||---
---||World||Saudi Arabia to invest over $133 billion in transport sector, minister says||DUBAI: Saudi Arabia will invest over 500 billion riyals ($133.34 billion) in airports, sea ports, rail and other infrastructure by the end of the decade in a bid to make the kingdom a global transportation and logistics hub, its transport minister said on Monday.  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is pushing economic diversification to wean Saudi Arabia off oil revenues and create jobs, announced a transport and logistics drive, of which few details have been released publicly, last Tuesday. Minister of Transport and Logistic Services Saleh bin Nasser al-Jasser said at an event in Saudi Arabia that the strategy included many mega projects, with over 500 billion riyals earmarked for investment. The strategy is the latest economic policy to put Riyadh in competition with the United Arab Emirates, the region's business, trade and tourism hub. Saudi Arabia plans to increase the number of international aviation routes from 99 to over 250 and more than triple total annual passenger traffic from 109 million in 2019 to 330 million by 2030, Abdulaziz Al-Duauilj, the head of the aviation authority, said at the same event. The kingdom's international network is currently significantly smaller than that of neighbouring smaller states the UAE or Qatar, which are both large air transit hubs. Al-Duauilj said annual capacity at Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport and Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport would each expand to 100 million passengers, without saying by when. He also said the kingdom was aiming to become a global air freight logistics hub, handling 4.5 million tonnes of air cargo a year, up from 900,000 in 2019. Saudi Arabia earlier announced a new national carrier would be launched as part of the strategy, which aims to make the kingdom the fifth biggest global air passenger transit hub. Sources familiar with the plans have told Reuters the new airline would target international transit traffic, pitting it directly against Gulf giants Emirates and Qatar Airways. Saudi Arabia's other airlines, like state-owned Saudia and its low cost subsidiary flyadeal, mostly operate domestic services and point-to-point flights to and from the country of 35 million people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-to-invest-over-133-bln-in-transport-sector-minister-says/articleshow/84159172.cms||---
---||World||OPEC oil alliance at impasse between Saudi Arabia and UAE||DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: Talks among members of the OPEC cartel and allied oil producing countries broke off Monday in the midst of a standoff with the United Arab Emirates over production levels. No new date was set for resuming talks, leaving oil markets in a state of at least temporary uncertainty about future supply as demand for fuel continues to recover from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.In an unusual public confrontation with leading cartel member Saudi Arabia, the UAE on Sunday pushed back against the OPEC Plus group, which includes non-OPEC producers like Russia. The UAE said it supported a proposed gradual increase in production favored by Saudi Arabia, the group's largest producer, and by non-member Russia. But the UAE said it also wanted an increase in its own permitted level of production.Despite the public clash, oil markets traded only modestly higher Monday. Crude oil rose 1.5% to $76.32 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while international Brent crude rose 1.3% to $77.20 per barrel.There are concerns that if an agreement cannot be reached, the alliance could break apart, potentially triggering a price war and swings in global oil prices at a time of uncertainty over future demand for oil due to continued lockdowns in parts of the world and the uneven distribution of vaccines worldwide.Last year's abrupt halt to travel and widespread lockdowns reduced global demand for oil, driving down energy prices as unused barrels of oil quickly filled up storage sites. The OPEC Plus group agreed to a steep cut of some 9 million barrels per day to keep prices from collapsing further. Saudi Arabia went even further, voluntarily cutting even more of its own production to keep prices from falling. In June, the kingdom produced just less than 9 million barrels per day, compared to more than 10 million barrels a day before the pandemic.As economies began rebounding and vaccine distribution picked up steam, the OPEC Plus group increased production so that daily cuts averaged around 6 million barrels per day. Currently, the OPEC Plus alliance is producing some 37 million barrels per day compared to around 43 million barrels per day in April of last year, at the start of the pandemic.OPEC Plus has been meeting monthly to decide on adding more production. Yet two days of online talks last week did not produce an agreement. Talks were scheduled to resume Monday, but hours later came an announcement that the session had been called off.Over the weekend the UAE's Energy Minister, Suhail al-Mazrouei, spoke to multiple media outlets about his country's concerns.On Sunday, the UAE Energy Ministry issued a rare statement, saying that it wants a higher baseline production level of its own that reflects the UAE's actual production capacity rather than what it said is an outdated reference.The UAE is currently producing around 2.7 million barrels per day under the OPEC Plus agreement, though it averaged around 3 million a day between January 2019 and March 2020, according to Refinitiv, a financial market data provider. Analysts suggest the country can easily produce up to 4 million a day.Per Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at Rystad Energy research and consultancy firm, said for the UAE to get what it wants, Saudi Arabia may need to make further cuts to its output.“If the UAE were to have a higher quota going forward, it would only be Saudi Arabia that can reduce production on their side,” he said, explaining that the kingdom has done voluntary cuts before and could be willing to concede in order to keep OPEC together.Still, that could be a hard sell because both countries are in need of oil revenue to buoy their economies, which have been rocked by the pandemic and lower oil prices.There are political differences between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, as well, to consider.Saudi Arabia and the UAE were closely aligned in past years, mirroring the budding relationship that had developed between Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. So close were the two de-facto leaders that the two countries launched into a war in Yemen and cut ties with neighboring Qatar together. In late 2017, the two nations announced a new partnership to coordinate in all military, political, economic, trade and cultural fields.But in recent years, national interests have diverged. The UAE dramatically downsized its footprint in the Saudi-led coalition battling Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. The Saudis moved to rapidly restore diplomatic ties with Qatar earlier this year, but the UAE has yet to restore full diplomatic relations and continues to block Qatar-based news sites like Al Jazeera.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia on Sunday suspended all flights to and from the UAE, lumping it with Ethiopia, Vietnam and Afghanistan as coronavirus risks. The kingdom has expressed concern over the fast-spreading delta variant, which has appeared in the United Arab Emirates.In recent days, the kingdom changed its law for goods imported from Gulf Arab countries to exclude from a preferential tariff agreement imported goods produced by any Israeli-owned companies, as well as goods with any components produced in Israel. Such products have proliferated in the UAE following the country's normalization of ties with Israel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/opec-oil-alliance-at-impasse-between-saudi-arabia-and-uae/articleshow/84159426.cms||---
---||India||‘Terrible, shocking’ that Sec 66A still used to arrest people: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said it was “terrible and distressing” that nationwide application of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act to arrest persons for social media posts was still continuing, six years after the court had erased it from the statute book for being violative of right to free speech guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution. Appearing for People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), senior advocate Sanjay Parikh informed a bench of Justices R F Nariman, K M Joseph and B R Gavai that in utter disregard to the law declared void, overzealous police across the states have booked many people under Section 66A after it was quashed. Not only that, abuse of the provision has continued even after the apex court in 2019, responding to a PUCL petition, asked the chief secretaries to sensitise police against using the section. Taking up the petition, the bench led by Justice Nariman, who had authored the March 24, 2015 judgment in Shreya Singhal case striking down Section 66A, said, “Amazing is all that I can say. What is going on is terrible and distressing. How could the provision be invoked by police even six years after the Supreme Court had struck it down?” Parikh said that it is shocking that more cases under Section 66A have been registered post-2015 judgment. He said Maharashtra, which had registered 349 cases prior to the judgment, registered 381 more FIRs invoking Section 66A. Uttar Pradesh had registered just 22 cases before 2015, but its police went on to file 245 more cases after the judgment. Jharkhand had just 43 FIRs prior to the judgments, but went on to register 291 FIRs after March 2015. Rajasthan had 75 cases, but went on to register 192 more FIRs post-judgment. "Shocking is the right word to use," Justice Nariman said and asked the Union government to file a response to the PUCL plea, which requested the court to direct the Centre to collect data about all cases registered by police and pending trial under Section 66A ,and send a communication to all trial courts and DGPs to close the cases/stop using the struck down provision. "We will do something," Justice Nariman assured the petitioner before turning to attorney general K K Venugopal for a preliminary explanation to the "shocking" disregard by the police of the Supreme Court's judgment, which under Article 142 of the Constitution has the force of law throughout India. Venugopal offered a plausible explanation: "All post-judgment publications of the Information Technology Act contained section 66A with a footnote in small font that it had been struck down by the Supreme Court. Seldom a policeman reads the footnote. That is probably why this struck down section continued to be invoked." The SC asked the Centre to file its response in two weeks. PUCL said it had to rely on a private website statistics on the misuse of Section 66A even after it was struck down as the government websites do not collate any information on this issue. "Cases which are registered only under Section 66A, which ought to have been closed after the judgment, are still continuing... Trial courts have passed orders framing charges under Section 66A despite the provision having been struck down. Not only has this happened in cases where allegations under Section 66A are raised alongside other offences, but disturbingly the research reveals charges framed solely for an offence under Section 66A," it claimed. In Shreya Singhal judgment, the SC had struck down Section 66A of I-T Act and Section 118(d) of Kerala Police Act, both being similar in nature. It had held that "Section 66A creates an offence which is vague and overbroad, and, therefore, unconstitutional under Article 19(1)(a)... We have also held that the wider range of circulation over the internet cannot restrict the content of the right under Article 19(1)(a) nor can it justify its denial. What has been said about Section 66A would apply directly to Section 118(d) of the Kerala Police Act." However, it upheld the constitutional validity of Section 69A of I-T Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terrible-shocking-that-sec-66a-still-used-to-arrest-people-supreme-court/articleshow/84159436.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||PM Modi: India to make CoWin available to all countries||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi announced Monday that India's CO-WIN platform for Covid vaccination is being made open source - available to any and every country - for health interventions across the world. The Prime Minister made the announcement while addressing a Co-WIN Global conclave that, according to official sources, saw participation from over 140 countries. The tech backbone of India's vaccination programme, the platform is seen to have delivered in tracking first and second doses, scheduling appointments, registering beneficiaries and issuing vaccination certificates that can be linked to passports. Speaking on the spread of the pandemic, Modi said there is no parallel to Covid-19 in a 100 years and that experience had shown that no nation, however powerful, can solve a challenge like this in isolation. According to government sources, the conclave was organised to share the "success story" of Co-WIN digital platform. "India has offered the platform, which can be adapted and scaled up for health interventions across the world, to partner countries as a global public good," said a source, adding representatives from European Commission and UN Offices also participated. "Right from the beginning of the pandemic, India has been committed to sharing all our experiences, expertise and resources with the global community in this battle," said Modi in his address. Asserting that vaccination is the best hope for humanity to emerge successfully from the pandemic, Modi said right from the beginning, "we in India decided to adopt a completely digital approach while planning our vaccination strategy". "This is the platform through which India has administered 350 million doses of Covid vaccines. A few days ago, we vaccinated about 9 million people in one day. They do not need to carry around fragile pieces of paper to prove anything. It is all available in digital format. But best of all, the software can be customised to any country as per their local requirements," said Modi. Ministers from five countries – Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Afghanistan and Guyana - participated in the conclave. They said apparently that this initiative could be useful for addressing health related challenges in their own countries and expressed interest in collaborating with India to utilise the Co-WIN platform. "Several countries showed interest in adoption of Co-WIN platform. Ministry of External Affairs will work with the National Health Authority for enabling adaptation and adoption of the platform by these interested countries. Interest has already been shown by Vietnam, Lao PDR, Cyprus, Croatia, Sierra Leone, Zambia, Maldives, Malawi and Guyana," said a source, adding the platform is also being offered to WHO’s Covid Technology Access Pool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-india-to-make-cowin-available-to-all-countries/articleshow/84159577.cms||---

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh govt may facilitate bank loans for beneficiaries of Jagananna colonies||AMARAVATI: In an attempt to give further impetus to the construction of houses in YSR Jagananna colonies, the state is contemplating to rope in banks to grant loans to beneficiaries. The government is planning to offer subsidy on rate of interest to be charged by banks to ensure the loans are granted at an interest rate of 25 paise per Rs.100. The government says such financial assistance would help more beneficiaries to take up the construction in YSR Jagananna housing project. The grounding ceremony organized in last three days has received an overwhelming response from beneficiaries as it reported almost 200 percent achievement over the target. The state government had initially wanted to make at least three lakh beneficiaries launch work in days in July, 1, 3 and 4. However, more than six lakh people launched works in the plots allocated to them in the YSR-Jagananna colonies. The state government received feedback from field-level administration that majority of beneficiaries were worrying about completing the houses within the prescribed budget of Rs.1.8 lakh. Several beneficiaries represented to the housing department officials that it would be extremely difficult for them to complete the structure without granting additional financial assistance from the government. Sources said that the district project directors of the housing department and municipal commissioners who were overseeing the housing project works reported to have explained the ground level situation to senior officials. The field level officials were also worried that it would be difficult for them to reach the targets in case the beneficiaries stalled the work soon after the grounding ceremony. The state government would release the unit cost to the beneficiaries only after completion of each and every phase for which the beneficiaries had to invest their own monies. Taking the ordeals of the beneficiaries, the government is contemplating to offer loans at subsidized rates. “Since majority of beneficiaries of the housing scheme are members of women self-help groups, we are planning to request the bankers to sanction special loans for the construction of the houses. We can offer subsidy on the rate of interest in such case,” said housing minister Cherukuvada Sri Ranganatha Raju. He said the issue would be discussed with chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy before making a formal announcement. The housing department officials were readying the data of the beneficiaries who were part of the self-help groups to assess the financial burden on the exchequer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-may-facilitate-bank-loans-for-beneficiaries-of-jagananna-colonies/articleshow/84163729.cms||Samdani MN

The situation is likely to worsen Tuesday onwards due to expected moderate to heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of these rivers in Nepal. The water discharge through the Valmikinagar barrage across the Gandak has fallen from the high of 2.93 cusecs to 1.63 lakh cusecs in the last 36 hours. Similarly, the discharge through Birpur barrage across the Kosi was 1.08 lakh cusecs, while the Ganga has been flowing far below the danger level at Buxar, Digha, Hathidah, Munger, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon. Among the smaller rivers, Kamla was in spate at Jainagar and Jhanjharpur, while the Adhwara group of rivers have also been flowing above the danger level at most places. In the eastern Bihar districts of Kishanganj and Katihar, the Mahananda was flowing above the danger level at Dhangarghat. Weather forecast said there would be moderate to heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the rivers in Nepal on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is likely to put the north Bihar rivers in spate, again. Meanwhile, reports from Bagaha in West Champaran said that hilly rivers like Pandai, Doharum, Oria, Sikarahana and, Biraha are eroding their banks and rendering a dozen families homeless. Over two dozen culverts, besides rural roads, have been damaged under Sikta and Mainatar blocks during the second phase of the floods in West Champaran. Sikta MLA Birendar Gupta, after touring the flood-affected area on Monday, said paddy seedlings transplanted earlier have been completely damaged. Due to accumulated floodwaters in the field, there is no hope of replantation of paddy seedlings. Agricultural labourers have become jobless. The Pandai river had caused over 25 feet breach in the protection guide bund near Domath village under Gaunaha block on Sunday. Gaunaha BDO Ajay Prakash and CO Amit Kumar visited the spot and assured to get the breached stretch filled, soon.

Sridhar made startling revelations on how Amaravati land deals were struck in his deposition before the Crime Investigation Department (CID) and in his letter to the chief secretary. He claimed that despite several objections raised by him, then senior officials and ministers did not pay heed to them and resorted to violation of the rules. Sridhar said an expert committee was constituted in August 2014 to make suggestions on the new capital for the residual state of Andhra Pradesh. Several locations such as Donakonda, Nuzvid, Vijayawada, between Vijayawada and Eluru, Vijayawada and Guntur, Visakhapatnam and Tirupati were considered for locating the capital, he said. The ministers and the officers at higher level sought information on geography, maps, existing infrastructure, details of lands such as government lands, including assigned lands, assessed waste lands and patta lands from the Guntur district collectorate even prior to receipt of an official memo from the principal secretary, municipal aministration and urban development, he said in the deposition. “The information about the entire geography and details of land were available with the government and the close corridors of power might have used it for purchasing the lands in the capital city region even before declaration of the capital,” he said. “Some of the prominent persons or organisations purchased lands in the capital city and its surroundings before declaration of the new capital. As these purchases were in the capital area and around it, it is obvious that information about the exact location of the capital to be declared was very much within the knowledge of the above persons and their associates who got undue benefit,” Sridhar said in his deposition. In September 2014, then government announced that the capital city would be centred around Vijayawada. “It is not known on what basis such a statement was made. Later, a committee of ministers and others was constituted for framing the Land Pooling Scheme on September 24, 2014,” the IAS officer said. “I was told about the information since land subjects were handled by the joint collector. Before declaration of the capital city, the ministers often visited certain villages in Guntur revenue sub-division for analysing the land pooling issues that may have cropped up and used to enquire with people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ias-officer-ap-capital-land-sold-even-before-it-was-named/articleshow/84158498.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The recommendation was based on the assumption that the third wave may disproportionately affect young children and mothers may have to accompany Covid-19 positive children during their hospitalisation. Consequently, the state health department identified about 18.7 lakh mothers in this category. As of July 4, Sunday, the state has administered the vaccine to about 18.5 lakh mothers, translating to about 99.7% coverage. On June 20 alone, when the state inoculated a record 13.72 lakh people, five lakh mothers were given jabs. Districts like West Godavari have already achieved 100% vaccination coverage in this priority group. According to state health officials, women who have recently become mothers would also be added to this group on a rolling basis. The Covid-19 immunisation coverage has crossed the 98% mark in both healthcare workers and frontline staff categories. Meanwhile, about 23,500 foreign travellers have also been inoculated. The state is now preparing to vaccinate pregnant women as recommended by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. According to the initial estimates, there are about six lakh pregnant women in Andhra Pradesh. A state health official informed that there would be training sessions on the administration of Covid-19 to pregnant women, adverse effect management, etc. “The Union health ministry is conducting a training session on Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant women on Tuesday, July 6, for district immunisation officers and state-level officers. These officials would in turn train medical officers and field-level staff before rolling out the vaccination programme for pregnant women,” the official said. Andhra Pradesh has so far administered 1.61 crore Covid-19 doses, including the 32 lakh second dose recipients. The state took about 170 days to reach this milestone after it launched the mass inoculation drive for the health care workers in the first phase on January 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-nears-100-vaccine-coverage-for-mothers/articleshow/84152574.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Talking to this reporter on Monday, a Patna College student, Dipak Prasad, said he was excited to meet his friends after a long time. He, however, expressed concern over “the inordinate delay in announcement of Part III examinations”. Abhijit Kumar, another student who studies at Patna Science College, also welcomed the decision to reopen educational institutions and restore academic normalcy in the state. “Necessary steps should, however, be initiated to get all the students, teachers and non-teaching staff vaccinated in order to protect them from Covid-19,” he urged. Justifying the decision to reopen colleges with 50% attendance, Girish Kumar Chaudhary, the vice-chancellor (VC) of Patna University, said, “As soon as the government gives the green light to examinations, we will announce the dates.” The principal of Magadh Mahila College, Shashi Sharma, pointed out that extra efforts would have to be made to ensure that youngsters follow the Covid safety protocols in classrooms. Her A N College counterpart, S P Shahi, echoed similar views. Abhay Kumar, the general secretary of Patna University Teachers’ Association, claimed that educational institutions were not fully prepared to hold classes in the offline mode. “Most students are yet to be vaccinated,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pupils-give-thumbs-up-to-classes-in-offline-mode/articleshow/84151434.cms||B K Mishra

---||Vijayawada||HC tells govt to set up human rights commission office in Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: The AP high court on Monday asked the state government to set up the human rights commission office in the state instead of Hyderabad. The bench of Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya was hearing a PIL filed by AP civil liberties association seeking directions to establish an office of the HRC in the state. The petitioners said the state government is yet to set up an office of the HRC. Advocate general S Sriram informed the court that the government proposes to set up the HRC office at the pollution control board office building in Hyderabad, to which the bench objected. “Many small states have established the HRC office in their own territory. Why can’t AP do the same? Should the petitioners go to another state to file a complaint?” the court asked, while adding that it wanted the government to set up the HRC office in Andhra Pradesh, not outside it. The bench also said that they will pass orders to this effect if the government ignores the suggestion. The advocate general submitted to the court that he will bring the matter to the notice of the authorities concerned and sought three weeks time. In another petition, the high court directed the endowments department to submit proceedings issued by the Dharmika Parishad in connection with the appointment of a seer for Brahmam Gari matham in Kadapa district. The court passed the order after hearing a petition filed by the second wife and minor son of the deceased Veerabogha Vasanta Venkateswara Swamy, seeking directions to declare his son as the next seer of the matham. The court posted the matter for next hearing to July 8. In another petition, the AP government submitted to the high court that it has not diverted endowments department funds for YSR Vahana Mithra. The bench of Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninna Jayasuriya was hearing a petition filed by BJP leader G Bhanu Prakash Reddy, alleging diversion of temple funds to Vahana Mithra. The government stated that the funds allocated to AP Brahmin Welfare Corporation were used for Vahana Mithra that went to beneficiaries from the same community. The petitioners submitted to the court that they were satisfied with the reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-tells-govt-to-set-up-human-rights-commission-office-in-ap/articleshow/84152698.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Patna||No development is possible sans social equality: Tejashwi Yadav||PATNA: Leader of the opposition in state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said there can be no development without social equality. “What will a person do with a flyover when there is no food to eat? What will a person do with the road when he has no money to purchase a vehicle?” he asked while lashing out at the NDA government over hike in fuel and cooking gas prices. Speaking at the RJD’s 25th foundation day function here on Monday, Tejashwi also took a jibe at CM Nitish Kumar for getting his cataract surgery done in Delhi. “We were questioned why we took Sputnik vaccine, but we did not ask why Nitish Kumar went to Delhi for his surgery and did not get it done in Bihar. We don’t do such politics,” he said and alleged corruption everywhere in the state. “If I did any mistake, forgive me. One keeps learning throughout his life,” he said and reiterated that the RJD is the party of “A to Z”. Earlier, RJD chief Lalu Prasad inaugurated the function virtually from Delhi and dedicated the RJD’s anthem to the people. Before starting his speech, Tejashwi paid tribute to LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan and RJD leaders late Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Mohammad Shahabuddin, Vidyasagar Nishad, Abdul Gafoor and others. Tejashwi also seemed to woo his elder brother Tej Pratap by recalling how they used to raise slogans for the party in their childhood days and Tej was always on the forefront. Tejashwi gave example of his father Lalu Prasad saying how despite conspiracies hatched against him, he did not compromise with his ideologies. “We have to take inspiration from him. Lalu ji never bent down and I assure you that Tejashwi will also never bend down,” the RJD leader said. Attacking CM Nitish further, Tejashwi said he is only surrounded by his officers and never interacts with common people. He said JD(U) was at the fourth position in the election, but because of the Election Commission, it became third in the last assembly elections. He said there was a difference of only 12,000 votes between the Mahagatbadhan and the NDA. “This means people of all castes and religions voted for RJD,” he said. Tejashwi said the ruling party leaders uselessly create propaganda and talk of the jungle raj, though the data suggests more crime during the tenure of Nitish. Few people are wearing a cloak named development, but their own ministers are unmasking them, he said while referring to the allegations made by JD(U) minister Madan Sahni against the bureacracy. RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari, national principal general secretary Abdul Bari Siddiqui, state president Jagdanand Singh and other senior leaders also addressed the gathering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-development-is-possible-sans-social-equality-tejas/articleshow/84154361.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Kolkata||At 885, West Bengal’s new Covid cases at 3-digit low for first time since March||KOLKATA: The number of fresh Covid cases in Bengal slid to a three-digit figure on Monday for the first time in more than three months. Fresh cases in the city, too, have plunged to double digits. On Monday, the state recorded 885 fresh cases while Kolkata clocked 64. Health experts said the Covid situation in the state is under control but warned that the guard should be kept up. “The declining number of cases is satisfying as far as controlling the infection is concerned. But this unlocking phase is very crucial and all of us must stick to Covid-appropriate behaviour so that the number does not start shooting up immediately,” said public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan Anirban Dalui. The last time Bengal recorded fresh cases in three digits was March 31, with 982 cases with two deaths. For Kolkata, fresh cases had been in the double digits for the last time on March 19 with 99 cases and no death. But the number started rising after Holi. “The Covid restrictions have worked along with the vaccination drive. Due to the magnitude of the second wave, this time people were more aware and followed rules. The government’s easing of curbs, in a phased manner, is a meticulous move,” said infectious diseases control specialist Debkishore Gupta. From four digits for the better part of April, the number started swelling to five digits by the third week of April, touching 20,846 cases by May 14 — the highest during the entire pandemic. For the city, the highest number of fresh cases was recorded on May 12 with 3,989 cases and 44 deaths. The slowdown started right after the government enforced Covid restrictions across the state and the number dropped to four digits after two weeks. It has been in the 1,000-plus mark for the past two weeks. “We cannot afford to let our guards down. The third wave and its magnitude will depend on how responsibly we behave now,” said Dalui. While all districts, including Kolkata, have started reporting cases in double or single digits, North 24 Parganas had 109 cases on Monday. Health officials are hopeful of the number declining in that district in a day or two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-885-states-new-cov-cases-at-3-digit-low-for-1st-time-since-mar/articleshow/84154300.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

While BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar is planning to undertake a padayatra immediately, Congress new chief A Revanth Reddy is likely to go on a padayatra from Alampur to Adilabad soon. YSR Telangana Party leader YS Sharmila has already announced that she would take up a padayatra to understand people’s problems first-hand. Revanth said he will take a decision on his padayatra after taking the permission of Congress high command. A source in Revanth camp said: “No decision has been taken yet on his padayatra. But definitely, he would undertake the padayatra before the 2023 assembly elections. Revanth will not take any decision on his own. He will consult the party leadership and go by its decision,” he said. Sanjay’s padayatra is likely to start very soon and conclude at Huzurabad assembly constituency which will go to bypolls following the resignation of Eatala Rajender as MLA. Konda Raghava Reddy of YSR Telangana Party said Sharmila’s padayatra will be year-long. “She will cover at least 100 constituencies. Except Hyderabad core city, she will walk around majority of Telangana. The padayatra will start from Chevella where her father, former CM YSR had kicked off his padayatra,” he said. He added: “She has already toured five districts. She received a huge welcome in Nalgonda and Khammam.” Sharmila’s new party is launching on July 8. The Election Commission of India has registered the party based on the application of Rajagopal, a confidant of Sharmila’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/assembly-polls-2-yrs-away-yet-padayatras-flavour-of-the-season/articleshow/84159477.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Kochi||Kerala: Smaller private hospitals too to give jabs soon||KOCHI: Small and medium private hospitals in the state will also soon start offering paid Covid vaccines. This is expected to speed up the inoculation drive in the state. After weeks of waiting, the state government decided to procure and distribute vaccines to such hospitals from July 10. At present it is mostly big corporate hospitals who are purchasing the vaccines directly from the manufacturers and giving jabs to the people. “As informed by the ministry of health and family welfare, Covid vaccine doses for the month of June 2021 for which payment was done by PCVC (Private Covid Vaccination Centres), by June 30, 2021, will be delivered before July 10 2021,” said a letter to the hospitals from Dr Rathan U Kelkar, state mission director, National Health Mission. He has also asked hospitals to start placing orders for the vaccine for July 2021. According to the revised guidelines for the national Covid-19 vaccination being implemented from June 21, domestic vaccine manufacturers may provide up to 25% of their monthly production of vaccines to private hospitals working as PCVCs. Aggregation of demand will be done only for Covishield and Covaxin. Other vaccines may also be included in the aggregation process subsequently. “With government procuring paid vaccines for private hospitals, many hospitals including ours, which are empanelled for treatment under Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padathi (KASP) health insurance scheme in the state, have decided to get our vaccine quota through this route. We have registered with NHM and informed them of our vaccine requirement,” said Sonu, quality system officer, NIMS Medicity, Thiruvananthapuram. Initially, the maximum monthly limit of stocks to be made available to the private hospitals will depend on the number of beds available at the hospitals. Hospitals with less than 50 beds will get 3,000 doses, those with 51-300 beds will get 6,000 doses, hospitals with 301-500 beds will get 10,000 doses and 500-plus bedded hospitals will get 15,000 doses for the first month. For subsequent months, the maximum order quantity (MOQ) will be determined based on opening balances likely to be available with the PCVC at the start of the month based on average daily consumption, and the average daily consumption during the previous month. “Everyone has made the payment for the vaccines but the wait is too long. Also, we have been told that only a small share of the vaccine demand raised by private hospitals will be met,” said Dr Jayakrishnan A V, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee on Covid vaccines and vaccination strategy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/smaller-pvt-hospitals-too-to-give-jabs-soon/articleshow/84184652.cms||Preetu Nair

The Samajwadi party candidate Malti Yadav had lost to Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) candidate Dr VK Singh by a margin of 18 votes. This was the first incidence when the district party leadership has taken action against its leaders after finding them involved in anti- party activities.

The list of expelled leaders included ex-block pramukh Kundan Yadav, Shailesh Kumar Yadav, Parmanand Kol and Ram Chandra Fauji. Madhur said, “Shailesh Kumar Yadav and Parmanand Kol have been earlier announced party’s candidate for block pramukh post from Pratappur and Koraon blocks respectively and both of them now have been expelled from the party. Besides, Ram Chandra Fauji from Shringverpur block has also been expelled on the charges of anti-party activities.” Madhur said, “Senior party leaders have sent a report of some more party workers and leaders to state party president Naresh Uttam Patel after finding their role and activities suspicious during the zila panchayat president polls”. SP leaders claimed that despite having highest number of zila panchayat members in the Prayagraj district, the party candidate Malti Yadav had lost the zila panchayat president post elections. Meanwhile,district party president Yogesh Yadav said, “The traitors would not be spared in Samajwadi Party and they would be shown the doors”.

He said there were only about 70,000 doses left in the state and that vaccination has stopped in most districts. “Vaccination has stopped in most of the districts today due to lack of vaccines,” he said. Rajasthan is not getting vaccines as per its requirement from the central government, due to which the drive has been affected. Gehlot requested the Centre to provide adequate number of doses to the state. “Vaccine wastage is negative in Rajasthan, but due to lack of doses, the public is upset,” he said.

Sources said a meeting has been called on Wednesday probably to discuss the change in state party leadership. A senior legislator said they received the information in this regard from party’s Bihar in-charge Bhakta Charan Das. “We all have been told to reach Delhi by Tuesday or Wednesday morning for a meeting with Rahul Ji. There will be around 35 people,” he said. When asked about the agenda of this meeting, he replied, “We have not been told about it, but most probably it will be regarding changing the Congress state president.” Congress legislature party leader Ajit Sharma said after the assembly elections, he appealed to the party’s high command Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for a meeting, but because of Covid-19 that could not be held. “Tomorrow morning, I will be leaving for Delhi. We are excited to meet Rahul Ji and we will implement all his instructions and strengthen Congress in Bihar,” said Sharma. Few state party members had on Friday met former governor and senior Congress leader Nikhil Kumar at his Delhi’s residence and discussed about the state leadership. This topic has gained momentum ever since Das has taken feedback regarding senior state leaders. Meanwhile, AICC member Intekhab Alam on Monday wrote a letter to party’s general secretary KC Venugopal complaining how minority leadership was being slaughtered in Bihar Congress and tickets to Muslim candidates were given from seats which had thin population of the minority community. Alam stated that regional parties were giving better representation to the Muslims and this was helping them perform better. “It is a matter of great concern that Congress did not field any Muslim candidate in 34 districts in 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 assembly elections. This weakened the party and the minority leadership gradually,” read a part of the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cong-legislators-netas-to-meet-raga-in-delhi/articleshow/84153902.cms||Sheezan Nezami

On June 28, the index had scaled a record peak at 53,127 points in intraday trade but late sell-off pulled it down to close below the 52,800-mark. The day’s gains came on the back of a strong domestic fund buying with a net inflow figure of Rs 646 crore, while foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 338 crore, BSE data showed. According to Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, investor sentiment was positive on account of fall in Covid infections and indications of more availability of vaccines. “Hopes of a sustained reopening of the economy led to buying in sectors which were most affected by Covid. Moreover, hope of good monsoon and positive (quarterly numbers) from some of the heavyweights led to buying in banking and FMCG stocks,” Khemka said in a note. In Monday’s session, RIL, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank contributed the most with 22 of the 30 sensex constituents closing higher. Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech were among the top laggards, BSE data showed. The day’s session also discounted a sharp fall in India’s services PMI, announced during early trades of the day. Going forward, the course of the monsoon, the pace of vaccination drive across the country, the strength of the economic recovery and corporate results would dictate the market’s trend. On the international front, the spread of the Delta variants even in the highly vaccinated countries would be the main determinant for the market’s trend, market analysts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-closes-at-record-high-as-covid-cases-dip/articleshow/84156550.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He announced that work on the construction of a road over the nullah would begin soon as funds had been sanctioned for the purpose. The road, which will start from I-T roundabout and go up to Kali Mandir at Bans Ghat, will be 1,289 metres long and 9 metres wide. “To be constructed at a cost of Rs 67 crore, the road over the Mandiri drain will improve the connectivity between Bailey Road and Ashok Rajpath and ease traffic movement. Vending zones will also be built and street lights installed,” the deputy CM said. According to sources, the issue of funds for the redevelopment of the Mandiri drain was raised and resolved at the 19th board meeting of the Patna Smart City Limited in the last week of June. After the meeting, the National Projects Construction Corporation Limited was asked to start work on construction of the nullah soon. Tarkishore, who also heads the urban development and housing department, said, “The government has been making efforts to provide better facilities to the people, improve the quality of their lives, and generate employment opportunities.” Meanwhile, road construction minister Nitin Nabin thanked CM Nitish Kumar and his deputy for giving the green light to the construction of a road over the Mandiri drain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/road-construction-work-over-mandiri-drain-to-begin-soon/articleshow/84151721.cms||Faryal Rumi

The government is planning to offer subsidy on rate of interest to be charged by banks to ensure the loans are granted at an interest rate of 25 paise per Rs.100. The government says such financial assistance would help more beneficiaries to take up the construction in YSR Jagananna housing project. The grounding ceremony organized in last three days has received an overwhelming response from beneficiaries as it reported almost 200 percent achievement over the target. The state government had initially wanted to make at least three lakh beneficiaries launch work in days in July, 1, 3 and 4. However, more than six lakh people launched works in the plots allocated to them in the YSR-Jagananna colonies. The state government received feedback from field-level administration that majority of beneficiaries were worrying about completing the houses within the prescribed budget of Rs.1.8 lakh. Several beneficiaries represented to the housing department officials that it would be extremely difficult for them to complete the structure without granting additional financial assistance from the government. Sources said that the district project directors of the housing department and municipal commissioners who were overseeing the housing project works reported to have explained the ground level situation to senior officials. The field level officials were also worried that it would be difficult for them to reach the targets in case the beneficiaries stalled the work soon after the grounding ceremony. The state government would release the unit cost to the beneficiaries only after completion of each and every phase for which the beneficiaries had to invest their own monies. Taking the ordeals of the beneficiaries, the government is contemplating to offer loans at subsidized rates. “Since majority of beneficiaries of the housing scheme are members of women self-help groups, we are planning to request the bankers to sanction special loans for the construction of the houses. We can offer subsidy on the rate of interest in such case,” said housing minister Cherukuvada Sri Ranganatha Raju. He said the issue would be discussed with chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy before making a formal announcement. The housing department officials were readying the data of the beneficiaries who were part of the self-help groups to assess the financial burden on the exchequer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-may-facilitate-bank-loans-for-beneficiaries-of-jagananna-colonies/articleshow/84153002.cms||Samdani MN

Previously in 2019, there were 95 black spots, which has now reduced to 45 after rectification. In turn, officials point out that there has been a substantial reduction in mishaps and fatalities in the first half of 2021. Covid-19 aided in reduction of mishaps in Krishna district in 2020 with fatalities standing 26% less compared to 2019. Between June 2019 to May 2020, the number of deaths due to road mishaps in Krishna stood at 275. However, the corresponding period from June 2020 to May 2021, fatalities stood at 361 due to the absence of lockdown. Interestingly, the same period shows a 17% decrease in injuries caused due to road mishaps. However, cops noted that comparing the fatalities of 2021 and its corresponding period in 2019 shows at least an 11% decrease in the present year. Speaking to TOI, Krishna district SP M Ravindranath Babu said, “We have carried out a weekly initiative called ‘No accident day’ where personnel are posted at these black spots, ensuring that traffic is regulated. The second aspect is rectifying the road engineering defects in coordination with the local civic body or the Roads and Buildings department,” Babu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/accident-rate-falls-as-krishna-district-rectifies-black-spots/articleshow/84152822.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Many camps had more recipients turning up than had been registered. While the state has been urging hospitals to hold camps in districts, the latter pointed out it has to be done simultaneously with off-site camps within the city since demand remains high despite suspicions about fake vaccines at off-site centres. “Since it is time for the second dose for a large group of people, there’s a huge spurt in demand. Off-site camps will help meet the requirement. We plan to add a few in Kolkata and have applied for permission,” said AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua. Hospitals said the process of approval — that was changed following the Kasba fake camp — has got longer. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences planned five off-site camps in Kolkata this week, but has approvals pending for three. “Now, every off-site camp is inspected before permission. We are willing to wait since it’s important to have recipients’ trust,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Belle Vue Clinic has two offsite camps at Park Street and at La Martiniere School. At the latter, attendance had dropped from 800 a day to 300 last week. “But it has started picking up now that the second dose is due for many,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. Woodlands Hospital is resuming off-site vaccination this week. “We have 2,000 recipients per day scheduled at approved sites,” said CEO Rupali Basu. A government official said fresh applications for off-site camps have dropped. “We have received more requests for camps in the districts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/footfall-up-at-off-site-camps-as-45-group-waits-for-2nd-dose/articleshow/84154385.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

But with the possibility of a third wave looming, health experts felt there was a need to be responsible as individuals while involving the civil society on community preparedness to combat the virus. “People should follow science to combat the anticipated third wave and that includes keeping up the Covid-appropriate behaviour and taking the vaccine,” said IPGMER surgery professor Diptendra Sarkar, mentor to Covid Care Network (CCN). Organizations like CCN, set up by healthcare professionals, and eminent people from the society deliberated on involving the issue on Monday. “We could rope in people from the civil society who can impress upon people on fighting Covid locally. There is still some cultural barrier in a section of people on taking a Covid test or getting inoculated. A strategy of protracted combat will go a long way in fighting another wave,” said IPGMER hepatology professor Abhjit Chowdhury, a mentor to CCN. The organization has taken various initiatives against stigmatization of the infected, help in hospital admission, oxygen supply, awareness on masking and other Covidappropriate behaviour. “Eminent people from the civil society can step in to bust myths and tell people that the vaccine helps,” said Sarkar. CCN’s discourse on “the anticipated third wave and the responsibility of the civil society in community preparedness” on Monday had the likes of actor Koushik Sen, former cricketer Utpal Chattopadhyay and theatre personality Deb Sankar Halder, also a CCN mentor, among speakers. “Even if numbers have dipped, we cannot relax on discipline,” said Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/responsible-behaviour-biggest-weapon-in-fight-against-3rd-wave/articleshow/84154485.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Sources said that the company would be filing its draft prospectus with the regulator soon after its extraordinary general meeting on July 12. The $2.3-billion fundraise will comprise a combination of primary and secondary issuances with a large chunk being sales by existing investors. The targeted valuation places the company slightly below that of Bajaj Finserv, which has a market capitalisation of Rs 1.93 lakh crore. There are only 20 companies with a higher valuation. If the company succeeds in achieving this valuation it will be among the top ten most valuable listed financial services stocks. Paytm has finalsied a syndicate of seven investment banks for the IPO. The bankers are: Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, ICICI Securities, JP Morgan, Axis Capital, Citi and HDFC Bank. Besides obtaining shareholder nod for the fundraise, One97 Communications is also seeking to have the flexibility to raise the amount at a later stage if required. “Although the talk of the IPO has been in the news only in recent months a lot of the groundwork for the initial public offering has already been completed. The company can therefore file its papers as soon as it receives approval from its shareholders,” a banking source said. The pricing sought by the company is nearly a 60% jump over the valuation during its last round of fundraising a couple of years earlier. Bankers say that valuations for fintech firms have improved in the last couple of years as the pace of digitization has accelerated in the post-pandemic period which is being reflected in the number of UPI transactions. Paytm has also improved its portfolio of offerings and has forayed into the distribution of financial products like loans and insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-eyes-25bn-valuation/articleshow/84156385.cms||---

PCMC commissioner, Rajesh Patil, told TOI, “This is an experimental initiative we have started to build confidence among school students about the current Covid situation. The fear of Covid should not be there among children and it would be possible only if they have the right channel to address their queries. If they have any queries, they will get answers from students, who have been selected based on their communication skills. If students are unable to answer any query, the expert backup will take over the call.” A civic body official said that the 20 students who will man the helpline will work on a rotation basis. Every day, two students will get a chance to operate the helpline. Their parents have been allowed to accompany them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-helpline-for-kids-by-kids-in-pimpri-chinchwad/articleshow/84156570.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Speaking at the RJD’s 25th foundation day function, he also took a jibe at the party’s state president and said it seemed that Jagdanand Singh uncle was still upset with him. In a lighter vein with an embedded message,Tej Pratap said he remained busy with his daily worship and his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav reached the “venue early and grabbed the seat”. The former health minister said when he speaks, people make fun of him like his father. On a serious note, Tej many people forget their responsibility and usually sit in the office, rather than going out in the field. Recalling how a person from his Hasanpur Vidhan Sabha constituency called him for help and he called several party members as he was out of station, “I got no response and since it was my call, it was not picked up.” He advised Tejashwi to create a space for women in the party office and provide a vehicle to all the RJD district presidents so that they could immediately help people in reaching the hospital. Referring to RJD’s Vidhan Sabha march in March in which his party workers were badly thrashed, Tej said, “I wanted to go in the crowd and get thrashed, but they pulled me back because they did not want me to become the real hero of that picture.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tej-takes-a-jibe-at-opponents-in-rjd/articleshow/84154197.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Given the surplus liquidity in the system, short-term interest rates are very low, and banks offer a risk-free return on idle money. For businesses that have a cash stash running into crores, a 3-4% return (which is what most savings deposits provide), is a decent yield for the short term. The move by the RBI is expected to force businesses to make use of their resources more productively or deploy them in longer-term deposits. The circular had triggered speculation in social media that auto-renewal of fixed deposits would be impacted. However, RBI sources said that the circular does not pertain to auto-renewals at all. Bankers also said that there was no intention to do away with auto-renewals as banks cannot disregard standing instructions given by customers. The RBI is likely to clarify that auto-renewals and renewal of overdue deposits will continue like earlier. In a circular revising its rules for interest on matured fixed deposits, the RBI on Friday said: “If a term deposit (TD) matures and proceeds are unpaid, the amount left unclaimed with the bank shall attract the rate of interest as applicable to a savings account or the contracted rate of interest on the matured TD, whichever is lower”. Earlier banks were forced to provide savings account rates on even bulk deposits which offered returns lower than savings account rates. In the case of overdue deposits, the RBI had left it to banks to their board laying down a transparent policy. This allows the bank to renew a fixed deposit from the maturity date even if the customer delays approaching the bank. The circular could also impact a very small section of retail customers who have accounts in banks that high savings account rates. Several small finance banks and some private banks offer returns ranging from 4% to 7% on savings accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-can-pay-less-on-matured-bulk-fds-rbi/articleshow/84156679.cms||---

Illegal poaching also has a role to play. Wild boars usually thrive in areas where there is enough food. They especially feed on sugar cane, groundnut and melons. However, due to migratory trends in the rural belt, most farmers have stopped producing these crops. North Andhra districts have a forest cover of around 28%, covering 6.58 lakh hectares out of 23.53 hectares of geographical area. While the forest cover is 42% in Visakhapatnam district, it is 20% in Vizianagaram and 11% in Srikakulam. A senior forest official said over 3,000 hectares of forest land in the region has been encroached in the last one decade. While there were around 30,000 wild boars in north Andhra districts a decade ago, the number has now dropped to around 20,000. Chief conservator of forests K Rama Mohan Rao told TOI no census has ever been done on wild boars. “They normally have a tendency to move on to greener pastures to survive. Due to damage to crops caused by the boars, farmers are erecting electrical fences at their farm fields. All the wild boars need is some bush cover and access to food, which they are finding difficult to get. Illegal poaching is also a big reason behind their dwindling population,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/wild-boars-numbers-dwindling-in-north-ap/articleshow/84153195.cms||Siva G
---||Allahabad||ABAP supports Bhagwat remarkson common DNA, mob lynching||Revised Prayagraj: The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) has supported the recent statements of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat that “DNA of all Indians is the same” and “cow is a holy animal but those who are indulging in lynching are going against Hindutva”. “It is true that the DNA of Muslims and Christians is the same along with the Hindus living in the country. Some people left Hinduism and got converted to Islam and Christianity under greed or pressure. Ancestors of all Muslims and Christians living in India were the first Hindus,” president of the 13 akharas (monastic orders) of the country, Mahant Narendra Giri, on Monday said supporting Bhagwat’s DNA remark. Giri also supported Bhagwat’s comment on the incidents of mob lynchings. “Mob lynching incidents cannot be justified in any way. Cow is our mother and will always be. But despite this, mob lynching in the name of cow slaughter cannot be justified,” Giri added. Giri said that ABAP is trying to connect Christians and Muslims living in the country with the ideology of Hindutva. “Bhagwat has rightly said that it is wrong to ask a Muslim to leave the country,” he further added. “That is why the Akhara Parishad is also trying to request ‘all’ to ‘return home’. I appeal to the Muslims and Christians to return to their old religion. All should be included... this will be good for the unity and integrity of the country,” said Giri. Speaking at an event in Ghaziabad on Sunday, Bhagwat had said that the DNA of all Indians is the same and those asking Muslims to leave the country cannot call themselves Hindus. Bhagwat had also said that cow is a holy animal but those who are indulging in lynching are going against Hindutva. Law should take its own course against them without any partiality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/abap-supports-bhagwat-remarkson-common-dna-mob-lynching/articleshow/84153696.cms||---

It also said that in addition, the MD and the CTO of the exchange could be penalised to pay up to 10% of their annual salary in case of such delays or failures. In February this year, Sebi had said it was in the process of forming a comprehensive policy with financial disincentives built in for such failures by exchanges and other financial market intermediaries, comprehensively called market infrastructure institutions (MIIs). The markets regulator has also come out with a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for all MIIs. These institutions include exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories. Sebi has put in timelines for corrective actions relating to various types of technical glitches. It also said that any technical glitch leading to trading disruption should be reported to Sebi, a prompt root cause analysis (RCA) carried out and a report submitted to the regulator within 21 days of the incident. In case of failure to adhere to these deadlines, the MII will have to pay a monetary penalty of Rs 1 lakh for each missed day of reporting, which could increase to up to Rs 25 lakh. Sebi also said that in case of “disruption of any one or more of the ‘critical systems’, the MII shall, within 30 minutes of the incident, declare that incident as ‘Disaster’”. If the MII fails to report such a disaster, the institution will pay “10% of average of standalone net profit for previous two financial years or Rs 2 crore, whichever is higher”. It also said that the MD and the CTO of the MII will have to pay a penalty equal to “10% each of their annual pay (both fixed and variable components) for the financial year when the disaster occurred”. To avoid technical glitches, Sebi also said that MIIs should also put in place business continuity plans, disaster recovery policies and system audit processes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/exchanges-to-be-fined-for-reporting-it-glitches-late/articleshow/84156612.cms||---

As many as 171 people were killed and 670 people suffered minor to major injuries in road accidents between January and June 2021. Speaking to TOI, additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Ch Adinarayana said a majority of road accident victims were two-wheeler riders. In 2020, the lockdown halted vehicular traffic for two months, pulling down the number of fatal and non-fatal accidents in the first six months, he added. Road accidents have been decreasing in Vizag city with more stringent enforcement. However, traffic violations such as speeding, driving without a head guard, driving on the wrong side, using mobile phones while driving, and other violations have increased by over 30%. “We are hoping that the number of fatal and non-fatal accidents reduce in the coming days,” Adinarayana added. Police said accidents declined by 10% on the National Highway stretch due to enforcement efforts. The ministry of road transport and highways has a set a target of reducing road fatalities by 10% every year in major states. Road safety committee meetings have recommended engineering changes at some locations to make travel safer and mitigate congestion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/road-traffic-deaths-rise-in-vizag-majority-are-two-wheeler-riders/articleshow/84152844.cms||Nalla.Babu

Hakim said the KMC’s vaccination drive was being extended every day with people in large numbers from the adjoining districts joining as recipients. “They are transport workers, vegetable sellers, fish vendors and domestic helps. We can’t deny them their dues. So I have asked Swasthya Bhawan officials to allocate the lion’s share of vaccines they are getting as a quota for the state,” Hakim said. According to a KMC health department official, the civic body has identified around 30 large vaccination centres for the priority group or super spreaders across the city. “If the state doesn’t augment supply of vaccines, we won’t be able to cater to the needs of the super spreaders,” a KMC official said.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata Jesuits call Father Stan’s death in jail ‘wilful murder’||KOLKATA: A pall of gloom descended on the Jesuits of the city as the news of Father Stan’s death filtered in. There are some Jesuit priests who had not only worked closely with him but were ideologically supportive of his cause for the Dalits and tribals and, hence, were in touch with him. They called the death a “wilful murder” of a man who worked all his life for the rights of the tribals. Though for most of his life Father Stan lived and worked in Ranchi and belonged to Jamshedpur, he was extremely close to the Jesuits in Kolkata and would often be a guest at St Xavier’s College, a Jesuit institution, where he spoke to students about the need of young people to work for tribal upliftment. “Throughout the 90s, we had him coming and speaking to our students. He had piles of research that he did on how the tribals of Jharkhand were losing their land, how they were exploited as cheap labour force and how they lived in disease and hunger. He shared his findings among our students and priests, urging each to come out of the comfort zone and work for the poor. Death was inflicted on him purposely, to serve the interests of the rich, for whom he was a big hurdle because they had to cross him to get to the tribal land,” said Father Felix Raj, the vice-chancellor of St Xavier’s University, who had been leading a movement in the city since the time Father Stan was put behind bars for inciting violence against the state. This was rubbished by Jesuits in India. Father Felix led a protest procession that ended at Mother Teresa’s bust after the arrest in October 2020 and wrote relentlessly against the “injustice” being done to a saviour of the tribals. “I even wrote to the PM, but nothing happened,” he said. Father Jayraj, the rector of St Xavier’s College, described Father Stan Swamy as a gentle giant who walked miles with the tribals for 60 years. “His death only makes our cause more powerful,” he said. His death, ironically, came the day his bail plea was to be heard. “On July 3, when his bail did not come up for hearing, his heart broke,” said Father Jyothi, a Jesuit priest of the city who has been in the food movement for which he has been in close touch with Father Stan. On Monday, when the plea came up for hearing, the director of the hospital he was in gave a statement that Fr Stan had passed away. Jesuit priests said that by denying him basic human rights, the state has shown its ugly coercive force to the people. Father Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College, called him a “martyr and a saint”. “He fought and died for justice and has become immortal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-jesuits-call-fr-stans-death-in-jail-wilful-murder/articleshow/84154358.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The district, which saw a large number of deaths during the first and second waves, is focusing on boosting ICU and oxygen beds. Government hospitals across the district will get 800 new oxygen beds, of which 200 will be ICU beds. The health wing is also looking to increase oxygen production and storage facility. “Early detection of symptomatic Covid-19 cases will help flatten the curve fast. This time we have decided to increase the bed strength. The government hospitals across the district will be strengthened and more oxygen beds will be added. We are doubling the oxygen generation and storage capacities in the district,” district collector J Nivas said TOI. Meanwhile, health wing authorities are conducting meetings with corporate hospitals in the city and increasing the bed strength and amenities. Hospitals with a bed strength of 60 are directed to have 500 LPM oxygen generation plants and 100 spare oxygen cylinders. The government has decided to renew licences of hospitals that follow rules and allocate 50% of beds to Aarogyasri patients. — Venu Lanka||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bed-strength-ramped-up-to-tackle-3rd-wave/articleshow/84152625.cms||Venu Lanka

Once complete, the road will boost revenue for residents of the region. Roads have been a perennial problem in the tribal pockets of Kodhama in the district. The absence of roads has prohibited access to healthcare and education. Often, the ailing are carried in makeshift ‘dolis’ to the nearest primary health centres, after treks of three to five kilometres. The road that will be laid through the forest route between Paguluchenneru and Kodhama (a 6-km-stretch) will cost an estimated Rs 8 crore. District forest officer, Vizianagaram, Sachin Gupta and his team visited Paguluchenneru and Kodhama villages as part of forest clearance for road works. Speaking to TOI, Gupta said land diversion is required for construction of the road. “We have identified some chunks of land for diversion for the road project and will submit the proposal to the government for clearance. The road will connect as many as 13 villages under Kodhama panchayat and people in those villages will benefit on all fronts,” he added. Locals expect the project will improve connectivity between Kodhama and the Kotia group of villages and speed up transport of essential goods. Earlier, tired of waiting for decades, residents of Chintamala in Vizianagaram pooled together money and laid a road. Tribals from the village in Saluru mandal collected over Rs 6 lakh for the 3.5-km road that would connect them to Sagumarri village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/6-km-road-to-connect-13-hilly-hamlets-in-vzm-dist/articleshow/84152783.cms||Nalla.Babu

The finding bears significance in the backdrop of the fact that BSIP scientists had found coronavirus in the water of river Gomti in the state capital. “A joint team of BHU and BSIP investigated possible presence of coronavirus in the Ganga as many experts had expressed contrasting views after human bodies were found floating in the river during May 2021,” said Prof Gyaneshwar Chaubey of the department of zoology, BHU. He added, “To investigate possible traces of coronavirus in the Ganga, the team collected two samples every week for seven weeks from Varanasi city beginning May 15 to July 3. The sample collecting point as well as the process to test the sample was the same every time,” said Prof Chaubey. “Our team extracted RNA and performed an RT PCR test for all the samples with a true positive and negative sample. Surprisingly, none of the samples collected from the Ganga showed any trace of viral RNA. However, samples collected from river Gomti did show the presence of viral RNA,” said BSIP scientist Niraj Rai, who heads the Covid lab at the institute. He added that his team had found presence of the virus in the Gomti water even after the treatment of sewage water at two sewage treatment plants (STPs) of Lucknow. “The virus was found in Gomti last year (September 2020) as well as this year (May 21),” he added. The finding is also important as it has been conducted amid apprehension that water of river Ganga could have been contaminated after several bodies were found floating in rivers Ganga and Yamuna. A large number of bodies were also buried on their banks during the peak of Covid-19 pandemic. Prof VN Mishra of the BHU’s department of neurosciences, one of the key contributors of this study, said: “The finding implies that Ganga water has some exceptional property due to some natural ‘phage viruses’ present in the water.” “We are exploring more to understand this phenomenon” said Prof Chaubey. Apart from Prof Mishra and Prof Chaubey, the Varanasi team also included research scientists Abhishek Pathak, Prajjval Pratap Singh, Debashruti Das and Bhargavi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/no-coronavirus-in-ganga-water-claims-joint-study-by-bhu-bsip/articleshow/84153742.cms||---

They are ready to gorge themselves on different cuisines and satiate their hunger at food joints which were shut during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Restaurants, in the meantime, are gearing up to follow all the safety protocols to ensure that the virus does not spread. A Kurji-based restaurant, for instance, has decided to promote “cashless transactions” with a view to minimising physical interaction with the customers. Its owner, Mohd Danish, told this newspaper on Monday that all precautionary measures would be taken to contain the spread of Covid-19. Hailing the government’s decision, Anjesh Shandilya, the owner of a cafe in Patliputra Colony, claimed that he was happy for his staff, who had been struggling to make ends meet during the Covid-induced lockdown. “We are arranging the tables in such a manner that social distancing norms are strictly followed,” he said, adding that all his employees had been vaccinated. Two other restaurateurs, Ravi Singh and Anurag, also welcomed the decision. While Ravi promised to get his restaurant disinfected from time to time, Anurag said he would install a full body sanitizer machine. Meanwhile, many Patnaites, especially youngsters, expressed happiness over the reopening of restaurants with 50% capacity. Neda Ali, a food blogger, exclaimed, “It was quite difficult to produce food-related content at home. Now, I will be able to step out with my friends, explore new restaurants and click lots of pictures.” Another foodie, Rahul Singh, said, “Soon after the news about reopening of restaurants broke out, my family and I started planning a night out.” He, however, promised to stick to the Covid safety norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/restaurateurs-on-cloud-nine-foodies-ready-to-satiate-hunger/articleshow/84151481.cms||---

Most of these hospitals still have very limited number of off-site camps after the state health department came out with a detailed SOP on conducting these camps. “With all the three vaccines available with us, we are having an impressive rise in the number of people coming to take the jabs. We are anticipating permission for two off-site camps by next week. In that case, we should be able to vaccinate more people,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. On Monday, close to 60,000 doses were administered from 340 CVCs in Kolkata, out of which 93 were given by private hospitals. There was an abrupt drop in the number last week. Nearly 2.9 lakh doses were administered on Monday from 2,065 sites across the state. “There is about 25% increase in the number of people coming to our hospital CVC. We also had an off-site camp in Kolkata after due approval from the health department,” said R Venkatesh regional director (East) Narayana Health. The three units of AMRI inoculated a little above 1,000 doses on Monday. The hospital is expecting approval for a few of its off-site camps in a couple of days.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Panel’s helping hand for family’s lone Covid survivor||KOLKATA: A traumatic instance of how Covid can destroy a family came up for hearing before the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) on Monday. A family from Kestopur lost three adult members to the virus in May, leaving the lone surviving adult member in mental agony and deep financial turmoil as well. The health commission on Monday ordered a hospital to refund Rs 4.3 lakh, as a discount, to the woman. All four adults from the Bagchi family — Sushanta Kumar (66), Lina (58), the duo’s son Subhamoy (34) and daughter in-law Madhumita — had tested positive for Covid in the first week of May. While Sushanta was the first to be admitted — to Horizon Lifeline Hospital in Moulali — on May 8, Lina and Subhamoy (34) were admitted to Lotus Hospital in Rajaharhat the next day. Madhumita, however, did not require hospital admission and stayed home with her fouryear-old son. “Unfortunately, all three admitted to hospital died during the course of treatment and relatives had to pool in funds to clear dues. We got an appeal to intervene as the lone surviving family member was left in financial distress because of the huge hospital bill,” said WBCERC chairperson Justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Banerjee. The three died within a span of six days. While Madhumita’s father-in-law died on May 22, her husband and mother-in-law succumbed to the infection on May 24 and 26 respectively. The bill at the Moulali hospital came to around Rs 2.8 lakh for 14 days while the bill at the Rajarhat hospital, for the other two, was about Rs 11 lakh. Ratan Saha, a relative of the family, wrote to the commission on behalf of Madhumita, appealing to see if there could be a discount on the treatment bills. Even though no relative of the Bagchi family appeared for the hearing on Monday, the commission took up the matter and asked Lotus Hospital to refund Rs 4.3 lakh. “We have called up the petitioner’s relatives and informed them of our verdict. The hospital, too, has agreed to refund the amount,” said Banerjee. The commission felt that charges for oxygen and a few other heads were higher than what they could have been. “The only surviving adult member is a homemaker who has to bring up a four-year-old child. She is extremely traumatised. Covid has left the family in tatters. None of us are in a position to speak on the tragedy,” said a relative. The hospital management in Rajarhat said they will consider refunding the amount on humanitarian grounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/panels-helping-hand-for-familys-lone-cov-survivor/articleshow/84154431.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rs 20 crore monsoon facelift for battered roads in Salt Lake||KOLKATA: Bidhananagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started monsoon road repair work in Salt Lake, using the Rs 30 crore funds that had been sanctioned by the state government for this purpose. The condition of roads in several places in the township, specially inside the blocks, have deteriorated with large potholes and craters following heavy rains. BMC board of administrators (BOA) member and Rajarhat New Town Trinamool MLA Tapas Chatterjee, who heads the BMC roads department, said that the civic body had earlier placed a Rs 47 crore road repair detail project report (DPR) for Salt Lake and Rajarhat before the elections as part of its second phase of road repair scheme. “Rs 30 crore was sanctioned out of which Rs 20 crore was for Salt Lake. Work order was issued earlier this year after which the election model code of conduct came in effect. The work under the scheme has now started,” Chatterjee said. Each year, condition of roads in the township deteriorates specially during the monsoons. BMC authorities had carried a pre-puja patch work last year, after the urban development department sanctioned about Rs 10 crore in two phases, but no thorough repairs took place due to the ongoing Covid pandemic. The authorities had earlier placed an overall road repair proposal for all its 41 wards across Salt Lake and Rajarhat as funds were being sanctioned in phases, civic officials said. Motorists, specially bikers often complain that they face inconvenience while moving on the battered stretches as craters or potholes appear out of nowhere leading to loss of balance. Residents said that the civic authorities need to monitor the condition of roads round the year. “It is really a problem while riding bikes. Craters or potholes suddenly pops up on the road and one always has to remain alert to avoid accident from happening,” said Avik Ray Chaudhuri, a resident of GD Block. “ The condition of roads in Salt Lake deteriorates each year during this time of the monsoons,” said Tamal Pal, a resident of HB block. Civic officials said that patch work to cover the most damaged spots on the roads is being done as and when the requirement arises throughout the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rs-20crore-monsoon-facelift-for-battered-roads-in-salt-lake/articleshow/84154445.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The plight of Mohammed, son of P K Rafeeq and Mariyumma of Mattool, came to light after his elder sister, Afrah, 15, who has also been diagnosed with the same genetic disorder, made a moving appeal on social media to help her brother. Afrah’s disease was not diagnosed in the early stages and she is now wheelchair-bound. A committee formed under Mattool grama panchayat had coordinated the efforts of the campaign which was taken over by social media over the past few days. Mattool panchayat president Farisha Abid said on Monday that they have received the required amount and urged well-wishers to stop the donations. “We were able to raise the money to save the life of the kid. There is no need for further contributions to this account set for the purpose. We are thankful to all kind hearts who contributed to save his life,” said Farisha, who also spearheaded the committee formed for the treatment. The kid was diagnosed with SMA type 3, a rare genetic disease that weakens the muscles and leads to walking difficulty, after early childhood. The child has to be given the gene therapy medication used to treat SMA before he reaches the age of 2. The treatment cost is so high due to the extremely expensive medicine for this rare condition. “ There are certain obstacles to bring the medicine . The MP and MLA have been contacted for further action,” said Farisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rs-18cr-in-6-days-world-unites-to-save-kannur-kid/articleshow/84154436.cms||---

The offices have been chosen based on the location of the villages. “The closest ward office has been selected for each village to reduce the hassle of citizens in reaching there,” said a senior official of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The merged villages are far away from the PMC headquarters in Shivajinagar. Residents of these areas would be able to get civic-related works done at the ward offices, claimed the civic officials. The ward offices work as an extended wing of the civic administration. Many of them have citizens facilitation centres. Works related to paying property tax, getting water tankers, birth and death certificates, and registration of marriages can be done there. Besides, various municipal permissions, including approval to building plans, can be obtained from these ward offices. “The power to take administrative decisions has been transferred to PMC from gram panchayats. Manpower in the civic administration would be increased to handle the extra work of these villages,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-connects-23-merged-villages-to-8-ward-offices/articleshow/84156661.cms||Prasad Kulkarni
---||Bareilly||UP: Sashastra Seema Bal jawan ‘assaulted’ by a group of Nepalese nationals at border, cops book 20 people||BAREILLY: A Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) jawan was allegedly assaulted by a group of Nepalese nationals near the border area in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri district when he confronted some of them for entering into the country through the forest area. The incident took place near a market in Gaurifanta area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday. Later, the jawan was rescued by a SSB team. The Armed Police Force (APF) of Nepal had also reached the spot. SSB commandant Munna Singh said that an FIR has been registered against 20 people. “The entry from this temporary route will be restricted to avoid such incidents in future,” Singh added. According to sources, the SSB jawan was not in uniform when the scuffle broke out with the group, which also had some women. Several Nepalese who gathered at the spot alleged that the jawan had “misbehaved” with a woman who runs a restaurant near the border. But SSB officials refuted the allegation. Singh told TOI, “We will look into the allegation leveled by the Nepalese. If it turns out to be true, we will take action against the jawan. The illegal market on the border was removed last year. But the movement from across the border was not restricted through this temporary route.” Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Lakhimpur Kheri, Vijay Dhull, told TOI, “We have registered an FIR under sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty), 186 (voluntarily obstructing any public servant in the discharge of his public functions), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ssb-jawan-assaulted-by-a-group-of-nepalese-nationals-at-border-cops-book-20-people/articleshow/84150163.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Goa||Goa: EDC allots Patto plot to RBI, bags Rs 30.3 crore||PANAJI: A single transaction of a prime piece of land in the state capital has hit a record as the Economic Development Corporation, the state-run non-banking finance company, allotted the 2,020 sq m patch at Patto Plaza to the Reserve Bank of India for Rs 30.3 crore, excluding GST and stamp duty. This allotment, at Rs 1.5 lakh per sq m, was completed during the last financial year, and brings to an end a long-pending legal dispute over the plot. The piece of land, near the LIC divisional office, was initially sold to Air India, which never utlised it. This sale is likely to help the financially-parched state government. “RBI has taken possession of the plot and plans to complete the construction within three years,” said K V Ballikar, managing director, EDC. EDC has not sold the land but has allotted the plot on lease or occupancy rights. For grants on lease or occupancy rights, restrictions exist over the sale of the land or change of use, since the ownership vests with EDC. Aside from the Rs 30.3 crore collected, EDC will also collect regular revenue through annual rent. “The total cost of the transaction is Rs 35.17 crore, which is inclusive of 18% GST. Apart from this, the Goa government got Rs 1.78 crore as stamp duty and registration charges,” said Ballikar. Though EDC received larger offers from other bidders, the state government decided to allot the plot to RBI, which is currently functioning from rented premises at Patto. The land transaction has seen EDC’s profits jump by 57%. There are three more plots at the EDC patto complex that are under dispute with the estate officer, and EDC is confident that it will be able to settle the cases in due time. EDC’s provisional profit after tax for 2020-21 stands at Rs 63 crore, as against Rs 40 crore in 2019-20. Ballikar said that while the earlier plots were sold at a no-loss-no-profit basis, EDC has gained due to the sharp escalation in real estate prices. “EDC is getting the benefits of late. The plots were earlier allotted at a no-loss-no-profit basis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/edc-allots-patto-plot-to-rbi-bags-rs-30-3cr/articleshow/84156662.cms||Newton Sequeira

If voices of criticism and dissent cannot be expressed against political leaders, we are no longer democracy but a dictatorship,” said Sisodia. The deputy CM also called up the student and told her that he was going to make sure the fine gets cancelled as it was unfair, members of All India Students’ Association (AISA) said. In his letter, Sisodia said that “no action should be taken against any student for expressing a viewpoint that is different from the government or the university, unless the statement damages the social fabric of our country or is against our constitutional values.” He further said that if any student was expressing her viewpoint against the government, then it should have been first brought to the notice of the government before initiating any action. “A university should be a safe space for students to freely voice their opinions, debate and develop their points of views. No student should be punished for exercising the right to free speech within the university space.” The deputy CM stated that “if they do not allow students the opportunity to critique, to comment and to develop their own voice, we set up our country for a bleak future where people will lack courage to stand up against injustice.” Sisodia asked the principal secretary to investigate the matter and make sure the student does not face any action for her remarks. TOI had earlier reported about AISA member and 2nd year MA student Neha being fined after holding an “online protest” against the university’s fee hike and reservation policy during the varsity’s live broadcast of its December 2020 convocation. “The people’s CM does not have the time to listen to the students, what alternative is the student left with? Fight the government, fight oppression or study, please help us out brother CM,” she had written with the hashtag #AntiStudentKejriwal. AUD’s proctor office, in its June 30 order, stated that the student must pay a fine as punishment for her use of “slur and disrespectful remark.” Neha told TOI on Monday that “Manish ji asked about my studies and said that if any problem arises, I could contact him directly.” “We have withdrawn the fine,” said AUD’s public relations officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-orders-fine-on-student-to-be-revoked/articleshow/84156700.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Ashes of Covid victims to give life to plants in Bhadbhada crematorium||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday planted saplings at Ram Van being developed at Bhadbhada crematorium. Management of Bhadbhada crematorium has decided to use mortal remains of ashes of Covid victims left after cremation as fertilizer for the plantation on the campus. Large number of cremations due to the second surge of Covid-19 had posed a challenge for the crematoriums as several tonnes of mortal remains in ash were left on the premises. These are being used as fertilizer for the plantation Bhadbhada crematorium has witnessed scores of cremations in the last couple of months, due to which around 4-5 truckloads of ash were left on the campus. As the ash was mostly of the Covid-infected bodies, it was not possible to transport it to other places. “There was a fear among people, so transporting this ash to any other place could be an issue. We did not even want to put it in any open place or throw it in a water body,” said secretary, Bhadbhada management, Mamtesh Sharma. He said, each cremated body has left around 50 kg ash. “Family members take home some mortal remains for rites. Disposal of rest of the ash is the responsibility of the crematorium which is a cumbersome task. As the cremated human body ash is an excellent fertilizer, it could be used for plantation. So, we decided to work on it,” said Sharma. He said it is being used on 12,000-hectare land earmarked for this purpose. “We spread the ash in the designated area. After that we put a layer of soil on top. This was the best time for doing this, after a round of 1-2 showers the land was ideal for plantation.” Plants of 70 species found in Madhya Pradesh will be planted in Ram Van through Japanese technique called Miyawaki. In this technique, various native species of plants are planted close to each other so that the greens receive sunlight only from the top and grow upwards rather than sideways. As a result, the plantation becomes approximately 30 times denser, grows 10 times faster and becomes maintenance-free after a span of 3 years. With this method of plantation, an urban forest can grow within a short span of 20-30 years while a conventional forest takes around 200-1300 years to grow naturally. On the occasion, the chief minister Chouhan’s wife, Sadhana Singh also planted a sapling. Crematorium management has even started contacting the families who are willing to plant saplings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ashes-of-covid-victims-to-be-used-as-fertiliser-at-bhadbhada/articleshow/84152515.cms||Ramendra Singh

Speaking at the launch of his 'ashirvad yatra' from Sultanpur village near Hajipur in Vaishali, Chirag said he was confident about the success of his yatra as people from different sections of the society bestowed their blessings upon him. “I have received more response from the people than what I had expected,” he said. Taking a dig at his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, who spearheaded the coup in the party last month, Chirag said he (Paras) should visit Hajipur to have a glimpse of the crowd that gathered at his father’s ‘karmabhoomi’. Paras currently represents Hajipur Lok Sabha seat. Chirag accused Paras of betraying both the party and the family. “He not only left me in the lurch after my father’s death, but also alienated me from my cousin Prince Raj, the LJP MP from Samastipur,” he added. The Mahatma Gandhi Setu, which connects north Bihar with the state capital, remained chock-a-block due to Chirag’s cavalcade. When asked about huge gathering at the ‘ashirvad yatra’ in violation of the Covid guidelines, Vaishali SP Maneesh said he had gone to Muzaffarpur to attend an official meeting with IG of Tirhut range. Earlier, Chirag received a rousing welcome from his supporters on arrival from Delhi at the Patna airport. Later, Chirag left for the Patna high court crossing in an open car where he was supposed to pay floral tributes to Dr B R Ambdkar at his statue. Not being allowed inside, he along with his supporters sat on a dharna there for nearly 10 minutes before leaving for Hajipur. “The government can stop me from paying tribute to Dr Ambedkar, but not from following his path. The party had informed the district administration about my scheduled visit, but no step was taken to keep the gate of the park open,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-confident-of-his-ashirvad-yatra-success/articleshow/84154490.cms||Ramashankar

Last week, the BMC resumed cutting of trees in the garden and on the footpath after the Bombay HC on June 30 vacated the interim stay restraining them (BMC) from cutting any more trees at the garden for the coastal road project. Activist Zoru Bhathena who had organised the protest on ground and also via video conferencing said when they reached Tata Garden around 9.30 pm, officials from D ward as well as the Coastal Road were there too. “We had gathered to mourn the loss of green cover. This is despite an alternative of taking the adjacent site instead of the garden. However, little did we expect that BMC officials would be there to hear us out,” said Bhathena. D ward assistant municipal commissioner Prashant Gaikwad said that the BMC chief had directed them to hear out the citizens’ concerns. “We tried explaining that the alternative suggested by them is not feasible. We have decided to arrange a meeting for them with the technical consultant soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-officials-turn-up-for-dialogue-at-late-night-tata-gardens-protest/articleshow/84156828.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Goa||In Goa, just 8% of govt schools have internet||PANAJI: Even as school education has moved online for over a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the full extent of the state’s problem with internet connectivity was recently revealed, as a Union education ministry report stated that just 8.4% of the 827 government schools in Goa have an internet connection. In this aspect, Goa fares worse than the national average for government schools, which is 11.5%, according to the Unified district information system for education (U-DISE) report, 2019-20. This makes the state’s coverage for government schools on this parameter comparable to those in Bihar and Chhattisgarh. Some, like Kerala and Delhi, boast of over 85% coverage. Over 750 of Goa’s 827 government schools are primary institutions, which are largely without computers or internet connectivity, appearing to be largely the factor in dragging the state down on this parameter. This also throws light on the conditions in which government primary school teachers may have been left to connect with students to continue teaching online during the pandemic. The wide gap between facilities in government-run and private aided and unaided ones is visible from the U-DISE 2019-20 data. Over 76% aided schools and almost 80% unaided schools from primary to higher secondary level have internet connectivity. This coverage of internet facilities for aided and unaided schools is among the top six states and UTs in the country. When it comes to availability of an operational computer in the school, only 17.6% of Goa’s government schools have one, also worse than the national average of 28.5%. In comparison, nearly 90% aided schools and 93.5% unaided schools in Goa have a functional computer or computers available. According to the data, Goa is among the best in availability of basics in schools, with 100% across government and private managements covered with facilities like electricity, drinking water, hand wash, functional toilets and separate toilets for boys and girls. All the around 1,500 schools, including government ones, also have a library of their own. Except six schools in Goa, all others have tap or treated water as its drinking water source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-goa-just-8-of-govt-schools-have-internet/articleshow/84156701.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Nagpur||50 units to be set up to make cow dung paint in Vid||Nagpur: Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s office is aiming to set up 50 plants for producing an eco-friendly, non-toxic paint from cow dung named ‘Khadi Prakritik Paint’. On Tuesday, the minister virtually inaugurated the model plant in Jaipur, set up by the Kumarappa National Handmade Paper Institute, an autonomous body under the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) and the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME).“About 30 students from the region had already taken up training at Jaipur where the first plant was set up. Another batch’s training is already under way. In the first three months, we’re targeting 50 plants in Vidarbha and have already placed orders for 12 units. Our office would be directly monitoring the setting up of such plants and would be providing help to the youth,” Gadkari’s advisor Sudhir Diwe told TOI.The ministry would be helping the youth to get loans under the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme, where they get a subsidy of 25% in urban areas and 35% in rural.Speaking at the inaugural function, the city MP hoped to set up such factories in over 6.5 lakh villages across the country which he said would boost the rural economy. He also ordered 500 litres of distemper and emulsion for painting his entire building near Hotel Radisson Blu from inside and outside. Gadkari assured the KVIC to become a brand ambassador of the product., according to Diwe.Explaining the advantages of the unique paint, Diwe said it was made up of 30% of cow dung and is 60% cheaper in comparison to other brands. “Since the cow dung is available in ample quantities, the manufacturing unit could be set up in rural areas. It would ease the burden from the urban areas and generate a lot of employment in villages. Additionally, the cattle wouldn’t be sent to slaughterhouses due to the demand for cow-dung and thus would be saved,” he said.According to him, the plant requires an investment of just Rs 12-Rs15 lakh and could be set up in a small area of 1,500 sq feet. “We will help the youth in arranging 90% funds on loan if they are willing to invest 10% which is just Rs 2.5 lakh. Their products would be purchased by the KVIC and would be sold across their stores in India. They can also sell their products independently. During the inauguration, the minister said he felt happier this time than opening the Worli-Bandra Sea Link and Mumbai-Pune Express highway,” the advisor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/50-units-to-be-set-up-to-make-cow-dung-paint-in-vid/articleshow/84186369.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The 30-year-old Jivu Solanki’s husband Vasant was detained on Monday after her brother lodged a complaint at Kuwadava Road police station. Police said that Solanki consumed acid on Sunday morning and was taken to Rajkot Civil Hospital and later referred to a private hospital where she died in the evening. Vasant told cops that he had an argument with his wife over a financial issue after which she consumed acid. On Monday, however, the deceased’s brother Bharat Shiyal approached police alleging that Vasant had been harassing and beating her. In his complaint Shiyal also stated that Vasant used to often beat the victim suspecting her of having extra-marital affairs. On Sunday morning too, Vasant had called Shiyal asking him to take Solanki with him. Vasant also said that he wanted to divorce her, the complaint stated. Based on Shiyal’s complaint, an offence of abetment to suicide and cruelty was registered. “The accused and the deceased had a three-year-old son and she was again pregnant with twins,” said a police official.

---||Nagpur||Jeweller looted of Rs four lakh, 70 tola gold at gunpoint in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Four masked robbers decamped with Rs4 lakh cash and nearly 70 tolas of gold after threatening jeweller Ashish Naware at gunpoint in Nagsen Nagar near Bhim Square, Jaripatka, on Monday. The thieves thrashed Naware before tying him up and pasting tape on his mouth. The CCTV footage of the cameras installed inside the jewellery shop caught the robbery live, despite an attempt made by the robbers to disconnect the wiring and dismantle the setup. It’s learnt that two thieves sauntered inside the shop, posing as customers, before grabbing Naware. Another one hurriedly sneaked inside the shop before pulling the shutter down. The fourth accomplice, having a school bag on back, was captured in the CCTV keeping an eye on the busy road in front of the shop, with the locality teeming with passersby and vehicles. A customer had paid Rs1.5 lakh in cash to Naware earlier in the day, which is now being probed by the cops for possible leads. Naware told the cops that a woman had come to his shop on Saturday under the pretext of seeing some jewellery, accompanied by a man. The voice of one of the thieves sounded similar to Naware to that of the man who had come with the woman, two days back. As per Naware, the burglars were speaking in Hindi among themselves. The incident, which shook the locality, came to fore only after the robbers sneaked away 10-15 minutes later, leaving the jeweller bleeding and shattered. After freeing himself Naware rushed out of his shop, seeking help from another shop owner, who took him to Jaripatka police station. The thieves, who had come on two bikes, fled towards Kamptee Road and are likely to have left Maharashtra. CCTV footage of the cameras along the highways caught them heading towards the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh state border. It’s learnt that the robbers abandoned one of the cellphones used by them near Bhilgaon. A section of the police feels the move was to ensure that the cops were misled into believing that they were in the vicinity, allowing them time to leave the state. Teams from Jaripatka police station and crime branch are on the chase in MP and Chhattisgarh, apart from resorting to different techniques to recover CCTV footages and identify the two bikes used.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jeweller-looted-of-rs4-lakh-70-tola-gold-at-gunpoint/articleshow/84156586.cms||Soumitra Bose

He also said there will be no increase in tuition fee and no additional fee will be charged by schools except tuition fee. He was addressing a crisis management meeting. He said that many parents told him that due to the closure of the school, studies are not being done offline, but the fees are being increased. The chief minister has clarified that no school will charge any fee other than the tuition fee. School associations have objected to CM Chouhan's announcement on tuition fee. "Schools are closed for the last 15 months, but expenses are on, the government has not given any concession or help to private schools, but has announced to take a one-sided decision like taking tuition fees only in this session," said Babu Thomas, secretary, Association of Unaided Private Schools,MP. He added that school owners have unanimously decided that if the government issues such an order, then from the coming Monday July 12, 2021, all private schools will be closed indefinitely and teachers will come on the streets. "It may be noted that no state government in the country has issued such an order and the few states that issued such orders they have been stayed by the High Court. This announcement of the state government is in defiance of the directions of the Supreme Court. All private school organizations of the state have opposed this decision," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pvt-schools-can-charge-only-tuition-fee-no-hike-cm/articleshow/84154583.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra task force expects further drop in Covid cases in 2 weeks||PUNE: The state task force and the health department expect the Covid infections to decline in Maharashtra in the next two weeks if no new variant of concern emerges and people strictly adhere to protocols related to the pandemic amid stepped-up vaccination in districts with more active cases. “The thick tail of the second wave of the pandemic should reduce in Maharashtra if strict covid protocols are followed and districts with high numbers of active cases ensure necessary steps to curtail the spread provided no new variant of concern emerges,” state task force member Dr Shashank Joshi on Monday told TOI. He said both Maharashtra and Kerala were still reporting 9,000-10,000 infections on a daily basis and the country was recording over 40,000 cases. “This needs to go down further,” Dr Joshi said. State surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate said active cases in Maharashtra should decline in the next two weeks, as has been the trend across the country. “This might touch the baseline by the end of July with the overall cases declining, barring in the 10 districts where the infections were still high,” he said. “There are not many Delta-plus variant cases in the state. But a close watch is being kept,” Dr Awate said. On the of a third wave of the pandemic, he said, “It’s too early to say anything about the third wave, especially its timing and magnitude. But we should not let our guard down,” he said. Maharashtra currently has over 1.2 lakh active cases and nearly 34% are in hospitals. A health official said the condition of the hospitalized patients was 13%, while the overall recovery rate in the state was nearly 96%. The state’s weekly positivity rate till July 3 was 4.5%. Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Buldhana, Pune (rural), Palghar and Raigad recorded test positivity rates higher than 4.5%, a report prepared by the state public health department revealed. Kolhapur till July 3 topped the state with a 10% positivity rate, followed by Satara (9.1%). The lowest positivity in the state was registered in Gondia (0.29%), followed by Nanded (0.36%) and Jalgaon (0.4%). Dr Joshi said the authorities have told officials of the nine districts with weekly positivity rates higher than 4.5% to boost their testing levels, contact tracing and pace of vaccine coverage and also ensure proper containment measures. Health experts said the state had reached the plateau in terms of Covid cases during the past two-three weeks when the daily infections oscillated between 8,000 and 10,000 with a test positivity rate at around 5%. “The target should be to go below 5%. Though the daily cases have been declining in some districts during the past two weeks, all districts in the state should be in the same bracket, as observed during the first wave of the pandemic,” public health expert Dr R Jotkar said. “The overall state average might be a positive sign, but one needs to keep a close watch on districts such as Kolhapur and Satara with high positivity rate. A close surveillance on the (virus) mutants is a must, while vaccination and strict adherence to the preventive measures are the only way ahead. Any violation of the Covid protocols should be dealt with strict punishment with experts warning of a possible third wave of the pandemic, as witnessed in other countries,” he said. State health director Dr Archana Patil has said the districts that have high positivity rate should improve testing, contact tracing, identify hotspots and ensure that vaccination was intensified and that there was no major gathering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-expects-further-drop-in-covid-cases-in-next-fortnight/articleshow/84156748.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The beneficiaries said they have been visiting the hospital for the last week to get the second dose. Some of them have been visiting for more than a week. They were told about vaccine shortage or by the time their turn came, the vaccine stock was exhausted. Seva Hospital has administered the highest number of vaccines in the district as per the officials and is a preferred centre due to the adequate number of stock available. Every day, Seva Hospital can administer around 600 to 800 jabs of the vaccines. An elderly woman, who joined the joined the protest, said, “I am getting text messages to get the second dose at the earliest. It has been 102 days since I took the first dose.

District guardian minister Satej Patil, however, warned that the shops would be shut again if the positivity rate for the week crossed 10% in Kolhapur city. In a video message, Patil said: “The decision has been taken to provide relief to the small traders and vendors who make their living through daily earnings. We don’t want the city to slip into the Level 4 of Covid restrictions, which bans the non-essential shops from opening, again. The decision to allow shops to open is not permanent. It will be reviewed at the end of the week.” The government had accepted the proposal sent by acting district collector in-charge Kadambari Balkawade seeking Kolhapur city to be considered as a separate administrative unit. The city had a positivity rate slightly below 10%, however, it is again hovering around 11-12%. Earlier, there was a proposal to consider Kolhapur city and 42 nearby villages as a single administrative unit. However, the government has approved only the shops in Kolhapur city to open. The traders, meanwhile, were in a celebratory moon Monday. The Rajarampuri traders’ association distributed sweets and cut a cake in the Janta Bazaar chowk. Lalit Gandhi, the head of the association, said, “This is a victory of our protest. Our shops were closed for so long, but why did the Covid count not come down? Though the government has given us permission only for five days on a trial basis, we will ensure that all Covid safety norms are strictly followed.” Sayyam Rathod, the owner of a gold shop in the Gujari market, said, “The decision to reopen our shops from Monday had already been taken by the traders. However, the administration granted us official permission and we are thankful. We cleaned the premises and performed a puja after opening of our shop.”  Aniket Patil, a customersaid, “For the past month, I needed to replace my bike tyre. The first thing I did on Monday was to buy a tyre.

---||Allahabad||Around 25,000 ineligible ration cards to be cancelled soon in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: Around 25,000 ration cards, which belong to well-off individuals of the district, would soon be cancelled by the district administration's department of food and civil supply. Close scrutiny of these ration cards releveled that these families had procured the ration cards for other purposes rather than purchasing subsidised foodgrains from the Public Distribution System (PDS). The families have made their ration cards for getting official work done like opening bank accounts, getting a power connection or getting a passport made and have never procured any ration against these cards from their assigned fair price shops. This in turn allowed the kotedars or the fair price shop licensed owners to sell the allotted ration in black, who also ensured that the ration cards of such families or individuals did not get cancelled till now. Now by preparing a list of the names of such ration cardholders, the preparations to cancel their ration card too has been intensified by the department. This is being done so that ration cards can be made for those who are in real need of the facility of the government. Instructions have been given to prepare the list of all such individuals from the district supply office and provide it to the field inspectors within a month. Talking to TOI, ADM Civil Supplies Jitendra Kumar Kushwaha said that scrutiny to identify ineligible persons for ration cards was underway in the district and ration cards of such persons would be cancelled. The exclusion parameters for a ration card for urban areas include all income taxpayers and those whose household members’ income is more than Rs 3 lakh per year, or if a member of the family alone or with others owns a self-earned residential plat of 100 sq metres or self-build house of 100 sq metre carpet area or owns 80 sq metres of commercial plot. Also, households possessing four-wheeler motorized vehicles, 5KVA or above AC set, one or more weapon licenses are also excluded. Likewise, the exclusion parameters for a ration card for rural areas include all income taxpayers, household members’ income more than Rs 2 lakh per year, or if a member of the family alone or with others owns an irrigated land of 5 acres or more (barring southern region of Bundelkhand’s Kaimur hills in Sonbhadra district where the limit is 7.5 acres). Also, households possessing four-wheeler motorized vehicles, tractors, harvesters, AC set, one or more weapon licenses are also excluded. Sources told that in the initial phase, Aadhaar was not mandatory for making ration cards. Taking advantage of the same, a large number of well-off individuals have got their ration cards made. Later, the same individuals have linked their Aadhar with the ration cards after complying with kotedars. There are around 10.50 lakhs ration cards in the district whereas the number of Antyodaya cardholders is more than 86,000. Over 45 lakh units are mentioned in these ration cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/around-25000-ineligible-ration-cards-to-be-cancelled-soon/articleshow/84153710.cms||Rajeev Mani

---||Delhi||Covid’s latest unpleasant surprise: Sore gallbladder||NEW DELHI: It’s been more than a year since Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic. But the disease continues to surprise the medical community with its unique manifestations. Recently, doctors at a city hospital came across a 48-year-old woman who had developed inflammation in the gallbladder post-Covid. Normally, such inflammation is caused due to stones that block the tube leading from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Doctors at Moolchand Medcity Hospital told TOI this woman did not have stones or any history of gallbladder-related disease that would predispose her to the complication. “She was admitted to our hospital with Covid-related complications in May. Two weeks later, she developed abdominal pain and fever that did not subside despite medications. Ultrasound confirmed inflammation in gallbladder, but no stones. That’s why we suspect that the complication is a post-Covid manifestation,” said Dr Sachin Ambekar, consultant, department of laparoscopic and minimal access surgery. Ambekar added that the woman was managed with intravenous antibiotics and other supportive measures. “If the inflammation in gallbladder wasn’t diagnosed in time, it could have led to perforation in the organ, which could prove fatal,” he explained. The surgeon said Covid-19 was a Pandora’s box and no symptoms should be disregarded. “Initially, it was thought that the disease affects the lungs only. But we have seen how it can affect multiple organs, including the liver, pancreas, small intestine and even gallbladder. It is, therefore, advisable that people should be watchful of symptoms, such as persistent pain in the abdomen, rectal bleeding and extreme weakness among others,” said Ambekar. Acute inflammation of the gallbladder post-Covid has been reported from other countries too. Doctors from University Hospitals of Geneva reported at least two such cases, as mentioned in Journal of Hepatology. “SARS-CoV-2 infection can mimic acalculous acute cholecystitis, an inflammatory disease of the gallbladder; viral RNA detection indicates direct vesicular involvement, while the exact pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Differential diagnosis can be challenging and rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2, and potentially conservative management might make a difference to patient outcome,” the doctors noted in their case report. Doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital recently reported infection caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) in recovered Covid patients leading to rectal bleeding. “Until now, it had affected only immunocompromised patients, post-transplant, cancer, AIDS, etc, but this is the first time in India that cases of CMV-related rectal bleeding in patients who have recovered from Covid-19 have been reported,” the hospital claimed. On Monday, Aakash Healthcare said nearly 50 patients had been admitted to their hospital recently with gastrointestinal problems, including colitis, colon ulcers, liver abscess (pus in the liver) and pancreatitis post-Covid. “These post-Covid complications should receive due attention because they can emerge as additional complications in people with respiratory failures and pneumonia,” said Dr Sharad Malhotra, head, gastroenterology department. Covid’s effects on other organs, like the brain, heart and kidneys, are also well documented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covids-latest-unpleasant-surprise-sore-gallbladder/articleshow/84156811.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

He also attacked the Nitish Kumar government and said murders have been taking place at four to five places daily in Bihar. Addressing the party’s 25th foundation day function at Patna from Delhi virtually, Lalu also visited his pet theme of communalism. “After Ayodhya, they (NDA) have now started talking about Mathura. To grab power, they can rupture social fabric,” he said, and appealed to the RJD workers “to work for making the social fabric strong”. Lalu is seriously ill and out on bail in the fodder scam case. He is recuperating at the official residence of his daughter and Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti in Delhi. Addressing the RJD workers and leaders after three and a half years, Lalu also formally anointed Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the party’s leader, noting that he had the support of both the party elders and youths. “… If Tejashwi and Rabri had not brought me to AIIMS Delhi from Ranchi, I would have died,” he said, in an apparent reference as to why the younger son is his heir apparent. Lalu also lamented that he could not take part in the 2020 assembly elections. “They can destroy me, but I will never bow to them,” the septuagenarian leader said. What caught the imagination of the concerned was Lalu’s assertion that he would “soon return to the state” and visit every district besides his prophesy that the RJD has a “bright future”. “I am still under medical care and there are some restrictions on my diets. Otherwise, I am all right, improving,” Lalu said. He also praised the “speech” of his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, pointing out that it had “dum” (strength to improve). “I was worried about Tejashwi’s performance during the assembly elections. At such a young age, he took on them all and the party won so many (75) assembly seats,” Lalu said, adding that Tejashwi had set the agenda for the polls by announcing to give 10,000 jobs. “The BJP people promised jobs in lakhs. Why don’t they fulfil the promise,” Lalu asked. Lalu was not as harsh on Nitish as everyone had expected. He, however, took a jibe at Nitish, saying he “had vouched” (with the United Front leaders in 1991) to make him the Union agriculture minister. Lalu also said that he had seen five PMs and helped them become one, including V P Singh, I K Gujral, H D Deve Gowda and Manmohan Singh. The RJD chief referred to the rise in petrol prices: “If the prices of diesel and petrol had skyrocketed under our government, we would not have been allowed to come out of our houses. But today people are helpless. The current petrol price has left behind even the price of ‘ghee’.” In Delhi, he also cut a cake with wife Rabri Devi and paid homage to LJP founder and “our friend” late Ram Vilas Paswan. Lalu’s political career from his student days in the 1970s has been marked by ups and downs. The worst was his incarceration for the first time in the fodder scam case in 1997. Yet, he surprised his critics by bouncing back to the centre stage. Apprehending the “return of Lalu”, BJP and JD(U) immediately pounced on him. BJP chief spokesman Rajiv Ranjan called the Lau-Rabri rule (1990-2005) as the “atank raj” when sense of fear and terror stalked the land, marked as it was by massacres and flight of businessmen, industrialists, doctors, students and youths to other states. JD(U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar said, “The birth of the RJD was the result of corruption charges against Lalu.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-vows-to-return-to-state-soon/articleshow/84154588.cms||Abhay Singh

A total stretch of 16 km in three locations has been shortlisted for the project which is part of Uttar Pradesh government’s “herbal belt” initiative. Under the project, the UP government plans to develop 800 km of roads in the state as a "herbal belt” with trees that provide raw materials for medicine and prevent land erosion. The government had said that the initiative would also promote biodiversity while keeping air free from pollution and bacteria. According to officials of the Public Works Department (Agra), 610 herbal saplings will be planted in three roads that connect rural areas to Agra city. While 170 saplings will be planted in Bichpuri-Achnera Road, Bah-Kachoraghat Road will get 190 saplings and Shamshabad-Rajakhera Road will get 250 saplings. PWD chief engineer Satya Prakash told TOI they would start with planting saplings of peepal, Indian blackberry (jamun), neem and mulberry next week. “Besides beautification of the landscape, these trees will help in reducing pollution caused by vehicles. The herbal trees will also provide raw material for ayurvedic medicines and prevent soil erosion,” he said. Each sapling will be covered by iron tree guards to protect them from stray animals, said PWD superintendent engineer Yogesh Pawar. “The herbal road project is an eco-friendly initiative of the state government. Duties have been assigned to officials to ensure adequate care of the saplings," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-to-get-herbal-roads-with-medicinal-trees-on-both-sides/articleshow/84150309.cms||Deepak Lavania

The suicide of MPSC aspirant Swapnil Lonkar last week has brought to fore the plight of many aspirants. An online campaign started hours after Lonkar’s death had students demanding that the commission start the process as soon as possible. Lonkar, who had cleared the MPSC written examination in 2019, was found hanging from the ceiling fan at his Phursungi residence on Wednesday. In his suicide note, Lonkar said pressure had built up due to growing uncertainty in the MPSC exams schedules and an overall pandemic situation. Following his suicide, the state government formed an expert committee announced by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that would suggest ways to avoid impending delays after the exams are conducted. Mandar Patki and IAS of 2019 batch, now assistant collector in Amravati, said, “Swapnil Lonkar’s case is ugly reality of competitive examinations. To all aspirants out there, think a thousand times before taking any extreme decision, talk to someone, try to formulate a Plan B and work on it. MPSC should not be an end in itself.” Prasad Nawale, an aspirant, said, “The government must take the exam seriously. The delay in the process is adding to the pressure youths face. We have been waiting for the interviews for years but the government seems incompetent.” Mukesh Gade, another aspirant, said, “First, it was the pandemic, then, it was the reservation issue and in between them we have waited for two years for the interviews to be conducted. We hope that this suicide is an eye opener for the government and it takes immediate steps in the positive direction and saves lives.” The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad on Monday staged a protest at the collectorate to condemn the death of Lonkar. “We have staged a protest today in order to ensure such a sad incident does not take place again. If the government keeps neglecting the aspirants, then we will scale up this protest.” There was high drama at the collectorate when an aspirant tried to jump from the floor into the security net to express her disappointment. She was rescued by the staff members. The police took custody of two aspirants who had jumped into the security net.  A group of candidates from Aurangabad who have already cleared the examination but are yet to receive postings has renewed the demand for job letters at the earliest. The candidates said that having no job despite cracking the examination has left them heartbroken. They said that they were facing pressure from family and society due to their unemployment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pressure-builds-as-mpsc-aspirants-wait-for-exam-interviews-results/articleshow/84154596.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The bus station in the heart of the city is a spartan facility. It will now be transformed into a shed with pillars reflecting the heritage leitmotif. The Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS) will soon begin the process of demolishing the old bus station. Officials in the AMTS said that the project cost for renovating the bus station will be about Rs 6.30 crore. To meet the requirements of electricity at the station, a solar power setup will come up at the existing zero platform. The officials said that the main building will have the Sidi Saiyyed jali patterns on the windows. Also, the famous shaking minarets will feature on the pillars. The officials said that the plan is to paint the building with the images of the heritage monuments of the city. The elevation in the building will also have a huge jali. The control cabins at each platform will wear the heritage look. The windows of the control cabins will bear the replicas of heritage monuments.  The officials said that since there are several monuments in the 2,000 metre radius of the station, an approval from the Archaeological Survey of India was needed for the renovation. Hence the project, which was sanctioned in 2017 at the cost of Rs 5.72 crore, was delayed for over four years. The officials said that the project will take one year to complete and is likely to be ready by August 2022. The officials said that the station will have a raised platform of about nine inches and hence a ramp will be constructed to give easy access to people with disabilities. The officials said that the last two platforms and the canteen will be demolished and make way for parking space. New platforms will come up on the sides of the station. The officials said that the state government had in 2016-17 allocated Rs 1.5 crore for the renovation while in 2017-18 another Rs 2.5 crore was granted. The officials said that in the early 2000s, the Walled City Revitalization Project was planned and it was then decided to renovate the Lal Darwaza station. But the project kept changing and later it was decided to house an AMC office on the first floor of the facility and the bus station on the ground floor. However, finally the AMC has resolved to have only the station at the facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-plans-a-heritage-trip-for-iconic-lal-darwaza/articleshow/84156791.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Ahmedabad||1.6 lakh likely to apply for Class 1 under RTE||AHMEDABAD: Nearly 1.6 lakh children are likely to apply for admissions in Class 1 under the Right To Education (RTE) Act. “About 158,751 students have filled up forms for seeking admissions under RTE Act till Monday evening. These numbers are expected to go up by another few thousands till Tuesday,” said a source in the education department. According to the act, 25% of the total school admissions in Class 1 for underprivileged students should be under RTE. The department has begun the admission process for students under the RTE Act from June 25 and the last day for application is July 6. The entire process is being held online. The schools have already started from June 7 for the new academic year and the RTE students who are enrolled this year are likely to be behind by one and half to two months. “This year about 75,000 students are likely to get admissions in schools under the RTE Act,” said a source. As many as 40,530 seats in Gujarat meant for candidates under the provisions of the RTE Act were not given to such students in last two years. This was stated in data tabled by the government in the state assembly earlier this year in response to a question by a Congress MLA seeking information on RTE admissions in the state in last two years. For the year 2020-21, 3,72,411 students were enrolled in the primary section. Against 90,738 seats that were to be reserved for RTE candidates, only 71,527 got admission, according to data tabled in the assembly.

---||Delhi||New high: How drinking experience will change in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Buying liquor in Delhi promises to become a very different experience soon with the state government’s excise policy for the 2021-22 stating that every liquor retail vend is to provide an air-conditioned, walk-in experience with no crowding at the counters. Also, licensees have to ensure there are no snack or food outlets operating right outside the shop to dissuade people from drinking at the spot itself. While Delhi government had floated tenders for licences for the 32 zones that the new excise policy divides the city into, the policy itself was put in public domain only on Monday after informing Delhi High Court. The new policy allows bars in hotels, clubs and restaurants in Delhi to operate till 3am and also to serve Indian or foreign liquor in any area within the licensed premises, including the terrace, balcony or lower area, so long as the liquor serving was screened off from public view. Till now, bars in restaurants and clubs were permitted to serve liquor till 1am and only bars within star hotels could function 24x7. Bars have also been permitted to play any type of entertainment or performance, including music and musical instruments, dancing or singing by professionals or deejays, live bands and karaoke on its premises. There will be no restriction on the shelf life of opened liquor bottles at the bar counter. The priority of the new policy is to promote consumer choice and availability of popular as well as niche brands. Delhi government also aims to curb smuggling and bootlegging and ensure adequate spread of retail vends in Delhi to leave no area unserved or underserved. To ensure this, a new licence — L-7Z — will be granted to each zone operator/allottee through e-tender and to the highest bidder per zone. The 272 wards in 68 assembly constituencies are divided into 30 zones, with 9-10 wards in each zone and a maximum of 27 retail vends and an average of three retail vends in each ward. Each zone operator will have to run two 'mandatory vends' in each ward allocated and the remaining vends will be 'freehold vends' that can be run anywhere within that zone. A total of 29 vends will be allocated for New Delhi and Delhi Cantonment assembly constituencies and 10 retail vends will be at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. The policy states that every vend shall be air conditioned, well-lit and designed to provide an enjoyable walk-in experience. Customers will not be allowed to crowd outside a vend or on the pavement and buy through the counter, it says. Each customer shall be given access inside the vend and the entire selection and sale process shall be completed within the vend, which will have closed glass doors. The licensee will have to install CCTV cameras inside and outside the vend, apart from adequate security arrangements as the vend itself is responsible for the law and order and security around the premises. In case the shop proves a nuisance for the neighbourhood and a complaint is received by Delhi government, the licence of the vend is likely to be cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-high-how-drinking-experience-will-change/articleshow/84154645.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Union Jal Shakti minister Gajender Singh Shekhawat and MP Ravi Kishan were also present on the occasion. “In 2009 when Khorabar area became a part of Gorakhpur parliamentary area, people demanded a regulator at Tarkulani pump station. This regulator which has started operating from today, has the capacity of pumping out the entire water from Ramgarhtal lake. Such a high capacity regulator will help to stop waterlogging in the area bringing relief to the people,” said the CM. “Fertilizer plant will also be ready in October for inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said the CM adding, “Once Ramgarhtal area was a centre of crime and now it has been turned into a tourist centre.” On the achievements of the government, the CM said, “The government works with double force and brings happiness to the people when they have double engine power of the state and the Centre both.” “For the last 16 months, the entire world is in the clutches of coronavirus and facing both health and earning issues. Under the apt leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, good work has been done in dealing with Covid pandemic,” he added. “In comparison to the US, India has four times more population but more Covid-19 deaths were reported in the US. They have a better infrastructure and here too good work is being done in combat Covid-19,” he said. Saying that the government bulldozer is running on the heart of the mafia, the CM asked the people if they would oppose the mafia, to which people answered ‘yes’. The CM further said that development will take place in the state and action will be taken against destructive elements. Union Jal Shakti minister Shekhawat said that 99 irrigation projects are underway in the country to irrigate 30 lakh hectares area. In Uttar Pradesh, Saryu, Badh Ganga and Madhya Ganga projects will be completed in three months, he said, adding that drinking water projects under Har Ghar Jal scheme are proposed for 97,000 villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/drinking-water-schemes-to-be-launched-in-50k-villages-yogi/articleshow/84153839.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Delhi||Delhi: GST mop-up in Q1 surges to Rs 5,281 crore||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has reported a surge in GST collection in the first quarter this fiscal, indicating a strong growth in consumption and rising demand after a lull brought about by the pandemic. A record Rs 5,281 crore GST was collected from April to June, even though a substantial part of the first quarter was spent under lockdown and economic restrictions. In the corresponding period of the last financial year, when the country was also under lockdown and economic restrictions were in place, GST collection was only Rs 2,943 crore, said a Delhi government official. The difference of Rs 2,338 crore shows people are consuming more goods compared with last year. However, the month-wise GST receipt figures were not available. Sources said typically GST receipts in April were higher than other months since April also reflected transactions made in March. Since GST is a consumption-based tax, its growth reflects a strong purchasing power in the economy. A senior tax official said sustained economic recovery played an important role for the high GST collection. The government had become financially crippled due to Covid-19, therefore it had been focusing on checking fake billing, fixing leakage in the system and improving tax administration. This resulted in timely tax payments. Another factor was the launch of the quarterly return filing and monthly payment of taxes scheme for small taxpayers. Due to this, dealers deposited the tax from January-March in April. The scheme offers traders with turnover of up to Rs 5 crore the option of filing GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B returns quarterly. Chartered accountant RK Gupta said last fiscal traders with turnover up to Rs 1.5 crore were not required to file Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN) code, which is used for classifying goods. However, since the beginning of this financial year, it has become mandatory for all traders to file HSN code details. “The government now has a massive data bank to aid tax monitoring,” he added. In 2020 too, the largest component of Delhi government’s revenue — state goods and services tax — grew consistently in the first four months (April to July) of the financial year and continued to remain above Rs 1,200 crore every month August onwards. Chamber of Trade and Industry convener Brijesh Goyal, who is also an Aam Aadmi Party trade wing functionary, said GST collection this fiscal was higher because last year the lockdown came as a shocker to people and they controlled their expenses. “This year, the lockdown was not nationwide, but state specific. So, people continued to spend. Also, interstate travel was not banned like 2020,” Goyal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gst-mop-up-in-q1-surges-to-rs-5281-cr/articleshow/84154635.cms||AlokKNMishra

The state public health department has in a report submitted to the state government on Sunday stated that of the 10 districts with high infections, Pune, Thane, Kolhapur, Mumbai and Sangli account for 60% of the total active cases in the state. As many as 9,336 cases were added on Sunday, taking the number of active cases in the state to 1.23 lakh. “We have direct the Pune, Thane, Kolhapur, Mumbai and Sangli district authorities to identify the hotspots and cover these areas with Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT). The aim is to the isolate positive patients at the earliest. They should initiate micro-containment measures and increase contact tracing,” state surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate said on Monday. Besides these five districts, Satara, Ratnagiri, Raigaid, Sindhudurg and Nashik are the other concern areas of the government. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said, “We have flagged the 10 districts as ‘districts of concern’ and put them on red alert. Stricter curbs should be in place there as we do not want any genomic versions of Delta or Delta- plus variants in these districts.” He said, “The remaining 25 districts should also ensure strict adherence to the Covid protocol, intensify the RT-PCR tests and maintain a below-5% positivity rate. We want to saturate these two months with aggressive vaccination.” Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state technical expert and task force member at both the state and national level, said, “Some districts are witnessing a rise in cases. It indicates that we are still not following the Covid protocols. We have to be cautious. We still cannot yet say that we are at the end of the second wave of the pandemic. If the protocols are followed and containment measures are in place, there should be a decline in cases from July 15-20.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/focus-on-hotspots-in-districts-with-high-cases/articleshow/84156823.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Hatim Arekas (16), his elder brother, Kaif, and their cousin, Wahid Arekas, all from Pargenagar, were the injured. The Kondhwa police detained a 17-year-old student and booked 10 people on charges of causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons, unlawful assembly and rioting. They are investigating if the person who triggered the quarrel by abusing the teacher was a genuine student or an outsider who accessed the web link to attend the online session. Preliminary investigation showed that the abuser was speaking from the ID of a genuine student who thought that Hatim and his brother were behind this act to discredit him. The genuine student called his friends and together they confronted Hatim and his brother. This led to a quarrel and the attack, the police said. Hatim said he was administered eight stitches on his head. Kaif and Wahid got minor injuries on their heads. “I did not attend online class on July 2. I don’t know how the abuser used the student’s ID to access the class. My classmate called and abused me on Friday and attacked me on Saturday.” Shaikh said he had blocked the abuser from the online meeting but he accessed it under a false name and proposed to a girl. “I removed him again. The abuser is not our college student. I don’t know him.

The competition, which began on June 30, will conclude on July 10. “I myself was amazed at the passion he showed for sailing when he was studying in Class V. Initially when he got hurt while training, I took him to the hospital. Despite an injury on his leg, he did not mind it and chose not to even rest,” Vishwanath’s father Saidulu told TOI. Saidulu is a construction worker hailing from Suryapet. His wife is also a construction worker. They came to the city 21 years ago. “After we put him in the social welfare residential school at Golconda, he was once taken to Hussainsagar where he saw yachting for the first time. By then, he also knew how two students from the social welfare institutions had climbed Mount Everest and he also was yearning to do something that excited him,” Saidulu recalled. The boy was selected by Navy Boys Sports Company (NBSC) when he was 12. Viswanath now trains at NBSC, INS Mandovi, Goa.

A 58-year-old man from Akola district who was admitted since June 27 died during treatment. Remaining 10 districts reported zero deaths, which is a record since the first wave. As per the state government figures, the condition in all 11 districts is better than that witnessed after the first wave. Monday’s record decline in fatalities is an indicator. Number of new cases reduced to 133, but this might be due to the decline in number of daily tests. As it was Sunday on July 4, and most districts are observing weekend lockdown, on-the-spot testing in market places was skipped in most of the districts. Due to this, only 13,087 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, which is less than even 50% of the daily average last week.

Mittal, however, termed the allegations as "false" and "looks forward to a fair and transparent investigation". A three-member judicial inquiry headed by a retired justice was set up by the governor to investigate corruption charges against Mittal. He was relieved of his duties with immediate effect till completion of the inquiry. Lucknow university vice-chancellor Alok Kumar Rai has been given additional charge of Agra university. According to the official declaration made by the office of governor, “Serious complaints of corruption, administrative and financial irregularities were received at the office of governor against VC Ashok Mittal. The VC had come unprepared and was not able to provide satisfactory answers during the review meeting on June 2." Some of the specific reasons cited by the office of governor for acting against the VC include recruitments made in violation of norms, non-compliance on audit objections, lack of adequate advocacy and required action in matters pending with the high court, delay in providing degree certificates to the students, unnecessarily providing overtime remuneration to the employees and lackadaisical approach towards responsibilities of a VC. Mahesh Kumar Gupta, additional chief secretary to the office of governor, said, “A three-member judicial inquiry headed by retired justice Ranjana Pandya has been set up by the governor for inquiring into the serious complaints. The committee will hand over its inquiry report to the governor within a month. To ensure that the inquiry and function at the varsity does not get affected, Agra university VC has been detached from his duties.” VC Ashok Mittal told TOI, “It is surprising that I was not given a chance to tender a formal clarification over the false allegations made against me. All the complaints are made with malafide intention against me by a local lawyer. Earlier, the varsity's top decision-making body, the executive council, had removed him from the legal panel after he was found involved in malpractices. I look forward to a fair and transparent investigation." A senior professor of economics at the Aligarh Muslim University, Ashok Mittal was appointed as VC of Agra university in February 2020 for three years. The 65-year-old former student of Agra university has a teaching experience of over 45 years and has done research work for over three decades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-university-vc-detached-from-his-duties-over-corruption-charges/articleshow/84151677.cms||Deepak Lavania

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh advanced the date from August 28 to July 9 after the NGO, Justice for All, moved an application for an early hearing. Advocate Khagesh Jha, appearing for the NGO pointed out that the students’ marks would depend on how the seniors had performed. The NGO added that, once the process of uploading of marks and preparation of results were over, the petition would become infructuous. The court also agreed to hear on the same date a petition by NISA Education, a registered society comprising entities running private schools, concerning the constitution of a results committee to assess Class X CBSE students. It claimed that, since the members of the committee and other faculty and staff of the school would be required to be physically present for deliberation, there would be a real danger to their health on account of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-to-take-up-plea-on-class-x-marks-on-july-9/articleshow/84156865.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lawyer in dock for using chamber to ‘conduct marriage, conversion’||NEW DELHI: Bar Council of Delhi has taken action against a lawyer who allegedly used his chamber to conduct nikah and religious conversions. Acting on a complaint by a man who claimed her daughter was forcibly converted and married off from advocate Iqbal Malik’s chamber, which was shown as a mosque, the council suspended Malik’s licence and urged the district judge to seal the chamber. In an order, BCD chairman Ramesh Gupta stated that “Malik was using his chamber for anti-social and illegal activities as per the complaint.” “Nikahnama/marriage certificate No.06/2021 dated 03.06.2021, in respect of daughter of the complainant has been forwarded along with the complaint wherein the place of performance of nikah has been mentioned at ‘F-322, Karkardooma Third Floor, Mazar Wali Masjid.’ The description tallies with your chamber, but it has been described as ‘Mazar wali Masjid’, which makes the allegations made in the complaint much more serious,” the BCD noted, setting up a disciplinary committee to verify the allegations. It urged Delhi High Court and the district judge and the deputy commissioner of police concerned to provide all necessary information and extend support to the committee. BCD noted that according to the complaint and documents annexed with it, “a conversion trust is being run by you from your chamber. The name of Quazi has been mentioned as Md. Akbar Dehlvi, F-73, Karkardooma Court. The complainant has alleged that his daughter was forcibly converted as Muslim and was married from your chamber which is also shown as a mosque.” The council asked Malik to file his response before the special disciplinary committee within seven days. The committee will conduct an inquiry and take a decision as soon as possible, preferably within three months, it stated. In the order, the BCD chairman said: “The alleged activities are not permissible nor are part of the professional activities of an advocate and his conduct in performing a nikah and issuance of the certificate of conversion and nikahnama/ marriage certificate is totally disgraceful and negates the dignity of the legal profession.” “The panel will immediately investigate the entire matter to save the dignity and credibility of the institution since the alleged nikah has taken place within the precincts of Karkardooma Court and that too in a lawyer’s chamber.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lawyer-in-dock-for-using-chamber-to-conduct-marriage-conversion/articleshow/84154659.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Hyderabad||Students in Hyderabad protest at minister Sabitha Indra Reddy’s house, demand postponement of degree exams||HYDERABAD: Tension prevailed at education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy’s residence in Srinagar Colony on Monday after students of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad and Osmania University protested seeking deferment of engineering and degree exams. Demanding that the exams be conducted online, large number of students marched towards the education minister’s residence during morning hours and sat on a dharna. The students argued that majority of those aged 18+, especially in the rural areas, are yet to be vaccinated and hence sought postponement of the examination. “When the government could cancel the class 10 exams and postpone the common entrance tests, why can’t it defer the degree and engineering exams or conduct them online,” questioned Sai Teja, a degree student. Even as the OU held the bachelor of degree and hotel management, culinary arts and bachelor of engineering exams on Monday, students sought postponement of other degree exams. With no assurance from the minister to postpone the exams, students continued their protest in front of her residence as they raised slogans. The protest was viral even on social media where hundreds of students tweeted seeking deferment of the exams using hashtag #noexamswithoutvaccination. “We’re ready to write exams but we need time to prepare and atleast get vaccinated please postpone the exams atleast 10 days until students get vaccinated,” tweeted GS Ram Reddy, a student. Police detained a few students and shifted them to Banjara Hills police station. Following a PIL filed by some students, the high court refused to intervene. The petitioner’s lawyer sought to move lunch motion but the court declined to take it up citing that the exams began at 10 am and that it cannot stop the exams. It wanted to know what the petitioner was doing till the last minute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-protest-at-mins-house-demand-postponement-of-engg-degree-exams/articleshow/84154665.cms||---

The flyover, which is expected to ease traffic between Medchal to Kukatpally, will be inaugurated by minister of IT and MAUD, KT Rama Rao. Meanwhile, the second steel bridge at Panjagutta, proposed by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation has been completed and is scheduled to be inaugurated soon. The first steel bridge was built to ease traffic coming from Banjara Hills Road Number 3. The second one will ensure a steady flow of vehicular movement towards from Nagarjuna Circle to KBR Park junction, while reducing congestion near Panjagutta graveyard. The project was taken up with a budget of around Rs 17 crore, including land acquisition costing nearly Rs 6 crore. The bridge is 140 metres long — 83 metres of the bridge and 57 metres of approaches. Locals are happy with the new bridge as it will make travel easy. “We used to fear taking this route earlier due to the bottleneck near Chutneys.,” said Anand Kumar, a resident of Banjara Hills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/balanagar-flyover-2nd-steel-bridge-at-panjagutta-ready/articleshow/84158725.cms||---
---||Delhi||Two Delhi markets shut down for flouting Covid protocol||NEW DELHI: After the sub-divisional magistrates and district officials noted increasing congestion and lackadaisical effort by traders to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour in and outside their shops, Central Market in Lajpat Nagar and Rui Mandi in Sadar Bazar were ordered closed on Sunday. Consequently, not a single shop opened in Rui Mandi on Monday. Since Monday is the weekly market closing day for Lajpat Nagar, the impact there couldn’t be ascertained. Delhi Police barricaded Rui Market at both its sides to restrict movement. However, by evening, TOI detected heavy footfall in the neighbouring Sadar Bazar main market. Anxious traders held meetings with the SDM and the local police officers and submitted a plan for avoiding congestion and identified a team of shopkeepers who will take continuous rounds of the market. “We clarified that the main cause of congestion in the market was illegal hawkers,” said Kamal Kumar, a trader. “Things were better till a few days ago when Delhi Police put up barricades to prevent cars into the market. But after these were removed, the situation worsened. Since Rui Market connects with shops in several narrow lanes, a lot of loading and unloading takes place on the road and causes jams.” Rakesh Yadav, president, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association, said they had requested the SDM to call a meeting of all parties to resolve the issue of congestion. Rajendra Sharma, general secretary, added, “Presidents of different market bodies are continuously persuading shopkeepers to wear masks and implement social distancing in the shops. But removal of hawkers is a problem and the administration and police have the major role to play in this.” In Lajpat Nagar, shopkeepers have been forced to submit an affidavit agreeing to have their establishment sealed if unmasked people were detected there. “We’ve assured the SDM in writing that we will remove any illegal use of public space by shopkeepers and support any action taken against shopkeepers who fail to implement social distancing or wear mask despite submitting the affidavit,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, Traders’ Association Lajpat Nagar. “We also suggested the cops barricade the market after 7pm on weekends to prevent crowding.” Criticising the action against Laxmi Nagar, then Nangloi and now Lajpat Nagar, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, alleged, “The closure of markets is ordered, shutters are pulled down and the market association office bearers are forced to meet the ruling party leaders, after which the markets are allowed to reopen,” alleged Kapoor. Brijesh Goyal, chairman, Chamber of Trade & Industry, has called a virtual mahapanchayat on the issue of shutdown of markets by the district administrations on Tuesday, clearly aggrieved that the congestion in markets/roads was being made the responsibility of the shops owners rather than the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lajpat-among-2-markets-shut-for-a-day/articleshow/84154707.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Nagpur||Experts: Curbs must be eased in Vidarbha, can be enforced if cases rise||NAGPUR: The second week of level 3 restrictions started in Vidarbha from Monday. The entire region has had less than 1% average test positivity rate for almost three weeks for now and many districts have even lesser positivity rate. Hospital beds are vacant and less than 500 patients are under treatment in hospitals across the region. Despite this, just a potential threat of the Delta+ variant is holding the entire region under level 3 restrictions. Not a single case of Delta+ has been found in Vidarbha till date. All the samples sent from Umred as suspected Delta+ cases have tested negative for the new variant. In such a condition, the region deserves a way towards normalcy, said experts. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said there must be a logical end to these restrictions or level 1-type of restrictions should be re-introduced. “Otherwise, if and when the real third wave will hit, people will become restless and would not follow restrictions. There is massive sero positivity in Vidarbha and a large number of people have natural immunity,” said Dr Shinde. “Moving towards normalcy will give the administration an opportunity to analyze if cases increase. In case positivity rate increases, we can always bring back restrictions,” he said. Earlier when level 3 restrictions were imposed, a senior member of the Covid task force had told TOI that the curbs were temporary until we get further information about the new Delta+ mutation. On Sunday, a crucial study conducted by the ICMR was made public. The findings of the study demonstrated that the breakthrough cases and the Covid-19 recovered individuals with one or two doses of vaccine had relatively higher protection against Delta variant in comparison to the participants who were administered either one or two doses. The study also concludes that vaccination results in less severe disease against subsequent infection against Delta variant. In addition, humoral and cellular immune response play an important role in protection. Epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte said if vaccines are effective on Delta, they will also be effective on Delta plus. “It’s not yet proved by any study, but epidemiologically, it’s difficult to believe that a vaccine effective on delta variant will not protect us from Delta plus. Protection level may vary, but vaccines will protect for sure. It’s too early to say that Delta+ will trigger new wave, like Delta had done,” he said. Why Vid deserves further relaxationsTest positivity (On June 5): Nagpur 0.61%, Amravati 0.95%, Akola 1.18%, Yavatmal 0.77%, Buldhana 1.88%, Washim 0.99%; Wardha 0.62%, Chandrapur 0.60%, Bhandara 0.51%, Gondia 0.29%, Gadchiroli 4% Patients under treatment (On June 5): Nagpur 152, Bhandara 23, Yavatmal 30, Gondia 39, Wardha 46, Gadchiroli 131, Washim 138, Buldhana 156, Chandrapur 171, Akola 231, Amravati 359 All 11 districts in Vidarbha have less than 0.15% weekly increase in new cases There is no district in top 10 ‘high alert’ districts of Maharashtra All 11 districts have nearly 90% decrease in cases/deaths and active cases as compared to 1st wave now||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/experts-curbs-must-be-eased-in-vid-can-be-enforced-if-cases-rise/articleshow/84152749.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Will you form heritage panel after rocks blasted, says high court to Telangana||HYDERABAD: Stating that thousands of rock formations that reflect the heritage of this land were destroyed in the last 20 years to pave way for the outer ring road etc, the Telangana high court on Monday directed the state government and HMDA to furnish it the GO issued to constitute a state heritage committee. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohi and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by social activist Perala Sekhar Rao from LB Nagar questioning the destruction of rock formations at Kokapet and seeking protection for them. HMDA, the competent agency designated to protect these heritage precincts, is now heading the task of this destruction, he said. Though the HMDA is under an obligation to include all such natural rock formations in the schedule attached to the Telangana Heritage (Protection, Preservation. Conservation and Maintenance) Act, 2017. State counsel Harender Pershad, when asked to convey the status of the heritage committee, conceded that the constitution of the committee was not yet complete. Wondering whether the state would complete the task after destroying all the monumental rocks, the bench sought an affidavit from the state and HMDA within ten days. Justice Vijaysen recalled his school days and said that none of the huge rocks where they spent several picnics are there now. They were completely destroyed, he said. To a query on whether he made any representation to protect the rock formations, K V Bhanu Prasad, the counsel for the petitioner, said that they made a representation to the chief minister. The bench told him that he should have first represented to the competent authority entrusted with the task of protecting heritage precincts. HMDA counsel S Niranjan Reddy said that the fears of the petitioner are unfounded. We have notified 25 rocks as notified heritage precincts, he said, adding that Koapaet rocks were not part of them. Bhanu Prasad brought to the notice of the court a book called “Rock Art Sites in Telangana – Art Galleries from the Paleolithic & Neolithic Era” containing 19 locations that have rocks with inscriptions including Kokapet. The Telangana Legislative Assembly passed the Telangana Heritage (Protection, Preservation, Conservation, and Maintenance) Act, 2017 for protecting the culture and heritage of the State of Telangana which includes Rock formations, etc as defined under Section 2 (q) of the Act for conservation, preservation, protection and maintenance of heritage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-you-form-heritage-panel-after-rocks-blasted-hc-to-t/articleshow/84154702.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: HCA apex council members barred from entering Gymkhana ground||HYDERABAD: For the first time since its inception in 1934, elected office-bearers of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) were barred from entering the Gymkhana ground on the orders of its president Mohammed Azharuddin. The drama unfolded on Tuesday afternoon when the members of the apex council — interim president John Manoj, secretary R Vijayanand, joint secretary Naresh Sharma, treasurer Surender Agarwal — and other members reached the Gymkhana to address the media and denounce the verdict of ombudsman Justice (retd) Deepak Verma to temporarily disqualify them from performing their duties as office-bearers. “It’s a very sad day for HCA. We’re shocked and surprised because no president has stooped so low as to have the police guard the gates and stop elected office-bearers from going inside. I tried to ask the cops and they said they have orders to stop us from entering. We came here with a roadmap on cricket. Two weeks ago when Azhar addressed media, we didn’t stop him. We have no choice but to move court,” John Manoj told TOI. “All of us are ready to resign if he (Azhar) puts in his papers. We’re ready for fresh elections. All these days he’s been saying we bulldoze because we’re in majority but now his high-handedness is for all to see.” Left with no choice, Manoj addressed the media on the roadside and said the ombudsman’s order is not binding on them because he’s not the majority’s choice. After the AGM on March 29 was deferred to April 11 — again unprecedented — Azhar announced that Justice Verma’s name has been ratified by show of hands and walked out of the meeting. “Out of the 174 members who attended the AGM, we have signatures of 107 members. Representatives of Institutional clubs stayed back but didn’t sign. So what is the president talking of show of hands and majority decision. Anyway the matter is sub-judice,” Manoj countered. The interim president also said that the president has not conducted a single Apex council meet and the ombudsman’s order — “On the basis of the said complaint, a showcause notice was issued by the Apex council to these members, to which a reply had also been given. It is only after this that these complaints have been forwarded to me under Sections 41 (a) and (b) of the constitution of HCA” — is contradictory. “Now, if we five are the Apex council members, why would we serve notice to ourselves? The showcause notice was issued by Azhar and this is how he misleads the ombudsman,” Manoj said. The interim president, who also conducted the meeting of coaches and captains on the roadside, said that the season will commence on July 7 and the special general meeting will be held on July 18. “We’re ready to compromise as far as cricket is concerned. That’s our priority. After a pathetic season the year before last, we thought we should make more effort this time. So, we’re starting it on July 7 as it also happens to be the late ML Jaisimha’s death anniversary. If the president wants, we’re ready for a debate on cricket. But all he’s done is stop cricketers’ pension and payment for vendors. Many retired players are suffering because only the president can sign vouchers,” Manoj added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-apex-council-members-barred-from-entering-gymkhana-ground/articleshow/84154714.cms||---

Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili was hearing a plea filed by Rajagopal urging the court to quash the case booked against him by the CBI in Penna Cements chargesheet of the quid pro quo case. He was facing allegations of irregularities in granting leases of limestone mines to the cement company. CBI counsel K Surender informed the court that the petitioner filed a discharge petition before the trial court on one hand and quash petition before the high court on the other. Rajagopal was also made accused in some other chargesheets. He filed similar petitions in them also. “The courts have dismissed all of them in the past. Now citing a new chargesheet, he is repeating the same exercise,” the CBI counsel said, terming Rajagopal’s exercise as aimed at delaying the process. The judge too asked the counsel for the petitioner as to what would be the fate of the petition before the high court if the trial court allows the discharge plea. His counsel said that it would become infructuous. The judge told the petitioner not to burden the constitutional courts with this kind of multiplicity of litigation. “Having filed a quash plea, you should not have filed a discharge plea in the trial court. Tell me whether you would withdraw the plea before the high court,” the judge asked. The counsel for the petitioner sought time to respond. “Probably, we may withdraw the discharge petition, I do not know. Please give us some time to ascertain,” he said. The judge then issued a notice to the CBI and posted the case for four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-takes-serious-view-of-rajagopal-filing-several-pleas/articleshow/84158715.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Two LeT operatives back in Hyderabad as parcel blast probe intensifies||HYDERABAD: After seven days custody, a National Investigation Agency (NIA) team on Monday brought the two alleged operatives of terror outfit Lashkar-E-Taiba (LeT) to Hyderabad for further probe into the Darbhanga railway parcel blast case. The investigation agency had identified the shops at Chikkadpally and Habeeb Nagar from where the LeT operatives reportedly purchased chemicals and sugar for preparing IED. Mohammad Imran Malik and his brother Mohammad Nasir Malik, allegedly associated with LeT, were arrested last week from the city for their alleged involvement in the low-intensity parcel blast at Darbhanga railway station. Later, a search was also conducted at their Mallepally rented house and incriminating documents were seized. Both the accused were produced before the NIA court at Patna, Bihar upon which the court granted seven days NIA custody of the alleged LeT operatives. The crime scene is also being re-constructed by the NIA with the help of Telangana’s Counter Intelligence Cell (CIC). The arrested duo will be taken from their residence to the Secunderabad railway station. Soon after reaching Hyderabad, the NIA team reportedly started collecting crucial evidence in the case by recording statements of certain witnesses who knew the arrested accused. Agency sleuths have also summoned the taxi driver in which the accused transported the parcel containing the concealed explosives. Further, concrete evidence is also being collected from the Secunderabad railway parcel service counter and the statement of the staff is being recorded. The statements of the owner of the rented house have also been recorded. Till date, the probe has revealed that the perpetrators of the parcel blast allegedly conspired to cause massive damage to the Secunderabad express train. “The exact picture of how the accused transported and conspired to cause fire on Secunderabad express train is being ascertained by the agency,” said a senior NIA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-let-operatives-back-in-city-as-parcel-blast-probe-intensifies/articleshow/84154674.cms||---

Depending on supply, we want to make it available under our free vaccination programme soon,” he said. Sputnik V also requires a storage temperature of -18°C. Dr Arora said cold chain facilities preserving the polio vaccines will be used to store Sputnik V — a plan which will also ensure the shot reaches the country's rural areas, he said. As for the pace of vaccination coverage, Dr Arora said some regions may have seen slowdowns in Covid vaccinations due to the ongoing polio drives, which has taken up staff and other resources at many centres. “The Covid vaccination programme will be streamlined within the coming week,” he said. He told TOI that more than 34 crore Covid vaccine doses have been administered so far and another 12 to 16 crore should be administered by July-end, as per schedule. In January, the Centre had said that nearly 50 crore doses would be administered by July-end to cover priority groups. Dr Arora said Covishield and Covaxin remain a big chunk of vaccine supply. Besides the scaling up of their production, he said the addition of Sputnik V and the shots from Moderna and Zydus Cadila, will boost daily coverage, which will go up from 50 lakh a day to 80 lakh to 1 crore in the coming weeks to cover everyone over 18 (nearly 93 crore people) by the end of this year. He added that with a recent ICMR report predicting a third wave by February or March next year, the country has a window of about eight months to finish covering the target. He also said it's still too early to link the new Delta-plus variant to the possible third wave. India has reported 52 Covid cases involving the variant. "Whether it will lead to a third wave will depend on universal adoption of Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB), ramping up of vaccination drives and testing and tracing in districts," he said, adding that studies are ongoing to determine transmissibility and effects of vaccines on mutations. He said, “So far, with 52 cases, there hasn't been exponential growth in clusters or districts that have reported the new variant. While guidelines on containment, tracing and treatment have been issued to these regions, other protocols and precautions will also help rein in the virus. The occurrence and severity of the third wave is in our hands."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-vaccination-sites-will-soon-offer-sputnik-v-for-free-top-official/articleshow/84156864.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Business||Twitter is in breach of rules, could lose immunity: Government||NEW DELHI: Twitter is in breach of India’s new IT Rules and liable to face punishment under existing laws, the Centre told the Delhi high court on Monday. The government added that any non-compliance with “the law of the land” would lead to the US-based platform losing its immunity as a social media intermediary under the IT Act. The immunity is in connection with third-party data hosted on such platforms. In its affidavit, the ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY) listed the “violations” by Twitter, saying the company had, as of July 1, failed to appoint a chief compliance officer, while the positions of resident grievance officer and of a nodal contact person (even on interim basis) lay vacant. The ministry also underlined that the physical contact address, which was shown to be there on May 29, was not available again on the Twitter website, arguing that all these steps are mandatory under the new rules. It maintained that the three-month period for compliance granted to all significant social media intermediaries (SSMI) under the IT Rules, 2021, including Twitter, ended on May 26 this year, yet the company had “failed to fully comply”. The affidavit has been filed in response to a plea by lawyer Amit Acharya claiming the microblogging platform was not in compliance with the Centre’s new IT Rules. In its affidavit, the ministry said it was informed that Twitter’s grievance officer had quit. But “as per details gleaned from respondent no. 2 website/mobile application, in the interim the grievances from India are being handled by personnel situated in the US, which amounts to non-compliance with the IT Rules, 2021,” it noted. The reply added that the immunity conferred on intermediaries under the law was conditional, subject to the intermediaries satisfying conditions under the act. Failure to observe the IT Rules, 2021 results in such entities losing immunity and becoming liable to face punishment under existing laws, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/twitter-is-in-breach-of-rules-could-lose-immunity-govt/articleshow/84159699.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Bhopal||Masks go missing in Bhopal shops and markets in absence of any checks||BHOPAL: As the coronavirus cases drop in the city, so has the mask from the face to the chin in absence of any checks at public places. When the lockdown was eased on June 1 and further relaxations were announced a fortnight later, the shadow of second wave of Covid-19 were palpable as people were talking of their grim experiences during the period and their conduct- which for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic appeared to be quite close to Covid appropriate behaviour. Personnel from administration or BMC also used to come and click pictures in the markets, fine people flouting Covid norms to ensure that customers and shopkeepers both adhere to Covid guidelines. “But they are also seldom seen now," said a shopkeeper in Ravishankar Market at 5 no. stop. All the shops were in a way barricaded with ropes so as to not allow the customers inside the shop, circles outside the shops were again in place for people to stand at an appropriate distance from each other and wait for their turn at a shop, posters and banners asking people to observe Covid guidelines and vaccination were also put up in markets and shops. Ropes, circles and posters are still there but people for whom it was all put in place have started going astray. “There is rope outside the shop to stop people from coming into the shop but after an initial hitch on their part to get into the shop, they are back at it again. They won't stand outside but sneak into the shop to ask for goods they wish to buy. If they don't stand in the circles drawn outside the shop and barge into the shop, you can't avoid crowding on the counter or the small vacant space inside the shop but caution on the part of the public was short-lived, they are back in their usual mould. People are not only giving a go by to safe distancing in markets and other public places but the mask, which people seemed to be wearing with far more caution (covering their face up to nose with the mask) has also stalled sliding with the tumbling coronavirus cases in the city. Moreover, many people, particularly youngsters can be seen without masks very often - be it a marketplace or spots where they go for leisurely time pass like the Boat Club or Kaliyasot dam site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/masks-go-missing-in-shops-and-markets-in-absence-of-any-checks/articleshow/84154723.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hafeezpet land tug-of-war: Apex court orders status quo||Hyderabad: The Supreme Court on Monday directed Telangana and private parties vying for a 50-acre portion of 140 acres in survey number 80 of Hafeezpet in Rangareddy district to maintain status quo on matters related to the land. A bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice V Ramasubramanian gave this interim direction while issuing notices in an appeal filed by the state government and Rangareddy district collector. The state government contended that it was aggrieved by the order of the Telangana high court because it went ahead ignoring the fact that a final decree was yet to come in the matter. “The proceedings related to this case are still pending before the high court,” the government said and added that survey No. 80 has more than 480 acres of land and the entire extent is known as ‘kancha sarkari’ land ie., government land. “No sub-divisions were made on the land as per the Survey and Boundaries Act. The land claimed by the petitioners in survey No. 80/D is not in existence as per revenue records and hence their claim is not valid as per the law,” Telangana said in its appeal. In its order, the high court had declared it as purely private land. The court had also said the state or waqf board has got nothing to do with the land. “This finding, if it goes unchallenged, will adversely affect the interests of the state,” Telangana said in its appeal. Palwai Venkat Reddy, state counsel in the Supreme Court, said the matter was adjourned to August 20. In a setback to the government and the waqf board, the high court in March this year said the entire extent of land in survey No. 80 in Hafeezpet in Serilingampally mandal was a private land. The writ petitions in the high court were filed by Katikaneni Praveen Kumar and Sai Pavan Estates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hafeezpet-land-tug-of-war-apex-court-orders-status-quo/articleshow/84158743.cms||---

Ashoka Medicover, a private hospital in Nashik, got the vaccines from Dr Reddy’s Lab. This will be the third vaccine available for beneficiaries who are willing to pay for inoculation. The hospital authorities said that the vaccine is being administered to the staff of Dr Reddy’s Lab and their family members who are based in Nashik. “Dr Reddy’s Lab (DRL) has its officials in the district. The stock of 100 doses of the Sputnik vaccine has been sent by DRL for its officials and their family members. We have already administered over 50 doses to the beneficiaries and remaining doses are to be given in a day or two,” said Sameer Tulapurkar, the public relation officer of the Ashoka Medicover Hospital. “A combined order for Sputnik V vaccine has been placed with Dr Reddy’s Lab by the Medicover group of hospitals and we will start administering the Sputnik vaccines to the city residents as soon as we get the stock,” said Tulapurkar. Many other private hospitals like Apollo, Sahyadri and HCG Manavata Cancer Centre are in touch with DRL to get Sputnik vaccines. Apollo is in the process of receiving a refrigerator to store the vaccines. “We are expecting to receive the Sputnik V vaccines in the next few days. We are already administering Covishield and Covaxin,” said Kaivalya Sohani, senior official of Apollo Hospital, Nashik. Sahyadri has also placed the order for Sputnik V and said it will receive the vaccines soon. “We are expected to get the stock of Sputnik V vaccines by this week. We will immediately start administering the shots when the stock arrives,” said Chetan Patil, a senior doctor at Sahyadri Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-gets-1st-batch-of-sputnik-v/articleshow/84150380.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||New technology to put Delhi Metro's Phase-IV corridors on the fast track||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has introduced the latest technology for construction of Phase-IV corridor, which will result in faster construction of elevated sections and minimum blockage of road space or traffic movement. DMRC introduced a specially designed “launcher attached with a transporter” on Monday for the launch of U-girders on its elevated section of the Phase-IV Janakpuri West - RK Ashram Marg corridor in the presence of DMRC’s managing director Mangu Singh. Longer than the conventional box girders, U-girders are “pre-tensioned” and tracks can be laid on these immediately. The length of U-girders, however, means difficulty in bringing these from the casting yards through the city traffic to construction sites, apart from requiring precision in “launching” them. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications) at DMRC said that in the earlier phases of construction, U-girders were erected with the help of cranes placed at each pillar location, where these were transported with the help of 42-metre-long trailers. “In a congested urban city like Delhi, it is challenging to find adequate space for positioning heavy capacity cranes, which occupy a lot of space. In addition, transporting U-girders of 28m length with such long trailers is also a herculean task as roads in NCR are either too congested or have massive traffic volumes even during the night,” Dayal explained. “These limitations often discouraged the use of U-girders in construction in spite of the fact that they are the most suitable structures for viaducts in terms of cost and time,” he added. This fully electric “launcher with transporter”, however, has higher output compared with conventional launchers or cranes. “The transporter carries the U-girder from one designated point and moves forward on rails laid on the already erected U-girders from the feeding point to the launcher,” Dayal claimed. As a result, the U-girders are transported on trailers only up to the feeding point identified at a suitable location and not for the entire length of the section. While using the conventional method meant around two U-girders could be erected in a day, the new system helps in erecting four to six U-girders in day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-tech-to-put-phase-iv-corridors-on-the-fast-track/articleshow/84154737.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Jaipur||Districts to follow Ajmer plan of hospitals for non-Covid patients||JAIPUR: Non-Covid patients had to suffer a lot in the state during the first and second waves of the pandemic. To prevent the situation from repeating in case of a third wave, Ajmer’s health officials have chalked out a plan and designated hospitals for non-Covid treatment such as cancer; chronic diseases of kidney, liver, heart, lungs; and neurological disorders. The health department has issued directions to all districts to take Ajmer’s action plan as a model and ensure that non-Covid patients are not ignored if a third wave strikes. The Ajmer plan focuses on designating one hospital to provide dialysis, treatment for cardiological and neurological problems, and general OPD; a satellite hospital for cancer; and a zanana hospital for maternal care. In addition, 16 government dispensaries will provide treatment for general patients. In rural areas, Ajmer has identified community health and primary health centres to provide only non-Covid treatment. “We have issued directions to all districts to ensure proper treatment for non-Covid patients even if we have a third wave. Ajmer has prepared a detailed plan of Covid and non-Covid treatment facilities. We have issued directions to other districts to follow Ajmer’s plan,” said Siddharth Mahajan, health secretary. Studies have shown that diseases in non-Covid patients worsened during the pandemic due to the fear of virus, lockdown and unavailability of facilities in hospitals. Many hospitals have confirmed that patients in advanced stages of their diseases have come to them after the second wave slowed down. “Most of the hospitals were providing Covid treatment. So, non-Covid patients were hesitant in going to hospitals. Now, we are trying to create an environment to treat non-Covid patients. We have designated hospitals for them," said Dr KK Soni, chief medical health officer (CMHO), Ajmer. A number of kidney, cancer and other patients with chronic diseases died during the first and second Covid waves. “Kidney patients suffered a lot of problems for doing dialysis. Since such patients and others with chronic diseases are at a higher risk of getting severe Covid infection, they fear going to hospitals," said Mujahid Naqvi, director, Kidney Warrior Foundation, which provides support to patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dists-to-follow-ajmer-plan-of-hosps-for-non-covid-patients/articleshow/84156892.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Delhi||Not happy with pleaof cops being turneddown, LG wrote to CM||New Delhi: Amid Aam Aadmi Party’s allegations that lieutenant governor Anil Baijal “wants to appoint special public prosecutors in cases related to the farmers’ agitation to ensure conviction and set an example”, senior officers present at a meeting between the LG and home minister Satyendar Jain on the issue on July 1 said the LG had categorically expressed his disagreement at the home minister turning down a valid request of Delhi Police for appointment of SPPs. “This was reiterated and clearly conveyed in a subsequent letter from the LG to the CM, requesting him to convene a meeting of the council of ministers to decide on the said disagreement at the earliest,” said sources in the LG’s office.At the meeting that was held through video conferencing, the differences between the LG and the home minister could not be settled. “Keeping in view that the matter has already been delayed inordinately, it is requested that the decision of the council of ministers be communicated expeditiously, preferably within a week,” the LG said in the letter.The cases are related to the farmers' stir of 2020-2021, including the ones related to the violent turn the protests took at several places in Delhi on January 26. Forty-eight FIRs were registered against the miscreants. Delhi Police had on February 26 requested the Delhi government’s home department for appointment of 11 lawyers as SPPs for all matters, including bail pleas, trials, appeals and other miscellaneous issues connected with all these FIRs.In the letter to the CM, the LG said he had called for the relevant file from the home department on March 24. It was noticed that the home minister had not agreed to the Delhi Police request despite the justification given by it.“These cases are sensitive in nature and require careful handling in a time-bound manner in view of the gravity of the offences and implications for law and order. Therefore, I see no reason why the proposal of Delhi Police should not be agreed to,” the LG said in the letter, requesting the home minister to reconsider his decision and, in case of any reservations, discuss the matter with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-happy-with-pleaof-cops-being-turneddown-lg-wrote-to-cm/articleshow/84154729.cms||---
---||Delhi||LG wants new farmstir prosecutors atBJP behest: Chadha||New Delhi: In a fresh tussle between the AAP government and the LG, MLA Raghav Chadha on Monday alleged that the latter wants to appoint special public prosecutors at the behest of BJP in cases related to the farmers’ stir by removing the ones appointed by the AAP government to “ensure conviction and set an example”.“BJP is trying to remove the Kejriwal government’s lawyers and replace them with their own lawyers. This is not being done with intention of providing justice but with the intention of seeking revenge. They want to cause damage to the farmers. They want to punish the farmers and seek vengeance,” Chadha stated.At a recent meeting between the LG and home minister Satyendar Jain, it was admitted that the public prosecutors are doing a very good job and handling the farm stir cases properly, claimed Chadha. “At that meeting, the LG, who is appointed by the BJP, said that they will still remove Delhi government’s lawyers because they want the farmers to be punished,” claimed Chadha.AAP has been backing the farmers’ stir since the beginning and Chadha said that they were braving extremely odd weather conditions to seek scrapping of the farm laws. As long as the Kejriwal government is in power in Delhi, the central government cannot mess with the farmers, he said.In a letter to the LG after the virtual meeting, home minister Satyendar Jain requested the LG “not to insist on appointing SPPs at the behest of Delhi Police.” He said: “The regular additional public prosecutor of the directorate of prosecution is competent enough to handle the case (cases registered during farmers’ agitation 2020-2021) properly. SPPs should not be appointed at the behest of the investigation agency in the interest of justice and fair trial as investigation and prosecution are two different facets of administration of criminal justice. The prosecutors have not only the duty to bring criminals to justice according to the rule of law but also have a duty towards the accused so that an innocent person is not convicted,” the state home minister said in the note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-wants-new-farmstir-prosecutors-atbjp-behest-chadha/articleshow/84154720.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Nashik||Four Covid patients in Nashik treated with 2-deoxy-D-glucose||NASHIK: Four Covid patients in Nashik became the first in the city to be treated with the 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) oral drug in June. The treatment has shown good results. a Dr Manoj Chopda, director of the Magnum hospital, said the drug has to be administered to the patients in the first seven days of symptoms and to those requiring oxygen support. “The number of severe Covid cases dropped in June. So, there were very few patients who required the medicine. We have administered the drug to four middle-aged persons,” said Dr Chopda. The 2-DG drug developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation was provided authorisation for emergency use by the Drugs Controller General of India on June 1 as an adjunct therapy for moderate to severe coronavirus patients. The drug has the potential to reduce a patient's average recovery time by two and a half days and oxygen demand by up to 40%. Dr Chopda said that the drug is in powdered form and has to be dissolved in water. It is administered orally to the patients. The four patients were given the drug as per their requirement for three to five days and their demand for oxygen drastically reduced. “This also helped in speedy recovery and lesser hospitalization of the patients,” he added. The Nashik civil hospital has not used the drug so far and neither have they decided to buy the drug at this point of time, civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said. The availability of the drug is also a problem. Dr Chopda got it from Hyderabad. “Since it was not available here, we got the same from Hyderabad. Considering the chances of third wave of Covid, we hope that the drug is made available at the stores soon,” said Dr Chopda. Rajendra Dhamne, the president of Nashik City Chemists and Druggists Association, said, “The stockists are yet to get the drug and they are in the process of getting the minimal stock. Since this is a specific drug, they would be bring huge quantities with sometime later. Currently, as the Covid cases are very low, the requirement is also on the lower side.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/four-covid-patients-treated-with-2-dg/articleshow/84150386.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The people, who were hesitant to take the vaccine and ran away on spotting vaccination teams, are now asking to be inoculated as all the government employees and officers stressed on the need for vaccination by organising special campaigns. “Ever since the Sandeep Aher, the incident commander of disaster management authority, Peth/Dindori. started the campaign in which all government officials were asked to contribute to the drive, things have changed rapidly,” said Sandip Bhosle, the tehsildar of Peth taluka As per the orders, the talathis, gram sevaks, sarpanch, primary and secondary teachers, Asha workers, booth level officers, police patils in Peth taluka were asked to join the vaccination campaign in their respective villages and urge people to take the vaccination. “The campaign started from June 28, where one village in each of the six primary health centres (PHC), was targeted on daily basis. All the respective officials taking up the responsibilities in each village visited the residents and it resulted in increased participation of the beneficiaries,” said taluka health officer Dr Yogesh More. The average vaccination in the taluka, which was around 450 per day, has jumped to more than 1,200 per day. Due to shortage of vaccine, the campaign was conducted only on five days and the number of beneficiaries vaccinated was 6,034. “The average vaccination is the highest since the drive began,” said block development officer Namrata Jagtap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vaccination-drive-gathers-steam-in-tribal-dominated-peth-taluka/articleshow/84150400.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Nitin Gadkari’s company on Maharashtra BJP chief’s list for ED probe||MUMBAI: State BJP president Chandrakant Patil’s letter to home minister Amit Shah has caused a flutter in political circles, since he has demanded a probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) into cooperative sugar factories purchased by firms controlled by senior party leader and Union minister Nitin Gadkari. In his July 3 letter to Amit Shah, Patil had demanded an ED probe into the sale/auction of 30 cooperative sugar factories, including Mahatma Cooperative Sugar factory in Wardha district and Wainganga Cooperative Sugar factory in Bhandara district, which were purchased by Purti company in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Then Purti company was controlled by Gadkari. Gadkari’s office did not respond to Patil’s letter, while leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said there was neither cheating nor undervaluation of the sugar factories purchased by the Gadkari-controlled firms. “Auction notices for the two factories were issued on three occasions, but there was no response. There was no undervaluation of the units and they were non-operational for a prolonged period. Gadkari himself has stated that he was prepared for a probe by any agency,’’ Fadnavis said. Patil did not respond to TOI’s message. A senior BJP leader said the two units were closed for a prolonged period following which farmers in Wardha and Bhandara districts approached Gadkari to purchase them to protect the interest of the farmers. The offset value of the Wardha and Bhandara units was Rs 10 crore each; Gadkari’s firm purchased them for Rs 14 crore each. Currently, both units are run by Manas Agro Industries Infrastructure Ltd. The BJP leader expressed shock and surprise over Patil’s letter to Shah. “It appears that he wrote the letter without adequate homework. Certainly, it has given a weapon to the opposition,” he further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gadkaris-cos-on-maharashtra-bjp-chiefs-list-for-ed-probe/articleshow/84159528.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||New challenge: Covid-19 on a downslide, dengue raises head in Ludhiana||LUDHIANA: Even as Covid cases are witnessing a fall, the district is facing another health challenge. Dengue cases are being reported and larvae are being found in various parts of the city. The health department has prepared a plan to tackle vector-borne diseases, including dengue, malaria and chikungunya. As per the recent health department data, the number of confirmed dengue cases reported from Ludhiana till July 1 was three, all in the urban areas. The three patients included a 28-year-old woman of Civil Lines, a 55-year-old man of Jamalpur and a 37-year-old woman of Chander Nagar. Last year, the number of dengue cases in Ludhiana was 1,355, which was the second highest in the past five years. The highest number of dengue cases, in the period, was 1,509 reported in 2019. As per the data, two persons had died of dengue in Ludhiana district last year. Seven malaria cases were reported the previous year, which was the lowest in the past five years, and no chikungunya case was reported. In a district-level National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) and water-borne monitoring committee meeting held recently, it was said that the whole city population was at risk. The meeting held that these diseases could neither be prevented nor controlled without the active participation of various departments, civic body and the public. Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia said, “We are working to control dengue. Besides municipal corporation units, we have constituted 18 teams of two members each, including an assistant malaria officer (AMO), to control the disease. These teams have been visiting each sub-division for checking larvae. We have also divided the city into two parts and deputed male supervisors and multi-purpose health workers to monitor high-risk areas, where mosquito breeding checkers have also been deputed.” The civil surgeon said they have been advising people to wear fully-covered clothes and use mosquito repellents. Residents feel the department concerned should carry out frequent fogging in their areas. “The municipal corporation officials are yet to carry out fogging in many areas though they are doing it in Ludhiana (west) constituency,” said Keemti Rawal, a social activist who lives in Chander Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/new-challenge-covid-19-on-a-downslide-dengue-raises-head/articleshow/84152819.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Ahmedabad||Exempt vaccinated fliers from RT-PCR mandate: GCCI||AHMEDABAD: Citing the receding of Covid-19 cases and increased pace of vaccination, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) has sought to exempt vaccinated air travellers from the mandatory requirement to submit RTPCR negative reports at the time of travel. A representation was made by the state’s apex industry body before the Union home minister, Amit Shah, on Monday, seeking to introduce a uniform policy across the country for domestic travel, by making RTPCR/ Rapid test report optional for vaccinated travellers. While Gujarat government has already done away with the requirement of an RTPCR negative report for incoming passengers; several other states have continued with the policy which was introduced in March-end, just at the cusp of the second wave of Covid-19. GCCI has underlined the need for a uniform policy across the country regarding this, and removing the requirement of making RTPCR tests mandatory for vaccinated travellers for domestic travel. “Making RTPCR reports optional for passengers who are vaccinated will encourage more people to get vaccinated. This will also reduce the expense of mandatory RTPCR testing and make the transit process at airports particularly faster,” the representation states. “At the same time, as RTPCR test takes 5-8 hours for results, it creates unnecessary burden on the traveller, especially during emergency travel, which adds to the travellers woes. Removing the requirement will also provide a boost to the tourism industry which is already facing survival issues due to Covid-19, states the representation. Last month, a similar representation was moved by the travel agents’ body as well with a view to give the needed boost to the travel and tourism sector. Summer vacation season – which fetches maximum business for travel agents and tour operators – was completely wiped out thanks to the sinister second wave and territorial restrictions – causing a major loss in business for the hospitality and travel sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/exempt-vaccinated-fliers-from-rt-pcr-mandate-gcci/articleshow/84157030.cms||---

He said the normal requirements for medical oxygen in the state per day was 100 metric tonnes, but this had touched 1,200 metric tonnes during the second wave of the coronavirus infection. Rupani inaugurated a 150-litre capacity PSA oxygen plant set up at the cost of Rs 22 lakh at Gadhada in Botad district. “We plan to produce 1,800MT oxygen to meet the demand during a possible third wave. Our target is to set up 300 PSA plants to meet this demand, of which 175 have already been setup.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Rise in Covid cases hints at possible surge||KOCHI: After a decline in the Covid cases, the state saw a slight increase in the number of cases last week. In contrast, all other major states have seen a decline in new Covid cases during this period. Between June 27 and July 3, Kerala on an average reported 11,942 cases per day. It was 11,463, a week earlier. Public health experts said that the next two weeks remain crucial and if the present trend continues, then Kerala may move from the extended plateau stage to a rapid rise in cases. This is mainly because the state’s TPR remains above 10% along with an increase in new cases. Since lockdown relaxations on June 16, on an average, about 20-21% new Covid cases are reported from Kerala. Last week, between June 27 and July 3, Kerala’s seven-day average TPR was the highest in the country at 10.2%. This happened even after there was a slight increase in testing during the week, with an average 1,16,834 tests per day when compared to 1,09,482 tests per day in the previous week. “After two months of negative growth, Kerala is now seeing an increase in Covid cases. This week cases have increased by 4%. This is partly due to an increase in tests 7,000 more tests per day were conducted during June 27 and July 3, when compared to the previous week. But despite increased testing, TPR has not decreased much and is still above 10%, indicating high disease burden in the community,” said rheumatologist and immunologist Dr Shenoy Padmanabha, who has been analysing Covid patterns across India. Kerala that saw a peak in cases in May first week with an average of 37,144 new cases per day, entered a plateau phase in the first week of June when 14,035 new cases per day were reported. Since then, there was only a slight decline in cases and new cases remained below 11,500 per day. However, last week, it jumped again. This, experts said, is probably because of the flattening of the curve and higher proportion of people vulnerable to infection in the state. “This indicates that due to continued lockdown and containment measures, Kerala may have reached a plateau phase, but lower down in the community the measures to prevent the spread of the infection are inadequate. Now, most of the spread is through unofficial gatherings family functions, meeting between friends and family members. Local bodies need to sensitize people about this,”said Dr Jayakrishnan A V, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rise-in-cases-hints-at-possible-surge/articleshow/84154767.cms||Preetu Nair

Nashik district has 1,949 villages and the process of setting up the committees in each of the villages has begun. The progress will be monitored and the situation will be reviewed every 15 days. “The government resolution on ‘Covid-free’ villages, is simple and self-explanatory. It expects each person of the village to be responsible for protection against the infection and teams will be set up for monitoring the same,” said Leena Bansod, the CEO of Nashik ZP.  The ward-level and village-level committees are to be set up to monitor the Covid situation. The committees, comprising gram panchayat members, health workers and teachers, have to visit every household regularly to check for Covid symptoms and report any abnormality to the health officials for immediate testing, tracking and if required treatment of the person. Apart from this, The committees will ensure a vehicle that will ferry the Covid patient to the health institutions instead of relying on an ambulance. “The villages are also expected to have isolation wards with all facilities of hygiene so that the Covid patients can be put up in these places. The committees have to ensure they have the rapid antigen testing kits available,” said a ZP health official. The committees also have to ensure 100 % vaccination among the residents in their respective jurisdiction. The committees will have volunteers to look after the agricultural needs in case an entire family of a farmer tests positive or has been quarantined and also take care of the children, who lost either or both the parents to Covid. The government resolution has laid out 22 conditions to evaluate the function of the committees. While each of the conditions carries 0.5 marks for 50% to 75% achievement, one mark for achievement up to 99 % and 2 marks for 100 % achievement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/teams-to-keep-an-eye-on-covid-scenario-in-villages/articleshow/84150392.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Dehradun||BJP MLA accused of rape approaches High court seeking protection from arrest||NAINITAL: Days after the BJP MLA from Haridwar’s Jawalapur constituency was booked for raping a woman party worker, the legislator has now approached the Uttarakhand high court (HC) seeking quashing of the FIR and protection from arrest. While an application was earlier filed by accused MLA Suresh Rathore under section 482 of the CrPC, asking the court to stay the directions of the magistrate court and not to allow the registration of the FIR, a writ petition has now been filed since the FIR has already been registered and the probe has begun. “By the time the application could be heard, an FIR was already registered. Therefore, the application has now become infructuous,” said Aditya Pratap Singh, counsel for Rathore. The application had come up for hearing before the bench of Justice NS Dhanik on Monday, however, after he was informed that the FIR had already been registered, the judge allowed the petitioners to withdraw the application. “Our application was listed for hearing on Monday but we withdrew it as it became infructuous. A petition has now been filed by us and it will come up for hearing in a few days,” Singh said. In his petition, Rathore has argued that the magistrate did not even consider the criminal history of the complainant and the fact that the woman and her husband were behind bars for almost a month after he approached the police with the complaint that they were trying to extort money from him. The woman, however, had alleged that she met Rathore two-and-a-half years ago when he asked her to join the party’s women’s wing. However, a few months back, he raped her and even threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed the 'crime' to anyone. Later, the woman approached the local court which directed the police to register an FIR. Subsequently, the Haridwar police registered the FIR at Bahadrabad police station on Friday under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-mla-accused-of-rape-approaches-hc-seeking-protection-from-arrest/articleshow/84152833.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Bengaluru||Surrender drama in Bengaluru: Seven men in court in lawyers’ attire||BENGALURU: When seven men dressed in white shirts and black trousers lined up in front of a courtroom in the magistrate court complex on Nrupatunga Road here on Monday, eyebrows were not raised. While everyone assumed they were advocates, the men shocked the courtroom announcing they had come to surrender in a murder case. They had come to give themselves up before the III additional chief metropolitan magistrate in the murder of N Madan, 44, a financer from Lakkasandra, outside Banashankari temple on July 2. The seven men’s plan to surrender before the court collapsed as the judge said that when the police FIR does not mention any names, their surrender was not possible. The advocate, who appeared for the seven men, had not filed any application, the judge said. SURRENDER DRAMASuspects dressed as lawyers to escape detection: CopsJayanagar police, who got a whiff of the development, reached the court before the suspects could walk out. All the seven were taken into custody on stepping out of the building. The men were taken to Jayanagar police station. They will be produced before the court on Tuesday for seeking police custody. On a complaint filed by Madan’s elder brother N Mohan, cops registered a case of murder against unidentified accused. Suspecting an old rivalry, police launched a manhunt for Madan’s old rivals. According to an advocate, the seven men walked into the court premises around 11.15am. They were clad in white full-arm shirts and black trousers. The only giveaway was none of them wore black shoes. Theywalked in a space of a few minutes and assembled outside court hall 37. Some sat on the benches placed outside the hall. Their advocate went inside the court and explained that his clients wanted to surrender. “The judge replied to the advocate saying that since there were no names mentioned in the first information report registered with Jayanagar station, it was not possible to accept their pleas. The advocate walked out and explained the outcome to his clients,” sources said. By now, a few curious advocates began questioning the youths. “They defame the advocates’ profession ,” an advocate said. Police said the suspects seemed to be keen on avoiding getting arrested first by cops and dressed as lawyers to escape detection. “If they surrender before a court, they will first be sent to jail and we will have to then seek their custody. Besides, they may also be influenced by a few recent incidents where some heinous criminals were shot in the legs during their attempt to escape from police custody after attacking cops,” the sources explained. The men are said to be old rivals of Madan. “They are suspected to be the associates of Viji and Linga, who were murdered in 2018 in Lakkasandra and Shantinagar, respectively. Their associates said Madan financed the two killings,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/surrender-drama-7-men-in-court-in-lawyers-attire/articleshow/84159880.cms||---
---||Delhi||Needle of suspicion: Covid-19 vaccine could lead to surge in blood sugar levels||NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 vaccination can lead to a sudden rise in blood sugar levels, especially among diabetics. Fortis C-Doc Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology, a private hospital, said it had come across 7-8 such cases recently, including a 58-year-old woman, a known case of type-II diabetes for the last 20 years. According to her case report published by the hospital in the medical journal, Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome, she had received her first dose of Covishield on March 4. “Before vaccination, her blood glucose levels were fairly under control with regular medications and diet. However, after it, the levels remained high for almost a month, and she needed an increased dose of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug,” said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-Doc. Another patient, a 64-year-old man, received the first dose of Covishield without any problems on January 18. Subsequently, the case report published in the journal said his blood pressure increased from 130/80 mm of Hg to 160/90 mm Hg by the end of the day. “Additionally, he had tachycardia, sweating, and palpitations for a few hours. Post vaccination, blood glucose values showed an increase for three days and then reverted to normal without additional intervention,” it added. There was another similar case report involving a 65-year-old man, who reported increased levels of blood glucose post vaccination, which reverted to normal without any intervention in 15 days. The common side effects that had been reported with Covishield, include fatigue, chills, headache, fever, flu-like symptoms. Less common ones were abdominal pain, enlarged lymph nodes, itchy skin, or rash. However, the doctors at the hospital said, increase in blood pressure, or changes in blood glucose levels in diabetic or non-diabetic individuals had not been mentioned in the vaccine trial data. “All three cases showed exceptionally good compliance with diet and exercise before administration of vaccine and maintained good glycemic control for a long time. In these cases, all the other causes of elevation of blood glucose were excluded. Overall, it appears that vaccines are a probable cause of sudden increase in blood glucose levels,” they added in the journal report. Dr Misra said, fortunately, in all these cases, the rise in blood sugar levels was self-limiting and did not require major changes in treatment. “But it is important for patients with a history of diabetes to be watchful of sudden increases in blood sugar or blood pressure. Good monitoring can prevent any potential complication,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/needle-of-suspicion-vaccine-could-lead-to-surge-in-blood-sugar-levels/articleshow/84156985.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Over 56% of the firms perceived a significant (over 6%) cost increase – up from 54% in April 2021. About 28% of the firms perceived a very significant cost increase. ‘The effect of the second wave of Covid-19 is still pervasive on sales expectations. Over 52% of the firms report that sales are much lower than normal,’ the result states. In addition, over 60% of the firms reported ‘much less than normal’ profit, further up from 55% in April. The analysis stated that a marginal improvement in sales expectations observed in May 2021 was more than offset by further increase in costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/costs-up-profits-down-for-msmes-inflation-survey/articleshow/84157032.cms||---

Jalgaon GMCH has handled bulk of the Covid patients in Jalgaon efficiently, along with patients coming from neighbouring districts and states, during the two waves. Jaiprakash Ramanand, the dean of Jalgaon GMCH, told TOI that the GMCH has started putting in place a series of measures to treat children, including including the new born, in case they contract Covid in the third wave. “We have completed a three-day extensive training of all our 250 nursing staff in treating children suffering from Covid. Unlike adult Covid patients, children need to be handled very carefully. They have been trained how to administer injections, check temperature etc,” he said The hospital authorities are now in the process of shortlisting 50 nurses of the 250, who would further be trained in handling paediatric patients admitted in ICU. “We have also purchased 10 paediatric ventilators, which will be used if needed. We also have 18 warmers that can be used in case the need arises,” said the dean. According to him, the GMCH has 15 beds at its paediatric ward, which will be initially used to treat children suffering from Covid. “In case paediatric cases rise, we shall make use of our burn ward, which has 18 beds and the postnatal ward comprising 39 beds. We can further ramp up our paediatric ward in case there is a need,” he said. The Jalgaon GMCH, which has a medical oxygen tank with a capacity of 20 MT, is in the process of setting up two more oxygen generation plants using the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) technology. Both the plants will produce oxygen over 23 litres/minute. “One PSA plant is being provided by the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) and the other one is being funded by the district planning and development council (DPDC), he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/jalgaon-gmch-starts-preparing-for-third-wave/articleshow/84150428.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Only about 11,000 people got the jabs across 39 centres that were operational in Bhopal on Monday. Three centres were privately run, where 550 people got vaccinated. People waited for over four hours to get inoculated at a school near Jayaprakash Hospital in Bhopal. Vaccination process became swift only after 11 am. Waiting for hours, some of the people created a ruckus. Seeing the deteriorating situation, police were called by the health officials; cops also had a tough time handling the angry crowds. “Had we been informed in the morning that there is a shortage of vaccine doses, we would not have stood in the queue for hours,” said Shyam Lal, a local. Vaccine in the centre was over within an hour, he added. Similar situation was reported from a vaccination centre at Govindpura. Without any visible police presence there, nursing staff stopped the vaccination after multiple queues were formed. On Monday, only Covishield vaccine was available; barely 200 doses were provided at most of the centres. At Anand Nagar higher secondary school too, vaccination was halted for over an hour. According to reports, an elderly person was injured in the chaos at centre near JP hospital. During the commotion, he fell on the ground and suffered a head injury; his relatives took him to JP hospital for immediate treatment. Later, the district hospital referred the 70-year-old man to AIIMS. Till date, 15,45,796 vaccine doses have been administered in Bhopal and 2,45,209 people have received both the shots of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/vaccine-shortage-leads-to-chaos-barely-11000-jabs-administered/articleshow/84152854.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Jailed under UAPA in October, activist Fr Stan Swamy (84) dies waiting for bail||MUMBAI: The 84-year-old rights activist-priest Stan Swamy, who remained in custody since October 2020 in the Elgar Parishad case under an anti-terror law (UAPA) despite repeated pleas for bail on grounds of old age and poor health, died at a Mumbai hospital on Monday. The Bombay HC was scheduled to hear his bail plea at 11am on Tuesday. His death was announced by Holy Family Hospital medical director, Dr Ian D’Souza, during a virtual session of the Bombay high court which was hearing Swamy’s plea for medical bail on a request for an urgent hearing at 2.30pm by his counsel Mihir Desai. Cause of death was a combination of pulmonary complications and Parkinson’s, the doctor informed the judges. Swamy had developed septicaemia too. He died at 1.24pm after suffering a cardiac arrest on Sunday at 4.30am, the doctor said. He had not regained consciousness after being put on the ventilator. The bench of Justices S S Shinde and NJ Jamadar recorded the news with a “heavy heart”. When Swamy’s health deteriorated in custody, the HC judges had overridden objections from the National Investigation Agency and ordered him shifted from Taloja jail to a private hospital on May 28. The NIA had suggested a government-run facility to which Swamy had said, “I would rather die here in prison.” He had tested Covid positive on admission, but recovered. While tributes poured in for the Jesuit priest and tribal rights champion, social media was thick with condemnation for the treatment meted out to the activist by the investigating agency and judiciary. Desai was all praise for the treatment at the hospital. The HC too acknowledged the care given. Swamy’s lawyer, however, alleged negligence by jail authorities and questioned the NIA’s conduct in opposing his bail. He said the agency had not sought even a day’s custody for questioning since his arrest and incarceration in Taloja prison. The chargesheet against him was filed on October 9, which meant the investigation was over and he should have been entitled to bail. Desai said, “there ought to be a probe against the authorities.’’ Last year, a special trial court had denied him medical bail and this March it said, given the seriousness of the allegations against Swamy it had “no hesitation” to conclude that “the collective interest of the community would outweigh the right of personal liberty of the applicant notwithstanding his “old age and or alleged sickness”.In April Swamy approached the HC to appeal against both orders. On May 28, a HC vacation bench directed his hospitalisation. He was shifted the same night from Taloja jail, where he had been lodged since his arrest in Ranchi. NIA had said sending him to a private hospital may set a “wrong precedent’’ but HC said given the “peculiar facts and circumstances of this case,” it was permitting the shift. Fr Swamy’s counsels Desai and Mihir Joshi had highlighted how he was “unable to stand, eat or visit the toilet” and his health was “extremely precarious with reduced oxygen saturation and acutely fluctuating blood pressure”. The HC was informed hospital expenses would be borne by Fr Swamy. On May 21, while the hearing on his weak condition was on, he had refused to be shifted to JJ hospital or even Holy Family. In a virtual interaction from prison, he said, “I would prefer to die here (in jail), than go to JJ Hospital.” The NIA had suggested the JJ prison ward. Swamy had told the court, “I was brought healthy, to Taloja jail eight months back but over a period all my body functions have deteriorated. I cannot eat on my own, can’t bathe nor walk unsupported. Though I have been getting medicines it has not helped.’’ A week on, Desai, asked by the HC to convince Swamy, did so and sought orders for his shift to Holy Family. The HC while directing Swamy’s hospitalisation for 15 days permitted hospital visits by Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, of St Peter’s Church. The hospitalization was extended till July 6. Desai said Fr Swamy has no family. “The Jesuits are his only family.’’ On his request, the HC directed his body be handed over to Fr Mascarenhas for the last rites in Mumbai. For the NIA, ASG Anil Singh and state’s public prosecutor Deepak Thakare said they would abide by HC’s order. Thakare said inquest and post mortem is needed, since the undertrial was in custody. The HC directed it be done forthwith. Desai said last rites will be in conformity with State’s pandemic SOP. The HC directed that all medical and post-mortem reports be placed before it next Tuesday, when Desai said he will make further submissions in the matter. Just last week Fr Swamy had freshly petitioned HC against section Section 43 D (5), UAPA which bars bail if a court forms prima facie opinion that accusations are true. Swamy had also questioned the terminology ‘frontal organizations’ in the UAPA first schedule, claiming its use by prosecuting agencies to “arbitrarily’’ oppose bail pleas. The NIA had claimed that Bagaicha, an organization founded by Fr Swamy to empower tribals, is connected with a frontal organization of the CPI (Maoist).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/jailed-under-uapa-in-oct-activist-fr-stan-84-dies-waiting-for-bail/articleshow/84158871.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Produce Pune court records, HC tells state on activist Sudha Bharadwaj’s bail plea||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the state to produce relevant records of the 2018 Pune trial court proceedings in relation to the chargesheet filed in the Elgar Parishad case against activist-lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj. Bharadwaj’s case is that the Pune trial court judge, K D Vadane, was “not a designated special court judge” and hence his order was not valid and she was entitled to default bail under law. Default bail is granted when chargesheet is not filed within the statutory period—in this case, 90 days —under the Criminal Procedure Code, unless an extension is granted by court.At a virtual hearing on Tuesday before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, Bharadwaj’s counsel Yug Chaudhry and Payoshi Roy said an RTI reply by the HC registry had disclosed that judge Vadane was a district and additional sessions judge and not appointed as special judge by the state government under Section 22 of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act for the period between January 2018 and July 2019. The HC said, “We will not allow the respondent-state to file reply, since we have heard substantially.” In its reply, the NIA said Bharadwaj was “rightly produced before judge Vadane and he rightly remanded the accused to police custody initially and then to judicial custody… and rightly rejected’’ her bail plea. The agency opposed her petition saying her contention would lead to “absurd interpretations of the law”. It said the case was initially registered only under Indian Penal Code (IPC), and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) was invoked only on May 17, 2018. However, Bharadwaj said she was arrested on August 28, 2018, after the UAPA was invoked. Chaudhry submitted that if the RTI information was found correct, then not only would Bharadwaj’s detention, but those of the eight other co-accused in the Elgar Parishad case, would also be deemed illegal. The state has not filed its reply yet. Section 11 of the NIA Act is at the “heart of argument’’, said Chaudhry. It provides that a special court shall be constituted by notification and be presided over by a judge appointed by the Centre as recommended by the HC chief justice. “It cannot be said that a special judge and a sessions judge are the same,’’ he added. Section 22 of the Act empowers the state to constitute special courts for trial of offences, in case one has not been appointed. So, said Chaudhry, there are two questions: One whether the Pune judge was appointed under the NIA Act either by the state or the Centre; second, whether or not the state had appointed any special judge under Section 22?’’ The HC will hear the matter on July 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/produce-pune-court-records-hc-tells-state-on-activist-bharadwajs-bail-plea/articleshow/84189411.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Post-Covid scourge? After mucormycosis, ‘bone death’ cases surging in Maharashtra: Doctors||MUMBAI: There is a surge in cases of ‘bone death’ or avascular necrosis among post-Covid patients across the state, including Mumbai, according to orthopaedic specialists. A day after TOI wrote about three cases of avascular necrosis (AVN) reported in a medical journal, BMJ Cases, from Hinduja Hospital in Mahim, various doctors reported similar findings in their daily practice. Covid patients treated with steroids during long hospital stay are the common factors among those affected. “At our daily outpatient clinic, we see one or two fresh cases of avascular necrosis among post-Covid patients,” said Prof Dr S Mohanty from KEM Hospital. Nagpur-based orthopaedic surgeon Dr Sushrut Babulkar said he treated up to 40 patients with AVN in the last five weeks. “All had previously suffered from Covid and were given steroids,” he said. Ahmednagar orthopaedic surgeon Dr Vijay Deshpande, who suffered from Covid in August 2020, is himself recovering from surgery for avascular necrosis. “Before my surgery on June 18, I operated on 17 patients, all post-Covid, for avascular necrosis between May 1 and June 17,” he told TOI over the phone. “In the pre-Covid period, I would operate on two or three such cases in a month, and now I had done 17 in weeks.” Deshpande’s Covid treatment stretched for a month and he needed prolonged use of steroids after developing a little-known neurological disorder, Parsonage Turner Syndrome, which causes severe pain in the upper arm and shoulder. This prompted him to undergo screening; the MRI scan showed the tell-tale ‘bone death’ on the head of the thigh bones. Doctors fear AVN cases will increase in the coming days. “AVN develops five to 12 months after exposure to steroids. During the second wave, irrational use of steroids was reported across the country. Cases will start rising in a month or two,” said Babulkar. However, the exact trigger for this rise in AVN cases is not clear. “We have to study if it is the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is leading to avascular necrosis or is it the steroid use alone. A combination of these two factors could also be the answer,” said Mohanty, who is the president of the Indian Arthroplasty Association. His unit at KEM Hospital has started maintaining a file on AVN among Covid survivors. “We have to also establish if these patients had early stages of necrosis that worsened with Covid and steroids,” he added. On July 2, Hinduja Hospital medical director Dr Sanjay Agarwala’s article was published in ‘BMJ Cases’ highlighting AVN among three under-40 doctors within two months of suffering from Covid. AVN disproportionately affects the young, and as the second wave affected more youngsters than the first wave in 2020, there is a cause for worry. “If a Covid survivor has hip or thigh pain, don’t pop a paracetamol. Get a screening done at the earliest,” said Babulkar.

Madhya Pradesh swimming association urges reopening of swimming pools||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh swimming association (MPSA) has demanded the opening of swimming pools in the state capital and other parts of the state. A delegation presented a memorandum to home minister Narottam Mishra on Monday. Joint secretary, MPSA, Ramkumar Khilrani said that other neighbouring states like Karnataka, Gujarat and others have opened swimming pools. “Swimmers are facing heavy losses in their training due to the closed pools. We have urged the home minister that the pools must be opened at the earliest,” said Khilrani. Asked about losses the swimmers are facing, Khilrani said, “Several events are to be organised sooner or later. In such a situation the MP swimmers will be at a big loss in the absence of the training. Other state swimmers will get an edge over our swimmers.” About the Covid protocols, Khilrani said that the association has assured the state government that they will follow all protocols. “Every swimming pool mixes sodium hypochlorite and copper sulphate to clean the water. These chemicals will keep any virus away from the pool. It is a proven study,” claimed Khilrani. Besides, he added that the swimmers swim in their own lane so they keep a proper distance with each other. He added that even important pools like Shishu Kunj and others are also closed which are under Khelo India. “Several important swimmers are not able to get training due to this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/right-time-to-take-the-plunge-mpsa-urges-for-reopening-swimming-pools/articleshow/84152901.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Kisan Sabha renews stir seeking better milk price||NASHIK: The Kisan Sabha has launched an agitation to stress on their demand for getting better prices for dairy farmers and is also meeting the elected-representatives asking them to look into the issue of enacting a law for the same. The move comes after dairy development minister Sunil Kedar accepted the demand for fair price for the milk producers, but failed to take steps in announcing the same. “We agitated for fair price and revenue sharing so that milk farmers can get good returns for their produce from the milk processing industries. The minister has assured to take steps, but there has been no announcement on the same so far,” Dr Ajit Navale, chief of Dudh Utpadak Shetkari Sangharsh Samiti and an office-bearer of the Kisan Sabha, said. Navale claimed that during the lockdown, the milk processing units lowered the buying price under the garb of lower turnover and reduced demand, but the retail prices of milk were never reduced. “The milk producers were looted by both the cooperative and the private associations,” he said. After the agitation in June, Kedar had assured a price of Rs 35 per litre price for milk producers along with revenue sharing as part of the Fair and Remunerative Pricing (FRP) by enacting a law. “But neither the law has been enacted, nor has there been any change in the price offered to the milk producers,” he said. “The state government is in session from Monday and that is the reason we have started the campaign of contacting every law maker — physically or via email — and urging them to take steps towards enacting a law for the farmers,” Navale said. “Many of our people are meeting the MLAs at local level and at the same time MLA Vinod Nikole is also meeting other MLAs to raise awareness among them about the issue,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/kisan-sabha-renews-stir-seeking-better-milk-price/articleshow/84120832.cms||---
---||Delhi||Muck stops here: Saplings on road divider at Bhishma Pitamah Marg share space with debris||NEW DELHI: A green activist has lodged a complaint with Delhi government’s forest department about the planting of saplings on the road divider on Bhishma Pitamah Marg without removing the debris and muck. Suhas Borker, founder member of Green Circle of Delhi, said the central verge on the road has a lot of debris left over from the PWD’s construction activities, but it was being covered with fresh soil without getting rid of the that muck, putting the survival of saplings being planted there at great risk. When TOI visited the site on Monday, it found that bollards, stones and bricks were dumped next to the saplings. Plastic wrappers, disposable plates and other waste generated by nearby shops were also strewn on the central verge. One could discern fresh earth piled on the divider on one stretch. Borker said, “This is a gross violation of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, and the various orders of National Green Tribunal on the plantation of trees on the central verge on Bhishma Pitamah Marg, west of Defence Colony. The construction debris on the central verge is being covered with fresh earth. The saplings are being planted without clearing this debris. This means the saplings are at grave risk. This is utter negligence of the established standard operating procedure for plantations.” In his complaint, Borker said, “This particular stretch has seen repeated plantations with zero to miniscule survival rate due to the negligence and lackadaisical attitude of the officers concerned. In July 2010, on the eve of the Commonwealth Games, huge palm trees were planted but not one has survived.” Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forests (South), said, “The planted saplings don’t fall under the jurisdiction of a tree officer. However, the greening agency that is carrying out the plantation will be suitably advised on how to ensure successful growth.” He added that under the legal definition, tree saplings did not fall under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act. A PWD official admitted that the material lying on the road was the result of the ongoing work on the road. “We will get the muck cleared as soon as the road work gets over, likely within the next 10 days,” said the official, who added that PWD was ensuring that the material lying on the road did not cause any traffic jams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/muck-stops-here-saplings-share-space-with-debris/articleshow/84154791.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana moves NGT against Andhra Pradesh’s Seema project, seeks action||HYDERABAD: Upping the ante against the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP) being ‘illegally’ constructed by Andhra Pradesh, Telangana on Monday filed a contempt petition in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Chennai bench urging the tribunal to initiate action against the AP government for its wilful violation of NGT’s earlier orders. Telangana also wrote a letter to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to hold a full board instead of a threemember committee to discuss all the issues pertaining to AP’s irrigation projects, water sharing and issues pertaining to Krishna river. It again urged the KRMB to convene a meeting after July 20 as its officials were busy with kharif season. The state government also dashed off a letter to the Union ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) on Monday, asking it to be ‘careful’ while considering giving environmental clearance (EC) to the RLIP during its meeting scheduled to be held on July 7. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar filed the petition in the NGT, charging AP with violating the tribunal’s earlier orders on the RLIP. “Initiate action and pass appropriate orders under sections 26 and 28 of NGT Act, 2010, against the respondent (AP) for wilful violation of the October 29, 2020, order of the tribunal,” he urged the NGT in the petition. The petition also asked NGT to restrain AP from executing RLIP without seeking EC from Centre and Krishna River Management Board (KRMB). The CS made the MoEF, Union ministry of Jal Shakti, AP chief secretary and KRMB as respondents. In its earlier order, the NGT had asked AP not to go ahead with the RLIP works without the EC and directed the KRMB in another order to inspect the project site. The NGT has also asked the tribunal to initiate action against the executing agency, SPML Infra, for taking up the works in violation of its orders. Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao said the state would not keep quiet while stressing that the state would continue hydel power generation on Krishna projects. The CM also announced that Telangana would utilise 50 per cent of Krishna waters till final allocations are made by KRMB. In his letter to the KRMB on Monday, Telangana special chief secretary (irrigation) Rajat Kumar said it was surprising that member-secretary of KRMB had mentioned issues raised by AP in the agenda at the July 9 meeting, but skirted several issues raised by Telangana. He mentioned about five major issues which needed to be incorporated in the agenda. “Revision of the water sharing ratio of Krishna river waters for the current water year, steps to stop construction of ‘illegal’ RLIP and Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme right canal by AP immediately, steps to stop excess diversion by AP from Pothireddypadu head regulator and other projects outside the basin, revoking 20 per cent of total water drawn as usage towards drinking water supply and appropriate accounting of savings by Telangana out of water releases ordered by the KRMB,” Rajat Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-moves-ngt-against-aps-seema-project-seeks-action/articleshow/84158858.cms||Koride Mahesh

With 457 people getting discharged, the total number of active cases stood at 2,992. The total number of people getting discharged stood at 2,16,952, taking the recovery rate to 97.7%. The district recorded seven deaths due to the virus, the highest in the state on the day, taking the toll to 2,076. One of the victims was a 40-year-old man who was diabetic and had heart problems. He was admitted on June 17 in CMCH and tested positive on June 23. He died on July 4. A 48-year-old man was admitted on June 24, tested positive on June 25 and died on July 1. The number of people vaccinated against the virus stood at 9.57 lakh on Monday. Considering that the district’s population is around 45 lakh, this means that 21.2% of the people have at least received their first shot. “We don’t have a set target, but hope to ensure that as many people as possible get both their shots by September and the entire adult population gets at least one shot, making them immune to severe disease and hopefully prevents transmission to children,” said deputy director of public health Dr Senthil Kumar. “All this depends on the availability of vaccines.” September-end would be ideal for most of the population to get vaccinated, keeping in mind that the third wave is predicted to hit around November. “Getting vaccinated is the only way that people can tide over the next wave,” said epidemiologist and former director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy. As the district is yet to get fresh stocks of the vaccine, vaccination camps were not conducted for the public on Monday in rural and corporation limits. “Vaccine stocks are already exhausted,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-records-seven-covid-casualties-highest-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/84157061.cms||---

He said PSPCL was purchasing maximum available power from the energy exchange market. On July 4, PSPCL purchased 1,178 MW at Rs 4.07 per unit, he said. “PSPCL has purchased power due to failure of second unit of TSPL (660MW) and less power generation from Bhakhra dam (due to lower water level). Against the maximum demand of 13,148MW in 2020-21the PSPCL has supplied 13,525 MW as the highest in a day in the state. On Sunday, PSPCL managed 13,213 MW from all sources including 8,188 MW (outside state, including purchase), 2,425MW (IPPs), 1,740MW (own thermal plants) and 860 MW (own hydel power). On an average, 10.3 hours of supply was provided to agriculture sector (border zone (14.7 hours), north zone (11 hours) and south zone (10.2 hours),” said Prasad.During a visit to SLDC office, the CMD in the presence of PSPCL director (generation) Parmjeet Singh and PSTCL director (technical) Yogesh Tandon appealed to SLDC officers to accept challenges being faced by PSPCL/PSTCL during the ongoing peak demand period. Earlier Prasad took a review meeting, regarding power situation of Punjab in the presence of director (distribution) D P S Grewal, director (commercial) Gopal Sharma, director (generation) Parmjeet Singh and others and discussed regulatory measures imposed on industry last week.

He said bureaucratic control had reduced ministers to mere showpieces. Sidhu said, “Badal-signed PPAs are looting Punjab and legal options against them are limited due to their protection from courts. Only way forward is new legislation in Punjab vidhan sabha with retro effect, capping power purchase prices to make the anti-people agreements redundant.” “A white paper on PPAs must be brought in Punjab assembly to make Badals & other authors of these corrupt agreements accountable to people... I have been demanding this since 2017. But bureaucratic control of the department makes people-elected ministers mere showpieces.” There had been a proposal to issue a white paper by the Punjab government on the power scenario and focusing on the PPAs signed by the previous SAD-BJP regime. Sidhu, who quit the cabinet after his portfolio was changed to power from local bodies, earlier tweeted advice to CM Amarinder Singh on Saturday. On Saturday, the CM had announced his government will soon take a decision on legal ways to counter the PPAs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-demands-new-power-purchase-laws/articleshow/84157097.cms||---

The protest led by former Sulur MLA P K Dhinakaran saw around 30 people turn up in black shirts, holding their party flag. “With diesel prices shooting up to Rs 94.4 and petrol to Rs 100 per litre, prices of all other commodities, including construction materials, kitchen essentials like vegetables and spices etc., have increased. Without controlling prices of these items, they have opened Tasmac outlets,” he said. “With the pandemic still around and no jobs, people can’t buy even their basic needs,” he added.

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Parents in lurch as government schools demand transfer certificate||COIMBATORE: A former ambulance driver, who is now nearly out of work as a concrete mixer truck driver, approached the collector on Monday stating that he had to pull his two children out of a private school because of his inability to pay the fees. However, the two government schools he is now trying to admit them are demanding a transfer certificate, which the private school refuses to give without paying the due fees. Many factory and mill workers in rural areas are also considering moving their children to government schools from private schools, especially when online class is the new norm. Kannan Manikandan, who used to work for 108 Ambulance in Palani, moved to Coimbatore towards the end of 2020 to find work. He managed to find work as a concrete mixer driver. “I put my son in Class IX and daughter in Class V in St Paul’s School in KNG Pudur,” he said in his petition to the collector in the city. “I initially paid a fee of Rs 38,000 for one term for both,” he said. Due to the poor economic condition and the prevailing pandemic, Manikandan said he found himself often without work and unable to pay the fee for both his children for the third term of 2020-’21 academic year. “Thus, I decided to pull them out and put them either in Pannimadai Government School or Ashokapuram Government School. But now both government schools are constantly calling us and asking for a transfer certificate at least for our son because he is going to Class X,” Manikandan said. The driver also showed constant SMSes and notes given to his daughter and son, demanding payment of the third term fee from the private school. For Mithun Karthik, they demanded a fee of Rs 22,970 and Rs 14,000-odd for his daughter. “The school says I have to pay 75% or at least two terms fees to give me a transfer certificate, which I can’t afford because I had no work for the past two months,” the driver said. The district revenue officer said he would investigate it. The chief education officer, M Ramakrishnan, said transfer certificates are compulsory in government schools for admission from Class IX nine onwards. “Till Class VIII under the RTI Act, transfer certificates are not required, but from Class IX it is required. While no government school will refuse education, it is a protocol that they get a transfer certificate,” he said. “ If the complaint is forwarded to us, we will look into it,” he added. A growing number of people in rural areas are considering the same move. “After my husband and brother lost their jobs, it’s with my salary that I am supporting them. Since it is an online class which my son doesn’t understand, I am considering shifting him from PUMS School to the Thondamuthur Government School,” said T Puniyavani, a domestic maid. “I am also trying to shift my son from Pioneer Aided school to a government school,” a private mill driver said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/parents-in-lurch-as-govt-schools-demand-tc/articleshow/84157093.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||New insect species discovered in biodiversity-rich Nilgiris||UDHAGAMANDALAM: Researchers from the molecular biodiversity laboratory in the department of Zoology and Wildlife Biology in the Government Arts College in Ooty have discovered a new wingless insect in the Nilgiris. A research paper on the new species has been published in international journal Biologia published by Springer Nature. “The 1mm-long flightless insect has been named Bionychiurus tamilensis as it was recorded in Tamil Nadu,” said associate professor and laboratory head R Sanil. “There are only six species under this genus reported so far across the world and reported only from cold high-altitude regions of Switzerland, China and Korea.” The insect was first observed in 2018 in the soil samples collected from Ooty Government Arts College campus. Further surveys showed its presence in grasslands and unpolluted humus soil samples. “We could not isolate the species from soil collected from agricultural lands and waste dumping yards. We assume this is due to presence of pesticides and is an indicator of soil pollution,” said Sanil. “An endemic one, similar genus is not reported even from the Himalayas or northeast region.” Scientists believe the genus diverged around 450 million years ago, said Muhsina Thunisa, lead author of the research paper.

On Sunday night, cops who were called in by the neighbours too faced the fury of the fighting couple. Dharmesh Gohel (27) and his wife Hetal created a din when Jamnagar police went to their residence on Khakhi Nagar. Head constable of C division police Dhaval Gosai lodged a complaint against the couple for obstructing public servants from discharging their duty. “When we reached to question the couple at their residence, Dharmesh refused to co-operate with the police while his wife Hetal threatened to attempt suicide by consuming poison. She also lay down before the police vehicle. It was a difficult time to handle the couple. We detained Dharmesh on Sunday night,” a police official said. “Neighbours of the couple have been complaining about them for the last few months. The two used to quarrel among themselves and also with the neighbours,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/couple-quarrels-man-held-for-ruckus/articleshow/84152963.cms||---

In his condolence message, the chief minister said it is unjustifiable that a man, who fought all through his life for our society’s most downtrodden, had to die in custody. Such travesty of justice should have no place in our democracy, he said. Satheesan said that the death of Fr Swamy is a murder by the government. He was a social servant who devoted more than five decades for the tribal and the downtrodden. He said that the crime that Fr Swamy had committed was that he raised his voice for the poor and the weaker classes of the society. The country has lost a person who is a combination of justice, humanity and fearlessness. It is a classic example of how the government is taming the Constitution of the country, he said. In his condolence message, speaker M B Rajesh said that Fr Swamy was an eye sore for those looting the country’s mineral wealth, as he relentlessly fought for the rights of the tribals and the oppressed class. It is a cruel fact that he was denied even the rights which an undertrial prisoner is eligible for. The government and judiciary cannot wash off its responsibility from this incident. It is a blot on the country’s democracy, he said. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy said that Fr Swamy, who spent his whole life for the tribal community, will remain in painful memory. A person who fought all through his life for the human rights of others has died after being denied his rights, he said. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said that he was a victim of government-sponsored terror. It is a black day in the country’s democracy. Even when his health deteriorated, the government failed in providing proper treatment, he said. CPM politburo member M A Baby said that none other than Narendra Modi-led government can kill a saint like Fr Swamy who spent his whole life for the upliftment of the downtrodden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/such-travesty-of-justice-has-no-place-in-democracy-cm/articleshow/84154824.cms||---

Unlike before when events were held at marriage palaces and banquet halls with hundreds of people gathered at one venue, this time the Ludhiana garment manufacturers are organising exhibitions inside hotel rooms. Lately, 96 rooms of a city’s five-star hotel on Ferozepur Road have been booked by garment manufacturers to run a three-day expo, starting Monday. Though earlier too exhibitors would book rooms, the major focus of the event used to be the exhibition in the common hall. Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, said, “Due to the coronavirus, for the past almost 15 months no garment exhibition could be held in Ludhiana, leading to a huge drop in business orders. Majority of our business volume is dependent on such events, as buyers are able to see the material because it is not possible to send them so many samples. Moreover, face-to-face interactions increase chances of getting confirmed orders.” Kairpal said earlier too some garment houses used to hold expos in rooms, but common events like fashion shows or gatherings at banquet halls ran parallel. “This is for the first time that every exhibitor has opted for rooms and no common meeting is being organised,” he added. Montu Chawla, an exhibitor, said, “We are getting a very good response from the buyers, as a large number of visitors from other states have come here. A total of 96 rooms have been booked by different manufacturers and we will run this expo for three days. Barring last year, we have been organising events and exhibitions and inviting buyers to finalise orders. This is the first time that so many rooms have been booked.” Sanjay Jalota, another exhibitor, said, “Holding expo in a room is a bit inconvenient, but serves the purpose as we get a chance to interact with the buyers and understand their requirements. With such events spanning over two to three days, we can also manufacture samples according to buyers’ demands and show these to them before they go back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/making-room-for-garment-expos-in-city/articleshow/84152953.cms||Mohit Behl

The arrested were identified as B Ashok Kumar, 49, of PN Pudur, P Sasikumar, 47, of Chinna Thadagam, AG Sampathkumar, 39, of Pannimadai and S Devaraj, 55, of Athappapalayam near Tiruchengode in Namakkal district. A country-made gun, torchlights were seized from them. On Sunday night, the four were hunting a wild boar in a reserve forest at Marudhamalai beat. After hearing a gunshot, people from Meenakshi Nagar and IOB Colony alerted the forest department officials who along with anti-poaching watchers rushed to the spot. On conducting vehicle checks, they intercepted a car and found a single barrel breech load (SBBL) gun in the vehicle. Immediately, the officials secured the four men who were travelling in the car and seized the gun. They were booked under the Wildlife Protection Act and remanded in judicial custody on Monday night. According to sources, Ashok Kumar wanted to become a national-level shooter and underwent training at a rifle club. Later, he became a hunter. He was fined Rs 1 lakh for hunting wild animals at Pethikuttai in the Sirumugai forest range in 2004. In 2013, former Boluvampatti ranger C Dineshkumar arrested him for hunting three deer. His gun licence was cancelled by the district administration. On October 25, 2018, Ashok Kumar was arrested along with three others for attempting to poach wild animals at Narasipuram and a country-made gun, bullets and two motorcycles were seized from them.

---||Bhopal||For soya farmers in Madhya Pradesh, it’s either rain or ruin||BHOPAL: With the state government discouraging farmers from cultivating soybean amid a long, dry and hot spell of monsoon, the soyabean crop is likely to be affected adversely in Madhya Pradesh. Those who went ahead with the sowing purchased soya seeds at rates as high as Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per quintal. For them, the coming two to three days are very crucial. Last year the crop was sown in about 58.54 lakh hectares in MP while in Maharashtra, it was sown in about 43 lakh hectares area. The two states together constitute almost 89% of the country’s soyabean production. Malwa region in western MP, produces almost 50% of the oilseed. After the government’s announcement this year regarding oilseed production, a large number of farmers shifted to other crops including corn and paddy. In Ujjain district alone — one of the soya pockets in Malwa — farmers have sown paddy in over 2,000 hectares of land. “This may be small but it’s a very significant development,” said Bharat Singh, spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh in Malwa region. He criticized both the state and centre for neglecting the soya seed research and development. Singh added that 80% farmers who have sown soyabean in Malwa wait for the revival of monsoon and if it doesn’t happen soon, their crops will face irreparable loss. Bhupesh Patidar, a farmer near Bhopal, said after good rainfall last month many farmers around Bhopal went ahead with sowing. But for the last fortnight or so, there has been no rainfall and the moisture in the soil is fast evaporating. “It should rain or I will be ruined,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/for-soya-farmers-its-either-rain-or-ruin/articleshow/84152958.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Edappadi teachers in soup as student tampers Class X marksheet||SALEM: Tampering of the provisional marksheet by a Class X student to get admission in Class XI has landed education department officials and teachers of a government higher secondary school in Edappadi in deep trouble. The state government recently ordered to consider 50% of Class X marks, 20% of Class XI marks and 30% of Class XII internal marks to allot final marks for Class XII students. “We learned that the student had failed in English subject in the Class X board examination held in the 2018-19 academic year,” an official from the education department said. According to the officer, the boy failed in English subject by securing 31 marks out of 100 in the Class X board examination. But he tampered the marksheet and changed it into just pass mark of 35. While checking the marks of Class XII students of the academic year 2020-21 to allot final marks as prescribed by the state government, the teachers found that the student had failed in English but was admitted in Class XI. They immediately alerted chief educational officer (CEO) T Ganesh Moorthy, who directed officials for an inquiry. When contacted by TOI, the CEO said that he had informed the directorate office to delete the student’s name from the Class XI and XII examination lists. “We will not issue the certificates to the student,” he said. He said that he would take necessary action against the schoolteachers who failed to notice the tampering of the marksheet. The CEO said due to the continuous holidays because of Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and this year, the teachers failed to check the marksheets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/teachers-in-soup-as-student-tampers-class-x-marksheet/articleshow/84157131.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Nandkumar Singh Chauhan’s son Harsh Vardhan Chauhan for Lok Sabha seat ticket in Khandwa||BHOPAL: Ahead of the bypolls to the Khandwa Lok Sabha and three assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh, several leaders in BJP have started staking their claims for a ticket. In Khandwa, supporters of Harsh Vardhan Chauhan, son of former Member of Parliament late Nandkumar Singh Chauhan, have propped him as a successor to the senior Chauhan. On Monday, Chauhan supporters led by former MLA Manju Dadu called on BJP state joint-general secretary (organisation), Hitanand, at the party's state office. Harsh Vardhan has emerged as a strong contender for the ticket amid a few names doing rounds in the political circles including BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya and former minister Archana Chitnis. Sources said that Chauhan supporters have also garnered support from other MLAs in the Lok Sabha constituency. "Harsh Vardhan is touring the constituency and meeting voters. There are other names too, but, we have to fulfil the dream of Nandu Bhaiyya ji, who played a very important role in the development of Khandwa Lok Sabha constituency. We arrived to talk to Hitanand ji and this was a courtesy call. We will support any candidate nominated by the party," former MLA Manju Dadu told TOI without naming Harsh Vardhan. She said BJP has a tradition to nominate candidates for the election and all party workers follow the same. "Harsh Vardhan will take up the development of Khandwa constituency like his father. We support him instead of an outsider," said a BJP worker pleading anonymity. Harsh Vardhan, however, did not disclose his intentions to contest the by-elections. "My father has a long relationship with the public in the entire Khandwa constituency. Everybody in the family and constituency felt his absence due to untimely demise. I am maintaining those relations as a simple party worker. I have never thought of any political plan and will accept what the party decides. There were speculations in social media about my contesting the by-poll but, I have not discussed it as of now," Harsh Vardhan told TOI. Sources said that BJP is hoping to sail through the bypoll on the sentimental wave of Nandu Bhaiyya who passed away due to Covid-19 infection in March this year. The Congress is most likely to field former union minister Arun Yadav, who holds sway in the region among OBC voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nandu-bhaiyas-supporters-prop-up-his-son-for-khandwa-ls-seat/articleshow/84152982.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Illegal immigrants caused West Bengal violence: Talk at RSS virtual meet||NAGPUR: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) last week held a virtual meet with around 1,500 persons, where the organization presented its view of the West Bengal post-poll violence. The address by Pradip Joshi, senior functionary handling affairs in West Bengal and Assam, claimed the real perpetrators of the violence were illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Mixing with Trinamool Congress workers, they were the ones who indulged in acts of violence and rape, it said. The participants included professionals like doctors, engineers and lawyers, who are not full time RSS workers, apart from other functionaries. There are plans to take batches of 1,000 persons each from different parts of the country to show them the ground reality in the state. The meet was part of the RSS’ Vichar Manch, which takes up discussions on latest issues in the country. The idea was to sensitise people about the situation in Bengal. It was stressed that citizens from the rest of the country should see the Bengal crisis as their own responsibility. There were signs that the state is heading towards a constitutional crisis, said Sunil Kitkaru of the Vichar Manch in Nagpur. The participants were from all over Vidarbha, he said. “There are plans to take people in batches of thousand each to West Bengal, where they would be holding protests against the violence. Videos and other visuals of the violence were also shown,” said Kitkaru. Quoting Joshi, he said 124 persons were killed and there have been 3,500 incidents, including crime against women. More than 11,000 persons have taken refuge in neighbouring states. The miscreants have been demanding money to allow residents to return and live in their own homes. Even the women are at risk from the perpetrators, the meeting heard. It was stressed that there are certain radical groups with Bangladeshi infiltrators in their rank and file who are creating trouble. However, even the state government machinery has become a mute spectator because of vote bank politics of Trinamool, Kitkaru said. The polarization was seen during the state elections, which had one-sided votes of immigrants to Trinamool, added Kitkaru, explaining what was discussed in the meet. “RSS workers and other volunteers will also offer help in monetary terms and also legal aid to the victims. People from the state living in other parts of the country are being contacted to know if any of their kin have suffered due to the violence in the state,” he said. It was shared during the meet that cattle smuggling, fake currency and smuggled arms are common along the border with Bangladesh. Arms smuggling also brings trouble makers from the other side to India, said Kitkaru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/illegal-immigrants-caused-wb-violence-talk-at-rss-virtual-meet/articleshow/84152975.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Chandigarh||Average price for power higher in Delhi than Punjab, says CM Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Lashing out at his Delhi counterpart over the latter’s alleged failure to provide free power to farmers in the national capital, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, on Monday, accused Arvind Kejriwal of making false promises of supplying free power in Punjab to woo voters ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections. “The Kejriwal government has completely failed people of Delhi on all counts with no free power to farmers in villages located in the national capital and excessively high power tariffs for the industry,” alleged Amarinder. He claimed that people of Punjab had rejected the Delhi model of governance on all counts. The Punjab chief minister termed the Delhi power tariff structure a case of “organized loot” by the Kejriwal-led AAP government. He claimed that the Delhi government was allowing private power distribution companies to collect excessively high tariffs from the common man. He said while Delhi was charging Rs 9.80 per unit for industrial power, the Congress government in Punjab was levying a subsidized tariff of Rs 5 per unit to attract industry to Punjab. He also said there had been more than Rs 85,000 crore worth of investment on the ground in the last four years. Subsidised power is currently being given to 1,43,812 industrial units in Punjab with an annual subsidy of Rs 2,226 crore, he pointed out. “ In sharp contrast to Punjab, where the government was giving free power worth Rs 6,735 crore to 13,79,217 farmers, the AAP government in Delhi made no effort whatsoever to extend similar support to the agricultural community there,” said the chief minister. He alleged that the Kejriwal government was among the first to notify one of the anti-farmer agricultural laws of the Centre in Delhi and said AAP pretended to be sympathetic towards farmers of Punjab. On electricity tariff, Amarinder said the Delhi government was fooling people by putting a small amount into one pocket by way of 200 units of free domestic power and taking away a higher amount from the other pocket by way of high tariffs paid by shopkeepers, industry and farmers for commercial and agriculture power. The Delhi Government was charging Rs 11.34 per unit from small shopkeepers and other commercial establishments, which was 50% higher than the charge in Punjab, he said. Comparing subsidies of the two states, Amarinder said that the Punjab government was paying an annual power subsidy bill of Rs 10,458 crore while the Kejriwal government was paying Rs 2,820 crore when the population of Delhi was two crore compared with Punjab’s three crore. He said this translated into average power subsidy of Rs 3,486 per person in Punjab, as against Rs 1,410 for a Delhi resident. Amarinder added that the Punjab government was giving subsidised power amounting to Rs 10,458 crore, or 2.24% of its total revenue, while Delhi government provided a subsidy of Rs 2,820 crore, which is only 1.03 % of its total revenues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/average-price-for-power-higher-in-delhi-than-punjab-says-amarinder/articleshow/84157139.cms||---

The SAD president said the issue of fixed charges was being politicised by both the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) even though they knew that this charge was applicable on private and government thermal plants as well as power purchased from outside the state. He said fixed charge for private thermal plants was Rs 1.50 per unit and that paid to government thermal plants when they were closed was Rs 2.35 per unit. “Punjab has paid a fixed charge of Rs 7,000 crore to government thermal plants during the last five years as per state electricity regulatory commission figures,” he added. The SAD president said if cheap power was possible by cancelling private purchase agreements (PPAs) made with three private thermal plants, then these should be annulled. “However, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh should take the responsibility of covering the shortfall of 4,500 megawatt of power at cheaper rates so that Punjabis do not suffer due to this step, ” he added. Sukhbir said the SAD-led government took the decision to make Punjab power surplus and followed a standard PPA document created by the UPA government to establish captive thermal plants in the private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-give-24x7-affordable-power/articleshow/84157173.cms||---

I gave those notes to my mother to return and the man handed over the bundle to me. I felt some notes were missing. Before I could stop the man, he ran away from there. I rushed out and tried to chase him, but to no avail,” she added. Ritika asked the bank employees to check the footage of CCTV cameras installed on the premises as the man was not wearing a mask. “The bank employees told me that the CCTVs were not functioning,” she said. Division 1 police station SHO sub-inspector Harjit Singh said the statements of the victims have been recorded and an FIR was being lodged.

He passed away on Monday at Holy Family hospital in Mumbai. Archbishop of Verapoly Joseph Kalathiparambil said that Fr Swamy was a person who stood for those who were denied justice in the society and ‘Has Stan Swamy got justice?’ remains a question in the conscience of the society. He said that the demise of Fr Swamy, who was a humanitarian and spent his whole life for the welfare of adivasis, the downtrodden and the marginalized sections of the society, was shocking. “Although he was arrested, accused of Maoist links, the investigation team was not able to prove the allegations against him. His demise happened when he was at the hospital for treatment and the death comes as a shock to the collective conscience of the society,” said Kalathiparambil. Kerala Catholic Bishop’s Council also condoled the demise of Fr Swamy. “In his last days, his activities were for the welfare of adivasis in Jharkhand. A lot of complaints had arisen about Fr Swamy, who was incarcerated under the anti-terror law, being denied even natural justice. He was moved to hospital due to the interference of the court when his health had deteriorated. Several people are in extreme grief over his death,” Cardinal Mar George Alencherry, president of KCBC, said in the statement. The cardinal said in the statement that KCBC joins in the grief of the several thousand people who received his services, especially the members of the Society of Jesuits. “KCBC condoles the demise of the social welfare activist, human rights activist Jesuit priest Fr Stan Swamy, who was always on the side of the poor. I pray for Fr Stan Swamy, offering him eternal peace,” the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/church-leaders-condole-death-of-fr-stan-swamy/articleshow/84154893.cms||---

The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) operated 187 mofussil and 324 town buses on the first day, said an official. “But footfall was minimal. We have decided to increase the number of buses and hope to build trust with more passengers after a couple of days,” he said. “As per a state government order, women, transgender people and disabled people are allowed to travel for free on 207 ordinary buses.” Tasmac outlets also witnessed poor footfall, said a salesman. “We expected huge crowds and made necessary arrangements to control crowds. We erected barricades and marked circles in front of outlets to ensure social distancing. Three cops were deployed in front of each outlet to control crowds and a token system was introduced. But the footfall was extremely poor,” he told TOI. “On the last day the outlets were closed due to the lockdown, our shop sold liquor worth Rs 12 lakh. But today, our revenue was just Rs 1 lakh till the lunch break.” Tasmac officials expect more business during the evening hours and hope to witness normal sales in a week. Arulmigu Koniamman Temple witnessed only 40% of the normal footfall, said a Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) department official. “We have installed an automatic thermal scanner and hand sanitizers at the entrance of the temple. While devotees are not allowed to sit inside the temple, we continue to do annadhanam by distributing packets of variety rice.” Prozone Mall witnessed only one-third of footfall on the first day, said marketing manager Justin. “We saw a similar trend during the previous lockdown as well and are confident that the footfall would increase in the coming days. Only 80 of the more than 100 shops in the mall are open as of now,” he said. “If everything goes right, we would be in a better position within a couple of months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lukewarm-response-to-lockdown-relaxation/articleshow/84157167.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Since only online teaching is allowed at present, teachers have to put in extra efforts because in rural areas its not so easy.” Kharde said teachers had earlier been put on Covid-19 survey duty. “Teachers went door-to-door to follow up on quarantined patients. I myself was part of this survey and due to it contracted the virus. Fortunately, I did not require hospitalization, but there are many teachers in Maharashtra who lost their lives,” he said. The association claimed teachers are currently engaged in Covid-19 surveys, evaluation of board marks, online teaching and poll duty. “Teachers have been given all these tasks and if at all they fail to accomplish any one of it, then who will be responsible. There are many teachers who are depressed because of the stress which authorities have put on them,” he said. He also said there is unanimity among the association members that physical reopening of schools must happen in rural areas because online teaching is not possible there. “Our teachers want to go back to the classrooms, rather be called for various odd-errands by the authorities. In villages, online teaching as an experiment is a complete failure,” said Kharde. Milind Wankhede, senior leader of the association, today met Nagpur divisional commissioner Prajakta Varma with their demands. “School reopening was the main issue, but of course there are other major concerns related to our teachers that need immediate attention. I hope the government will consider all of these on priority and find a resolution soon,” said Wankhede.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-poll-duty-for-teachers-demands-association/articleshow/84152986.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Whistle-blower complainant Raju Shah raised objections to his admission to a private hospital and lodged a complaint with the home department, alleging that special treatment was given to GHeware and he could have been admitted to the government-run JJ Hospital. Shah alleged that the ULC scam should be handed over to the CBI. “I have filed a complaint with the home department that despite a clear-cut case, the SIT is not arresting those policemen, including Param Bir Singh, who took huge money and allowed the accused builders go free,” Shah said. Gheware was suspended from services after his arrest. The SIT probing the case is likely to make more arrests in coming days as the the three arrested accused, including Gheware, have given information about the absconding accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-gheware-sent-to-pvt-hospital-for-chest-pain/articleshow/84159574.cms||Ahmed Ali

The Congress alleged government’s patronage to the accused and demanded a CBI inquiry into the case. Taking a dig at Congress leader Kamal Nath who visited Nemawar and demanded a CBI inquiry into the case, home minister Narottam Mishra alleged that this reflects Congress' vulture politics. "Hovering at the sight of a dead body, this is Congress culture. Congress leaders should have visited hospitals and served living people in distress during the Corona pandemic. But they cannot do so as their politics is limited to politicizing the deaths," alleged Mishra. Five members of a family were strangulated and their bodies dumped in a 10-foot-deep pit that was dug in advance in Nemawar last month. The accused, Surendra Chauhan, allegedly had an affair with one of the victims, 21-year-old Rupali. The skeletons of the five victims who had been missing since May 13 were exhumed from an agricultural field in Nemawar, in Dewas district on June 30. Former chief minister, Kamal Nath, who visited the place and met the victims' family on Monday, hit out at the BJP government alleging that criminal elements dominate the state. Nath also said that no action was taken against the accused and the government was trying to suppress the matter. Reacting to Nath's statement, BJP state chief Vishnu Dutt Sharma said that Congress playing politics on the incident is condemnable. He also said that Congress allegations against the government were baseless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-cong-spar-over-nemawar-massacre/articleshow/84153023.cms||---

According to highly placed DRI sources, Prabjit Singh was produced before the Panvel Court on Monday and remanded in DRI custody till July 12. Prabhjit, proprietor of the firm which had imported a consignment from Afghanistan, was summoned to record a statement by DRI Amritsar regional unit on the morning of July 1. He was arrested under the NDPS Act on July 2. DRI officials had obtained Prabhjit’s transit remand from the court. He was sent to Mumbai, where a total of 293.81 kg heroin was recovered from six gunny bags, the value of which is believed to be around Rs 2,000 crore in the international illicit market. Sources said that the two associates of Prabhjit were apprehended by DRI Indore zonal unit officers from Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh and their statements were recorded. “Both have been arrested and were being brought to Mumbai on transit remand,” said sources. Narcotics were recovered following examination of two containers imported by Prabhjit’s firm from Afghanistan with a declared cargo of semi-processed talc stones which had arrived in Mumbai via Chat Bahar port, Iran. Sources said that each container was found to contain around 350 gunny bags. In six gunny bags (3 in each container), a creamish white substance of slightly rough texture was found, which was visibly different from the declared cargo of semi-processed talc stones found in the other gunny bags, which were pure white and of fine texture. “These six gunny bags of similar weight and having slightly different marks and sieve pattern were found intelligently concealed at different locations inside the containers,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/prime-suspect-in-rs-2k-cr-drug-racket-in-dri-custody/articleshow/84157248.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Chandigarh||Cong endorsing our model: AAP||Chandigarh: AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann on Monday said Congress leaders were now endorsing Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s idea of giving 300 units of free power to people of Punjab. He also claimed that if power purchase agreements (PPAs) were not cancelled, Punjab would have to pay Rs 2.25 lakh crore to private power companies. Mann said Congress leaders were now saying that the plan to make 300 units of power free was possible. The MP said during the 2022 elections, the AAP would come up with an effective road map for the people of Punjab. “It is possible to scrap these pacts and an audit these companies should also be done. AAP has given a guarantee to Punjab on PPAs,” he added. “The previous SAD-BJP regime had entered into ‘deadly’ power agreements with the private power companies and now the Congress government has implemented the faulty pacts. Due to this, Rs 20,000 crore has been given to the private power companies from the exchequer without purchasing power. Still the people of Punjab have to buy the most expensive power in the country,” he added. “Now, Amarinder is saying that these power deals are being reviewed and there was no need for 122 out of 147 power pacts. When it was a part of the Congress manifesto, why was it not acted upon in past four years,” he asked. The private power companies had spent about Rs 25,000 crore for setting up a power thermal plant and recovered double the cost, he claimed. Mann said the Election Commission should register election manifestos issued by political parties and also issue notices to the party forming the government against non-fulfilment of the election promises. “I had raised the issue in Parliament and a mechanism should be developed. The manifesto should be a legal document,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-endorsing-our-model-aap/articleshow/84157206.cms||---

Party chairman Jose K Mani kept mum on the issue and it was party general secretary Stephen George who came out with a statement. George said the party conveyed its strong protest in the baseless references made about KM Mani, former chairman of the party, in the Supreme Court. He also asked the government to seek an immediate explanation from the lawyer for making such irresponsible references about Mani who was not found guilty by the high court and on two occasions by the vigilance court. He also asked the government to take immediate action to withdraw the reference. Meanwhile, senior Congress leader K C Joseph asked Jose K Mani to clarify his stand on whether the government lawyer told the court that the protest in the assembly was against the ‘corrupt’ finance minister KM Mani. If the lawyer has really said so then it is an insult to late Mani by the LDF government, of which KC(M) is a constituent, he said. Reacting to the media at Thodupuzha on Monday, KC(M) Joseph group leader P J Joseph said that Jose K Mani should answer the Kerala government affidavit against late Mani. “The government’s stand is deceptive. The statement by the public prosecutor about KM Mani was not correct. The assembly ruckus can’t be justified. The UDF stand is that Mani was not corrupt. My stand is the same,” said Joseph.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kcm-protests-reference-to-km-mani-in-supreme-court/articleshow/84154979.cms||---

In the last 13 days, at least 132 minors, mostly from Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, were rescued while they were being taken for being engaged as labourers. The police also managed to arrest 34 child traffickers. In Moradabad alone, 38 children were rescued from Amritsar-bound Karmabhoomi Express while 34 were recovered from three different trains at Aligarh junction. Similarly, 33 were rescued from Saket Express in Prayagraj and 15 from Lucknow, including 12 from a private hired bus. Teams of RPF and GRP also recovered eight minors from Gorakhpur and four from Firozabad following a tip-off by the activists of Bachpan Bachaao Aandolan (BBA). State coordinator for BBA, Surya Pratap Mishra, said: “After easing of Covid restrictions, demand for labour has risen in Delhi and Punjab. Child traffickers are making every attempt to cash in on this opportunity.” “The accused lure the parents by claiming that their children would be provided education and job. Before boarding train or bus, children are asked to share incorrect information if caught by the police. Children receive minimum wages and get trapped in the never-ending cycle of exploitation,” he said. Activists claim that the minors are paid up to Rs 3,500 per month and are forced to work 16 hours a day in factories. Coordinator of ChildLine in Lucknow, Krishan Pratap Sharma, said: “Traffickers have changed their modus operandi. Though they work in groups of 4-5 members, one trafficker associates himself with two-three children posing as their close relative.”  “We have found that minors are taken from backward areas of Bihar, UP, Jharkhand and West Bengal,” said Zafar Alam, a CWC member from Firozabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/child-trafficking-for-labour-goes-up-as-covid-19-restrictions-end/articleshow/84157278.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Jilted, teen used exam as cover for revenge||AHMEDABAD: Misdirection was the name of the game that the perpetrator who sent threatening emails to Anand Niketan school was playing. He sent one email after another asking the school to put off exams and online classes, driving the school and the cops to investigate that angle. However, he revealed his hand when he posted morphed photographs of two female students online. The move made the cops realize his real motive was to defame the two girls, and this helped them to whittle down their list of suspects to just one: a 17-year-old student of Class 12. After months of futile efforts to trace the culprit who first sent an email in September threatening to post morphed pictures of students online if the school did not defer mid-term and preliminary exams, the police reached an impasse. The perpetrator had used the dark web to commit the crime and the case had turned into one of the most complicated cybercrime case that the Ahmedabad police had faced till date. This, even though they had roped in central and US investigative agencies. A senior officer said, “In the first 6 couple of emails, the anonymous sender asked the school to cancel the exams. His real idea was to defame the girls but he played this game to make sure that the the probe was focused on another track.” his Revealing why he targeted these girls, with the officer said, “We got our list of suspects when we checked the phones of 120 students and found that some had looked up information about the dark web. When the photographs of only two Class 12 female students were made viral, we got suspicious. We found that one of the victims had been in touch with one of the guys on our list. He was not only good at navigating the dark web but had also elicited an interest in one of the girls. We found that the girl had rejected him and he believed that her friend was responsible for her decision. So, he decided to take his revenge on the two in this manner.” Web searches gave cops clue needed to crack caseWhile this had been a tough case to crack, no crime is perfect. The cops, who got help from central agencies, finally found a lead in the web searches on one of the gadgets they had collected from the students. Last year, before using the dark web to send the threatening emails, the teenager used regular web services to gather information about the dark web. This drew the attention of the cops. Also, the cops wondered why the perpetrator targeted only two girls and began probing in that direction. “We found that the boy had professed his love for one of the girls but was rejected. Believing the other girl was responsible for the rejection, he decided on this route to get ‘revenge’ on the two,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jilted-teen-used-exam-as-cover-for-revenge/articleshow/84157272.cms||---

AIPEF spokesperson V K Gupta claimed the Union power ministry circulated the draft bill on February 5 only to the state secretaries of energy for comments to be sent within two weeks. “This procedure is anomalous and defective as the important stakeholders comprising power sector engineers and employees, electricity consumers have been excluded,” he said. Further, even before the time completion of two weeks, videoconferences were proposed to be held on February 17 to give views. The virtual discussions were also held with regulators. “The whole exercise to rush through the bill is thus non-transparent, undemocratic, and discriminatory,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dont-rush-electricity-amendment-bill-aipef/articleshow/84165175.cms||---

RM Ramanujam, NNTR field director and conservator of forests, said, “The leopard was recorded in camera traps during Phase IV estimation in the NNTR in February. The fact came to light during analysis by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun.” Ramanujam added, “The melanistic leopard is moving between interconnected Navegaon National Park and Navegaon Wildlife Sanctuary. It was found even last year but the matter was not publicized. The picture of the big cat went viral after WII scientist Bilal Habib shared it on Twitter.” Earlier, on May 30, 2018, a melanistic leopard was first recorded by a Belgian diplomat Jean-Francois Aernouts and his family in the Kolsa range of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). However, the spotting of the leopard was dubbed as a black leopard. Later, the leopard was sighted in Tadoba range leading to speculation that there were two such leopards in Tadoba. “It is something unique as black panthers are melanistic and are generally found in evergreen forests like the Western Ghats and Dandeli-Anshi in Karnataka, but its record in Tadoba and NNTR, which is a dry deciduous forest, needs attention,” said Habib.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/black-leopard-recorded-in-navegaon-forest/articleshow/84153047.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The boy also had malignant hyperthermia, a rare condition that makes a person susceptible to severe reaction to certain drugs used for anaesthesia during surgery. “A previous attempt of corrective surgery in another hospital in 2015 had to be abandoned as the patient’s temperature soared to 108 degrees Fahrenheit. He was barely saved after a 13-day long intensive care. According to the Indian Spinal Injuries Centres (ISIC), where the corrective surgery was performed recently by a team of doctors, a drug called Dantrolene was imported from Germany to manage any potential drug reaction during surgery. Also, while the medicine was awaited, doctors said they put the boy on halo gravity traction (a technique to pull the head and spine upward by stretching the spine slowly) for three weeks that improved the curve to 100 degree from 140 degree. “This also helped to address the iliocostal impingement, a painful disabling condition in which ribs start to touch the iliac crest (hip bone). The remaining curve and misalignment of the hip were corrected with spinal fusion from vertebrae D2 to pelvis during a six-hour-long surgery,” Dr Rajat Singhal, spine surgeon at ISIC, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/docs-operate-upon-boy-with-rare-spine-deformity/articleshow/84155023.cms||---

AIPEF spokesperson V K Gupta claimed the Union power ministry circulated the draft bill on February 5 only to the state secretaries of energy for comments to be sent within two weeks. “This procedure is anomalous and defective as the important stakeholders comprising power sector engineers and employees, electricity consumers have been excluded,” he said. Further, even before the time completion of two weeks, videoconferences were proposed to be held on February 17 to give views. The virtual discussions were also held with regulators. “The whole exercise to rush through the bill is thus non-transparent, undemocratic, and discriminatory,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dont-rush-electricity-amendment-bill-aipef/articleshow/84157307.cms||---

The division bench of chief justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice V K Shukla had sought a response from the state government while hearing a PIL challenging the legality of the strike. The petitioner, PG Najpande of MP Nagrik Upbhokta Manch, in his petition said that he had filed a PIL in the year 2016 when nurses had threatened to go on strike seeking court's intervention so that the medical services in the state were not disrupted, but the strike was called off and he had withdrawn the petition with an assurance from the court that he could again move the court, if the nurses proceeded on strike in future. He said that the MP Nursing Association had called for a state-wide strike of nurses from June 30, which has adversely affected medical services in the state. In this context, state government submitted a reply in the court on Monday. The court has placed the petition for next hearing on July 7. Advocate, Dinesh Upadhyay, appeared in the case on behalf of the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/talks-get-striking-nurses-back-on-duty-govt-to-hc/articleshow/84153060.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nurses protest as NMC ends contracts, offers work on daily wages||NAGPUR: Over 400 contract nurses or paramedical staff recruited by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for Covid-19 duties staged a silent protest on Monday after their contract was terminated. The civic body has now asked them to work on daily wage basis, where they will be paid Rs500 per day, only when they are called for vaccination duties. “With current vaccine crisis, if there is no vaccine drive, we will not get any wage,” said paramedical staff Ritu Meshram (name changed). A delegation of paramedical staff met mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar over the issue. They claimed that most of them joined NMC during the first wave of Covid-19. At first, they worked in Covid Care Centres and later NMC deployed them at vaccination centres. “Most of us left private hospital jobs and joined the civic body. From day one, we were told by NMC that we were hired on contract basis for a monthly honorarium of Rs25,000 and had even signed bonds,” said the para-medical staff. “Now, NMC wants us to work for Rs500 daily wage basis and that too only when they require our service for administering vaccines,” agitated nurses told TOI. TOI also saw letters issued by NMC’s chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar, who asked heads of all concerned health centres to relieve all contractual staff with immediate effect. In his letter, Dr Chilkar pointed out that as cases of Covid-19 have declined, so all contractual staff may be relieved from their jobs. Dr Chilkar has also written similar letters to deans of GMCH, IGGMC and AIIMS Nagpur, to relieve contractual paramedical staff appointed by NMC in their hospitals. He, however, asked GMCH and AIIMS to continue the services of lab technicians. An agitated paramedical staff member Pratim Kotnake (name changed) said most of the paramedical staff had left their jobs in private hospitals to work for NMC. “Since we joined NMC, we worked vigorously along with the administration in the entire pandemic period of both first and second waves,” he said. “Our workload increased at vaccination centres. Official timing of the job was from 10am to 5pm. But we were always asked to report before 9am and wind up our daily work not before 8pm,” said agitated members. With shortage of vaccines, NMC does not have any work for them and so the decision has been taken to terminate their contracts, said an official from the health department. “With most of us from other cities and towns, we have committed expenditures like room rent, school fees etc,” said nurses, and added that if NMC did not continue their service, they would not work at vaccination centres. The mayor assured to resolve their issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nurses-protest-as-nmc-ends-contracts-offers-work-on-daily-wages/articleshow/84153069.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Dehradun||Public works department mulling to change alignment of road construction threatening Jincy springs in Mussoorie||MUSSOORIE: A day after TOI raised the issue of Jincy springs—one of the largest water sources of Mussoorie —being threatened due to the construction of a new road on the Thatyur-Kempty route, the administration has decided to temporarily halt the project and work out a way to change the alignment of the road without damaging the springs. Assistant engineer of the Public Works Department (PWD), Sanjay Nawani said a joint inspection with Jal Sansthan officials would be conducted on Friday to identify the possibilities. “We will conduct a survey and explore the possibilities for altering the alignment of the road so that it passes below the springs, thereby preventing damage to Jincy springs,” Nawani said. A team led by tehsildar of Dhanaulti along with officials of PWD and the water department also reached the site on Monday to assess the situation. A number of villagers from Jincy village reached the spot, too, and expressed concern over the construction of the road which, they claim, has already led to the damage to one of the springs feeding the village. Taking note of the TOI report, Garhwal commissioner Ravinath Raman said district magistrate Iva Srivastava has been directed to look into the matter. “It was verified that the road construction may damage the water source. I have directed the officials to change the alignment of the road and take all possible steps to ensure that the water source is protected,” he said. Meanwhile, residents of Mussoorie have welcomed the administration’s decision. “Jincy is the main source of water for Mussoorie, and no development work should be done at the cost of damaging the water source. We are glad that the administration is looking into this matter,” said Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand Hotel Association. Notably, there are seven springs which are collectively referred to as Jincy springs. These springs have a discharge of close to 2.5 million litres of water per day, accounting for nearly 25% of the water being supplied to the town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pwd-mulling-to-change-alignment-of-road-construction-threatening-jincy-springs-in-mussoorie/articleshow/84151258.cms||Anmol Jain

The charitable clinic at Madrassa Abu Talib in heavily populated Kashmiri Mohalla will be inaugurated by its patron, Maulana Saif Abbas, on Tuesday. The facility will start functioning from Wednesday morning. Doctors, nurses and paramedic staff will be stationed at the madrassa-clinic which will equipped with Covid diagnosis kit, oximeters and other equipment required for early detection of coronavirus infection. In the second phase, Abu Talib Charitable Clinic will also have isolation beds and the unit will work as a primary isolation facility. “The idea came from the experience during the second wave of coronavirus pandemic that hit the city hard in April-May. People, especially from the minority community, are afraid of going to hospitals and ignore symptoms initially. By the time they are taken to the hospital, the disease reaches severe stage,” Maulana Saif Abbas said. “These people will visit the clinic in their vicinity without any hesitation and get themselves checked for Covid if they experience any symptom,” he added. The academic activities will, however, continue without any hindrance. While students will study on the first floor of the building, the clinic will cater to patients on the ground floor. “Experience of the shortage of beds and other resources during the second wave of pandemic was the driving force behind the clinic. We decided to use the madrassa space as an isolation facility and started work in that direction. Fortunately, the wave subsided by the time we could get things together. For now, it will start as a Covid care clinic and turn into an isolation facility, if required,” Maulana Saif Abbas added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/madrassa-to-double-up-as-free-covid-care-clinic/articleshow/84157322.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Delhi||Delhi: Demolition drive on Yamuna floodplain leaves many homeless, they claim no notice given||NEW DELHI: Punnya Khatun (45) has lived along the Yamuna floodplain opposite Lalita Park in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar for over seven years now. However, in the past 24 hours she has lost the roof over her head. Khatun has two children to take care of and her husband, who pulls a rickshaw has meagre earnings, one that will not be sufficient for them to find a home immediately. Like Khatun, hundreds of dwellers near Lalita Park and Ramesh Park have been evicted since Thursday, with Delhi Development Authority (DDA) carrying out an encroachment removal drive in the floodplains. Locals, however, allege they were neither provided any notices in advance, nor have been provided rehabilitation. “There was no warning whatsoever and no one came to inform us. They just showed up with earthmovers and people had to collect their belongings and flee,” says Khatun, stating while she has a PAN card, a voters ID card and has voted for different parties in the past few elections, neither has been able to help them in this regard. “The only option we have left now is to sell our goats, which will give us some money. We may have to go back to our village,” she rues. Locals reached out to NGO Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN), which says a petition will be filed in Delhi High Court, questioning the eviction without a notice. “This has been done during a pandemic, which is a violation of fundamental rights. People have not been provided rehabilitation elsewhere. These are all rickshaw pullers and people from the lower strata. How will they manage at a time like this?” said Dev Pal, a field researcher with the NGO. When TOI visited the area on Monday, hundreds of jhuggis lay flattened, with some people still living out in the open. Dashrath, a 72-year-old mason, who has been living in the area for over two decades, said he does not know where he will go. “My son is a rickshaw puller and while I worked as a mason earlier, I am too old to work now. Where will we go all of a sudden?” he added. Locals suspect a scrapping yard nearby could also be one of the reasons for the demolition drive. “A lot of kabaddiwalas would come here and sort items. If they are the reason, why did DDA not target them, but us?” Dashrath claimed. Despite repeated attempts, DDA didn't respond to queries sent by TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/demolition-drive-on-floodplain-leaves-many-homeless-they-claim-no-notice-given/articleshow/84155112.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra records 51 deaths, lowest since March 15||MUMBAI: For the first time since the peak of the second Covid wave in April, Maharashtra registered 51 deaths on Monday, the lowest single-day toll since March 15 (48). In the city too, daily Covid deaths, which had emerged as a cause for concern last week with 118 deaths recorded in five days, registered a drop to 10. In Mumbai, daily cases (486) on Monday dropped below 500 for the first time since February 15. In tune with the weekend trend, the state recorded below 7,000 cases on Monday (6,740), similar to last Monday (6,727). State government officials said the dip in cases was due to reduced testing over the weekend. The state conducted 1.7 lakh tests on Sunday, as against the average 2.4 lakh tests during weekdays. With this, the total cases in the state touched 61 lakh and the deaths rose to 1,23,136 with the addition of 55 previous deaths. Mumbai’s case tally touched 7.3 lakh with 15,554 deaths. “The daily caseload in the city is likely to fall further. We are getting near-zero daily test positivity rate with rapid antigen tests. All our positive cases are coming from RT-PCR tests,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Talking about deaths, he said: “We are auditing last week’s spike in deaths and the report should be ready in a couple of days, but the initial causes seem to be late reporting and late referral from private hospitals to government centres… If a private hospital is found to be at fault, we will drop it from Covid service.” Health minister Rajesh Tope said with cases coming down, there is low enthusiasm for getting vaccinated. “The severity of the third wave can be reduced if a large number of people are vaccinated. Districts which are low on the vaccination targets will be given more doses to ensure that they bring people to the centres,” said Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-records-51-deaths-lowest-since-march-15/articleshow/84157411.cms||---

No casualty was reported due to the derailment. The train left Howrah at 8.35am. The front wheels of the SLR coach moved outside the tracks. Railway officials rushed to the spot and the train departed for Radhikapur around 1.05pm . There was disruption on the Howrah main line for almost one-and-a-half hours. Railway officials have ordered a probe into the reason behind the derailment. They suspect a point failure might have caused the derailment. The process of lifting the derailed compartment took several hours. Since it was a special train, there were not too many passengers. Mohammad Azim, a passenger, said, “We were informed about the incident by GRP and RPF personnel who took care of us.” During the monsoon point failure becomes a cause for concern for the railway authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/train-derails-near-burdwan-station/articleshow/84155070.cms||Mohammad Asif

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Vaccine safe, but comorbids need to consult doctor before jab||NAGPUR: Reiterating that Covid vaccines are safe, city doctors have advised citizens with heart ailments, chronic diabetes, taking anticoagulation therapy or simply suffering from fever that they must consult a physician or cardiologist before planning the jab. Patients who have recovered from severe Covid infection also need to take the opinion of their doctor before the vaccination, they add. Following death of a 58-year-old man from the city two hours after he took the second dose of Covishield, TOI spoke to experts on how those suffering from any illnesses must plan their vaccination and whether a death occurring after the second dose can be called adverse event following immunization (AEFI). Doctors said anaphylaxis reaction (severe allergic reaction) is rare and chances of it happening are one in million. But the absolute contraindications and relative contraindications need to evaluated before the vaccination, the experts opined. Senior pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said conditions like heart problems, coagulation, allergies, asthma or even fever can precipitate the virus. “Those having heart problems or under anticoagulation therapy must see their doctor before taking the vaccine. Having any acute condition must be informed to the vaccinators too. Even those who had severe Covid infection must consult the doctor before vaccination,” he said. Dr Arbat said the vaccine has been developed in shortest time, yet it is safe. “We have no option but to get vaccinated to protect ourselves from the virus. We need to be careful,” he said. Critical care intensivist Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said there are two aspects of side-effects. “Absolute contraindication is allergy to vaccine or its component. Relative contraindication includes ongoing fever, uncontrolled diabetes, known case of coagulopathy which is high risk of blood clotting. Hence, before taking the vaccine, such patients must see a physician or cardiologist,” he said. Dr Mohammad added that evaluation of safety, risk and benefit is also a must. “If benefit is higher, then you have to take call as per doctor’s advise. Vaccine is safe. Anaphylaxis reaction is rare and may happen immediately after taking the jab. This side-effect is common with all vaccines. Usually, AEFI doesn’t happen unless a patient has an underlying condition,” he said. Orange City Hospital & Research Institute (OCHRI) director Dr Anup Marar said there is minimal contraindication for Covid vaccination including history of bleeding and coagulation disorder, hypersensitivity to active substance or to any of the excipients in the vaccine. “People with clinically stable comorbid conditions can surely receive the jab. However, acutely unwell persons should defer taking the vaccine to safeguard themselves. One of the specified vaccination side-effects, even though rare, is major blood clotting in combination with low platelet count. Hence, any patient with acute ischemia (reduction in blood flow resulting in decreased oxygen and nutrient supplies to a tissue in brain, heart or limbs) should prioritize their health needs and first get themselves treated by qualified specialist before taking the vaccine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccine-safe-but-comorbids-need-to-consult-doc-before-jab/articleshow/84153123.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Many committees have been formed by the villagers for the purpose which will keep an eye around the village. It was also decided in the meeting that if any flying team comes to the village, it will be taken hostage, but if the local electricity employees or SDOs come to the village for some work, they will be allowed to come. About five days ago, the flying team of the electricity department had raided the fields of Samain village. When the villagers came to know about this, anger spread among them and they held a meeting in the village. The people present in the meeting said drinking water is taken by installing a small electric motor on the tubewells installed in the fields, which the team of the electricity department says is illegal and heavy fines are imposed on it. Five days ago, some farmers of the village were fined. They said these days, the canals are closed and there is no rain, due to which the crops are drying up, due to which the farmers are upset. Farmers took tubewell connections by paying a lot of money and now the team of the department is harassing the farmers, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khap-wont-let-flying-squads-enter-village/articleshow/84157360.cms||---

Interrogation revealed that Hossain had not leapt out of the bus moments before the accident or even after but he had mingled with passengers to avoid drawing people’s attention. Usually, there are always a few pedestrians in the area, where the accident took place, and anyone fleeing the spot can easily be spotted. While slipping away, Hossain had switched off his mobile and then gone to his elder sister’s house in Kamarhati. Hossain also admitted that he had not applied brakes but claimed to have fallen ill just before the accident. Forensics experts said that it was the driver’s fault rather than any mechanical failure that led to the accident. The driver had submitted his licence for renewal in June and was using a temporary acknowledgement slip issued to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/red-road-accident-bus-driver-hid-among-injured/articleshow/84155114.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Kabir Suman accuses percussionist Subhadrakalyan Rana of plagiarizing his 'Ahir Bairagi'||KOLKATA: Kabir Suman levelled plagiarism charges against a 20-something musician on Sunday from his hospital bed. Suman alleged Subhadrakalyan Rana had copied ‘Ahir Bairagi’, a raga that he had composed some years ago. But Rana pleaded innocence, claiming his raga was called ‘Dhaivati’, which was not a copy of Suman’s creation. According to Suman, after he had posted on Facebook about this raga, Rana had contacted him and expressed his desire to play it. “He learnt it and played in ‘tabla taranga’. Thereafter, he started to market this as his own creation. He also got a few others to attack the Bangla Khayal genre on Facebook. Now, I am recovering at SSKM Hospital because of the efforts of the Bengal government’s health workers,” he wrote. Suman promised to get back to pursuing Bangla kheyal as soon as he recovered and hoped Rana would pursue music and not engage in peddling falsehood and jealousy. The veteran musician also posted a screenshot of his earlier interaction with Rana, when the latter had sought his permission to play this raag. But Rana told TOI on Monday that he had never claimed ‘Ahir-Bairagi’ to be his creation. He alleged that Suman had been “unilaterally defaming” him and “causing public harassment” by claiming he had “stolen” his raga. Rana, who started taking lessons from Pt Shankar Ghosh, shared his recitals, called ‘tabla tarang’, being played on10 to16 ‘dayan’ drums, on social media. “In December 2020, I posted on Facebook my rendition of ‘Ahir-Bairagi’ with due respect and credit to him. I mentioned this recital was done with Kabir Suman’s consent. I removed that post following his public attack against me when I requested him to sing a song during a Facebook live,” he said. In February, Rana claimed to have posted his “experiment” as Raag Dhaivati. “I started formulating it in 2016. It is not a copy of Ahir-Bairagi. A major difference was I applied Dha or Dhaivat to the ascending and descending scales of Bairagi, while his Ahir-Bairagi has ‘Dha’ in avarohi only. I have no information that Kabir Suman holds a patent to add ‘Dha’ in any form to the scale of Bairagi,” Rana said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-accuses-percussionist-of-plagiarizing-his-ahir-bairagi/articleshow/84155173.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Lucknow||Superannuation of 17 academic doyens leaves void in Lucknow University classrooms||LUCKNOW: The retirement of 17 doyens of their respective fields has left a vacuum in Lucknow University, which will be hard to replace, according to teachers. One of the teachers to superannuate is Prof UN Dwivedi, an internationally acclaimed scientist, who is credited with the development of LU’s biochemistry department. An alumnus of Michigan Technological University and North Dakota State University, he authored over 120 research papers in his 40-year career. “Enzymology is a tough branch. I cannot teach the way Sir (Prof Dwivedi) did. He established a bioinformatics and tissue culture lab and biotechnology subject in 2002,” said HoD, biochemistry, Prof Sudhir Mehrotra, who has been a student of Prof Dwivedi. Teachers and students in the ancient history and archaeology department will miss Prof DP Tiwari, an archaeologist par excellence, who changed the perception of excavation of ancient sites with his work on Kampilya, associated with Mahabharata queen Draupadi. He has also worked on many excavations with the Archaeological Survey of India and Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, including at ‘Kalli Pachchim’ in Lucknow. He also founded LU’s archaeology museum. Similarly, Prof SK Jaiswal from the same department is known for his expertise in ancient Indian polity, administration and social, economic and religious life, besides the history of south India. The psychology department will yearn for Prof PC Mishra and Prof Pallavi Bhatnagar. “It’s difficult to find a teacher like Prof Mishra, who was a master of all branches,” said dean, academics, Prof Rakesh Chandra. “The same is true for Prof Bhatnagar who has over 60 research papers and nine books to her credit,” he added. She was trained in mindfulness by Marsha M Linehan, a renowned American psychologist and creator of dialectical behaviour therapy. LU’s botany department, known for bryology—the study of mosses and liverworts—had a strong group of bryologists like late Prof Dinesh Kumar and (retd) Prof SC Srivastava. Now, the last trained bryologist Prof Geeta Asthana has also retired. “A handful of Indian universities teach bryology. Prof Asthana lived bryology through her work,” said HoD Prof Vivek Prasad. The superannuation of Prof Kirti Sinha, an expert in X-ray and spectroscopy, has left the physics department worried. “It is hard to find experts in this domain,” said HoD Prof Poonam Tandon. The retirement of Persian department’s Prof Arif Ayyubi has taken away the only expert of Iranian and central Asian studies LU had. Retirement of Prof PS Tiwari, Prof Kalicharan Snehi and TP Rahi will be a loss to the Hindi department. “Prof Tiwari is among a handful experts of Pali, Riti-Kaal, Tulsidas and Kabir in India. Prof Snehi popularised Hindi internationally and, along with Prof Rahi, was the backbone of ‘Dalit Vimarsh’,” said HoD Prof YP Tiwari. CBI sleuth-turned-teacher Prof DNNS Yadav has a huge following. “His areas of research were social and economic justice. He will be missed,” said dean, law, Prof CP Singh. HoD, chemistry, Prof Arun Sethi said: “Prof Naveen Khare’s retirement has weakened our carbohydrate experts team.” Geology students will miss Prof KK Agarwal, an expert of structural and Himalayan Geology. The retirements of Prof Ram Sumer Yadav and Prof Aruna Shukla, experts of Sanskrit and Buddhist literature have created a crisis in the Sanskrit department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/superannuation-of-17-academic-doyens-leaves-void-in-lu-classrooms/articleshow/84157400.cms||Mohita Tewari

---||Chandigarh||Punjab cops bust drugs supply chain, nab 4 Afghans in Delhi||Chandigarh: Punjab Police on Sunday busted a drug supply chain with the arrest of four Afghan nationals and 17 kg heroin seizure worth about Rs 90 crore on the international market, from south Delhi. Punjab Police chief DGP Dinkar Gupta said that with this seizure, the force had dug up another trail leading to Uttar Pradesh and a team had been sent there. The accused have been identified as Mujahed Shinwari of Nangarhar in Afghanistan, other three — Mohammad Lal Kaker, Jannat Gul Kakar and Samiullah Afghan — are from Kunduz region of Afghanistan. The police have also recovered assorted chemicals and lab equipment used to prepare the drug from the Neb Sarai unit in south Delhi. The arrests and seizure resulted from a lead uncovered by a Hoshiarpur police team led-by SSP Navjot Singh Mahal as they were investigating certain earlier FIRs registered under the NDPS Act. FIR in the case has already been registered on July 1 under the NDPS Act at Garhshankar police station in Hoshiarpur with the arrest of an accused who gave the information to the police. DGP Gupta said the Hoshiarpur police, on May 18, had recovered 70 gram heroin after arresting Pushpinder Singh and Amit Choudhary, who revealed that they had procured the drug from Jasvir Singh Gajju of Jandiala in Amritsar and Sarabjeet Singh Sethi of Hoshiarpur. Raids were conducted at Jasvir’s residence, where his accomplice Jagrup Kaur was arrested with 100g heroin. A search of the house led the police party to the recovery of 1.48 kg heroin, 500 grams gold and Rs 49.48 lakh drug money. The police later arrested Sethi from Garhshankar on July 1 and 500g heroin was recovered from his possession. He revealed that he had procured the heroin from Afghan nationals, who run a heroin manufacturing factory in Delhi, and Imteyaz who operates from Uttar Pradesh. Acting on leads, a police team from Hoshiarpur raided the suspected location in Delhi and busted this manufacturing unit. Another team has been sent to Uttar Pradesh to bust Imteyaz’s module, said the police chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cops-bust-drugs-supply-chain-nab-4-afghans-in-delhi/articleshow/84157428.cms||---

The KMC on Saturday and Monday took their vaccination bus to Mahatma Gandhi Road near Grace Cinema Hall, where streetside book traders, publishers, book store employees and others associated with the trade queued up for their shot. They were administered Covaxin. On June 17, the Presidency Alumni Association wrote to the KMC, advocating for small-time book traders, who made significant contributions to the Boipara business, selling books at a very low rate and sometimes, renting them out. “The street-side book traders, who are an integral part of the Presidency ecosystem, were not included in the vaccination priority section. Most faced difficulty in getting vaccine. When we wrote to the KMC, the officials agreed and asked for their details. We submitted a list to KMC, which arranged for a mobile vaccination camp,” said Bivas Chaudhuri, vice-president, Presidency Alumni Association. “Almost everyone linked to the trade, who did not get the vaccine, have got it now,” said Pratap Das, secretary of Sir Ashutosh Booksellers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-presi-alumni-plea-900-boipara-traders-get-jabs/articleshow/84155261.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Governor has constituted a three-member probe committee headed by retired Allahabad high court judge Ranjana Pandey, while the VC Prof Ashok Kumar Mittal has been relieved of his duties with immediate effect till the completion of the inquiry. Lucknow University vice-chancellor Prof AK Rai has been given the additional charge of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University. The other members of the probe committee are Prof VK Pathak, vice-chancellor of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University, Kanpur, and Prof Surendra Dubey, VC of Sidharth University, Kapilvastu. The committee will submit its report within a month. In a communique, MK Gupta, additional chief secretary to the governor, stated that Prof Mittal has been accused of indiscipline, financial and administrative anomalies. During the review meetings by the governor from May 31 to June 2, Prof Mittal was found unprepared on the reference points raised by the Chancellor. The replies given by him during the review meetings were found unsatisfactory, Gupta said. The probe will be done into the appointments done by bypassing the rules, ignoring objections raised in the audit, inadequate action on cases pending in the high court, failure to provide degrees to students’ on time, and giving unnecessary overtime honorarium to employees. All of these are indicative of VC’s lax and indifferent behaviour as the head of an institution, the note from Raj Bhawan stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/guv-relieves-agra-varsity-vc-of-duty-orders-investigation/articleshow/84157453.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Administration nonchalance + Nagpurians’ ignorance = No Smart City laurel||The results of India Smart Cities Award Contest were announced last week. Despite its selection for development as one of the 100 Smart cities in country, Nagpur hasn’t found recognition in any category. In a series starting today, TOI tries to understand where the city is lacking and how it can climb the ladder of successNAGPUR: Smart Cities are meant to leverage the benefits of technology to simplify, improve and automate routine governance processes to better the quality of life with optimization of resources. Even after half a decade of its selection to be developed as one of the 100 Smart cities in the country, Nagpur is nowhere near achieving the coveted status. The city has been witnessing a huge infrastructure revamp but has not been chosen for a single Smart City award even in categories including governance and social aspect. While many blamed it on administrative nonchalance, others said Nagpurians too must share the blame. TOI tries to find out the reasons why the city fares so poorly among the 100 Smart Cities. A senior official from Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) told TOI that the city could do well in the governance category as it has already launched the Nagpur Smart & Safe City Project - Solution Components. Under this category, the city has installed around 3600 CCTV cameras and has also set up a command and control centre. This system helps the city police to keep 24x7 vigil. But he could still not explain why the awards remain elusive for the city. About the social aspect, the officer claimed that the NSSCDCL had undertaken area-based development of 1,730 acre in east Nagpur. “This part of the city was developed in a very haphazard way. The NSSCDCL is to provide all basic amenities — proper roads, sewerage network, gardens, playground, smart schools etc,” he said. Majority of works are yet to be completed. For citizen activist Tejinder Singh Renu, Nagpur completely missing from recently declared results by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is a cause for concern as initially the city had been performing so well. Renu feels it’s an administrative failure. “Despite having all the potential, Nagpur is not able to deliver on time. Being a member of the City Level Advisory Forum of NSSCDCL, I also share a part of the responsibility. We rarely have had any meetings in the past many months,” he said. As per his knowledge, the project at Pardi, Punapur and Bharatwada in east Nagpur is not being implemented due to various reasons. “Whenever we plan development of a large area, local people are not taken into confidence about their rehabilitation,” said Renu. He further said that the civic chief should frequently review NSSCDCL work and plug the loopholes. Citizen activist Amit Heda blamed both administration and public. “The administration goes all guns blazing whenever such a contest nears or when there is criticism in the media. Unfortunately, it doesn’t monitor the work. The administration is controlled by corporators who only nurture political ambitions and seldom give priority to city’s development,” he said. Heda said even the “negligent, irresponsible and careless” Nagpurians must share the blame. “They crib about cleanliness but make no efforts to keep their vicinity clean. Remember the slogan My Nagpur, Clean Nagpur?” he said. According to citizens and professionals Neeraj Choure, Ashok Deuskar, Pratik Raut and Pratiksha Wasnik, NSSCDCL and NMC should involve citizens’ group in all such activities. “If citizen involvement is neglected, Nagpur will never be able to do well in such contests,” said Wasnik. Wasnik stresses every citizen needs to know that a Smart City cannot function effectively and efforts will be wasted if people are not disciplined and do not follow standard procedures. STATUS OF SMART CITY WORKS * CCTV cameras installed at 706 junctions * 140 wi-fi points installled * Environmental sensors to show air quality index at major squares * Works under Rs650 crore tenderSure project in Bharatwada, Pardi and Punapur going on at snail’s pace * Project Home Sweet Home to rehabilitate 1,024 families affected by other projects yet to start * Little work done for facilities such as solar power, green building, sewerage treatment plant, rainwater harvesting, smart schools, gardens, playground, roads, stormwater network||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/admin-nonchalance-nagpurians-ignorance-no-smart-city-laurel/articleshow/84153271.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The minor girl lived with her father, who is a plumber, her mother and an older brother. Police said since her family’s financial condition deteriorated, she left home last October and travelled ticketless on a train to Dadar. However, she did not find any job there so she came to Bhiwandi where she disguised herself as a boy and took on the name of Samir Shaikh. Police said she landed a job as a helper at power loom units, but when the lockdown was again imposed during the second wave, she lost her job. She started living on the streets and started begging for a living. Senior inspector Shital Raut said, “Initially, the girl told us she was from Nagpur. But when we probed further, she revealed the truth.” Raut said she was not ready to go back home or speak to her parents. “But we counselled her and arranged a video call. Following an emotional appeal by her parents, she agreed to return,” added Raut. Her parents recently came to Bhiwandi and the family was reunited at the police station.  Police said she left home last October and travelled ticketless on a train to Dadar.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Sarobar walkers’ plea for time relaxation, opening more gates||KOLKATA: Residents of south Kolkata who go for walks to Rabindra Sarobar have written to the state chief secretary, requesting for relaxation in timings and opening of additional gates. While the Lake is currently open between 6am and 9am, regular visitors have appealed to Hari Krishna Dwivedi to open the gates an hour early so that morning walkers are spread out and don’t crowd the Lake at the same time. “The Lake used to open at 5am in summer and 5.30am in winter. Early-risers reached at 5am while others walked in after 6am. But with the gates now opening at 6am, there is a rush to enter at that hour. Distancing norms go for a toss with so many people waiting for the gates to open,” pointed out Arun Kumar Dalmia who is among the signatories in the letter. A section of walkers also want the lake to be opened for a couple of hours in the evening as well for those who can’t make it in the morning. “I am unable to take a walk in the morning. Why can’t someone like me get an opportunity to take an evening stroll?” wondered local resident Manish Chakrabarty. Citizens have appealed to KMC as well to open its parks in the evening. “Why can’t parks be open in the evening when closed spaces like malls and restaurants can function for long hours?” remarked lawyer Ankit Agarwal who lives in Rawdon Street. Residents of Southern Avenue and others in the vicinity have also raised the issue about two main gates - one next to Lion’s Safari Park, and the other opposite Menoka Cinema - being kept shut. “There are many senior citizens with mobility issues who walk in the Safari Park or sit and meditate. They are finding it very difficult to access these places as the gates are shut,” said Ujjal Dugar, another regular at the lake. Officials of Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) that is in charge of the Lake’s upkeep, said lack of adequate manpower to monitor the gates meant they could not open all of them. But Soumendra Mohan Ghosh, who has been going to the lake for several decades, pointed out that checks for vaccine certificates as well as adherence to protocols like maintaining distance and wearing masks were often flouted. Whle acknowledging the difficulty in policing the Lake, KMDA staffers said it was virtually impossible to monitor everyone. “It is also upon individuals to behave responsibly,” one of the staffers deployed at the lake said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sarobar-walkers-plea-for-time-relaxation-opening-more-gates/articleshow/84155319.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata colleges start ground work for UG screening||KOLKATA: Several colleges are scheduled to conduct meetings or form committees to devise a method to screen candidates before admitting them to undergraduate courses this year. After the different boards councils—both state and national—cancelled their Class XII exams due to the pandemic, college principals have been worried about how to assess candidates’ aptitude for the subjects they will apply for as the formulae devised will consider the students’ performance in Class X boards and Class XI annual exams and the subjects concerned might be completely left out. The candidates might be able to make it to the cut-off for certain subjects owing to the newly calculated marks, without taking a test in those subjects in the past two years. The boards and councils aim to publish the Class XII results by July-end. Most principals felt the different board and councils’ formulae might not reflect the applicants’ knack for a certain subject as Class XI annual exams could not be completed last year due to the lockdown. “A meeting of the admission committee is slated for this week. We will discuss how best we can screen the applicants but we will go by the directives of Calcutta University and the state government,” said Indrila Guha, principal of Basanti Devi College. J D Birla Institute, which is accepting applications, will hold online interactions with applicants before admissions. At Jadavpur University, heads of the departments have held internal discussions before meeting the academic committee. “There is a consensus on some sort of screening before UG admissions. The method of screening will be discussed in a meeting later this week,” said an HoD at JU. Colleges, like Lady Brabourne, have already requested their heads of the departments to work out a formula to evaluate the candidates over and above the boards marks. “We need some sort of a criteria to test the candidates’ aptitude before drawing up the merit lists. We have had meetings with our admission committee. In the absence of an admission test, theHoDs will work out a formula to assess the aptitude of the candidates,” said Siuli Sarkar, Lady Brabourne principal. St Xavier’s College will start accepting applications as soon as boards results are published. City College in north Kolkata held a meeting on Monday to form an admission committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-start-ground-work-for-ug-screening/articleshow/84155347.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The CBI probe into the allegations of corruption has exposed the true character of SP. Once the probe is over, no guilty will be spared,” he said. Accusing SP of having looted people’s hard earned money, he said that UP’s people will never forgive the party for its misdeeds. Saying that the Riverfront scam was just one of the several such cases of corruption that took place in the five years of the SP government, Singh said that CBI had taken action against many engineers and contractors involved in the scam. “Soon it will become clear how material worth Re 1 was bought for Rs 100 under the SP government and the cost of the project was escalated by three times,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/riverfront-scam-has-exposed-sp/articleshow/84157536.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Two Andhra Pradesh farmers move Telangana high court against hydel power generation at Srisailam||HYDERABAD: The high court on Monday said it will not venture into examining the legality of Telangana’s decision to generate hydel power at Srisailam project without deciding on the maintainability of such petitions. The court also said as per the Inter-State Water Disputes Act, Krishna water tribunal in Delhi alone has got the jurisdiction to hear such cases. While hearing a lunch motion moved by two farmers from AP, a bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar said: “We will not get into the legality of TSGenco’s decision to produce hydel power in full capacity at Srisailam dam without first deciding whether petitions seeking such examination are maintainable before the court.” The judges further said: “Section 11 of the Inter-State Water Disputes Act says that only the Krishna tribunal at Delhi should hear it. Neither the Supreme Court nor any other court can hear such disputes.” This was in addition to the judgment of the apex court in the Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS) case, they said. The judges wanted advocates representing both the states and the farmers to come to court again on Tuesday after going through the SC verdict in the Rajolibanda case. The farmers were challenging the decision of Genco to go ahead with full-scale power generation, contending that this would disable the irrigation authorities from maintaining a required water level at the dam. They also said the resultant depletion in water levels would harm the interests of farmers in Krishna delta in AP. It may be recalled that the Rajolibanda judgment of the apex court adds an additional embargo on petitions from individual farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-ap-farmers-move-t-hc-against-hydel-power-generation-at-srisailam/articleshow/84155792.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Surat||Gujarat: Violent protest at Vedanta’s project in Tapi||SURAT: At least 30 teargas shells were fired when the public hearing for Vedanta Group’s Hindustan Zinc’s smelter plant turned violent in Doswada village of Tapi district on Monday. The mob, majority of them tribals, opposing what is being touted as the ‘world’s biggest zinc smelter complex’ started pelting stones during the hearing arranged by Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB). Reports suggested that at least five policemen were injured in stone pelting. "People opposing the public hearing got agitated after which they turned violent and forced us to lob teargas shells. Two policemen sustained minor injuries and a police vehicle was damaged," said sub-inspector Rajesh Vasava of Songadh police station. Tapi district superintendent of police (DSP), Sujata Majmudar said, "When the crowd was dispersing, somebody started throwing stones at policemen after which we fire teargas shells. The situation was brought under control.” A tribal leader who attended the protest said people from at least two dozen villages had assembled to oppose the setting up of the plant over pollution fears and they had demanded that the GPCB defer the hearing for some time. The state government had in October last year signed a pact with Hindustan Zinc to set up the zinc smelter complex with a capacity of 300 kilo tonnes per annum, entailing an investment of Rs 10,000 crore, on a 415 acre area in Doswada Some of the protesting persons also suffered injuries.  Tight police bandobast was installed at Doswada GIDC on Monday. Locals have submitted a memorandum against its development in the area. Holding public hearing in the time of Covid-19 was one of the reasons for protests by locals.  Those participating in the hearing demanded that the hearing should be postponed while those outside shouted slogans with banners. Locals are protesting the plant over environmental issues as well.  After the district collector HK Vadhvaniya announced that the hearing was postponed, some people started pelting stones on cops. “We are protesting against the project as it will have an adverse impact on the environment. Along with Mindhola River, lives of two lakh tribals will be affected. We wanted a permanent solution but the administration did not give a satisfactory reply, hence protestors sat on the road but police used force after which the stone pelting started,” claimed Amarsinh Z Chaudhary, founder of Adivasi Samanvay Manch, Vyara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/violent-protest-at-vedantas-project/articleshow/84153491.cms||---

Senior counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana, who was arguing the case of the Andhra Pradesh farmers, said that since the bench of Justice Ramachandra Rao was entrusted with the matters related to the AP Reorganisation Act involving both AP and Telangana, it would be better if the matter was heard by the roster bench — the bench of Justice Ramachandra Rao. Justice Ramachandra Rao warned the state counsel that the request of the government asking the bench to recuse from hearing the case amounts to ‘bench hunting’. “We did not expect the AG to make such an unreasonable request,” the judge said before commencing the hearing in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/court-slams-bench-hunting-bid/articleshow/84155852.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Dehradun||Armed with online petition, website, Twitterstorms, locals intensify stir against Sattal 'development'||NAINITAL: Local residents and environmentalists have intensified their protest against the proposed "redevelopment" of Sattal — an interconnected group of seven lakes located a few kilometres from Nainital — with many turning to social media to register their opposition to “concretisation of an ecological paradise”. The Sattal redevelopment plan involves building a children’s park, a view point along with beautification and landscaping work. But local residents have alleged that any construction in the ecologically fragile area would damage its rich biodiversity. Last week, as work on the project officially started, residents initiated Twitterstorms — a flurry of activity on Twitter — flooding the site with photos of an earthmover next to the pristine waters of the Sattal lake. Thousands of tweets supporting their cause poured in. An online petition to declare Sattal a “conservation reserve” has also garnered 32,000 signatures while a website has been built dedicated to the ‘Save Sattal’ campaign. The region is famous as a bird-watching spot and is one of the few breeding places for the endangered mahseer fish. It is also one of the last remaining oak forests in Uttarakhand. “Estimates suggest that there are nearly 600 bird species in Uttarakhand. You can easily see and photograph half of them in Sattal alone. The area has a high number of leopards, birds, reptiles, fishes along with a significant vegetative diversification. The concretisation will destroy everything,” said Asheesh Bisht, an assistant professor at Kumaun University, who has been working on avian research. Aagnay Budhraj, a resident of Sattal who started the online petition, alleged that local residents were not consulted by the government. “We don’t want any permanent structure in this area. The administration needs to find a solution,” he said. The residents said they had raised their concerns with the government but were yet to hear from the authorities. Government officials, however, said the project was an attempt to better manage the area and “concretisation has been reduced to bare minimum”. Officials alleged that the area around the lake is littered with garbage and the lake is being polluted. “We are not felling any trees for the redevelopment and the use of concrete is bare minimum. We are also engaging with locals and taking their feedback into account. No drastic changes will be made to the local ecology,” said N S Bhandari, managing director of Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN), which is working on the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/armed-with-online-petition-website-twitterstorms-locals-intensify-stir-against-sattal-development/articleshow/84151294.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Hyderabad||Telangana tells MoEF to be careful on green clearance for RLIP||HYDERABAD: Making a strong pitch against granting environmental clearance (EC) for Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP) by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) of Union ministry of environment and forest (MoEF), the Telangana government requested the EAC to carefully consider the legal, hydrological and environmental issues mentioned while considering granting clearance during its meeting scheduled to be held on July 7. Special chief secretary of irrigation department Rajat Kumar, in a letter to member-secretary of EAC on Monday, said the RLIP is an ‘illegal project’ and did not have water allocation or the Central Water Commission’s (CWC) approval. “On earlier occasions, EAC has not accorded EC for want of water allocation by CWC. In the case of Telangana, in the 19th EAC which was held on October 26, 2018, the committee had deferred the approval of Sitarama Lift Irrigaiton Project (phase I) on the same reasons,” Kumar said. He said the RLIP seeks to augment the expansion of Pothireddypadu Head Regulator which itself was an unauthorised project, not approved by the CWC and aimed at diverting Krishna river water outside the basin. The project canals’ buffer zones adversely impact the eco-system of the region and wildlife sanctuaries, he explained. The government also mentioned that the NGT (south zone) also directed the AP government not to proceed with the RLIP works without submitting the detailed project report before the KRMB and getting their appraisal done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-tells-moef-to-be-careful-on-green-clearance-for-rlip/articleshow/84155915.cms||---

Police had commenced an in-depth investigation in the case, and this could have upset the chances of some aspirants in securing tickets for the next assembly polls. Within 24 hours of the assault, police had arrested the main accused, Ram Gopal Yadav alias Kariya who is learnt to have revealed the names of the other persons who are directly or indirectly linked with in the case. Police sources said that Kariya, who confessed his crime, revealed the names of some influential politicians of Sancoale panchayat. The summoning of some Sancoale panchayat members by the police also raised suspicion. Verna police later received orders to transfer the case to crime branch on Monday. The police was also investigating whether the attack was planned to threaten or kill the victim. The two accused, who attacked Naik at the panchayat building, were identified as Ismail Shaikh alias Kabbu who is a history sheeter and out on bail, and his relative Khalil Makandar. Efforts to trace their location around the Goa state borders was under way. “The transfer of the case to crime branch put an end to the efforts of Verna police in unearthing links of more powerful politicians with the case,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rti-activist-assault-govt-hastily-transfers-case-to-crime-branch/articleshow/84157593.cms||---

The suicide of MPSC aspirant Swapnil Lonkar last week has brought to the fore the plight of many aspirants. An online campaign started hours after Lonkar’s death had students demanding that the commission start the process as soon as possible. Lonkar, who had cleared the MPSC written examination in 2019, was found hanging at his residence on Wednesday. In his suicide note, Lonkar said pressure had built up due to growing uncertainty in the MPSC exam schedules and the overall pandemic situation. Following his suicide, the state government formed an expert committee announced by CM Uddhav Thackeray that would suggest ways to avoid impending delays after the exams are conducted. Mandar Patki, now assistant collector in Amravati, said, “Swapnil Lonkar’s case is the ugly reality of competitive examinations. To all aspirants out there, think a thousand times before taking any extreme decision, talk to someone, try to formulate a Plan B and work on it. MPSC should not be an end in itself.” Prasad Nawale, an aspirant, said, “The government must take the exam seriously. The delay is adding to the pressure youths face. We have been waiting for the interviews for years but the government seems incompetent.” Mukesh Gade, another aspirant, said, “First, it was the pandemic, then, it was the reservation issue and in between them we have waited for two years for the interviews to be conducted.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uncertainty-builds-with-intws-off-results-on-hold/articleshow/84159328.cms||---

The school management has taken the decision to relieve parents of paying fees who are already struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. The school could retain students by taking such a bold step as parents would pull off their children from school citing inability to pay the fees. Gurukulam Nursery and Primary School with transportation facility charges an average of Rs 20,000 annually per student. But only a few parents could pay the fees last year. “Since 90% of the parents are daily wagers, we realised that parents will not be able to pay fees this year as well after the second wave,” said K Sivanesan, 34, correspondent of the school. Unlike most private schools that are located in urban areas, Gurukulam school is located in the remote Alanjirankadu village of Aranthangi taluk in Pudukottai district. Sivanesan said the school was started six years ago with 20 teachers to give quality education to the rural students as most private schools are located in towns and cities. The teachers were paid Rs 1,000 ever since the pandemic crisis began. Exhausting all the savings and mortgaging his jewellery, Sivanesan says that he can no longer pay the teachers. While the school is against conducting online classes for children in the tender age, each teacher is ensuring minimum learning for their students by engaging them from their neighbourhood. Parents pay the teachers for taking classes during the evening hours, said Sivanesan. “Waiver of fee has come as a great relief when I was thinking about pulling out my son from the school,” said S Karthikeyan, 35, a parent. One of the teachers in my neighbourhood is helping my son engage in academic activity. Many of the villagers have lost their income because of the pandemic. We will support the school as it has realised our pain and would pay back once normalcy is restored after the pandemic, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/pudukottai-private-school-waives-fees-parents-vouch-to-pay-back-after-crisis/articleshow/84155447.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Delhi||Riots case: HC refuses to hear activist plea after lawyer heckles||New Delhi: Delhi high court on Monday refused to hear student activist Gulfisha Fatima’s plea against her alleged illegal detention in a Delhi riots case after it took a strong exception to her advocate Mehmood Pracha’s taking recourse to “heckling” and placing reliance on facts that were not on record. A bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani directed that the petition be placed before another bench on Friday. “Instead of addressing us on merits, Mr Pracha is taking recourse to heckling and seeking to take recourse to facts not in the petition. List before another Bench..,” the court said. “We refuse to be addressed by someone who does not know the basics of law,” it remarked. In the habeas corpus petition, Fatima claimed that her custody in a Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case relating to alleged larger conspiracy that led to the northeast Delhi riots was illegal and she should thus be released. Delhi Police advocate Amit Mahajan told the court that a habeas corpus petition preferred by Fatima’s brother on the same relief was dismissed by the high court last year and the present petition was thus not maintainable. Pracha informed the court that an appeal against it before the Supreme Court was withdrawn with liberty to approach the high court. Calling the present petition a “second salvo on same relief”, the court questioned its maintainability and asked Pracha to take recourse to the remedy available in law. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riots-case-hc-refuses-to-hear-activist-plea-after-lawyer-heckles/articleshow/84155502.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Gomti Riverfront scam: CBI raids 40 locations in 3 states||LUCKNOW: The Central Bureau of Investigation conducted searches at 38 locations in UP and one each in Rajasthan and West Bengal in connection with the Rs 1,513-crore Gomti Riverfront Park scam – a flagship project of the previous SP government. The searches started on Sunday night and were underway at some locations till late on Monday. The crackdown came after the CBI filed a fresh FIR in the case on July 2 naming 16 government officials and 173 firms and private entities as accused. Sources in the CBI said the FIR was lodged following revelations that surfaced while probing the original FIR in the scam lodged in 2017 in which only eight engineers were named as accused. The searches were carried out in Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Gorakhpur, Agra, Etah and Moradabad. The CBI teams also searched a property each in Alwar district of Rajasthan and Kolkata. The premises searched included properties of two chief engineers, four superintending engineers, an executive engineer, assistant engineers who were posted with the irrigation department between 2015 and 2017 and had been associated with execution of the project. Premises of private entities associated with the scam were also searched.The July 2 FIR, on the basis of which searches were conducted, relates to the work related to the Gomti Riverfront Park that was executed between 2015 to March 2017 amounting to Rs 407 crore. It included repairing and painting of bridge, removal of sludge, construction of amphitheatre, installation of swings for children, landscaping and horticulture work from Nishatganj Bridge to Baikunth Dham, audio system, food plaza on Gomti Setu, Rubber Track and Jogging Track. “Probe revealed that Notice Inviting Tenders (NIT) for these jobs were not published in national newspapers as required and fake letters were allegedly sent to the information department instead,” the CBI stated in the FIR. The FIR cited investigations to state that tenders were awarded to the firms only on papers while the proprietors of these firms have denied signing or submitting any document related to the project. It has also been revealed that committees constituted to allocate work related to the project floated fake tenders and awarded contracts to shell firms registered in the names of their relatives or family members. The FIR also mentions a French firm, Aquatic Show, which was given a contract fraudulently. “Without due permission of the government, the accused engineers misused their official position and gave contract to the French firm on quotation basis. Though the accused engineers, in the official records, had shown that tenders were floated which could not be corroborated,” the FIR stated. The engineers named in the FIR are: Shiv Mangal Yadav, Jeevan Ram Yadav, Akhil Raman, Surendra Kumar Pal, Kamleshwar Singh, Roop Singh Yadav, then superintending engineer Shriprakash, then assistant engineers Jagpal Singh, Sunderlal, then principal assistants Om Verma, Kazim Ali, Siddh Narayan Sharma, then chief engineers Rajkumar Yadav and Manoj Yadav, then junior assistants, Sushil Kumar Yadav then Assistant Engineer and Arvind Singh Yadav then Executive Engineer. All have been booked under the charges of dishonesty, prevention of corruption act, Forgery for purpose of cheating, forgery of valuable security, fraudulently or dishonestly using a genuine document and criminal conspiracy. Sources said the first FIR was registered against eight engineers on November 30, 2017, in which works of beautification of Gomti river project to the tune of Rs 1,031 crore were only taken up by the CBI and in which a chargesheet has also been filed against former executive engineer Roop Singh Yadav, senior assistant Raj Kumar Yadav, two directors of a private firm associated with the Gomti Riverfront Development Project scam. The named accused awarded the work for intercepting trunk drain to an ineligible private firm and the date of tender was twice extended to accommodate the said firm, while probe is still pending in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gomti-riverfront-scam-cbi-raids-40-locations-in-3-states/articleshow/84157630.cms||---
---||Trichy||Native village Viragalur mourns Fr Stan Swamy||TRICHY: Born in Viragalur, a nonchalant village near Lalgudi in Trichy in Tamil Nadu, 84-year-old tribal rights activist Father Stan Swamy was not even known as an activist by his neighbours in the village until he was arrested over his alleged role in Bhima Koregaon violence by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on October 8, 2020. On Monday, a pall of gloom descended on his native village after the news spread on the passing away of the octogenarian Jesuit priest at Holy Family Hospital in Bandra, Mumbai. “Though he was born and brought up here, many of our relatives and neighbours had no idea about his work for the welfare of tribal people. Only after his arrest last year people here had come to know about his cause, and we took out a demonstration in Lalgudi demanding his release,” recalled S Benitto Prabhu, 26, who is the grandson of Swamy’s 89-year-old brother T P L Irudhayaswamy. The small village caught the attention of everyone with media people visiting his ancestral house on Monday. Fr Stanislaus Lourduswami, shortly called Stan Swamy, was the fifth child of his parents, who have six children. In memory of Swamy, the society of Jesus, Jamshedpur Province, put out a condolence message mentioning about his joining Jesuits in 1957, ordination in 1970 and final vows in 1981 besides mentioning about his service in Jamshedpur and Chaibasa, Indian Social Institute (ISI) in Bengaluru, St Xavier’s at Lupungutu, Johar in Chaibasa and BAGAICHA in Ranchi. His family members mentioned his association with St Joseph’s College in Trichy in his early days. “His native is Tamil Nadu, but he considered Jharkhand as his second home where he strived for the justice for the tribal people for 36 years till his death,” said Benitto adding that he never mentioned about his Tamil Nadu roots anywhere. Many factors prevented him from attending the funeral of his mother in the village in 1989, said Benitto. Fr Swamy’s last visit to his ancestral house was in January 2020. “He stayed here for three days. Usually, he would travel by train and ask one of us to pick him up from the railway station,” said Benitto. Since he was down with Covid-19, the family members were not allowed to participate in his funeral, which will be taking place in Mumbai, said Benitto. Condolences poured in from everywhere. Chief minister M K Stalin expressed his grief over his death. People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL)’s president Ravi Kiran Jain and general secretary V Suresh issued a joint statement condemning the judicial custody of Stan Swamy. “It is very clear that the NIA, Union government and the prison authorities are together responsible for the unnecessary and preventable death, which amounts to ‘institutional murder,” it said. The statement also said, “We strongly condemn the callous, insensitive and vengeful approach of the prosecution to the prayer for interim bail to Fr Stan and other prisoners who suffered medical conditions making them vulnerable to Covid-19 infections in the prison.” CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan called for a state-wide demonstration on July 8 to demand action against those ‘responsible’ for the death of Fr Stan ‘by foisting false cases against him’. VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan MP termed the death of Fr Swamy ‘a murder committed by BJP government with the help of laws’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/native-village-viragalur-mourns-fr-stan-swamy/articleshow/84155460.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Speaking to reporters in Trichy on Monday, the president of the federation, Sella Rajamani, appealed to the state government to reopen all the state-run sand quarries that had stopped functioning since April 7. “More than 55,000 trucks meant for sand mining remained idle. The truck owners were reeling under a financial crisis and were unable to pay the vehicle loan dues. Some of them have committed suicide,” said Sella Rajamani. Rajamani also said that the state required 60,000 units of sand per day. The closure of sand quarries from 2017 reduced the number of quarries to single digits, which produced 2,500 units of sand daily. The federation also pointed out that the then AIADMK government had shown very less interest to operate the sand quarries from 2017 to 2021 leading to severe shortage of river sand for the construction purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/truck-owners-demand-state-govt-to-reopen-sand-quarries/articleshow/84155465.cms||---

It’s BJP’s internal issue, says former Uttarakhand state chief||Dehradun: Veteran BJP leader Banshidhar Bhagat, who is currently a cabinet minister and was previously the party’s state chief, after the swearing-in ceremony of Pushkar Dhami’s cabinet on Sunday, alleged that “people are not concerned whether the party replaces CMs once or twice or even 10 times.” “How does it matter how many times a CM is changed? People are concerned about getting work done and seeing development in the state which our party is ensuring,” he said. He added that the opposition was “creating issues out of non-issues.” “Who is listening to what opposition parties are saying? People don’t pay attention to them.” Reacting to Bhagat's statement, Suryakant Dhasmana, state vice- president of Uttarakhand Congress, said, “Has anybody benefited by having three chief ministers in a short period of time? This is nothing but creating political instability in the state. BJP has done grave injustice to the people of Uttarakhand and they will not forgive them for it.” Bhagat has courted controversy multiple times in the past. In January, he had called leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh, who passed away last month, “an old woman.” Last year, while exhorting party leaders to improve their performance, he had said that “MLAs won’t get votes in the name of PM Narendra Modi as the Modi wave is now over. Later, he had to release a statement in which he stated that his remarks on the PM, who is a great leader, had been misinterpreted by the people of a media channel whom he had spoken to. Bhagat was also criticised for downplaying the importance of wearing a mask and was clicked performing pooja in a temple when religious places were closed during the Covid-induced lockdown last year. He was also seen using a gadget which he alleged will save him from Covid-19, and soon after that, he tested positive for the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/how-does-it-matter-if-we-replace-2-cms-or-10-its-bjps-internal-issue-says-former-ukhand-state-chief/articleshow/84151318.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee

Farmers also want to know if they will be allowed to keep licensed air guns to shoot the wild boar or whether government department officials will exterminate the animals for them. “There are a lot of restrictions in owning an air gun, but a few farmers clandestinely use it because they need to choose between protecting their produce and the wild animal,” a farmer from Dharbandora said. Some others were of the opinion that the issue’s timely announcement is nothing but a political gimmick. “This is an issue of the survival of the farmers,” Sattari-based farmer and lawyer, S N Joshi said. “People cultivate crops and invest heavily in their farms, yet do not get the returns owing to wild animal attacks. If the government is really serious about it, they must also issue a notification, else this looks like nothing but a political gimmick,” he added. “This initiation (by Sawant) looks more like an election propaganda. The entire farmer community will be glad if the government releases an order at the earliest,” Rohan Joshi, a farmer from Bicholim said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ryots-seek-action-plan-on-vermin/articleshow/84157649.cms||---

People are facing problems due to wild boars,” Sawant said, adding that only this species is being considered for declaration of vermin. Currently, the wild boar is protected under the Wildlife Act, making its killing illegal. Owing to man-animal conflicts and destruction of crops over the past few years, farmers had been appealing to the government to declare certain wild animals vermin, one them wild boar. They insisted that four animals from schedule 3 and 4 be reclassified to schedule 5. Over the past few years, the opposition, too, has been demanding that wild boars and other animals who destroy crops be declared vermin. Meanwhile, Sawant said that he has directed the forest department to expedite pending cases to settle forest rights claims. He also said that tree cutting permissions would be given online.  Sawant said that he continues to hold review meetings (with forest department officials). He said he discussed progress on reforms in the department and also the status of recruitments. The chief minister said that they have invited bidders to conduct surveys in forest areas to settle claims, but only one agency has shown interest. “We have to conduct the survey and settle the public claim of forest rights,” he said. Sawant also said that people can apply online to seek permissions to plant trees for commercial use. He also said that the state government has finalised the granting of tree cutting permissions online, and it would made available shortly. Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar had said that the tribal communities in the talukas of Sanguem, Quepem, Canacona, Dharbandora and Sattari are worried about their future due to ‘inconsistency in government policy decisions as well as lethargic approach of the government with respect to forest right claims under the Forest Rights Act, 2006’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/initiated-process-to-declare-wild-boars-as-vermin-cm/articleshow/84157666.cms||---

Eight clusters were identified and surveyed in the corporation’s jurisdiction and 24 clusters were selected by the department of public health in rural parts of the district. Sample collection is nearing completion in the rural localities. Health officials said that the third phase commenced across the district in the first week of July. Random localities were selected by the state health department to ensure accuracy and the district health department and civic bodies were not involved in localities selection process. The serosurvey will select one household in a locality identified. By using the Kish method (respondent selection type), family members in each household will be listed based on their age and one person will be selected from the list to collect the blood sample. Serosurvey will examine the blood sample of residents of a particular geography to detect the immune response to the virus and identify the presence of antibodies. Lab technicians from nearby primary health centres accompanied by the medical officers to collect the blood samples. Answers for a set questionnaire covering Covid-19 vaccination status, infection symptoms and age were collected from the locals of the cluster. “We selected respondents from 30 consecutive houses of the same street as suggested by experts for better accuracy. Those who were unwilling and locked houses were skipped. The areas selected were not covered in the previous two phases of the serosurvey,” said city health officer Dr M Yazhini. In the first two phases of the serosurvey in Trichy city, the seropositivity was around 30%. In rural Trichy, 720 samples will be lifted from 24 clusters. Health officials said that the public was more accommodative after explaining to them about the purpose of the survey. The third phase is expected to have high seropositivity than the first two phases since vaccinated people were also covered. Similarly, the positivity rate in the second wave was higher than the first wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/third-phase-serosurvey-completed-in-trichy-city/articleshow/84155487.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Delhi||Arrest of car thieves from central Delhi puts cops on terror trail ahead of Independence Day||NEW DELHI: The arrest of two vehicle thieves from central Delhi put the security establishment on their toes with intelligence agencies and cops from Jammu & Kashmir joining the probe to trace their antecedents and network. The primary line of investigation is now being conducted from terror angle, said a senior officer adding that efforts are on to ascertain if the duo had any indirect links with any proscribed outfits and whether they were providing vehicles to their members. While recovery of pictures of drones and terrorists from the handsets had rang the first alarm bells, peculiar burn injuries on the hand of one of the suspects has made the agencies examine it to ascertain if it was caused by explosives, cops said. A picture of a cop killed by terrorists has also been found on their devices. The two men have been identified as Shaukat Ahmed Malla (25) from Sopore, Baramulla and Mohammad Zubair from Kairana, UP. Showkat, it turns out, came to Delhi frequently via flight and drove back to the Valley with stolen cars. Five air tickets of last month has been found on him apart from 100 fake number plates. He was working as a contractor for civil work for the state government. Zubair was a mechanic. Zubair was tasked to receive stolen vehicles from an auto-lifter referred to as Rinku from Loni in Ghaziabad and make it ready for sale after tampering with its chassis/engine numbers and changing its number plate. “The syndicate was busted by a team led by ACP Yogesh Malhotra and sub inspectors Sandeep Godara, Ravi Shankar and Islamuddin,” DCP (central) Jasmeet Singh said. The team gathered informed on them for three months and finally found that they were coming to Delhi to take delivery on July 3. A trap was laid in Paharganj and the duo was nabbed with a stolen Baleno car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/arrest-of-car-thieves-from-central-delhi-puts-cops-on-terror-trail-ahead-of-i-day/articleshow/84155553.cms||---

Devul has been sent for Covid tests and will be arrested if his results are negative. “Devul came to the police station and surrendered himself. His blood samples have also been taken to ascertain if he was drunk while driving,” said KM Chaansiya, Manjalpur police station. On Saturday evening, Devul was speeding near the crematorium road in Manjalpur and rammed his jeep into a two-wheeler at about 6.30 pm.  Dharvi Patel, who was going home on the scooter, fell down with Kavish and Kiyan, both seven-year-olds. Kavish suffered severe injuries on his head and was rushed to the hospital. Devul fled from the spot and drove his jeep towards Alwa Naka. The police said that a panicked Devul rammed the jeep into a divider and abandoned the vehicle there.  After the police learnt about the accident, they began searching for the jeep that was found near Alwa Naka. about two kilometres from the spot of the accident. The vehicle didn’t have a license plate. They found a mobile phone and wallet from the jeep and learnt that the vehicle was owned by Ghanshyam. Ghanshyam told the cops that his son Devul drives the jeep.  Kavish died late on Saturday night during the treatment after which the cops intensified the search for Devul who was missing from his home. Devul claimed to have passed Class XII but he hasn’t produced any certificate yet. He was reportedly booked by the police for flouting night curfew in April this year and his jeep was also detained. Ghanshyam, who is into construction business, had joined RSP last year and contested the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) polls from ward 6 earlier this year. The incident, though, left Kavish’s family shattered. His father Rajesh, a resident of Dabhoi, had sent Kavish to Vadodara city for better education. Kavish was studying in Class I. Kavish was born 22 years after marriage BOX: When Kavish was born, his father 51-year-old Rajesh Patel’s joy knew no bounds. “Kavish was born after 22 years of marriage. His parents had been trying for the baby for a long time and the kid was born after IVF treatment. He was a blessing for the family but sadly their only kid died due to rash driving of some man,” said Kavish’s uncle Jitendra Patel. RSP leader accused in criminal cases Police said RSP leader Ghanshyam Fulbaze has criminal cases registered against him. His wife Manisha had filed a complaint of criminal intimidation against him in City police station in 2018. Manisha had accused him of bigamy and he had allegedly threatened her against testifying against him the court. Ghanshyam’s partner too had registered a case of criminal intimidation against him in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/local-netas-son-who-mowed-down-seven-year-old-boy-arrested/articleshow/84153614.cms||---

Around 100 more will be planted over the next week till mid-July, and during the Vanamahotsava festival this month. Guava, mango, cashew and teakwood tree saplings are among the few that have been planted, and many more are expected to be provided by the forest department to the NIO, said director Sunil Kumar Singh. The institute is home to a variety of trees spread throughout its campus, that include mango, copper pod and neem trees, besides a number of flower trees. Some of these were decades old, planted at the time of the institute’s inception, while others had been there even prior to that. Due to the impact of Tauktae, many of these trees were uprooted owing to the ferocious winds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-tauktae-nio-on-replantation-spree/articleshow/84157694.cms||---

Ananthavadi and adjoining villagers said that a new bus service was sought by the locals to reach Jayankondam town and other small towns in the adjacent districts of Ariyalur. Apart from the workers going to their work locations, people also sought the service to travel for medical needs. So far, the village had only one bus service, which was termed insufficient.

---||Dehradun||We will talk less and perform more: Pushkar Singh Dhami||DEHRADUN: In one of his first media interactions after taking over charge of the state, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami spoke extensively to TOI on Monday about his priorities for the state and how he is planning to tackle dissent within the party from seniors, many of whom were reportedly unhappy over his elevation. “There is no dispute or differences between any of us. All of us are working together to usher in an era of development in the state,” the CM said. He added, “I am lucky I have an extremely experienced team, which is a big bonus. All of them are experts in different sectors and have been in politics for a long time. We had a meeting, and it was decided that the focus will be on time-bound completion of projects.” Dhami said that his main thrust will be on generating employment for unemployed youth through government jobs and self-employment opportunities. “Our focus would be on creating around 25,000 job opportunities in government of which 13,000 vacancies will be brought out immediately. We will also give relaxation in age limit by one year to those appearing for competitive exams in the state and a proposal to this effect will be brought in the cabinet soon,” he said. He added that the state government was soon going to file a review petition in the high court for the phase-wise start of the Char Dham Yatra. “When Uttarakhand was created, tourism and energy were two major sectors. Tourism has been adversely affected by Covid-19 and, therefore, it is extremely important for us to revive tourism.” When queried whether he had any inkling the party was selecting him for the top job, he said, “Honestly, I was not aware of it till the time the BJP legislature party meeting started to select a new leader. But yes, I was aware that my name was being considered. Now that I have been given this opportunity, I will ensure I do a good job.” On the limited time that he has –barely a few months before elections are announced -- Dhami said, “I am well aware that we have less time at hand but we will make the most of it. In the next few days, I will start touring different parts of the state to take a first-hand account of the activities in each region. I want to reiterate that our government will not only lay the foundation stone of projects but also complete them in the next few months and dedicate them to the people of the state.” Stressing that he wanted to "reach out to maximum people", Dhami said, “I have stayed in almost all districts of the state and can say that I am aware of the situation, right to the block level. I want to send out the message that we will not work like a ‘sarkar’ but rather as a sajhedar (partner). We will talk less and perform more.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/we-will-talk-less-and-perform-more-dhami/articleshow/84151330.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Dehradun||In Uttarakhand hills, entire meadow with lake ‘private property’||DEHRADUN: A sign board that declared a meadow with a dried-up lake at 6,000 ft in Chamoli district as a “private estate” has alarmed environmentalists in Uttarakhand, many of whom have called for a probe into “the encroachment by land mafia”. The signage was spotted this week by city-based environmentalist Manoj Dhyani and his team who had gone to the area — nearly 660 hectares of lush cover of oak and rhododendron — to inspect why the Benital lake in Gairsain had dried up. “Our intent was to understand why this Himalayan lake has dried up despite rain and snow this year, but we were shocked and heartbroken to see this sign that said the entire meadow was ‘private estate’. How can the entry to the lake or meadow be private property? We are demanding an investigation into this,” said Dhyani. Meadows or bugyals in Uttarakhand have legal protection. The high court had previously ruled that no permanent structures should be built in the alpine and sub-alpine meadows and grasslands in the Himalayas. It had also passed a mandate limiting the number of tourists to these places to protect the meadows from exploitation. Local residents said the sign had come up this year. Magan Singh, president of Benital Jan Sangharsh Samiti, an organisation fighting for rights of villagers in the region, told TOI, “We hold a local fair at Benital every year and this sign was certainly not there last year or the year before that. It appeared this year and it mentions that the land and the lake was given to the owner by the British.” TOI found that the “estate” was embroiled in a long-drawn court battle. Under the Kumaun and Uttarakhand Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1960, the rights, title and interest of every hissedaar (owner) in respect of forest land situated in the specified areas ceased with effect from January 1, 1978 and the same were vested in the state government. In August 1997, the Allahabad high court dismissed a writ petition filed by the owners of the Benital land, holding that the appellants were not entitled to any compensation even when their forest land was acquired by the government because the appellants had not derived any income from the said forest. In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that the private forest should be handed over to the state and petitioners should be paid compensation. Ashutosh Singh, divisional forest officer (Badrinath Forest Division), told TOI that after the judgment, the state government had said that the 660 hectares of land would be declared a reserved forest. “But to do that, the revenue department has to transfer the land to the forest department which hasn’t been done yet.” The district magistrate of Chamoli, Swati Bhadouria, said no one had approached the district administration with a complaint of encroachment yet. “If anyone is found encroaching upon government land, they will face legal action,” said Bhadouria. Environmentalists said construction at such high altitudes must be banned to protect the fragile ecology. Padma Shri Kalyan Singh Rawat, founder of Maiti Movement — under which newlyweds plant saplings — said, “If land mafia are allowed to eye Himalayas, they will destroy its biodiversity and threaten the survival of the human race.” Rawat said the rare Brahma Kamal once bloomed in Benital but the lake had dried up now due to lack of conservation efforts. Benital lake is surrounded by two mountain ranges — Beni Tal and Dudhatoli — and is 6km from Adi Badri, a holy pilgrimage site of Hindus in Chamoli. The area is rich in biodiversity with thriving populations of Himalayan goats, leopards and even macaques.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-ukhand-hills-entire-meadow-with-lake-private-property/articleshow/84151344.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Districts with more private hospitals have inoculated most 18-44s||MUMBAI: The suspension of free vaccination by government agencies for people between 18 and 44 years for most of May and June has led to a massive disparity within districts in the proportion of population covered. Districts with a higher concentration of private hospitals such as Mumbai, Pune and Thane have marched ahead of others that didn’t have similar access to doses. Of the 71.1 lakh doses given covering 12% to the 18-44 year olds in the state, nearly 60% has been in Mumbai, Pune and Thane (see box). Mumbai is at the top of the chart having vaccinated nearly 20 lakh and covered a third of this population with a single dose. The majority of these vaccinations happened in the private sector. State data shows only 11 of the 35 districts have managed to vaccinate more than 10% of this population, considered more mobile and crucial for the opening of economic activities in the state. On May 1, the Centre opened vaccination for all adults, but the state government took a call to suspend vaccination for 18-44 years from May 12 to prioritise the vaccination of people above 45. Free vaccination for 18-44 years olds resumed only on June 21. Private hospital chains that could procure doses carried out inoculations through May and June. A state official said the Centre’s policy of allowing private players to procure their own doses created the difference in coverage between districts as rural districts with not many private hospitals lost out. “Besides availability, hesitancy too is playing a role, which districts must combat using effective communication,” he said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, an adviser to the state government, said the state must vaccinate people from all age groups if the third wave’s impact has to be minimised. Kolhapur has emerged as a unique example in vaccination. It is at the top of the coverage chart for people above 45, inoculating 70% with at least one dose. But it is struggling when it comes to the 18-44 age group. “As we get more doses, these numbers will improve. Also, we are seeing a very high transmission rate and volume of new positive cases, mainly from the younger age brackets. Hence, their vaccination numbers are low since they have recently been exposed,” a senior district official said. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said private hospitals in Mumbai had received 19 lakh doses in May and 12 lakh in June which helped in the vaccination of the 18-44 year olds. In the age groups above 45, the state has completed administering at least one dose to 43% of the population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-districts-with-more-pvt-hosps-have-inoculated-most-18-44s/articleshow/84155721.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Days after teenager’s murder, police arrest three men for extortion bid||NEW DELHI: Ten days after an 18-year-old boy was shot dead in the cc area inside a utensil shop, police have arrested three men who had come to the shop to extort money from the owner. Police said the owner was a well-known businessman and the accused first fired three rounds to scare him and later handed over a slip on behalf of jailed gangster Ashok Pradhan demanding Rs 50 lakh. The boy who worked at the shop was trying to contact the police when the accused shot him dead. The three arrested men have been identified as Pankaj, previously involved in three criminal cases, his associate Aniket and Shiv Jeet, a lawyer whose father was a retired assistant commissioner of police. Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said that on June 25, police received a call around 4 pm that some men had opened fire at a shop and injured a man in village Qutab Garh. “A team from Kanjhawala police station reached the spot. The owner of the shop, Devender Gandhi, told the cops that a man came to his shop around 3:45 pm and fired bullets inside and outside the shop and even handed over a slip demanding money. When Vishal, a worker at the shop, dialled the police, the armed man shot him on the spot,” Tayal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/days-after-teenagers-murder-police-arrest-3-men-for-extortion-bid/articleshow/84155594.cms||---

Earlier in the day, Mayawati had said that RSS has always supported BJP’s narrow and divisive politics. Responding to her statement, BJP’s state spokesperson Sakshi Diwakar said RSS is a nationalist organisation working selflessly for the betterment of the society but the BSP supremo is unaware of it as she has always promoted caste based politics for the sake of monetary gains. “It is not surprising that people and parties which thrive on casteism and nepotism will not understand the selfless dedication of RSS towards nation building,” she said. “Bahenji is yet to realise that people have voted for BJP only to bring an end to the culture of caste politics that thrived of corruption under the successive SP and BSP regimes,” Sakshi said in a statement. She said people of the state have been through the times when money and middlemen use to frame the policies of the state as a result of which people of UP had to suffer. “People have seen everything so no one is ready to believe the BSP chief,” she added. Sakshi said perhaps Maywati has realised that PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath are pushing forward the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, leaving no scope for any other political outfit to come to power in the near future which is why she is making such comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-chief-is-no-longer-taken-seriously-by-her-party-bjp/articleshow/84157735.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Using the phrase Insha’Allah (if God willing) in his tweet, Owaisi had said that he would not let Yogi Adityanath become the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh again. “The word Insha’Allah means praying to the Almighty for something to happen. He just wants to create religious differences rather than doing honest politics,” secretary of Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation, Athar Hussain, said. “Owaisi is not concerned about the day-to-day problems of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, he only comes to UP during elections and goes back to Hyderabad,” he added. Co-Mutawalli of Teelay Waali Masjid in Lucknow, Maulana Wasif Hasan, asked what did Owaisi do in the matter of Barabanki mosque which was “illegally sealed and demolished”. “Neither he raised the issue with the government nor conducted any legal proceedings to address the problem,” he added. “Whenever there is a rise in communal politics, the minority community suffers the most. Owaisi has sparked communal passion, we will face the consequences,” said Mohammad Alam, a religious scholar in Ayodhya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/muslims-accuse-owaisi-of-mixing-religion-politics/articleshow/84157714.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||India||Could ceasefire be a casualty after Pakistan’s accusation against India?||NEW DELHI: With Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf declaring that the blast on June 23 outside terror leader Hafiz Mohammed Saeed’s home in Lahore was the work of Indian intelligence agencies, its clear the nascent ceasefire process, which began with guns on the LOC falling silent on Februrary 25, may have run its course. Yusuf told a TV channel that there would no longer be any back-channel talks with India largely because the neighbour “failed” to heed Pakistan’s concerns and did not reverse nullification of Art 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. He claimed India approached Pakistan for talks — "It was India that approached us. They (India) said they wanted to talk on all disputed issues, including on Kashmir." He added Pakistan had clearly conveyed its demand for reversal of the August, 2019 move for talks to resume. While Yusuf tagged India's alleged refusal to restore Article 370 as reason for closing the doors on any likely engagement, such a consideration did not seem at work earlier when army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa urged that Pakistan must consider "geo-economics" instead of just "geo-politics" and the Imran Khan government considered easing of trade. Yusuf’s statement on the Johar Town blast glosses over that it was at the home of a UN designated global terror group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and that its chief Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, supposedly in prison, was according to numerous reports at his residence at the time of the attack. Indian officials see this as the beginning of a Pakistan narrative against India. It will be difficult for Pakistan to sell the story of a terror attack by India against the mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. Instead, they expect Pakistan to try to make the case that India is responsible for creating internal instability. Pakistan has been stunned at the pace of Taliban’s advances in Afghanistan in the past weeks. Like others, they too expect a period of civil war like situation in Afghanistan, and worry Pakistan could face some blowback, in terms of refugees as well as a concern that the anti-Pakistan TTP could tie up with the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan retains a significant hold on the Afghan Taliban leadership, particularly the more virulent factions. But Islamabad-Rawalpindi entertain fears that a Taliban that chafes under Pakistani domination could help other terror outfits against Pakistan. That has the potential of turning the entire idea of “strategic depth” on its head. A narrative against India could be tried out for sympathy votes in the West. The Pakistan parliamentary committee on national security heard last week that the government wants a better relationship with US, while not giving up its ties with China. Reports said Pakistani lawmakers asserted that they did not want to be seen to be in China’s pocket. That could have implications for the Pakistan-China relationship particularly as the US-China rivalry deepens every day. Pakistan could reach for a more normal relationship with India, but this might have implications for its ties with China. Or it could, as seems more likely, seek to paint India black in the West — there are reports to suggest Pakistan may be using a smart and coordinated media strategy and a diaspora outreach for the purpose. PM Khan has already been interviewed in the western media, and he has written opeds too. Islamabad might reckon that with Modi allegedly having lost support in the western civil society and media, it might be an easier climb for Imran Khan and the Pakistani narrative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/could-ceasefire-be-a-casualty-after-pakistans-accusation-against-india/articleshow/84160033.cms||Indrani Bagchi

---||Delhi||DDA set to begin landscape work around east Delhi’s Sanjay Lake this month||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has been carrying out the ecological restoration of Sanjay Jheel, a man-made lake located amid over 170 acres of greenery, one the largest green areas in east Delhi. In the first phase of the project, an amphitheatre, walking trail and cycling tracks had come up. As part of Phase-II, major landscaping work is set to begin this month. A senior DDA official said that from mid-July, landscape development work would begin. “It will provide space to the public to feel the natural beauty without disturbing it,” he added. The units that are going to be created include Murram (gravel) path for walking, new cycle tracks, green mounds, a natural pathway trail and a “bioswale” for ground recharge, which would also provide natural beauty. A bioswale is a ditch or channel with vegetation where stormwater runoff is concentrated to remove debris and help in recharging groundwater. Created in the 1970s, Sanjay Jheel has been a popular location attracting visitors, thanks to the presence of the waterbody, greenery and ducks. DDA is now trying to improve the entire area so that it becomes one of the best recreational areas in the city and the best in east Delhi. “Apart from a toddlers’ play area, there will be open gym equipment and a round area with pergolas and brick jaali work to weave the beauty of artwork with nature,” said the official. DDA would also install an adequate number of benches and sitting platforms for visitors. “The project deadline will be eight months after the award of tender. It is expected to start from July 15, so the deadline will be March 15, 2022. The total cost is expected to be Rs 1.7 crore,” added the official. While Phase-I only covered a part of the huge green area, the current phase would ensure more improvement in a larger section without disturbing the ecology of the area. There are also plans for lakeview plazas, food courts, observation deck, meditation garden, duck house, artist court, sculpture court, craft hut, etc in the future. “No work related to the Transit Oriented Development project is being used,” the official clarified. The Sanjay Lake View Complex near Trilokpuri in east Delhi is one of the identified TOD projects planned to be developed by DDA along with NBCC. The complex will come up adjacent to the Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake station of Delhi Metro’s Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) on DDA land measuring 10.3 hectares (25.3 acres). DDA started the ecological restoration of the area more than two years ago. The water in the lake gets dirty as unclean water gets mixed with it. That is why there are plans of creating a sewage treatment plant (STP) there. “Since the lake is man-made and has no catchment areas, it depends on rainwater and other sources for feeding it,” the official said. There are plans to use water from a nearby stormwater drain for which the STP would be used.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/soak-in-nature-from-up-close/articleshow/84155689.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The BJP denied the charges and termed it an attempt to reduce the opposition’s strength in the assembly. The suspended MLAs later met governor B S Koshyari, asking him to stay the suspension and demand a probe. The suspended MLAs include senior leaders like former ministers Girish Mahajan, Ashish Shelar, Jaykumar Rawal and Yogesh Sagar. Shelar, as former city BJP chief, and three other Mumbai MLAs who are among those suspended, are influential figures for BJP in the BMC polls due in February. Jadhav told the assembly the MLAs rushed to the well of the House and tried to snatch his mike and also the mace kept on the Speaker’s table. ‘Speaker election cannot be held when MLAs suspended’Twelve BJP MLAs were on Monday suspended for one year for creating a ruckus in the assembly on the OBC quota issue and later allegedly misbehaving with the presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav in the cabin of the deputy speaker. “These things happen but never continue outside the assembly. However, they later came to my cabin and abused me. They came in a large crowd and tried to manhandle me. I have not seen such behaviour in the last 36 years in the assembly,” Jadhav alleged. Those suspended are not allowed to enter the assembly premises in Nagpur and Mumbai for a year. The BJP denied the charges. “The Talibani Thackeray government hatched a conspiracy to create false charges and reduce our numbers. Elections for the Speaker’s post cannot be held when MLAs are suspended,” said the BJP’s Shelar. The BJP alleged that it was the Shiv Sena MLAs present in the cabin who had indulged in unruly behaviour. “I had even apologized to Jadhav and the issue was over,” said Shelar. Skill development minister Nawab Malik tweeted a video clip showing footage of a sloganeering crowd in the cabin, but Shelar said it did not establish anything. The chaos in the state assembly began after the MVA government sought to blame the Centre over the lack of data on the status of the OBC community. The resolution moved by food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said that the Centre had empirical data on OBCs as part of the Socio Economic Caste Census 2011 but had not provided it to the state despite repeated requests. The resolution asked for the Centre to provide the empirical data to the state so it could be given to the Backward Class Commission. The quota for OBCs in local bodies, including zilla parishads and panchayats, was recently struck down by the Supreme Court. Elections to several local bodies are scheduled in February. Leader of opposition in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis said the Supreme Court had asked for empirical data on the community, not for the census data. “The state needs to conduct empirical research into the political backwardness of the OBC community. Census data will not help maintain the reservation,” Fadnavis said. After Bhujbal spoke, the BJP sought to reply, but their request was denied. Then BJP legislators rushed to the well of the House even as Shelar tried to persuade them to return to their seats. The presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav was heard warning BJP MLA Sanjay Kute. The resolution was passed with a voice vote and Jadhav adjourned the state assembly. However, several MLAs went to his cabin, where the alleged misconduct took place. Later, in the legislative assembly, Sena MLA Sunil Prabhu and NCP’s Nawab Malik demanded action against the BJP MLAs. The resolution for their suspension was moved byparliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab and was passed by a voice vote even as the BJP walked out and boycotted the rest of the assembly proceedings. Fadnavis claimed that it was not the BJP MLAs but the Shiv Sena MLAs who had used abusive language in front of Jadhav.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Now, stage set for block pramukh poll on July 10||LUCKNOW: After high-decibel polling for the posts of zila panchayat chairpersons, the political stage is set for another grassroots election with the Uttar Pradesh State Election Commission announcing the schedule for block pramukh (chairperson of the kshetra panchayats) polls on Monday. Election will be held for 825 of the 826 blocks, the only exception being Gonda’s Mujhena block where the term of block pramukh will conclude in 2022. More than 75,500 ward members will choose block chairman during the electoral process.

Candidates can withdraw their applications till 3pm on July 9. Polling and counting of votes will take place on July 10. The election assumes importance as the ruling BJP and opposition parties are eyeing maximum gains to strengthen their position ahead of 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections. “It is an indirect election but results would give a psychological boost to the winning parties," a poll analyst said. The ruling BJP already has an edge over the opponents by winning 66 of the 75 seats, while its allies bagged another one, in the recent zila panchayat chairman polls. The party won unopposed on 21 seats. Samajwadi Party-backed candidates won five seats while three seats went to RLD, Janshakti Party and an Independent candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-stage-set-for-block-pramukh-poll-on-july-10/articleshow/84157746.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Hyderabad||Eye on third wave, doctors in Hyderabad train parents on first aid||HYDERABAD: Ahead of a possible third wave of Covid-19 hitting Hyderabad and the districts, paediatricians and general physicians are recommending parents to learn first aid and home remedies to tackle the virus at home. Apart from training sessions on first aid, many parents are following videos and posts by experts to remain up to date on the first aid after data showed that children are increasingly falling prey to the virus. “At first, I had no clue about first aid but when my child got Covid-19 during the second wave, I learnt a bit from online videos. Fortunately, it wasn’t a severe disease and settle down but after having experienced that panic, I started looking out for ways to learn first aid online,” said Priyanka Bolla, mother of a 2-year-old in Hyderabad. While parents are trying to gain knowledge about how they can address common problems like diarrhoea, high fever and seizures at home, the number of parents who know first aid need to increase substantially, say experts. “The most important thing for parents is not to worry or panic but be prepared for all possibilities in view of Covid-19. The parents need to empower themselves with the right knowledge about fever, seizures, vomiting and diarrhoea which are seen in kids. Right now, the awareness among parents is very little and we urgently need to increase the awareness among parents. That way we can prevent a lot of trouble,” said Dr Shivaranjani Santosh, chief consultant paediatrician, Magna centres. While on one hand, parents need to know what the symptoms of Covid-19 could be and related complications with Multi system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), on the other, the need to learn how to tackle these issues effectively are also being highlighted. MIS-C has been seen increasingly during the second wave and includes high fever, severe shock and cardiac arrest. “While in Covid-19, most children do not fall very sick, but parents need to know how to control the temperature in case of fever, monitor oxygen levels, make sure the child is hydrated (by checking urine output, lethargy) and giving regular liquids in case of dehydration. In severe cases which are very few, the child can go into seizure. Knowing first aid will help parents in knowing that they need to put the child in a lateral position,” said Dr Srinivas Jakka, pediatric pulmonologist, Ankura hospitals. He added that while checking for breathing difficulties is important too and in such cases the children should be taken to the hospital instead of trying anything at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eye-on-third-wave-doctors-train-parents-on-first-aid/articleshow/84155634.cms||Amrita Didyala

Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation (MADC) managing director Deepak Kapoor, who has completed one year into his tenure here, however, sees a ray of hope. Acknowledging that the Covid-19 pandemic has hit proposed investors, he says the administration has been successful in bringing two big companies. In view of the precarious situation faced by the city in April, he has also come up with the concept of having another multipurpose hospital at Mihan. He has also proposed a hotel inside Mihan and floated tenders. In an exclusive talk with TOI, he speaks about various issues related to Mihan. Excerpts: Big manufacturing companies are still shying away from Mihan. The second wave of Covid-19 and series of lockdowns has really devastated the economy. However, we at MADC are making consistent efforts to invite investors. Our efforts have borne fruit with Persistent Systems, one of the top IT companies in the state, buying 13.5 acre for setting up a unit. They’re supposed to provide employment to 500 people. Similarly, Kalpana Saroj Aviation Limited purchased one acre for establishing its aviation park. It would start training in aviation through simulators and other latest gadgets. A lot of youths are expected to get direct or indirect jobs in these two units. Of course, uncertainty is still looming large, but we’re trying our best. Questions are often raised about Patanjali plant, which has failed to take off even after four years. It’s in the process of revival. Our officials sent me a picture recently of machinery being brought in a truck to the plant. The company has appointed a general manager there and applied for fresh bank loans. It has also started cleaning the premises, said our team that paid a visit there. What’s the status of Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited’s (DRAL) plant at Mihan? They’ve cleared all their payments and there’s nothing pending as of now. Their operations are underway. You plan to start another hospital and a hotel at Mihan. The Covid-19 pandemic has taught us that health care and tourism are going to be major development areas in the next few years. We’ve allotted 0.3 acres for the hospital and received a good response, with six companies bidding for it. The tenders would be opened on Thursday. It would most likely be a multi-purpose hospital. For a hotel, we’ve invited tenders. We don’t know if it would be a three, four or five-star hotel. It will all depend on the response of the bidders. We’ve allocated 6.79 acre for the hotel. The aim is visitors coming to Mihan should get a proper facility to stay, as most would come there for business purposes. We’re in contact with reputed groups like Taj, Maurya and Radisson. Even Nagpur airport privatisation has hit a roadblock. We’ve now appointed Deloitte as an advisor to oversee the privatisation process. Since the issue is pending in the high court, I wouldn’t like to comment further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patanjali-reviving-plant-in-mihan-madc-md-deepak-kapoor/articleshow/84155638.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Lucknow||50 lakh get fully vaccinated in Uttar Pradesh, over 2.8 crore take first dose||LUCKNOW: With over 8.38 lakh vaccinations on Monday, a total of 50.09 lakh persons in Uttar Pradesh became fully vaccinated against the pandemic virus. Data from CoWin portal showed that over 3.35 crore doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been given in Uttar Pradesh. In terms of people, 2,84,51,525 have taken at least one dose, while 50,09,188 have taken both doses. In absolute terms, of the total people who came forward for vaccination in UP, 14.9% have taken both the doses. However, compared to the total target of vaccination for the state – about 14 crore – only 3.5% are fully vaccinated. UP is the fourth state in the country where more than 50 lakh persons have taken both the doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Comparison drawn by the Union ministry of health and family welfare indicated that Maharashtra leads the list with 69.85 lakh fully vaccinated population, followed by Gujarat and West Bengal where more than 60.8 lakh and 56.7 lakh people have taken both the doses respectively. UP’s nearest contender is Rajasthan where 43.84 lakh people are fully immunised. Karnataka stands close by with a fully vaccinated population of 42.18 lakh. The surge in vaccinations was attributed to the state-wide launch of the cluster model for Covid-19 vaccination drive which has made the task easy, equitable and seamless by eliminating crucial road blocks like transport and digital divide. As per the CoWin portal, 8.38 lakh jabs on Monday was the second highest in a single day given in the state. The maximum number of doses – 8.63 lakh -- were given on June 24 -- the day UP achieved its one crore jabs under Mission June six days before the deadline. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said: “The cluster model has been launched across the state and there is visible enthusiasm for vaccination now. However, the important thing to remember is that the vaccine doesn’t give the licence to ignore Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/50lakh-get-fully-vaccinated-in-up-over-2-8cr-take-first-dose/articleshow/84157778.cms||Shailvee Sharda

But the cybercrime sleuths busted their racket and arrested three men who had been committing the fraud since January this year. While two of the accused were arrested 10 days ago, the third one Jay Prakash Shukla was remanded to two days of police custody by a local court on Monday. The police said that Rakesh Khankariya, a resident of Surat, was the mastermind of the racket. “The accused used to first get hold of mobile sim cards whose services were out of order. They used to find out if any of these phone numbers were linked with loans of a private finance firm,” said Hardik Makadia, ACP (cybercrime). Rakesh used to get the list of closed mobile phone numbers from the second accused Bhargav Pambhar, who used to work in a mobile network company. The list of closed phone numbers was then given to the third accused Jay Prakash Shukla who used to work for a private finance firm. Shukla had stolen the username and password of an employee of that firm and used it to find out if the closed phone numbers were linked to any loan account. “They used to zero in on the phone numbers linked to the loan accounts and then reactivate these numbers with a different name. Shukla also used to give loan account details to Rakesh. Rakesh, who is the mastermind, then used to take loan in the name of those who used that number previously,” Makadia told TOI. Once the loan was approved, Rakesh used to directly buy expensive smartphones from the money and then sold off these phones online. “He had already sold about 15 phones and got Rs seven to Rs 8 lakh. The accused told us that they had planned to dupe people of Rs two crores,” Makadia added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cyber-fraud-racket-busted-three-nabbed/articleshow/84153749.cms||---
---||Chennai||No new public buildings in Tamil Nadu without toilets for disabled, says Madras HC||CHENNAI: No public buildings can be constructed in the state without providing access and toilet facilities to differently abled people, the Madras high court has ruled. “It is imperative that all public buildings, including court houses, must have access that may be used by persons with disabilities. Toilets must also be installed in public buildings which may be used by persons with disabilities,” the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said on Monday. The state is reminded that no new public buildings may be constructed or sanctioned or planned without providing access for persons with disabilities and ensuring toilets and other facilities for such persons, the court added. The official respondents, particularly the public works department and its officials, should be acquainted with the governing statute and the national building code, the court said. This is to ensure that the mandatory instructions therein are adhered to without any exception, it said. The court made the observations while hearing a PIL moved by M Karpagam seeking to implement the provisions of the Persons with disabilities (PWD) (equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation) Act in the state. When the plea came up for hearing, P Muthukumar, counsel for the state government, submitted a report on behalf of the state. Recording the same, the bench said that the report did not indicate whether the public buildings across the state can be accessed by persons with disabilities. “Since the status report now filed does not indicate the measures taken or the number of buildings where access for persons with disabilities have been provided, let the matter stand over for two months for a more detailed report to be filed when it appears next,” the judges added, and adjourned the next hearing in the matter to September 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-new-public-bldgs-in-tn-without-toilets-for-disabled-says-hc/articleshow/84155677.cms||---

The arrests were made on the basis of a complaint filed by the village head. The woman, who was living with her maternal uncle after the death of parents, met the youth, Tasleem Arif, in Vadodara a few years ago. Arif used to work in a factory there. On Sunday, they reached Pilibhit’s Kajri Niranjanpur village. As the preparations for the wedding were on, a police team reached the village. The woman, the youth and three clerics were taken to Sehramau North police station of Pilibhit. Soon, the four men were booked for kidnapping, even as local police admitted that the woman had come to the village on her own and wanted to get married. They were booked under IPC sections 366 (abducting woman to compel her marriage), 368 (wrongfully concealing and or keeping in confinement) along with the sections 3 and 5 of the UP’s Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020. All the accused have been arrested. Local police said that the woman’s maternal uncle will soon come to Pilibhit to take her home. The complaint was filed by Yadvinder Singh, the village pradhan. Apart from the youth, the three arrested clerics were identified as Aqib, Maulana Rahish and Syed Tareef. Pilibhit’s superintendent of police (SP) Kirit Kumar Rathod said, “The girl is an adult. But we found violation of law here which is why an FIR has been registered under relevant sections. The woman will be produced before a magistrate court tomorrow where she will give her statement. The accused have not been sent to jail and further action will be taken on the basis of the woman's statement in the court."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/gujarat-woman-flees-to-marry-a-muslim-youth-in-up-cops-book-her-lover-under-anti-conversion-law/articleshow/84148993.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad & Jalna: 5,000 hectare forest land encroached upon||AURANGABAD: Close to 5,000 hectare of forest land is currently under encroachment in Aurangabad and Jalna districts. Officials said efforts are being made to reclaim the forest land. In the Marathwada region, only 4.5% of the total geographical area is forested. Moreover, this area faces water scarcity and inadequate rainfall. In Aurangabad district, about 92,852 hectare is under forest land and in Jalna it is 9,996 hectare. As per the figures obtained, forest land accounts for over 1,600 hectare in Aurangabad taluka, 563 hectare in Khultabad taluka, 190 hectare in Soyegaon, 338 hectare in Sillod, 118 hectare in Ajanta, about 500 hectare in Vaijapur, 540 hectare in Kannad, 207 hectare in Nagad, 614 hectare in Jalna (north) and 82 hectare in Jalna (south). Authorities maintained that serious efforts are being to reclaim the lands, which, in most cases, are under litigation due to claims made by some local residents, villagers and even tribals. Assistant conservator of forest Arun Patil told TOI that only people able to prove that they have been tilling a particular section of the forest land for at least three generations or 75 years, have valid and legitimate claims. “The tribal claiming ownership of the forest land need to have some evidence in the form of offence registered against their predecessors or some receipt from forest department etc.” he said Patil added that recently, about 500 hectare of forest land around Kannad, Vaijapur were reclaimed by turning down petitions and claims made on these lands. Aurangabad district has a total forest area of 5.61%, while Jalna has about 1.4% of land under forestation. Senior forest official confirmed that at some of the locations, people have not only encroached the land but have also constructed pucca houses, making it further difficult to reclaim the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-jalna-5000ha-forest-land-encroached-upon/articleshow/84151431.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The long overdue Union cabinet reshuffle is likely to take place on July 7 or July 8. According to highly placed sources, the rejig in Yogi cabinet would be need-based and take care of those who fail to get berths in the expansion at the Centre. The idea is to ensure proper representation of all key castes which would have a strong say during the state elections next year.

At present, in the 52-member Union ministry, there are 10 members from the state. At least 20-22 new ministers are likely to be inducted in the rejig. According to sources, among new ministers to be inducted from UP, there could be a Brahmin face. The party think tank believes that they need to be kept in good humour in the run-up to the Assembly elections. According to sources, prominent faces in the race are 73-year-old Kanpur MP Satyadev Pachauri, 71-year-old MP from Prayagraj Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Basti MP Harish Dwivedi (47).

Political circles have been thick with buzz about speculationSimilarly, in its Dalit outreach, the Modi government may induct a Dalit MP from the state and Etawah MP Prof Ram Shanker Katheria (56) is said to be the top contender. He was the Union minister of state for human resource in the first Modi government until 2016. Katheria is also the former chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. BJP national secretary and Kaushambi MP Vinod Kumar Sonker (51) and Mohanlalganj MP Kaushal Kishore (61), who is also the state president of BJP’s Scheduled Caste Morcha, are also in the race for ministerial berth. A member from Pal community may also get representation in the Modi cabinet and the top contender is 61-year-old Agra MP Prof SP Singh Baghel, who is believed to have a strong vote base. He was vying for a ticket for his daughter from Tundla assembly seat during Vidhan Sabha bypolls. With Covid pandemic hitting the business community hard in the last one year, the central government might induct a Vaishya MP. Being the senior most parliamentarian from the community, 69-year-old Meerut MP Rajendra Agrawal is believed to be the frontrunner. Interestingly, Pravin Nishad, the BJP MP from Sant Kabir Nagar and son of NISHAD party chief Sanjay Nishad, is also believed to be in the race for a ministerial berth. However, if he fails to find a place in the central cabinet, his father Sanjay Nishad might be inducted in the Yogi Adityanath government.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: When basic training helped in saving lives at home||HYDERABAD: While it is no secret that first aid can be a life saver, some trained parents have been able to save their loved ones during the pandemic. In one case, a woman who had learnt the basic first aid (which includes management of high fever, serious wounds, responding to choking, cardiac arrest etc) was able to perform CPR (cardio pulmonary resuscitation) at home, when her husband collapsed. In other cases, the skill has been helpful for parents during the trying pandemic times, when getting a hospital consultation or bed was a challenge. “My 6-year-old son had developed high fever nearly a year ago. Since it was in the middle of the pandemic, I was not ready to take him to the hospital. I looked for some YouTube videos on this by doctors and was able to manage without panicking. I kept doing continuous sponge bath and waited for 2-3 hours to check the temperature. Without having known this, I would have checked every 15 minutes and rushed to a hospital in panic,” said Triveni Bonthu, a software engineer, who is now planning to attend a workshop for proper training. “Knowing basic first aid has been particularly helpful to me when by 36-month old baby was choking sometime back. I was with my mother and grandmother and both suggested that I give water to the child to clear out the piece of watermelon that was stuck but having been trained in first aid I knew the right thing to do is let the baby cough it out or put then in specific position and pat their back till the congestion is cleared,” said Shraddha Thakar, from the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/when-basic-training-helped-in-saving-lives-at-home/articleshow/84155685.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘A party banked on Muslim votes, but gave no zila panchayat seat’||LUCKNOW: All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaddudin Owaisi said on Monday that his party would give a new clarion call for the forthcoming UP elections as the party which sought Muslims’ votes in the recently concluded panchayat polls, couldn’t get a single candidate from the community elected as zila panchayat chief. Talking exclusively to TOI, Owaisi, in a veiled reference to the Samajwadi Party, said: "A political party sought votes of the Muslims to get its village pradhan and panchayat members elected but could not ensure the victory of a single Muslim candidate from any of the ‘safe seats’ in districts where its victory was assured. This is unfair." He said the fact that a state which has 19% Muslim population does not have a single district panchayat chairman from the community smacks of a well-planned strategy to reduce the community to second class citizen. “A particular political family had claimed that their members had won a majority of seats in Badaun, Kasganj, Mainpuri, Kannauj, Auraiya and Farrukhabad but they lost the district panchayat chairman polls in these district which are seen as their stronghold. This was surprising,” he said, adding "things have come to a point in UP that political parties with whom Muslims have traditionally sided during elections are too scared to even raise the issues of the community and AIMIM will certainly question them." Owaisi said that he would launch his party’s campaign for the UP elections by inaugurating an election office in Bahraich on Thursday and would visit the state once every fortnight to hold meetings with party leaders at regional level to finalize the strategy for elections. “I will inaugurate an election office in Bahraich and thereafter hold meetings with the party leaders to discuss the strategy for the elections. As of now, the plan is to visit UP at least once every fortnight to hold meetings with the district and regional leaders. This will continue all through the Monsoon session of parliament,” the AIMIM MP from Hyderabad said. On RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s statement that DNA of all Indians is the same irrespective of religion and him condemning lynching, Owaisi said people behind such acts may be ignorant about difference between a buffalo and a cow but Pehlu Khan, Junaid, Akhlaq and Aleemuddin were killed because they were identifiable by their names. “Cowardice, violence and murder are characteristics of Godse’s Hindutva mentality and lynching of Muslims is also a result of the same thought process,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/a-party-banked-on-muslim-votes-but-gave-no-zp-seat/articleshow/84157865.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The civic body has set a target of Rs 468.54 crore towards collection of property tax and Rs 108.57 crore from water tax. But much to the awe of the authorities, only Rs 27.79 crore from property taxes and Rs 6.70 crore in water tax have so far been collected by the AMC. It is a meagre 5.93% and 6.17% of the total tax collection target for property and water taxes, respectively. AMC deputy commissioner Aparna Thete told TOI, “With easing of Covid-19 restrictions, we have started getting property and water taxes. However, the payment needs to be scaled up to on war footing, to meet the target.” The officer, who heads the estate department of the civic body, said that as of now one team in each zone has been pressed to recover outstanding dues. “We are going to take all possible steps, including multiplying the number of recovery squads in each zone, to ensure we meet the targets this year,” she said.

In her petition, Jeyarani, a daily wage labourer, who sough compensation from the government, said her son Pandithurai,12, was studying Class VII in a government school at Uppathur near Sattur in Virudhunagar district. On November 9, 2018, when Pandithurai was playing along with his friends after returning from school, he sustained 50% burn injuries due to an explosion. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that the court can take judicial notice of the fact that frequent accidents due to explosions from illegal firecracker units take place in Virudhunagar district. On all such occasions, the government pays some compensation. “There is always an excitement when such incidents happen and ultimately, everybody forgets about it till the next incident takes place. We are living in an era where short memory is the order of the day. Virudhunagar district is no exception to this norm and every time a huge fire accident takes place in an illegal firecracker unit, compensation is paid to the deceased and injured and thereafter, everybody forgets it,” observed the judge. “It is brought to the notice of this court that the boy is virtually in a vegetative state and unless plastic surgery is performed, it will be a horrifying sight for the parent to keep watching a child with burn injuries all over the body,” observed the judge. The judge observed that the tahsildar and district collector after assessing the situation, found that there was genuineness in the petitioner’s claim and recommended for payment of compensation from the chief minister’s public relief fund (CMPRF). However, the chief secretary went by the literal words that are used under the scheme and found that the claim does not strictly fall within the parameters. The petitioner is very poor and she will not be able to sustain the medical treatment, unless the government comes to her rescue, observed the judge and directed the government to pay the compensation from the CMPRF within six weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-relief-to-boy-injured-in-cracker-explosion/articleshow/84155744.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM seeks report on ward officer who ‘sought bribes’||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed the state Urban Development (UD) to seek a report from the BMC on charges of corruption and irregularities against a civic ward officer in clearing eligibility of tenants in a Slum Redevelopment Authority (SRA) scheme . The CM’s direction came on a letter sent by state Congress chief Nana Patole to the chief minister. Patole’s letter was based on a complaint against Vibhas Achrekar, of BMC’s S ward filed by Congress office-bearer Rakesh Shetty who alleged that Achrekar was demanding bribes to clear eligibility of slum dwellers for the rehabilitation scheme in Bhandup. Patole asked the CM to probe irregularities pointed out by Shetty. Achrekar however refuted the allegations, claiming they were baseless. He said that Shetty was a “professional complainant” and had failed to complete a slum redevelopment project in the area for many years. Achrekar said he had already submitted a report on the issue to the higher authorities. Patole’s letter came days after he urged Thackeray and industries minister Subhash Desai to stay and probe the tender allotted by state-owned Maharashtra State Mining Corporation to a company for supply of coal, alleging malpractice. “The complainant is unnecessarily harassing me to compel me to make 15 non-eligible structures eligible in his SRA scheme. The scheme has not progressed since 2009. Since there was no progress for 11 years, it was proposed to close the scheme. Neither is the BMC plot being developed nor are slumdwellers getting new homes. The eligibility revision is not in my hands. The developer should apply to the first appellate authority — the additional collector (encroachment). But instead of doing that Shetty is pressuring me by maligning my image. A report in this regard has already been submitted to the higher-ups,” Achrekar said. In his complaint against Achrekar, Shetty alleged that Achrekar was demanding a bribe to clear lists of eligible tenants. “Achrekar pointed out that they [developers] would have to shell out Rs 25,000 per tenant to get the clearance done. There are 84 tenants in the scheme…. Achrekar demanded Rs 10 lakh for completing the work,” Shetty said in his complaint to Patole, pleading for immediate transfer and suspension of officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-seeks-report-on-ward-officer-who-sought-bribes/articleshow/84155836.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The counsels for the petitioner, Paavanasam, father of the deceased P Muthu Mano, 27, submitted that despite the case being transferred to CB-CID, the investigation was not being done in a proper manner. The counsels also submitted that the investigation was not completed within the timeframe which has been stipulated under provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. However, the senior counsel appearing for the state submitted that the investigation is being done with seriousness and is monitored by the senior officers. He also sought the petitioner and others to cooperate with the investigation for obtaining statements. Taking note of the submissions, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi gave the direction to the state government. The judges also directed the counsels for the petitioner also to file an affidavit with regard to their grievances pertaining to the investigation.

---||Allahabad||ZP polls: Petition filed against Poonam Maurya’s election||Times News Network Varanasi: Unopposed election of Bharatiya Janata Party’s zila panchayat chairman Poonam Maurya has been challenged by Samajwadi Party’s Chanda Yadav by filing a petition before the court of district judge Om Prakash Tripathi on Monday. Accepting the petition district judge ordered for serving notices to the UP government, district magistrate/district election officer and Maurya by fixing August 6 as next date of hearing in this case. SP candidates lawyer Abhay Nath Yadav said that the district election officer rejected the nomination of Chanda Yadav on the ground of non-renewal of authorisation of notary lawyer, who issued affidavit for her. This ground was opted for rejecting the nomination despite the fact that there is no rule in UP zila panchayat act in this regard, he said. It is also mentioned that fee for renewal of authorisation of notary lawyer had already been sent to the state government through the district judge, he said adding that it is sufficient to clear that renewal application had not been rejected. As rule 10(4) of UP zila panchayat Act states that no nomination can be rejected on technical ground, the ground taken by district election officer for rejecting Chanda Yadav’s papers are insufficient. Yadav said that accepting the petition the district judge court asked to serve the notices to UP government, district election officer and Maurya through special messenger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/zp-polls-petition-filed-against-poonam-mauryas-election/articleshow/84153828.cms||---

The court, which was was hearing a public interest litigation filed by K R Raja from Madurai district, asked the petitioner to focus on the aspect as to whether there has been any denial of admission and to pursue it in that angle. The petitioner had also sought for a direction to take action on the government, aided and private schools which have failed to admit students with disabilities under RTE Act and those which have failed to provide friendly campus for such children as per Section 16 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi said that the petitioner through RTI, has come to know that in several districts, the number of students with disabilities in private schools is very low and in most cases it is nil. From the documents placed before the court by the petitioner, it shows that applications were not received from the differently abled children for admission. The judges observed that though they appreciate the cause and the concern shown by the petitioner, they are unable to infer from the statistics provided in the petition that the schools are refusing to admit students with disabilities. The judges took note of the state’s submission that applications received from children who are orphans, affected with HIV, transgender, children of sanitary workers, children with disabilities are given admission first before starting random selection under RTE Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-to-ensure-kids-with-disabilities-admitted-under-rte/articleshow/84155755.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Legal issues are being created to delay things. However, the chief minister will not get entangled in the issues,” Reghupathy said while replying to a question on their release after inspecting the Madurai Central Prison on Monday. The state government is committed to improve facilities in Madurai Central Prison as chief minister M K Stalin is very particular about the welfare of the prisoners, the minister said. Reghupathy, who inspected the Madurai Central Prison along with finance minister P T R Palinivel Thiagarajan, said that 1,562 prisoners are lodged in the prison of which more than 1,000 out are on remand. He said that they heard the grievances of prisoners and received petitions from them. They sought to improve the facilities of the prison since the buildings except the administration block and the women’s prison on the premises were constructed during the British era. They also sought to improve medical facilities. He blamed the previous government for not improving facilities in the last 10 years. The minister said that most buildings require new construction, however since demolishing them and constructing new ones will be more expensive, the government will explore the possibility of identifying a suitable land and construct some required facilities there. “Many prisoners sought remission. It will be taken to the knowledge of the chief minister to give remission to applicable prisoners. The chief minister is very concerned about the welfare of the prisoners,” Reghupathy said. Ravichandran, a convict in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who has sought parole has been advised to send a petition through his mother to the state government for the chief minister to take a call on it. Law officers for district and other courts will be appointed soon based on the applications received by the respective collectors, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cm-will-take-appropriate-decision-in-rajiv-case-convicts-release-min/articleshow/84155768.cms||---

District collector K V Muralidharan has ordered a probe into the incident as the infant was declared dead by the hospital staff when it was really alive. On Saturday, six months pregnant Fatima Mary, 30, wife of Pilavendra Raja of Thenkarai near Periyakulam, delivered a 700g female infant at the Theni government hospital after she started experiencing labour pains at 12.30am. As the child did not show any movements, the nurses took her for observation and later the infant was handed over to Raja’s sister Fatima Rani. They decided to bury the infant at the cemetery on the Theni - Periyakulam main road and took it there around 8am on Sunday. When they lifted the infant they noticed that the limbs were moving and rushed back to the Theni GH. Dean Dr R Balaji Nathan ordered an inquiry and directed the infant to be put on ventilator, with the initial findings showing that the baby had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). However, around afternoon, the hospital told the parents that the child had died. Pilavendra Raja, a driver by profession, said this was his third child. “Right from the time this infant was conceived we took three scans and the doctors told me that the growth was not keeping pace with the age of the foetus, but we decided that it was God’s gift and hoped for a miracle,” he said. “As per our custom, it is my maternal uncle who has to perform the last rites for my children in case of an unfortunate death. My uncle Yesudas, was elated when he rang me from the cemetery and told me that my little daughter was moving and blinking,” he said. Raja says that he was lucky to have seen his child open and close its eyes when she was brought to the hospital after the half-an-hour journey from the cemetery located about 25km away. “After coming here it was given good attention, but then she passed away. We have to believe in God’s actions,” he said. Collector Muralidharan has asked three heads of departments to conduct an inquiry and submit the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/still-born-infant-comes-to-life-at-the-cemetery-in-theni-dies-later-at-hospital/articleshow/84155802.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

The district will get a grant of Rs 100 crore under the project, which is expected to be completed in the next two-three years. The National Horticulture Board (NHB) under the agriculture ministry is the implementing agency for the project. NHB director (Maharashtra & Goa) Manik Patil said the project will boost the plantation of new varieties of grapes and help farmers get a good market. Moreover, cold chain facilities and logistic infrastructure will also get an upgrade. The project focuses on three major points — pre-production and value addition, post-production, and branding/marketing and logistic. Under pre-production, various issues like bringing good varieties of grapes, planting materials and tissue culture are to be implemented. While post-production activities will focus on building pack houses and cold storages for the grapes. This will help grape farmers store their produce for a some time and sell when they get good prices. The third major factor of the cluster project is branding, marketing and logistics. The government has already appointed an agency to prepare the blueprint for branding of the grapes and developing the logistics. Local MP Bharti Pawar said Nashik is known for producing large quantities of grapes and is the wine capital of the country. “It is a positive development,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dist-to-get-rs-100cr-to-boost-grape-productivity-marketing-logistics/articleshow/84151518.cms||Tushar Pawar

Mahal Streets have eight streets, of which streets 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 are in a bad shape. Manjanakara Street connecting Mahal Streets also requires attention. Residents say that streets 5 and 7 are comparatively in better shape. P S R Ganesan, a resident of Mahal 3rd street said, “The condition of the roads has worsened in the last few months. We approached various officials to set right the problem, but nothing improved on the ground. Commuters and pedestrians are affected a lot due to the present road condition.” S Vanaja, another resident, said that the potholes are filled with water whenever it rains. “While residents manage to manoeuvrer through the potholes since they are used to them, people new to the area will find it difficult. Water getting splashed by moving vehicles has been an issue faced by pedestrians for a long time,” she said. Residents have urged the Madurai Corporation to carry out patch works until the fresh roads are laid to provide temporary relief, since frequent spells of rain in the city is exacerbating the issue. They also urged the civic body to improve the storm water drainage system as it takes time for the water to drain whenever the city receives heavy rain. A corporation official said that required steps will be taken to address the issue soon. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/residents-of-mahal-streets-complain-of-broken-roads/articleshow/84155782.cms||---

Nimish Shah, who lived near Navdi Ovara, consumed poisonous liquid in the afternoon and died immediately. Police said that Shah was mentally broken since he lost his job and would often hallucinate that he was suffering from Covid-19. “Firstly, he lost the job and was not able to find work and due to ongoing pandemic, he would feel that he contracted the virus,” said a police official. Shah had called ambulance twice and tried getting himself admitted at New Civil Hospital but was sent home both times as his report turned out to be Covdi-19 negative. The deceased had written notes five times and tried hanging himself from the ceiling fan but had failed. On Sunday, he wrote another note and consumed the liquid. Police said that he mentioned his unemployment in the note and was not able to take the dwindling economic crisis at his home. Shah’s mother Mala works as domestic help, but her income was not enough. Before the lockdown he worked at a jewellery shop, but he was removed and he could not find a suitable job later. “The mother-son duo were the only residents in their house. The deceased has a sister, but she lives in Rajasthan,” a police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/covid-hit-jobless-man-commits-suicide/articleshow/84153855.cms||---
---||Goa||Dy collector reaffirms river navigation dept’s ownership of Dona Paula plot||Panaji: A 43-year-long legal battle for ownership and possession of prime land at Dona Paula may be near its end after the deputy collector (Tiswadi), Panaji, on June 24 dismissed the Goa Yachting Association’s claim over the plot at Dona Paula jetty. While dismissing the association’s claim, the deputy collector and sub-divisional officer for Panaji, Gurudas Desai, observed that the river navigation department (RND) was adjudged the rightful owner of the plot in 1989. “The order is already passed by the deputy collector, confirming the title of the government vide order dated September 22, 1989. In view of the aforesaid order, this court do not have any jurisdiction to decide on the matter. Hence the application... stands dismissed/rejected,” Desai said. The saga, which dates back to 1974, has seen the government drag its feet in recovering its own slice of land, which could have earned it revenue. Official documents show that revenue department and RND officials sat over the case for several years while the Goa Yachting Association continued to retain possession of the premises and earn revenue from a bar and restaurant that is operating from the plot. In 1974, “some land” at Dona Paula was offered to the Goa Yachting Association, which was an unregistered body back then. In 1989 when the ownership of the plot was challenged, the deputy collector’s office confirmed that the land belonged to RND. Goa Yachting Association in 1994 challenged the order before the administrative tribunal, which upheld the deputy collector’s order. In November 1995, the Captain of Ports directed the association to vacate the premises within 15 days, but the order was stayed by then revenue minister Wilfred Mesquita. Since then, despite being the rightful owner of the land, neither the RND nor the revenue department made serious efforts to recover the land. In 2018, when the case was brought to then revenue minister Rohan Khaunte, he chose to put the ball back in the deputy collector’s court asking for the revision of the order and for the case to be disposed of within six months. It is pertinent to see that the Goa Yachting Association did not approach the high court of Bombay at Goa to challenge the deputy collector’s order or the administrative tribunal’s judgment. TIMES VIEW: The government needs to shed its lethargic view towards land grab, especially when attempts are made to usurp the government's own land. We only hear rhetoric from every government on how they passionately try to protect government property. In this case, the revenue department and the River Navigation Department have clearly dragged their feet instead of ensuring that the prime land was reverted to the government as quickly as possible. It is high time, the government takes special efforts to protect government land across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dy-collector-reaffirms-river-navigation-depts-ownership-of-dona-paula-plot/articleshow/84156059.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Workers initiated cleaning measures and sanitation drives on their premises on Sunday itself. While large numbers were seen visiting the temples in the south, the footfall was not as expected in the central region, mainly due to fear among the people against venturing out. Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) department officials said that all the entrances of major temples were equipped with thermal scanners and sanitisers. Devotees without facemasks were sent back by the security personnel. The Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam displayed time charts mentioning four slots (6.30am to 8pm with intervals for puja) for the devotees to worship. Although the temples opened their gates by 6am, only locals residing nearby visited the shrines, a HR&CE department official said. “Our temple did not even have half the footfall we usually receive. We usually have about 2,000 devotees on Mondays, but only around 700 came on the first day,” said Se Mariappan, assistant commissioner, Trichy Thiruvanaikoil Jambukeswarar temple. “I have been waiting for this day as I am used to going to the temple every week,” said K Barathi, 60, of K K Nagar, who had come to the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple on Monday.The Sri Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameswaram, Andal temple in Srivilliputtur and Alagarkoil witnessed large crowds. “I had made a vow to tonsure my head in Alagarkoil, but as we were not allowed to bathe in the temple spring, I had to postpone the move,” said T Saravanan, who visited the Alagarkoil temple in Madurai.The Rameswaram temple saw locals and tourists from other districts standing in the queue as early as 4.30am. In the Palani Dandayudhapani temple, rope car services did not resume and people had to walk up the hill to the temple. The temple administration had earlier asked the devotees to register online for darshan to make it easier to regulate the crowds.Meanwhile, the Madurai Matuthavani flower market saw good crowds as the temples opened. Similarly, eateries that opened for dine-in also saw a poor response. A majority of those who opted for dine-in were bachelors and frontline workers. “The demand was disappointing since the morning.

In a circular by the chief secretary, the government fixed the responsibilities of curbing illegal mining in forest area on the respective department. The forest officials of respective areas will be accountable if cases of illegal mining are noticed in the forest land. Similarly, in non-forest areas, it will be the duty of the mining department to undertake anti-illegal mining activities. If instances of illegal mining are reported, the mining department officials of the area concerned will represent the case in the court. On revenue land, the patwaris will be responsible to check illegal mining on khatedari land. The onus will be on the patwari to bring the case to the notice of the tehsildar who can then withdraw the title of the land. If any land falling under the industry category or RIICO or UIT and if any illegal mining is noticed, the respective state departments or agencies will be responsible. They will have to file police complaints against the illegal activities. At the state and district levels, separate dedicated teams will be set up to work in coordination with other departments, the circular stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-fixes-responsibilities-to-curb-illegal-mining/articleshow/84155834.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: From employees to kingpins of fake call centres||LUDHIANA: The kingpins of the fake call centres—which duped foreign nationals and were busted last week in Ludhiana and Mohali—were earlier agents of a man who ran a similar centre near Cheema Chowk in 2018. After learning the techniques from there, the accused started their own con job. Besides, the police have also started the process to freeze bitcoins they purchased with the swindled money. Additional deputy commissioner of police Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “It was found during investigation that a person, whose name cannot be disclosed yet, was running a similar fraud call centre from Ludhiana’a Cheema Chowk in 2018. He was also from Gujarat. The now-arrested accused—Dhruv, Peenak, Pratik and Yatin—were working as his agents. Along with him, they would call up the foreign nationals and dupe them. With the imposition of the lockdown, that call centre stopped operating. Since then, these accused were not in touch with that man. Thereafter, they formed their own group and started a similar call centre.” The accused ran the fake call centre from different parts of Ludhiana like Cheema Chowk, vegetable market, Shekhewal and Pakhowal Road. “They would look for buildings with multiple offices, so that they did not come to notice. Also, their preference was to get a workplace near a telecommunication office,” she added. Their Pakhowal Road call centre was busted on June 30. Bhatti said, “We will try to trace that man also as he could be running another such call centre. Accused Yatin, Pratik and Peenak had purchased bitcoins worth Rs 50 lakh with the cheated money. We have started the process to freeze these. Also, the bank accounts of all the accused, which have Rs 39 lakh, will be frozen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/from-employees-to-kingpins-of-fake-call-centres/articleshow/84153841.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Collective interest’ trumps Stan Swamy’s plea, said judge||MUMBAI: Tribal rights activist Stan Swamy, picked up from his Ranchi home last October, was the last of the arrests in the three-and-half-year-old Elgar Parishad case. The oldest of the 16-odd accused, his plea has remained one of innocence; he had fought for his liberty on grounds of ill-health. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) which arrested him a day before he was chargesheeted, opposed his bail applications claiming that the investigation “established’’ him to be a “member of CPI (Maoist) and actively involved in its activities’’ and also “in contact with some of the conspirators...for furtherance of its activities.’’ In its March 22 order, the special NIA court Judge D E Kothalikar, rejecting his plea for bail on merit, said he is accused of belonging to a “terrorist organisation” and conspiring to overpower the government, politically and by using muscle power. The court had said the “collective interest of the community” would outweigh the right of personal liberty and Swamy’s old age or alleged sickness would not go in his favour. Judge Kothalikar said from documents produced by NIA, it could be gathered that Swamy and other members of the banned CPI (Maoist) had hatched a conspiracy to fuel unrest and overpower the government. Swamy was carrying out activities to further the objectives of the organisation which was nothing but to overthrow “the democracy of the nation”, the court held. The court order also said, “…if seriousness of allegations made against the applicant are considered in proper perspective…there will be no hesitation to conclude that collective interest of the community would outweigh the right of personal liberty of the applicant and as such the old age and or alleged sickness, of the applicant would not go in his favour,” the court said. Fr Swamy’s contention was that mere allegations of being a Maoist does not call for continued custody. He had also pleaded that he was not present in Pune at the time of the Elgar Parishad on December 31, 2017, neither was he named in the January 8, 2018 FIR filed by the Pune police. The main thrust of his defence was on “admissibility of the documents”, that NIA was relying on “hearsay” evidence to connect him. His case was that nothing was seized from him and he was “not involved in any anti-national activitiy’’ and also that there is nothing produced by prosecution to show that the Koregaon-Bhima incident had “any nexus with Elgar Parishad at Shaniwarwada, Pune.” The NIA also pointed to “exchange” of around 140 emails between Fr Swamy and co-accused, and the fact that Swamy, co-accused Sudha Bhardwaj and other members of the Persecuted Political Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC) had condemned the conviction of professor G N Saibaba and others under UAPA for Maoist links. His case was that the letters cited by the prosecution “do not establish that they were actually sent’’ and their authorship was uncertain. Swamy was helping tribals and ‘moolvasis’, had founded a body named Bagaicha, and had written and researched extensively on issues of caste, religion, land rights and people’s struggles, said his petitions. His plea was that the role of PPSC is to provide legal aid and that is no offence. But the NIA claimed he was a “staunch supporter of the activities of organisations like Visthapan Virodhi Jan Vikas Andolan…frontal organisation of CPI (Maoist).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-collective-interest-trumps-swamys-plea-said-judge/articleshow/84158002.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Madurai||Tiruchirappalli: Mixed response by devotees as temples open after 71 days||MADURAI/TRICHY: Seventy-one days after religious places of worship were shut down as part of intensive lockdown measures announced by the state government to contain Covid-19, temple doors in southern and central districts opened to the public on Monday. Workers initiated cleaning measures and sanitation drives on their premises on Sunday itself. While large numbers were seen visiting the temples in the south, the footfall was not as expected in the central region, mainly due to fear among the people against venturing out. Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) department officials said that all the entrances of major temples were equipped with thermal scanners and sanitisers. Devotees without facemasks were sent back by the security personnel. The Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam displayed time charts mentioning four slots (6.30am to 8pm with intervals for puja) for the devotees to worship. Although the temples opened their gates by 6am, only locals residing nearby visited the shrines, a HR&CE department official said. “Our temple did not even have half the footfall we usually receive. We usually have about 2,000 devotees on Mondays, but only around 700 came on the first day,” said Se Mariappan, assistant commissioner, Trichy Thiruvanaikoil Jambukeswarar temple. “I have been waiting for this day as I am used to going to the temple every week,” said K Barathi, 60, of K K Nagar, who had come to the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple on Monday. The Sri Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameswaram, Andal temple in Srivilliputtur and Alagarkoil witnessed large crowds. “I had made a vow to tonsure my head in Alagarkoil, but as we were not allowed to bathe in the temple spring, I had to postpone the move,” said T Saravanan, who visited the Alagarkoil temple in Madurai. The Rameswaram temple saw locals and tourists from other districts standing in the queue as early as 4.30am. In the Palani Dandayudhapani temple, rope car services did not resume and people had to walk up the hill to the temple. The temple administration had earlier asked the devotees to register online for darshan to make it easier to regulate the crowds. Meanwhile, the Madurai Matuthavani flower market saw good crowds as the temples opened. Similarly, eateries that opened for dine-in also saw a poor response. A majority of those who opted for dine-in were bachelors and frontline workers. “The demand was disappointing since the morning. For us, rail users are mostly the customers. Only when rail services resume, we can expect the business to pick up,” said P Gowri Shankar, proprietor of Sri Saraswathi Café near Trichy railway junction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mixed-response-by-devotees-as-temples-open-after-71-days/articleshow/84155822.cms||---
---||Shimla||Don’t crowd Manali, locals tell tourists||MANALI: Photos of crowds of tourists in Manali have caused concern across the country and social media is flooded with warnings of a third Covid wave. While some of the photos being circulated are old, some are not. Although members of Manali Hoteliers Association said 50% rooms in most of the hotels were empty, a social media user quipped, “earlier rooms were not available in hospitals and now rooms are not available in Manali hotels.” Mall Road area, the hotspot of Manali town, is a small space in the town centre where tourists throng in the evening to relax and do shopping. Even with 3,000 tourists, there is hardly any space as people jostle around. Social distancing becomes impossible in such a situation, however, police do ensure that tourists wear masks. Twitterati are expressing their anger at people visiting Manali saying that the rush can precipitate a third wave. Nimish Joshi tweeted, “#3rdWave - Corona loves the way humans forget the lessons from past experiences. #Manali.” March To May: Remdesivir - not available, Oxygen cylinders - not available, Hospital beds - not available. June/July: #Shimla - Sold out!, #Mussoorie- Sold out!, #Manali - Sold out! Manali #COVID19 #COVID19Pandemic, tweeted Nishant Gulati. Sharing the latest photo from Mall Road area of Manali, Rickey Bordoloi tweeted: In search of peace, many people will rest in peace. If the 3rd wave arrives and causes havoc then special thanks to these people. Covid appropriate behaviour wasn't followed because of which 2nd wave striked. #Manali #CovidIndia. Twitterati from abroad have also joined in warning people against the rush to the mountains. After the state government ordered SPs and DCs to check tourist crowd in their respective districts, Kullu administration asked police to keep a check on crowding. However, physical distancing on the small mall road of the town seems to be impossible. Meanwhile, Atal Tunnel set a new record of vehicular movement with 7,384 vehicles entering and exiting the tunnel from 8am on Sunday to 8am on Monday. Lahaul-Spiti SP Manav Verma said 3,590 vehicles entered the tunnel from its south portal while 3,794 exited the tunnel in 24 hours. “Over 95% of the vehicles were tourist vehicles. The number is expected to increase in coming days. The highest number of vehicles that had used the tunnel in 24 hours last weekend was 7,276 ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/netizens-warn-tourists-against-crowding-in-manali/articleshow/84163490.cms||---

Petrol on Monday was being sold at at Rs 106.35 per litre as against Rs 106.01 on Sunday. The cost of diesel remained constant at Rs 95.85 per litre. Since June 1, the price of petrol has increased by Rs 5.40 per litre while that of diesel has gone up by Rs 4.36 per litre. According to Nashik Transporters’ Association, the constant rise in diesel prices has affected their business. “We have annual contracts and the rates are decided at the time of contract in the beginning of the new financial year,” Subhash Jangda, an office-bearer of the Nashik Transporters’ Association, said. “The increase is marginal, but the fuel prices have been increasing constantly. The government needs to reduce fuel prices and ensure that it will not increase continuously,” he added. “There has been a huge rise in diesel prices during the last eight months. Earlier, I would spend Rs 40 lakh on transporting goods through trucks on the Nashik-Delhi route. Now, I need to spend around Rs 45 lakh on the same route,” said a transporter. Nivrutti Nyaharkar, a farmer, said farmers resort to tractor-mounted equipment for farming activities. “The rates for ploughing and other farming activities through tractors have increased by over 30% during the past one year due to continuous rise in diesel prices,” he said. “There has already been a rise in prices of seeds and fertilizers. Now, the rising price of diesel has become a major concern for us. We want the government to either reduce the prices or provide diesel to farmers at subsidized rates,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/slight-rise-in-petrol-price-in-nashik-city/articleshow/84151600.cms||---

According to the guidelines, the maximum screen time per day for kindergarten/ preschool students has been limited to 45 minutes. For classes 1 to 5, schools can conduct two sessions-- 1.5 hours per day, for not more than 5 days in a week. For class 6 to class 8, screen time has been limited to 2 hours and for class 9 to class 12, classes will be be limited to a maximum of 3 hours per day. “All the head of departments, regional joint directors of school education, Hyderabad and Warangal, all the district education officers in the state are hereby directed to take necessary action,” read proceedings released by the office of A Sridevesana, director, school education. Last year in August, the state released similar instructions before the commencement of digital classes. However, not many schools followed the guidelines as most of them conducted classes for up to seven hours. “There is no point of releasing such guidelines time and again without verifying if they are implemented. Schools are conducting classes for seven to eight hours and officials are least bothered to initiate action against erring managements,” said K Venkata Sainath of Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA). The state had also released guidelines with respect to digital classes. It said that the bridge course programme for class 3 to class10 will continue until July 31 to mitigate the learning gap among students due to the closure of schools for a long time. The state asked 50% of government teachers to attend schools daily and ensure that all students are attending digital classes, distribute textbooks, worksheets and carry out other works. They were also asked to verify if students have smartphone or television attend online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/follow-centres-guidelines-for-online-classes-schools-told/articleshow/84155911.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Under this programme, which was started a couple of weeks ago, the criminals on police record are called and sensitized about the benefits of leaving illegal activities. Once the criminals concerned give in writing that they would not indulge in any illegal activity and would be ready for any action by the police if they are found in illegal activities, the police will not take preventive action against them. Commissioner of police Deepak Pandey said during the past few programmes conducted at various police stations over 200 criminals have given us bond of good behaviour. “If their conduct is good over the next few months their names would also be removed from the police record,” he said. Meanwhile, in the recent programme that was held at Bhadrakali police station, police also gave jobs like security guards and ambulance drivers to seven such criminals. “While we are taking strict action against criminals, we are also offering an opportunity to many of them to improve their conduct so that they their presence is not a nuisance for the society,” Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/over-200-criminals-give-bonds-of-good-behaviour-to-police/articleshow/84153890.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Nashik||Jalna: Sacked contract health workers protest in front of minister’s house, booked||AURANGABAD: The Jalna police have booked about 150 contractual health workers who gathered outside the state health minister’s house and demanded to be reinstated to service. The health workers, wearing their respective uniforms including aprons, reached the minister’s bungalow located in the Rishi Park area and started shouting slogans. They said their services should be regularised and they should be absorbed to fill about 16,000 vacant posts across the state. Soon, the police teams rushed to the spot to ensure that there is no law and order situation. As the protest went on for about two hours, the police tried to disperse the crowd. This led to a heated argument between the police and the agitators. After the agitators were assured that their grievances would be conveyed to the minister, they complied. Subsequently, the Jalna police registering an offence against the agitators for violation of social distancing and other Covid-19 related norms, apart from holding a protest without prior permission from the police. Police officials justified the action saying that like in other districts in the state, the Jalna administration too has imposed restrictions on all social, political or religious gatherings beyond the permissible limit. Also, prior police permission is mandatory. The health workers, who were hired to serve during the peak period of the two Covid-19 waves, were sacked on July 1. The move did not go down well with the workers. They had expected that they would be hired and their services would be regularized during the recruitment drive that the state government is planning to carry out. On June 30, district collector Ravindra Binwade, citing communication from the public health department, cut short the services of the contractual workers hired and posted at all the DCH and DCHC across the district. Those who have been sacked in the Jalna district include 113 doctors apart from a few hundred nurses and Class IV employees. As per the contract of these health workers, their contractual services were to last till September 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/sacked-contract-health-workers-protest-in-front-of-mins-house-booked/articleshow/84153897.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The elections would be held on July 19, as per officials from the collectorate. Against the declaration by Congress state president Nana Patole that they would like to go alone in the polls, the grand old party has forged an alliance with its former ally NCP. On other hand, the saffron alliance between BJP and Shiv Sena is broken, with both parties contesting the elections independently. All the major parties have renominated their winning candidates, barring a couple of exceptions. There are also signs of rebellion in the Congress, the NCP and the BJP. Shiv Sena, however, has decided to contest in 12 circles. For 16 ZP seats, the Congress and BJP each have one new face each. Former leader of opposition from BJP Anil Nidhan withdrew his candidature while Congress rejected incumbent Jyoti Raut’s claim. In the last election, Nidhan had won from Gumthala circle and later became the BJP's group leader. His withdrawal is a blow to BJP. Discussions have also started that he withdrew due to fears of internal politics. In his place, BJP has fielded Yogesh Daf, who is said to be close to former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. Kunda Raut has been nominated to replace former Congress member Jyoti Raut from Godhani Railway Circle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-parties-bank-on-winning-candidates-in-zp-repolls/articleshow/84155526.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Delhi||After dust, power plants top source of air pollution in Delhi in summers: Study||NEW DELHI: After dust (52.5%), power plants are the biggest contributor to Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration during summers, a new study led by the department of civil engineering at IIT Kanpur has found. Among organic aerosols found in the city’s air during the summers, solid fuel combustion has emerged as the biggest contributor (16.2%), followed by traffic (12.3%) and cooking (7.3%), it reveals. Track the pollution level in your citySachchida N Tripathi, head of the civil engineering department at IIT Kanpur, who carried out the study, said real-time source apportionment was done in June and July of 2019 to focus on the variation in summer pollution as compared to winter pollution. Concentration of sulfates and organic aerosols increases considerably during the summers as compared to high chlorine and nitrate composition in the winters, he added. “After dust, power plants were found to be the second biggest contributor. While dust is a known factor in the summers, high sulphur in the air, which reacts with the heat to release sulfates, was found to be a key component too,” said Tripathi. “Through this study, one can tell which is the biggest contributor in terms of pollution and action can then be directed towards that problem.” A technology was set up at IIT Delhi for the study in which IIT Jodhpur, Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad, Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry, Switzerland and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also took part. Tripathi said the contribution to pollution from cooking came as a surprise. “Past studies have not been able to capture cooking as a source and that allows greater concentration in that regard,” the IIT Kanpur professor added. The study also found a higher percentage composition of primary organic aerosols during the summer months. “The difference between the percentage composition of primary organic aerosols (traffic, biomass burning and cooking) and secondary organic aerosols was 28.4% as compared to only 4% in winter indicating the dominance of secondary sources in summer,” it stated. Tripathi says the real-time source apportionment has helped them identify the change in the sources of industrial waste burning and solid-fuel combustion in the region, which changes from south-east in winter to south-west in the summer months. “This is primarily due to the change in wind pattern and meteorological conditions. Due to this, power plants in the vicinity are playing a key role and bringing pollutants to Delhi,” he added. The Delhi government had recently filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking closure of the ten thermal power plants situated in the neighbouring states that have been using old/outdated polluting technology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-dust-power-plants-top-source-of-air-pollution-in-summers-study/articleshow/84156085.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

According to the managements, a majority of these schools are facing a dry spell and at least 3,000 to 4,000 schools have not even started online classes or engaged the services of a single teacher. “Before Covid-19, we used to get at least 50 to 60 admissions each for nursery and kindergarten and several new admissions for class 1 and class 2. The same was the case with other classes, up to class 6. But this year, even if we consider all classes, there are not even 50 new admissions,” said M Sridhar, correspondent, Sri Chaitanya Public School, Jagtial. He said he is unable to generate even Rs 75,000 to pay towards annual rent of the premises. The fact that many students and their parents, especially in rural and remote areas, are not interested in online classes or paying the fees, has only made matters worse. “During the 2019-20 academic year, we had more than 200 students but not many paid the fees. Now we have about Rs 10 lakh in debt from then. Last year, the situation was worse. Even if I sell school buses and other belongings, I won’t be able to clear my debts,” said Jaganmohan Swami, who runs an upper primary school in Karimnagar.With no income, Swami said is currently unable to pay either his school or house rent. According to Telangana Recognised School Management Association (TRSMA), at least half of the schools are yet to start online classes and most of them don’t have any new admissions. 1,500 schools shut shop due to Covid:Many schools have already succumbed to the financial crisis. According to TRSMA records, at least 1,500 schools across the state to pulled their shutters down, since the start of the pandemic. Reason: Inability to afford the rents or EMIs, with parents not paying fee, said school managements that TOI spoke to. They said they had not choice but to exit as the monetary burden was getting too much for them to handle. Shekhar Rao Y, president of TRSMA said that the number of those shutting shop could be much higher than 1,500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-admissions-dry-up-many-schools-contemplate-closure/articleshow/84155970.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra must draft policies to ensure no building collapse deaths: HC||MUMBAI: The state government must come up with policies to ensure that people don’t die on account of building collapses, the Bombay high court observed on Monday. “The situation has gone out of control...We have to value human life. Come with policies so that human lives can be saved,” said Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, when hearing a suo motu PIL on building collapses. The bench focused on the preliminary report of a judicial inquiry into the three-storey building collapse at New Collector Compound in Malad’s Malwani in June that killed 12 people, including eight children. The judges enquired how many ground-plus illegal structures are there in Mumbai. The amicus curiae, senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani, pointed out that according to the inquiry report, there are 8,485 structures at New Collector Compound of which 1,072 are ground floor and 4,494 are ground-plus one. “It is bound to happen if there is no control. In front of your (BMC and collector) eyes, they are coming up. Why one floor? They will go up to six floors,” said Justice Kulkarni.outThe report held the BMC responsible for not maintaining vigil and supervision. But senior advocate Aspi Chinoy, with advocate Joel Carlos, for BMC, said the commissioner erroneously held that the civic body has jurisdiction to remove unauthorised structures in notified slums. Under the Slums Act, the competent authority is the deputy collector, Chinoy said. The HC judges then told advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the BMC “has washed its hands of slums”, who replied that the BMC cannot say it is not concerned with unauthorised constructions. To the CJ’s query about “what welfare is the government thinking of residents of second, third, fourth floors in a slum”, Kumbhakoni replied that due to the nature of the construction, it may not be practically possible to remove separate floors as the structure may collapse. “The whole structure will have to be removed,” he said. The CJ said, “It is for you to decide. We cannot leave the lives of people at the mercy of legislators.” Amicus curiae Jagtiani said the BMC had, in fact, told the inquiry commissioner it had taken action against 444 of the 622 illegal structures in Malwani village. The judges frowned at the state for issuing a government resolution extending protection to unauthorised hutments/occupiers from 2000 to 2011 without amending the Slums Act. “How could you tinker with the cut-off date? You enjoy such vast powers that you can bring about such illegalities. We feel, prima facie, they are driven by vested interests,” said the CJ. In another hearing, a full HC bench extended all interim orders passed by courts in Maharashtra and Goa till August 13 or until further orders, whichever is earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-must-draft-policies-to-ensure-no-bldg-collapse-deaths-hc/articleshow/84159406.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Jaipur||‘Discoms need to share Covid losses with other arms, not hike tariffs’||Jaipur: With power demand declining substantially during the lockdown, distribution companies are likely to fall short of their revenue targets and incur additional losses. It is likely that the already debt-burdened discoms will offset losses by raising power tariffs for the consumers. In a bid to insulate consumers from any tariff hike because of the pandemic losses, Bask Research Foundation, an energy sector non-profit, has filed a petition with Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC) for a direction that will enable the discoms to invoke force majeure clauses in the agreement and distribute the losses among generation and transmission companies as well. RERC will hear the petition on Tuesday. Bask has estimated potential net loss in the range of Rs 400-Rs 926 crore on a projected revenue loss of Rs 835 to 1,795 crore for Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd alone. This amounts to an overall average tariff impact of 17 paisa per unit to 41 paisa. Bask in the petition said that the estimate is based on impact on electricity demand only. The actual impact because of project delays, fall in collection efficiencies and cost of short-term borrowings is likely to be much higher. “Amongst the three primary business verticals in power sector - generation, transmission and distribution, the distribution companies bear a disproportionately higher risk. Such risks extend beyond the technical and operational risks inherent to the business of electricity distribution and include difficult to manage risks associated with electricity demand,” Bask said in the petition. Typical structure of PPAs is such that even in case of a natural disaster such as Covid-19 pandemic, distribution licensees are liable to shoulder the burden of the impact and eventually pass it on to the consumers. “Such impact should be equitably and realistically spread throughout the value chain, and not borne by discoms alone as highlighted in the report by Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP) titled 'Reconciling Discom ‘stimulus’ and dues,” Bask stated. The distribution licensees are liable to pay fixed charges to generation companies, including for deemed generation. While demand has fell significantly due to the lockdown and impact of pandemic, the generation and transmission companies are assured of fixed returns on their equity investments as none of the risks linked to electricity demand are shared by them. “While true picture of impact of Covid-19 shall only be realized in near future, it is critical that electricity consumers of Rajasthan are not further burdened by possible impact on electricity tariffs,” it added. PPAs allow exemption from performance of obligations due to any event or circumstance (force majeure event) beyond the reasonable control of the party. The agreements signed between Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd and the discoms have the provision of force majeure in it. “The discoms may be directed to invoke force majeure to renegotiate PPA terms for a limited liability period of two years, based on assumption that such period shall be necessary for full recovery of the economy and the commission may extend or shorten such an agreed period on prudence basis,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/discoms-need-to-share-covid-losses-with-other-arms-not-hike-tariffs/articleshow/84155971.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: RGIA sees passenger footfall of 4 lakh in June as air travel picks pace||HYDERABAD: The easing of lockdown in various states, coupled with an increased pace of vaccination, has given an impetus to domestic travel. The Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, (RGIA) Hyderabad, for instance, witnessed a sharp increase in daily footfall in June – from 10,000 on June 1 to 22,000 on June 27 – with number of regular connections too jumping from just over 100 on June 1 to 199 on June 27. In all, RGIA saw four lakh domestic passengers and around 35,000 international passengers use the facility throughout the month, official data shows. During pre-Covid-19 times, RGIA clocked a daily footfall count — domestic and international — of anywhere between 55,000 and 57,000. This almost came to nought in March-April this year, with the second wave putting brakes on travel. “In these challenging times, the number of passengers crossing four lakh in a month reflects confidence and trust in air travel. As the pandemic subsides and restrictions across various destinations in the country ease, a gradual rebound in air travel has been witnessed,” said the spokesperson of GMR Hyderabad International Airport adding, “To brace ourselves in bringing about faster recovery, we have adopted innovative solutions that have become the ‘new normal’. If the trend continues, we are poised to see a gradual increase in passenger numbers in the coming months.” At present, the Hyderabad airport is connected to 42 domestic destinations with Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Visakhapatnam being the top five growth sectors for June. Among them, Mumbai recorded the highest growth (in passenger count) of 84% during this period. “Visiting friends and relatives, SME business travel are what largely contributed to this increase in passenger numbers,” the spokesperson said. Internationally, RGIA is connected to 10 locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rgia-sees-passenger-footfall-of-4l-in-june-as-air-travel-picks-pace/articleshow/84156005.cms||---

---||Mumbai||‘He was given separate cell in jail hospital, 2 attendants’||NEW DELHI: Elgar Parishad case accused Fr Stan Swamy, against whom NIA had filed a chargesheet the day after his arrest and never sought his police custody in view of his age and “sufficient evidences...already on record”, was given a separate cell at Taloja prison hospital with all necessary precautions and two attendants as per advice of the jail’s medical officer, said government sources on Monday. At the Taloja central prison, where Swamy was lodged soon after his arrest on October 8, 2020, a source said he was provided with all facilities, including a wheelchair, a walker, a walking stick, a straw, a sipper, a mug, a commode chair, battery cells for his hearing machines, dental treatment, a visiting psychiatrist and telemedicine. NIA had earlier termed as “false, incorrect and mischievious” reports that it had seized Swamy’s straw and sipper from his Ranchi home and sought 20 days’ time to hand over these items to him. A government source said the 84-year-old Jesuit priest was arrested after the Elgar Parishad probe revealed him to be an alleged member of the banned CPI (Maoist) involved in furthering its activities. He was found in communication with CPI (Maoist) cadres and was convener of Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), a frontal organisation of CPI (Maoist), as per the chargesheet. In the letters, he had allegedly expressed concern over leakage of communications between Maoist leaders, leading to the arrest of various key cadres. Government sources said that at the time of his arrest on October 8, 2020, by NIA in Ranchi, Swamy was informed of the grounds for his arrest in the presence of his advocate Peter Margin. Information was also conveyed to his acquaintance Soloman David. All medical formalities after arrest were complied with. Utmost care was taken for his safe and comfortable transit from Ranchi to Mumbai and all entitlements of the accused in detention, including food, were taken care of, said government sources. Swamy was examined by the medical practitioner and his health condition certified as stable as per Section 54 of CrPC. Government sources said he had made no complaints to the special court about any “ill-treatment” from the investigating officers. Father Swamy filed bail applications before the Bombay high court but these were rejected. On May 21, 2021, he filed a criminal appeal before the high court, regarding which the state of Maharashtra filed a medical report of the board of doctors constituted by J J Hospital. He was advised by court to be treated at J J Hospital but refused to get admitted.

One rake of coal weighs around 4,000 tonne. The destination of below 2200 gross calorific value coal purchased under spot e-auction from Dahibari siding of Bharat Coking Coal (BCCL), the Jharkhand-based coal producing subsidiary of CIL, is Rampal Power Station, Khulna, Bangladesh. This falls under Maitree Super Thermal Power Project — a joint venture between the Indian power producer NTPC and Bangladesh Power Development Board. The Bangladesh-bound coal left the Indian shore from Kolkata port, the sea route which links India with Bangladesh. Effective June 8, the Mahartana coal miner amended its e-auction sales policy allowing across-the-border sale of coal bought under spot e-auction and special spot e-auction by domestic coal purchasers, including traders. “This ushered in the way for coal exports. Both types of auctions are meant for all categories of Indian coal buyers and traders. Special spot e-auction though offers extended time for lifting coal. Though small in quantity, what is encouraging is that a beginning has been made. We look forward to more exports that would help improve coal sales under the two categories of the auction platform,” said a senior executive of the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-auction-rejig-cil-sends-1st-coal-rake-to-bdesh/articleshow/84156035.cms||---

The pre-monsoon groundwater level survey done in May shows improvement in water levels in three talukas – Sinnar, Chandwad and Yeola. The water levels were not only better than the five-year average but even above the levels reported last year before summer. Sinnar taluka, which requires water supply tankers for drinking water, has remained tanker-free this year. The taluka has not needed tankers for two consecutive years, sources from the district collectorate said. “The groundwater survey carried out through the observation wells across the 15 talukas show the water levels have improved by 2.6 meter in Sinnar taluka when compared to the five-year average. The water was available at 6.8 metres below surface as against the average of 9.4m below surface,” Jeevan Bedwal, senior geologist, Nashik district, said. It may be noted that water was available at 8.25 meter below surface in Sinnar last year. The groundwater in Yeola taluka improved by 1.9 metre when compared to its 5-year average and 1.68 metre in Chandwad – all of which are parched areas of the district.  The officer added that the farmers in the three talukas are not very aggressive on cash crops and it has resulted in comparatively lower drawing of water from the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/groundwater-levels-better-than-5-yr-avg-in-dry-parts-of-nashik/articleshow/84151804.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Hyderabad||May not be profitable to release new films in Telangana, says film industry||HYDERABAD: Representatives of Telugu film industry urged the state government to allow a minimum amount as parking fee while asserting that they were waiting for a complete unlock in the neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh also before reopening theatres. The Telangana State Film Chamber of Commerce (TSFCC) said one of the main sources of income for theatres is parking fee which accounts for 40% of revenue. In a representation to chief secretary Somesh Kumar on Monday, honorary secretary of the chamber Sunil Narang also explained how theatres had suffered a blow because of pandemic and lockdown in the last two years. With theatres not opening despite the government lifting the lockdown a fortnight ago, Somesh Kumar held a meeting with film producers Daggubati Suresh Babu, Dil Raju and others to enquire what was preventing them from reopening cinema halls. M Vijendar Reddy, theatre owner and former president of Telangana film chamber of commerce, said various issues pertaining to the industry were explained to the CS by the representatives. “It was also explained that it would not be profitable to release new films only in Telangana and that the film industry is waiting for lockdown to be lifted in AP,” Vijendar said. The representatives urged the government to reduce the state GST and vacancy remission for cinema halls in Telangana as theatres were closed for a long period so that they do not have to pay property tax for the last two years. The representatives also wanted the government to reduce rates for film shootings at different locations all over the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/may-not-be-profitable-to-release-new-films-in-state-says-industry/articleshow/84156043.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Delhi||New Delhi Municipal Council puts mark on households not segregating waste||NEW DELHI: Taking strict action against those not segregating waste despite several warnings, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has started pasting a red sticker outside their houses. If no change is noticed in 8-10 days, then penal action will be taken based on Solid Waste Management guidelines. The civic body claims to have taken action against 170 properties on Malcha Marg, Jor Bagh, Sarojini Nagar, BK Dutt Colony, Khan Market, Palika, Golf Links, Bhagwan Das Road, Rajdoot Marg, Moti Bagh, Laxmi Bai Nagar, among other places, after closely watching the defaulters. “We have been reaching out to residents and guiding them in segregating wet and dry waste. We also organised workshops, engaged vehicles for collecting segregated waste and then made it mandatory. However, a few households are not taking things seriously. Unsegregated waste mixed with the rest makes the entire effort zero,” said an NDMC official. After pasting the stickers, NDMC employees have been watching for behavioural changes in the households. “We conducted a survey and found that around 40 households were following the norms. We then removed the stickers. We will be sending notices followed by a challan to the remaining households. The drive is aimed at maintaining 100% segregation at source,” said the official. The official said that hotels and restaurants were also being watched closely, while huge complexes had been asked to install in-house composting plants. NDMC is also carrying out workshops to share methods for home composting in residential areas. “We have carried out the exercise in West Kidwai Nagar, Gole Market and BK Dutt Colony, where we even distributed kits to make compost at home with kitchen waste. We distributed materials, such as coco peat, enzymes and buckets to the residents with the help of an NGO. We have formed a WhatsApp group for circulating information and educational material with RWAs and residents,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ndmc-puts-mark-on-households-not-segregating-waste/articleshow/84156140.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: RERA appoints third party to complete pending project||JAIPUR: In a first, the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Rajasthan, has appointed a third party to complete the construction of ‘Hyde Park’ project situated behind Dalda factory in Durgapura after revoking the registration of the promoter. The decision was taken on a petition filed by Hyde Park Flat Owners Association. As per the orders, the new developer will commence construction within 30 days from the receipt of installments from the members of the complainant association. The apartments will have to be completed within two years from the start of work. The order reads, “The construction and expenses from the escrow bank account will be monitored by a project management consultant, which will be approved by the authority. The progress of construction and the details of the bank account would be submitted to the authority on a monthly basis before the 10th day of each month.” The project Hyde Park was launched in 2014 by the Adarsh Buildestate Limited (ABL) as developer promoter. The construction was started by the promoter respondent, which proceeded at a good pace till 2016, but slowed down during 2017 and came to a stop in 2018. As per the development agreement, the project was to be developed into two stages: Phase I consisting of 593 flats and Phase ll consisting of 296 flats. The entire project was to be completed within 48 months commencing from April 1, 2013. However, the developer miserably failed to complete first phase. Phase I was later revised and it was proposed to construct 265 flats. Now, RERA has directed to complete Phase 1 after appointing third party as 150 odd allottees booked their flats with the promoter on the promise that they would be handed over the possession of their apartments by March 3, 2017, which was later extended by till March 31, 2021. The remaining 115 will be booked and sold by the third party to meet the construction expense. “The new developer, landowners and the complainant association will enter into a tripartite agreement wherein the rights and responsibilities and obligations of all the three parties in respect of completion of revised Phase I shall be recorded,” reads the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rera-appoints-3rd-party-to-complete-pending-project/articleshow/84156072.cms||Ajay Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: School wants to teach RTE students offline||JAIPUR: Looking at the difficulties faced by the students admitted under Right to Education (RTE), Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya (SMS School) has sought permission from the state government to teach RTE students physically on campus. According to the letter written to the state government, schools administration has said that they are providing online virtual two-way teaching by experienced and talented teachers and with the use of modern technologies to all its students (including RTE students), in which 95% students are participating. However, school authorities have noticed that the students admitted under RTE are not able to connect with online classes regularly, may be because of lack of facilities like necessary gadgets, connectivity and appropriate learning atmosphere at home. Being sensitive to the issue and concerned with education for all, especially to the children from deprived sections of the society admitted under the RTE Act, the school authorities said that they are willing to teach RTE students physically on the campus. There are about 10 to 15 children in each class and the school has all necessary arrangements to follow Covid protocol. The children belonging to RTE, if allowed by the government, may be called to the school for teaching while following the Covid protocol — thermal scanning, physical distancing in campus and classrooms, hand sanitisation, face masks, no library, no sports, no prayer, no canteen. Similar problems have been faced by students studying in government schools in rural areas or from economically backward families, where non-availability of internet has impacted the learning of students. Hence, the government had decided to teach students from home by the teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/school-wants-to-teach-rte-students-offline/articleshow/84156093.cms||---

In Bijnor, one such facility is being developed on government land near Vidur Kuti and can be replicated at the village level. “Anyone can plant a sapling in the memory of a departed dear one. Due to emotional connection with the sapling, the person who plants it will obviously nurture it, which is crucial to its development in the initial years,” said M Semmaran, divisional forest officer, Bijnor. Active participation of people in the plantation drive will also ensure that Bijnor meets its target of planting 63 lakh saplings this monsoon. This year, the UP government plans to plant 30 crore saplings across the state. Terming the initiative as a means to channelise grief into a positive effort, Umesh Mishra, Bijnor district magistrate, said, “It is a unique programme touching the masses. Family members of the deceased will plant saplings in the memory of a loved one. The bond will enable them to look after the saplings. They can plant the saplings on government land which is earmarked for plantation here at Vidur Kuti area. Besides, they can do so at their villages or graveyards. I hope this will encourage the plantation drive.” According to officials, earlier people had planted saplings at Indira Park and City Forest here in memory of the departed souls but somehow it did not prove to be a success as anticipated. But this time, they hope, the drive will sustain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/plant-a-sapling-in-memory-of-loved-one-bijnor-admin-urges-people/articleshow/84151909.cms||Harveer Dabas

Three years ago, the state government had approved Rs 27 crore to develop the historic ghat of the Panchaganga river and had released Rs 5 crore to take up the civil works. The public works department (PWD) is the execution authority of the project and the activists blamed the members of heritage committee for stalling of the work. During the meeting held on Monday and chaired by Kolhapur Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Mandlik, the activists claimed that the heritage committee has not revealed the queries raised by the citizens regarding over the project. The activists went on to claim that there are no written objections reagrding the project and the ambitious project is stalled due to vested interests. Heritage committee head architect Amarja Nimbalkar and secretary Ramchandra Mahajan failed to submit the queries to Mandlik. Ramesh More, convenor of the activists forum, said, “The MP has asked the authorities to start the first phase of the project by August. He also took the responsibility to get permissions from the archeology and other government departments. The heritage committee earlier had stalled various projects from the city, but we did not relent and ensured the projects get completed. The government has written to the PWD to revert the funds if the project work does not begin at the earliest.” The project involves restoring the heritage structures of the ghat, bring the submerged structure such as temples to the fore along with developing the premise which is spread over 10 acre. Mandlik said he will again call a meeting on Thursday to review the documentation of the project. He was angry over the objections raised by the heritage committee when the project plan got approved and the work tendered three years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/heritage-committee-members-face-flak-for-stalling-panchaganga-ghat-development/articleshow/84151845.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Anil Deshmukh fails to appear before ED for third time||MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s former home minister Anil Deshmukh failed, for the third time, to appear before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday. He sent a letter through his lawyer informing the ED that he cannot be present for questioning till the Supreme Court decides on his petition urging against any coercive action. The ED decided to challenge Deshmukh’s petition in court. Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh has been summoned on Tuesday. On Monday, the ED rejected Deshmukh’s letter as there was a box-type mark below Deshmukh’s signature, and the ED officials believed that it was photoshopped, said ED sources. They further added that Deshmukh is not traceable for his statement and his phone is also switched off. Two separate ED teams had visited his two known residences in Mumbai on Friday night, but the former minister was not traceable. Deshmukh’s lawyer Inderpal Singh declined to comment. Last Tuesday, Deshmukh wrote a letter to the ED, asking it to record his statement through video-conferencing. The ED has rejected the request after stating that it was neither feasible nor tenable and alleged that Deshmukh adopted a dilatory tactic. In Monday’s letter, Deshmukh reportedly stated that the ED’s objections “are not only misconceived but also reflect a prejudicial bent of mind.” The letter asked ED to “wait for the outcome of the proceedings before the Court for the next few days”, which the agency said is diametrically opposite to what he has been maintaining, where he asked for details of the case and insisted that he was not avoiding the investigation. Last month, the ED had arrested Deshmukh’s private secretary (additional collector rank government officer) Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde for helping Deshmukh and Hrishikesh with the money laundering. Palande and Shinde are in ED custody till July 6. The ED is investigating a money laundering case against Deshmukh based on the allegation of the former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh in his letter to the chief minister. Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had demanded Rs 100 crore every month from (now-dismissed) assistant police inspector Sachin Waze and two other officers after asking them to collect it illegally from orchestra bars in the city and other sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukh-fails-to-appear-before-ed-for-third-time/articleshow/84159420.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana wants techies in office by September but industry reluctant||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government may be keen on seeing the IT/ITeS sector log all employees into offices from September, but companies are not yet ready to go the whole hog with R2O (return to office). Plaguing them are fears of a potential third wave and rising attrition levels (pegged at around 20%) that could make it difficult to crack the whip and herd employees back to office. “Currently only about 7-8% of employees are on work from office (WFO). Before wave two hit, industry was expecting about 30% staff in office by July, but now this is expected to be only 10%,” said Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) president Bharani Kumar Aroll. He said while smaller players are showing interest in WFO, most of the large ones are not in a mood to push employees due to these fears. Batting for safety first, Nasscom’s former GCC Council chair V Laxmikanth said a full opening is risky as even a single incident can shut down a GCC and even in the US tech centres are being reopened in a measured and voluntary manner. “While it is good to give positive message that Covid is behind us and the state is ready, instead of being prescriptive government should work with companies for reopening. We know nothing about the virus and if anything goes wrong, the leadership here will have to answer to their bosses and employees.” Also nearly 40% of the 6-lakh odd techies employed by Telangana’s IT sector are on WFH from their home towns and are reluctant to back to office due to increased savings and safety concerns and may switch jobs if pushed too hard, feel industry heads. “Apart from WFH fatigue, attrition is rising because of the high demand for digital transformation projects. Salary hikes on switching jobs have shot up from around 30% to 45-50%,” Aroll said, adding at only 55% of techies on WFH in Hyderabad have got at least one vaccine dose. Society for Cyber Security Council (SCSC) secretary general Krishna Yedula too feels that even if offices are opened up in September, WFO component will remain at sub-20% levels only due to lack of confidence. Though no directive has been issued to industry yet, Telangana ITE&C principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan said the government wants offices to reopen fully in early September as a lot of livelihoods dependent on the IT sector are getting unnecessarily impacted. “IT companies that talk about charity and CSR should realise that not reporting back to work causes livelihood losses. It (third wave) is very speculative and just sitting at home and thinking about it is sheer foolishness,” said Ranjan, pointing out nearly 60% of the techies currently in Hyderabad have been vaccinated. “We are very confident that even if there is a third wave, it will not start in Telangana because of our extraordinary preparedness” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-wants-techies-in-office-by-sept-but-industry-reluctant/articleshow/84156099.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Chandigarh||Kaptan Singh, 4, fires up action, ‘josh’ at farm stir sites||Barnala: When Kaptan Singh, 4, takes stage at farm protest sites in Punjab and on Delhi borders, the crowd roars and even passersby get clicking. As the diminutive figure raises slogans integral to the struggle and quotes lines of revolutionary poets, he stirs admiration among the crowd and amps up the tempo of the stir. He is an unlikely crowd-puller for the agitation as his father Lakha Singh of Mehal Kalan in Barnala district has no agricultural land. This hasn’t stopped the family from joining the ongoing struggle. Kaptan, of course, can be found leading the action at the protest sites. A veteran of sorts at protest sites, Kaptan, a Class 1 student in a private school at Mehal Kalan, can be seen shouting slogans and rendering lines of songs played from stages to enthuse his fellow protesters. Thanks to his expertise in inspiring the crowd, he is a known face at the farm protest sites of Mehal Kalan toll plaza and Barnala railway station. He also made quite an impression when he visited the Singhu and Tikri borders, and plans to go there again in a fortnight. His father Lakha Singh is a carpenter by profession and mother Manjit Kaur used to work as a teacher till some time ago. Manjit Kaur tells how they became part of the ongoing struggle. “After the farmers had left for Delhi borders on November 26, 2020, we started thronging the Mehal Kalan toll plaza site some days later. As my husband used to work in his carpenter workshop near the toll plaza, my son Kaptan started accompanying me to the protests. Initially, he could not understand what the agitation was about, but a week later he had learnt the popular slogans and began demanding time to raise slogans from the stage. When he used to shout ‘‘Kale kanoon radd karo, kale kanoon vapas karva ke rahange, saade haq aethe rakh, kisan mazdoor ekta zindabad, bhagat singh teri soch te pahra diange thok ke’’, passersby used to stop and many would click his pictures with their mobile phones or make videos," says Manjit. Soon Kaptan even memorised some lines of revolutionary poet Sant Ram Udasi, which are read out at protests. His parents recount that when the family visited the farm protest sites on Delhi borders in June, Kaptan instantly gained popularity, becoming the favourite participant in the farmer movement. He was so sought-after that his parents got invites from many protest sites in nearby districts. "We have no land, but my parents had agricultural land and I used to support my father in farming before my marriage. So I have a soft corner for the interests of farmers and became a part of agitation along with Kaptan, said Manjit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kaptan-singh-4-fires-up-action-josh-at-farm-stir-sites/articleshow/84156133.cms||Neel Kamal

Though the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) had written to the finance department to extend relaxation on stamp duty till March 2022, the department provided relief till September. During the budget, the state government announced to reduce stamp duty on housing units in multi-storey buildings from 6% to 4% until June 30, 2021. The benefits were provided to buyers purchasing flat worth up to Rs 50 lakh. As the real estate industry failed to reap the benefit of relaxation after strict guidelines were imposed during the second wave, the developers demanded the extension Rajasthan CREDAI chairman Gopal Prasad Gupta said, “To support the developers, the state government should adopt an approach like Maharashtra, where stamp duty relief is provided to all plots. The window is too small and people will not take benefit of this extension.”After the first lockdown, both consumers and real estate industry faced a setback as stamp duty was increased to 6% from 5%. Also, with 1% registration fee and 30% other taxes, the total stamp duty had gone up to 8.8%.Though the relaxations were announced in February, restrictions imposed during the second wave put a spoke in real estate industry’s wheel. “Not many could crack the deal due to the second wave. Many consumers who planned buy a flat up to Rs 50 lakh shelved their plans ,” said Ankur Sharma, a developer On the demand of CREDAI, the Rajasthan Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) had also given one month extension to developers to submit quarterly progress reports (QRPS) of their registered projects.In the last orders, the authority mentioned that the last date for submission of QRPs for all the earlier quarters and also for the quarters ending on March 31, 2021 had been extended to June 30, 2021 without any delay processing charges or penalty. This has now extended to July 31, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/stamp-duty-relaxation-extended-for-flat-buyers-in-highrises-till-sep-30/articleshow/84156125.cms||---

The EU Special Representative for Human Rights Eamon Gilmore tweeted: “India: I am very saddened to hear that Fr #StanSwamy has passed away. A defender of indigenous peoples’ rights. He was held in detention for the past 9 months. The EU had been raising his case repeatedly with authorities.” Mary Lawlor, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights defenders, wrote: “The news from #India today is devastating. Human Rights Defender & Jesuit priest Fr Stan Swamy has died in custody, nine months after his arrest on false charges of terrorism. Jailing HRDs is inexcusable.” The internet buzzed with condemnation by human rights activists—from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who said “Fr Stan deserved justice and humaneness” to mediapersons, activists, NGOs and citizens. Fr Stan’s home state of Jharkhand led by chief minister M Hemant Soren and the churches of Ranchi and Jamshedpur all grieved his loss. Oswald Cardinal Gracias, head of the Catholic Church in India and Archbishop of Bombay, was personally acquainted with Fr Stan’s work in the tribal hinterland. He said, “Fr Stan’s arrest was very painful. Under the Indian criminal law, one is innocent until proved guilty. Fr Stan’s case did not even come up for hearing. We were eagerly waiting for the case to be taken up and the truth to come out... Fr Stan worked tirelessly for the underprivileged and the downtrodden. I witnessed his dedication to the exploited tribals. I do hope that the truth will come out soon and his name will be cleared of all criminal conspiracy.” His community of Jesuit priests, in particular, mourned his loss. Fr Errol Fernandes said he was “now free from all earthly jails” while Fr Vincent Vaz described him as the “Mahatma of tribals”. Hours before his death came to light, the People’s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR), a Delhi-based civil liberties organisation, had written an open letter to the Chief Justice of the Bombay high court to end his incarceration. “Arresting an elderly activist suffering from multiple ailments in relation to a false and malicious political case, and then letting him die in custody by opposing desperate requests for release, is nothing short of custodial murder,” wrote secretaries Radhika Chitkara and Vikas Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-eu-un-join-netas-rights-activists-priests-to-mourn-death/articleshow/84158244.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

In the next couple of days, people will be able to buy their favourite brand of beer at Rs 10 less once the old stock gets over, as authorities try to encourage drinking beer. The liquor income was expected to be around Rs 2700 crore every month, but for the past few months, the state government is netting only Rs 2,500 crore. Looking at the shortfall in income, the government identified that price hike was one of the reasons for the fall along with Covid- 19 fears. “After the old stock with old price is exhausted, the new price will come into force. Already instructions have been given to sell the beers at reduced rates,” one official said Looking at the numbers, 4.92 crore beer cases were sold as against 2. 73 crore in the last financial year. Liquor prices were increased last year after lockdown in the month of May. The price of beer bottles went up by Rs 30. On some varieties, the price hike was Rs 50, taking the base price of a 650-ml premium bottle to Rs 150. Prices of beer has come down in states like Delhi, but in Telangana, higher prices continued, despite several representations from the industry pending with state government to reduce the MRP price drastically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-to-slash-price-to-make-beer-market-bullish/articleshow/84156136.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Pune||Pune: Restaurant owners seek new timings for dine-in services||PUNE: The owners of restaurants and bars in the city want urgent restructuring of the present operation timings for them to continue dine-in services and make up some of the losses incurred because of the 4pm deadline. There are around 4,000 restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Of them, 200 eateries have now shut down dine-in services permanently because of the restrictions. “There needs to be quick relief. We have demanded that all restaurants and bars be allowed to operate from 11am to 3pm and 7pm to 10.30pm. This will bring in at least some business. After the 4pm deadline for dine-in services and only takeaways on weekends, around 200 restaurants shut down dine-in services in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad as they could not sustain,” Ganesh Shetty, the president of the Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA), told TOI. The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies revised the restrictions in the last week of June. “If we are allowed to operate for at least some hours in the evenings, even at 50% capacity, there will be some business. Many of us have called back our staff after the relaxations, but are now finding it difficult to pay them after the restrictions,” Kishor Satpotdar, the general secretary of PRAHA, said. The owner of a bar and restaurant in Koregaon Park told TOI that he had got four of his employees back from West Bengal, but now they had no work. “I cannot send them back again or else they will never return. I have completely stopped dine-in services as these frequent changes are causing confusion and costing me a lot of money,” he said. Shetty said that as soon as they open the outlets, the landlords start asking for rent, they need to pay the salaries, electricity and water bills. “So, there is no profit in the present situation,” Shetty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eatery-owners-seek-new-timings-for-dine-in-services/articleshow/84156245.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Kolkata||West Begal: Tolly colleagues help trolled actor Shruti Das in skin-tone fightback||KOLKATA: After police registered a case against Facebook users for trolling actor Shruti Das, others have started talking about their own experiences. According to them, this incident has kick-started a movement of sorts. Some like actor-turned-president of Trinamool youth wing Saayoni Ghosh insist that directives should come from the court penalizing the offenders. Interestingly, both the contemporary Bengali big and small screens offer very few lead characters for heroines with melanin-rich complexion. For reasons both aspirational and/or related to acceptance issues, many once-dusky actors now have 10 times lighter skin tones. Ghosh attributes this to so-called standard norms of beauty set by society and the pressure of acceptance. “In our industry, fair-skinned heroines are often cast as dusky characters. Why don’t we normalize dusky skin?” she asked. Ghosh herself has been trolled for her short hair and her English skills. “But I never took things lying down. I congratulate Shruti for taking this step keeping aside her celebrity image and the apprehensions of getting dragged in legal issues. I am glad that Kolkata Police has taken cognizance of this complaint. This is a watershed moment. I am hoping this FIR will empower women of colour.” On Monday morning, actor Sohini Sarkar got in touch with Das to extend her support. As a child, Sarkar was made aware of her dusky skin tone when her grandmother used to “fondly” call her Kalindi. Her cousin was called Tulu because she was as fair as a cotton wool. “I never took offence then because I knew my grandmother didn’t have any malice. In recent times, some friends have alluded to my complexion and said ‘ei toh gaayer rong…’. I took all that in good spirit also because I love my complexion,” she said. Today, she realises that such comments are “discriminatory” and should not be allowed. “I will stop anyone using the word ‘Kalindi’ now because I know if such terms get currency it might badly impact those like Shruti.” Actor Tuhina Das took to Facebook to post her protest. “I am sure the way the world is moving towards an equal place, there shall soon be regulations put on such unwarranted opinion. I just hope it arrives before this takes a serious mental toll...” she wrote. Talking to TOI, Das said: “This FIR has started a movement in a more concrete way. While I have not been trolled viciously like Shruti, it’s very painful to see the discrimination all around.” When Ushoshi Sengupta, started modelling in 2004, she was described as “unconventionally beautiful”. “It was a subtle way of making me feel like the other. Indian women are conventionally dusky. There is no point using the word ‘unconventional’ while referring to a dusky complexion,” she said. In the early days of her career, she used to mute indecent comments that came her way. “By lodging a police complaint, Shruti has done what I couldn’t when I was trolled. Shruti has started a movement and I am with her. Even if someone uses derogatory terms like ‘moila’ and ‘chapa rong’ in a humorous context, I will still protest,” she added. Actor Oindrila Sen remembers the time when actor Ankush was trolled for no reason. “Trolls have serially abused my tendency to put on weight. I laud Shruti’s courage to fight back. Social media doesn’t allow sharing of copyrighted music. It should have a similar system in place for blocking posts with filthy language,” Sen said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/its-not-fair-tolly-colleagues-help-trolled-actor-in-skin-tone-fightback/articleshow/84153977.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

It would be bestowing a record 870 PhDs on the students on Friday, but it would be done virtually due to Covid-19 restrictions, as per NU officials. NU would also be giving Doctor of Letters (DLitt) degrees to Ratnakar Bhelkar and Dr Tulsidas Gedam, both in humanities faculty. While the former would be getting his degree for his study on ‘Translation of Tukadoji’s Gram Geeta: Tradition of Reality’, the latter would be receiving it for his project on ‘Shudra, all in original’. Bhelkar will be the second one to receive the prestigious degree in English in the last four decades after RN Roy, former NU Head of English department. Officials informed that the university would be bestowing 195 medals and prizes on the meritorious students from various faculties. Among top winners are Prachi Agrawal of BA LLB (five-year) course from Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Law College at Deekshabhoomi, who won 11 medals. She’s followed by MBA student Aditya Khode from Dr Ambedkar Institute of Management Studies and Gauri Joshi from the NU department of chemistry, with seven each. Amol Dhakde from NU’s Dr Ambedkar thought department has won six, along with Poonam Belekar from Anjuman Engineering College. According to NU officials, the previous highest 842 PhDs were conferred during 103rd convocation in November 2016. The highest ever was 998 presented during the historic 100th convocation. A majority of the 870 PhD recipients are from the science and technology faculty, followed by humanities and then commerce and management. They added that despite NU introducing strict norms during the tenure of former VC SP Kane and pro-VC Pramod Yeole, the number of PhDs continued to swell over the years. Kane and Yeole had introduced two tests PET-1 and PET-2 for those pursuing PhD, that had initially led to reduction in the number of aspirants. However, the new administration under VC Subhash Chaudhari relaxed norms by cancelling two tests and bringing back one test that may lead to breaching these numbers, the officials said. Governor to attend prog online NU officials disclosed that Maharashtra governor and chancellor Bhagat Singh Koshyari would be attending the ceremony online, as he would be going to Delhi for some urgent official work. Earlier, he consented to preside over the ceremony to award Doctor of Law (LLD) degree to former Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde. An official from the governor’s office also confirmed the development. His move, however, disappointed the NU officials.

You have conducted a preliminary enquiry. So, who are these unknown persons? Give us a report in a sealed cover. We will see and return,” Justice Shinde said to CBI counsel ASG Aman Lekhi. It added, “We do not know what investigation has been carried out by CBI after registration of FIR, at this stage.” “What would happen to quashing petition?

University representatives were directed to submit documents regarding the title of land belonging to Maharaja College and Maharani College so that action could be taken in this regard. Similarly, Jaipur tehsildar was directed to send proposals for Rajasthan College’s land, which is registered as state land, on which consent could be obtained from the state government.

The court refused to pass a direction to DU to conduct an assignment-based examination instead and clarified that it would not substitute the stand taken by the university. “Court can’t give mandatory direction to the university to conduct assignment-based examinations... The matter is one which university is authorised to consider. The university’s policy decision can’t be interfered with by court,” it said. The court, however, asked DU to declare the results of the examinations as expeditiously as possible. Law Faculty dean Vandana told the court that the examination in question was likely to be conducted in July itself and another round of exams will be held in September for the benefit of students who are unable to sit in the first round. The varsity also submitted that as approved by Bar Council of India, the mode of examination — whether online, offline, blended or assignment based — was left to the discretion of the institute concerned. The students argued that online open book examination for last year’s intermediate semesters II and IV was not in the interest of students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-refuses-to-interfere-with-du-decision-on-open-book-tests/articleshow/84156209.cms||---

What began as an inspiration from a cartoon catapulted the little girl into the league of celebrities so much so Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed her as “friend” as she was awarded with Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Shakti Puraskar in 2019. Now, travelling all over the country, the class IV student is invited to plant trees in Delhi, Jaipur, Indore, Ghaziabad, among other cities. “This is our last chance to save human civilization. Planting trees is the only way to do it, the more the better,” said Eiha Dixit, who aims to become an IPS officer, and wishes to plant trees all her life. She now develops her own seeds of various plants and distributes them to masses. Eiha's father Kuldeep Dixit, a coach for competitive exams, said, “The cartoons had made such a powerful impact on Eiha that she was insistent on planting a sapling herself. She was four years old at that time. One day I took her to a nearby park and fulfilled her desire by helping her sow a lemon sapling. She was happy. Soon, she started to plant saplings every Sunday." Her father added, "Seeing her passion we organised a bigger event in 2018 where other children were involved. A site was provided by the Housing and Development Board where 1,008 saplings were planted in two days. It was the turning point. Her effort was noticed by local media and later, government officials verified facts after which she was mentioned in PM Modi’s Mann ki baat in 2019." Later, the PM posted a photograph of him with Eiha on his Instagram account mentioning: “With my young friend Eiha Dixit at 7, LKM. She was among the youngsters conferred the Bal Shakti Award.” After receiving the award, there was no turning back for the young girl. Incidentally, the Uttar Pradesh government has focused a lot on planting saplings on a mass scale in the state. The state has now set a target of planting 30 crore saplings during the 'van mahotsav' (afforestation festival).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/how-a-girl-of-8-years-friend-of-pm-modi-planted-7000-saplings/articleshow/84152058.cms||Sandeep Rai

These units, which are manufacturing extra neutral alcohol, denatured spirit, Indian made foreign liquor, Punjab medium liquor, and beer are established after the grant of licence by the excise department and work as per the norms laid down in excise laws. The official said the structural layout of the units and pipelines laid out for carrying extra neutral alcohol (ENA)/denatured spirit/ rectified spirit are required to strictly comply with excise laws. Recently, MFMs were installed in all distilleries, bottling plants, and breweries at the instance of the excise department to accurately measure the quantity of ENA or other spirits produced by the distilleries and later dispatched or consumed for bottling. A team comprising technical experts will audit each unit and give its report. The entire expenditure of the audit will be borne by the excise department. The purpose of the audit is to check whether the plant and various structures built in them are as per the site map approved by the department. Along with this, pipelines laid out in the manufacturing unit will be checked. The purpose of checking the pipelines is to check that no parallel pipeline exists to take out the spirit from normal flow. A technical audit of the MFMs will be done to check specifications and calibration. It would also check if flowmeters are measuring the entire outflow of the spirit and no other pipeline is laid out to bypass the flowmeter. The audit by the team of experts of IIT started on Monday, at Rajasthan Liquors Limited in Dera Bassi. It will cover all the manufacturing units of the state in a span of six months. This audit will go a long way in bringing compliance at the manufacturing level and prevent pilferage of ENA and protect the revenue of the state, added the spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/third-party-audit-of-liquor-manufacturing-units-in-punjab-begins/articleshow/84156192.cms||---

Samastipur divisional railway manager (DRM) Ashok Maheshwari said the trains were cancelled as a precautionary safety measure. “The floodwaters in Burhi Gandak river crossed the danger mark at bridge number 248 on Muzzaffarpur-Paniahawa section, while water level shown a rising trend at a few other rail bridges,” he said, adding railway safety staff have been put on high alert to check damages to rail bridges and tracks, if any. “The overall condition is alarming. All possible efforts have been made to plug the water leakage at vulnerable places. Railways has arranged stone boulders and sand bags to use in emergency.

The fares, unofficially, will be higher than usual to absorb ever-rising fuel costs. The state government has asked the operators to first run buses to alleviate commuters’ woes. The government would then think of revising fares. In a meeting at the Maidan camp of West Bengal Transport Corporation, transport minister Firhad Hakim on Monday entrusted MLA and bus operators’ leader Swarna Kamal Saha to convey this message to other associations. “The fuel price is skyrocketing. We are sympathetic with the plight of bus owners. But we also need to think of those who have been struggling to commute. These people badly need services of private transport to make ends meet,” Hakim said. The minister dodged queries on a probable hike in private bus fare structure. However, he assured that a fleet of private buses will run. Sources in the transport department said Hakim asked the private bus owners to be patient at this crucial juncture when the focus of the state government was to keep the city moving after following Covid restrictions for 45 days. The transport department, meanwhile, started contacting the operators of school buses, chartered buses and pool cars so that they can ferry passengers on different high-demand routes to ease commuting woes. All Bengal Bus-o-Minibus Samannay Committee secretary Rahul Chattopadhyay said: “We cannot force operators to run buses when the diesel price is inching towards a century. However, if anyone runs a bus, we will give him moral support.” Immediately after the meeting, four associations — All Bengal Bus and Minibus Samannay Committee, Bengal Bus Syndicate, City Suburban Bus services and West Bengal Bus Owners Association — held a meeting to decide the next course of action. A section of private bus owners has reportedly requested Hakim to allow some more days so that they could get their buses checked by mechanics before hitting the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/start-ops-will-think-of-fare-hike-govt-to-bus-owners/articleshow/84154001.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Vadodara||Vadodara group booked for holding agitations against inflation||VADODARA: There was an interesting twist to the agitation organized by a city based group to oppose price rise. The group has been accused of violating Covid safety protocols during the programme. The offence was registered on Sunday, but the organizers from the group ‘Team Revolution’ came to know of it only on Monday when they were called at the police station. The leader of the group Shwejal Vyas was arrested on Monday and he refused to take bail. The group had organized the agitation on Sunday at the Jay Narayan Society in Gorwa to oppose the hike in milk prices. Earlier, it had also organized an agitation to condemn the rise in prices of petrol and diesel. The group planned to give one bag of milk to a person who raised a slogan against price rise, two bags if the person showed a selfie with a corporator, three for a selfie with a MLA, five for one with CM and 10 if one was clicked with the PM. While police did not stop the event, it took action later. Vyas said that sufficient safety measures were taken at the venue including following social distancing and hand sanitisation. The offence however mentions that the guidelines were not followed and a man Jignesh Nayak had also complained regarding this to the police. Vyas said that Nayak had got 10 bags of milk and had complained later. “It is evident that he had been sent by persons from the ruling party. The offence is uncalled for and we will not take bail,” he said. The group has also demanded an offence to be registered against BJP leaders in the city. It alleged that an event was held in Gorwa by the BJP in which Covid guidelines were violated. “Why was the BJP event ignored? It was attended by top BJP officials in the city. We have submitted a complaint against it,” Vyas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/group-booked-for-holding-agitations-against-inflation/articleshow/84154081.cms||---
---||Mumbai||The priest who lived for the poor||RANCHI: As a 28-year-old Jesuit priest, Fr Stan Swamy first arrived in Jharkhand, then a part of undivided Bihar, to “live and understand” the life of the Ho tribe in Chaibasa. What he saw and experienced then led him to become the voice of the poor and marginalised until his death in judicial custody at the age of 84 on Monday. Colleagues and admirers recalled how Fr Swamy, while studying Ho life, felt the need to further sharpen his understanding of academic sociology and went to Belgium to pursue a one-year course in the subject. Though he was selected for a doctoral degree in sociology there, he preferred to return to Chaibasa and apply his knowledge to the service of humanity. “I first met him in Bengaluru in the 1980s when he was director of the Indian Social Institute (ISI). He drove down in a jeep to receive me. A real humble gesture,” social activist Balaram said. “Later, In the 1990s, he came to Jamshedpur and stayed at Mango as our neighbour,” he added. Fr Swamy would collect clippings of newspaper reports about the “oppression” of tribal communities. “It’s time for me to be active in anti-displacement movements,” Balaram said, quoting Fr Swamy. Many activists engaged in campaigns for tribal rights were of the view that Fr Swamy, born in faraway Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu, chose to live in Jharkhand when campaigns against land acquisition for the Netarhat field firing range and the Koylakaro project began in the early 90s. He found a place to stay at the Agriculture Training Centre (ATC) run by Jesuits at Namkom in Ranchi. Once settled at the ATC, he founded Bagaicha, an organisation to fight for the cause of the poor and deprived, and started championing the adivasis’ fight for constitutional rights. “Bagaicha got its own office in 2006,” Fr Tony, director of the ATC, said. In the following years, Fr Swamy associated himself with almost every campaign for tribal and Dalit rights. He headed the Ranchi unit of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties and extensively worked for the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota). He wrote a book based on the case studies of Adivasis sent to prison under “Pota without evidence”. Fr Swamy was steadfast in his support for the rights of undertrials in prison. While engaged in the Jangal Bachao Andolan, he later highlighted the plight of thousands of Adivasis jailed for violating forest laws. He also fought for the Forest Rights Act and supported the implementation of the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act. The Jesuit priest-turned-activist had a taste of strong government measures when he led the Adivasis’ fight for administrative autonomy in Scheduled areas, popularly known as “Pathalgarhi movement.” He, along with other campaigners, was slapped with numerous criminal cases by the then Raghubar Das government for their Facebook posts supporting the campaign. “We cannot identify him with any one particular movement. He would be the first one to raise his voice whenever there was a violation of civil rights,” Anand Kumar Singh, former general secretary of PUCL (Jharkhand), said. The death of one of Jharkhand’s most revered civil activists has both hurt and anger his admirer. In a tweet, chief minister Hemant Soren said, “Shocked to learn about the demise of Fr Stan Swamy. He dedicated his life to working for tribal rights. I had strongly opposed his arrest and incarceration. The Union government should be answerable for absolute apathy and non-provision of timely medical services, leading to his death.” Ranchi Archbishop Felix Toppo said, “The fact that Fr Stan Swamy, who was suffering from Parkinson’s disease, was arrested at the age of 84, refused bail for over seven months, not even allowed a sipper and finally contracted Covid inside the jail, is a sad reflection on those who had the innocent man arrested and the courts that refused to grant him bail.” Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM), a conglomeration of different rights bodies with whom Fr Stan was associated in several campaigns, said, “His death is murder by the state. We hold the NIA and the Union government wholly responsible and strongly condemn their role in Fr Stan’s death, which once again exposes the ‘fascist face’ of the BJP government at the Centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/the-priest-who-lived-for-the-poor/articleshow/84158400.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The power department personnel were at the spot visit to check a fault when the accident took place. The injured were rushed to hospital where the condition of three is said to be critical. Dr Vijendra Kumar, emergency medical officer, Saharanpur district hospital, said three of the four injured had received 60-80% burns and were admitted in the burn ICU. The jolt of electricity was so intense that cracks appeared on the walls of the house whose first floor is occupied by a family.

---||Nagpur||No sessions planned at Nagpur government CVCs for couple of weeks||NAGPUR: Citizens planning Covid vaccination through online booking from the comfort of their homes are an aggrieved lot as no slot is available on the Co-Win portal for the last couple of days. Slots are updated on the portal daily at 8am, 12pm, 4pm and 8pm by private and government hospitals. The continued shortage of doses has prompted government CVCs not to plan sessions in advance for a couple of weeks. As on Monday afternoon, less than 100 slots were available at a couple of government Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) for Monday and Tuesday, that too at far off places like Jamtha or Kuhi. By the time, citizens log in and search, only a few slots are left. This is forcing many to go the extra mile to get their jab. Interestingly, two sessions of Sputnik V were made available for July 14, which too were taken in no time. After 4pm, some more slots became vacant in private hospitals but it appeared citizens were preferring government CVCs. At some private centres, the available slots were for second dose. As per the NMC, Covishield won’t be available for any age group on Tuesday. Officials said the civic body is unsure when the stock would be available next. However, Covaxin for 18+ group would be available at select government CVCs. Some citizens feel the government CVCs must allow sessions in advance so that they can get a slot. Prapti Banerjee, a resident of KT Nagar, questioned surplus vaccines with private centres when stock is running dry at government hospitals. “This shows how bad governance benefits private parties at the cost of citizens. The Covid crisis has put a lot of financial stress on people. Hike in prices of various things, from petrol to cooking oil and everything in between, has broken the financial backbone of average households,” said Banerjee. Banerjee said private hospitals are benefiting due to ill planning at government hospitals. “Or may be it is being done intentionally,” said Banerjee. Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) convenor Dr Anup Marar said most citizens are facing issue of non-availability of vaccination slots and immediate booking. “This may be due to lack of enough vaccines and vaccination centres,” he said. “Union Government had released a SOP to ensure even small hospitals and clinics in remote areas can also commence vaccination. Unfortunately, there is no transparency in allocation of vaccines and selection criteria of centers therein,” he said. Dr Marar said till now only select centres are working because of which slots are getting booked immediately leading to panic situation. “People want to get themselves fully vaccinated before the projected third wave. If the vaccination does not commence as specified in new GR, government’s aim to get majority of public vaccinated by December will remain on paper.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-sessions-planned-at-govt-cvcs-for-couple-of-weeks/articleshow/84156256.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Bail plea of ‘love jihad’ accused rejected||VADODARA: A local court on Monday rejected the bail application of the man who arrested under the recently amended Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. It was the first case in the state under the new ‘love jihad’ law and the accused, who was booked for forcefully converting his wife and committing atrocities on her. He was arrested on June 18. “The bail was rejected on several grounds. I argued that the man is accused of serious crimes and he had illegally converted her. He also used abusive words for her caste and blackmailed the woman by threatening to make her nude videos viral,” said advocate Anil Desai, public prosecutor appearing for the complainant. Four days ago, the 25-year-old complainant had filed an affidavit in the court to grant bail to her husband. She had also claimed that her 21-year-old husband didn’t force her to convert and denied all the other allegations. “I argued that the woman’s signatures on the affidavit and the FIR were different. And the affidavit was prepared some days before the bail application was filed. The woman must have been under pressure from the accused’s family to file the affidavit. The court didn’t consider her affidavit,” Desai said. The woman had on June 17 filed a complaint at Gotri police station against her husband, who called himself Sam Martin, on social media. She had alleged in the complaint that he befriended her in February 2019 and then expressed his wish to marry her. The complainant had alleged that he forced himself on her and they got married in February this year. The woman had accused her husband of converting her forcefully and he didn’t allow her to practice her religion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bail-plea-of-love-jihad-accused-rejected/articleshow/84154122.cms||---

This number would be identified taluka-wise, he said. The move to persuade those who haven’t taken the jab is part of the government’s target of vaccinating 100% of the eligible population by the end of this month. Sawant said that Tika Utsav 1.2 began in Goa on Monday, in consultation with primary health centres and locals. He also said that Tika Utsav 2.2 and 3.3 would be organised to complete the vaccination. The 1.2 nomenclature is to emphasise on the administration of the second dose of the vaccine for those who have completed 84 days since the first jab. The chief minister said that the state government’s current target is to find out how many people have been “left out” from the vaccination, and this would be known in two days. At present, all persons above 18 can walk in to get either the first or second dose at any vaccination centre. Citizens can contact their local representatives and health officials for the time table of the venue in their locality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-identify-those-who-havent-taken-jab/articleshow/84156305.cms||---

The BJP functionary said that the new policy was aimed at encouraging consumption of liquor, opening of more liquor outlets, and warned that this all could lead to creation of a new law and order problem in the capital. “It is unfortunate that to generate extra revenue, the AAP government is putting at risk the future of the young generation and seeking to create a new social disorder,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-urges-lg-to-review-nod-to-excise-policy/articleshow/84188806.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Ayush Prasad, CEO of the Zilla Parishad, said the PCV inoculation drive will also boost children's immunity during the Covid-19 pandemic. He said, “Our endeavour is to cover all children aged below one in our limits. The drive will start from July 12. Training sessions have started for staff at PHCs. We are yet to get a confirmation on the number of doses that'll be supplied by the state government.” District immunisation officer Dr Sachin Edke said for effective protection from pneumonia (a leading cause of death in children below 5 in the country), each child needs three doses of the vaccine: the first at six weeks of age, the second at 14 weeks and the final dose at nine months of age. Dr Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer, said, "At private hospitals, one dose of the PCV costs Rs 5,000. A child needs three doses. That works out to Rs 15,000 per child. This government drive will benefit every child below one across the district." A senior doctor from Sassoon General hospital, who didn't wish to be named, said PCV jabs should not mean protection from Covid in children. The doctor said, "The PCV acts against pneumonia-causing bacteria. As there is no Covid vaccine for children and as a precautionary measure against a possible third wave, the PCV would act as the first line of defence."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-to-start-anti-pneumonia-vax-drive-for-infants-from-july-12/articleshow/84156281.cms||Sandip Dighe

If it arrives in the capital by July 10, it would be the most delayed monsoon in 18 years. Rain activity is likely to start in Delhi from July 8. Track the pollution level in your cityIMD had earlier predicted an early onset of monsoon on June 15 but the advancement of monsoon slowed down. The monsoon was delayed as it crossed its normal arrival date of June 27. It is now expected around July 10 and the capital may witness the most delayed monsoon since 2002. The onset of monsoon in the capital took place on July 19 in 2002. In 2006, the monsoon had arrived on July 9. In 1987, Delhi had witnessed monsoon arrival on July 26, an all-time record delay. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said, “The monsoon is likely to arrive around July 10. The rainfall activity is predicted to increase in the region.” “Moist easterly winds in lower level from Bay of Bengal are likely to establish gradually over parts of eastern India from July 8 onwards. They are likely to spread into northwest India covering Punjab and north Haryana by July 10. Accordingly, southwest monsoon is likely to advance over remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, some more parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan and Delhi around July 10,” said IMD’s bulletin on Monday. The forecast of the Met department says there is a possibility of thundery development on Tuesday and Wednesday. However, light rain or thundershowers are expected from July 8 onwards. The rain will also help in bringing down the mercury as maximum temperature is expected to reach 34 degrees Celsius by July 11. On Monday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 39.5 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal. The minimum temperature settled at 28 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity oscillated between 62% and 40%. The overall Air Quality Index in the city was 149, which comes under moderate category. “Dust (PM10) will be the lead pollutant for the next three days. AQI is forecast to remain in the ‘moderate’ category for the next three days,” stated System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research.

They have claimed that the angle of family harassment narrated by the suicide note could be a conspiracy as the deceased were illiterates and did not know to write. They have asked the police to justify that the handwriting of the note was theirs. In a press release, president of NCHRO Ranjan Solomon and executive secretary of CSJP Fr Savio Fernandes, has called for an inquiry to be conducted by an independent commission for the sake of justice and fairness. The suicide note, alleged to be written by the deceased, is yet to be proven as authentic, they said. “We believe that the bodies constituted for the protection of human rights such as the Goa State Human Rights Commission, Goa State Women’s Commission, and State Police Complaint Authority should take suo moto cognisance and conduct an inquiry,” they further said. It may be recalled that last Tuesday, Halagappa Ambigera, 35, his wife Devamma, 28, and his brother Gangappa, 29, were found hanging at their rented house near MES college, Zuarinagar. Their family members had approached human rights’ activists alleging that police were pressurising them to collect the bodies after the postmortem was conducted. Devamma’s brother had told activists that he had seen Verna police torturing them physically in his presence in connection to an earlier theft case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vasco-deaths-police-asked-to-justify-authenticity-of-suicide-note/articleshow/84156332.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Month after house crash, Malad gets ward officer||MUMBAI: Nearly a month after an illegal structure crash killed 12 people, the BMC on Monday appointed a full-time assistant municipal commissioner (ward officer) for its P-North ward. The ward, which has jurisdiction over Malad where the illegal structure crashed, is the city’s most populous, and has not had a full-time ward officer since February. The BMC on Monday moved assistant municipal commissioner Makrand Dagaidkhair from E ward to the P-North ward. A C Prashant Gaikwad of D Ward has been asked to hold additional charge of E ward. Despite the rejig, important wards in the city don’t have full-time ward officers and so does BMC’s Removal of Encroachment department. With several wards in Mumbai functioning without full-time ward officers, and three ACs promoted as deputy municipal commissioners (DMCs) last week, BMC has asked executive engineers and deputy chief engineers to sign up work as ward officers. The Maharashtra Public Service Commissioner has also opened applications for recruiting officials in the BMC. While the BMC issued a circular inviting applications from a few other levels of officers last week, the public service commission too issued an advertisement inviting applications from candidates for the post of assistant civic commissioner. According to officials, BMC is now short of five ward officers. Currently there are no full-time ward officers in the E ward (Byculla), B (Mohammed Ali Road, Dongri) M-East (Govandi, Shivaji Nagar) and S (Bhandup) wards. Either executive engineers are holding charge of ward officers in these wards or assistant commissioners of adjacent wards are holding additional charge. Assistant commissioner Sanjog Kabre was promoted as deputy commissioner in February and since then assistant commissioner Santosh Dhonde of P-South ward has been holding the charge of P-North ward. “The city short of half a dozen assistant commissioners amid a pandemic, monsoon and elections coming reflects the collapse of the administration. It took the lives of 12 persons for the BMC to wake up and appoint a ward officer in P-North but what about other wards?,” said BJP Corporator Vinod Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-month-after-house-crash-malad-gets-ward-officer/articleshow/84156522.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Meanwhile, the health department has made it clear that “there will be a third wave, with size probably less than that of a second wave”. However, the health department has also warned that “there could be a wave piggyback on the existing second wave in the five northern districts”. The expected average daily number of cases in the state this week is also over 10,000, said the health department report presented before the review meeting on Monday. The chief minister directed the district collectors of Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod to ensure that the testing numbers are increased for the next one week. No decline in casesAs per the report presented at the meeting, 84,790 cases were reported in the week between June 28 and July 4.This is more than the cases reported between June 21 and 27, which was 79,500. The caseload was 95,157 in the week between June 7 and 13. The percentage of change in the active cases was more in Kozhikode (11.93%), Kasaragod (11.81%), Malappuram (10.64%), Wayanad (9.41%) and Kannur (9.12%). In these five districts, cases increased in three days from July 2 to 4 when compared to the cases reported from June 29 to July1. In Kannur and Kasaragod, the TPR increased to 11.77% and 14.96% from 10.44% and 13.24%, respectively. Third wave predictionThere will be a third wave, with size probably less than that of the second wave. Third wave may not be a challenge if 40% effective herd immunity could be achieved before the wave. A 30% herd immunity may also protect from challenging the third wave, unless the transmissibility of the virus is not more than 20% additional to the existing strain (maybe delta), said the report. The health department pointed out that the best way to achieve this is vaccination. If no third wave occurs over the existing second wave (piggybacking phenomenon), there could be a third wave in September-October as a post-Onam surge. The CM said that there are reports of people with comorbidities and children who have tested positive are not getting admitted in hospitals.There should be proper campaigns to get them admitted in Covid hospitals since they will require regular medical attention, he said. He urged the district administration and health authorities to ensure that the data of the people coming in contact with the Covid-positive people are strictly monitored.The data of the primary and secondary contacts should be strictly uploaded on the government portal.

The total pending fines run up to Rs 300 crore. Among the big names who cleared their dues is a former leading cricketer, who paid up Rs 10,000. “We drew up a list of the top 25,000 defaulters, some of whom haven’t paid fines running into several lakh rupees. Two policemen from each of our traffic divisions were handpicked and trained before sending them door to door,” said joint commissioner, traffic, Yashasvi Yadav. “We have drilled it into our staff that being courteous while visiting people’s homes is very important. They must address a motorist as ‘Sir’ or ‘Ma’am’,” he added. Carrying legal notices, 100 constables have been pounding the streets in teams since June 16. Each policeman wears a body camera, carries a walkie-talkie and informs a motorist whenever their conversation is being recorded. “In slum pockets, there is a possibility of our men being jeered or accused of demanding bribes. A video recording of the goings-on can serve as evidence in future,” said senior inspector Kishore Shinde of Mankhurd traffic division that has netted the highest fines of about Rs 20 lakh. The legal notices have details about payments to be made. People are shown photographs of their violation and given an opportunity to clear the dues on the spot -- via credit/debit card on an e-challan machine or online. They are also explained that non-payment could result in the case going to court and their driving licence getting cancelled. “Around 70% have paid on the spot. Some promised to pay up in a day or two. Almost everyone asked how they could check their dues in future and were asked to download the MumTraffic app,” said an officer. Some of the policemen recounted heart-warming experiences during door-to-door visits such as being thanked or offered a cup of tea. “At a corporate office in Dindoshi, the manager not only cleared pending dues of company-owned vehicles, but also got his subordinates to pay up fines on their personal vehicles,” said a constable. But there were hiccups too. In some instances, e-challans turned out to be incorrect as the make or registration number of the vehicle captured on camera did not match with the one belonging to the motorist. In other cases, the previous owner of a vehicle ended up getting a challan when despite selling the vehicle, the ownership had not been transferred. The department is trying to iron out these issues. The door-to-door campaign was planned to supplement the efforts of a “call centre” that operates out of the traffic police headquarters. Through reminders over phone, the call centre staff has managed to collect Rs 20 crore in three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-polite-traffic-cops-ring-doorbell-recover-rs-1-crore-dues-in-20-days/articleshow/84159449.cms||Nitasha Natu

Constable Vaishali Pundhir was rescued from the city's Sahawar police station and taken to a hospital by her colleagues. Doctors there said that she was out of danger. Meanwhile, SHO Rajesh Kumar Meena has refuted the allegation of harassment. He said, “Constable Vaishali’s duty was assigned at the local branch of State Bank of India. During inspection, she was found absent. When questioned about her absence, she was not able to provide any satisfactory answer. She tried to commit suicide to build pressure on me. Allegation of harassment is false.” According to sources, Vaishali sent out a message in an official WhatsApp group before attempting the suicide. She said in the note, “SHO is mentally torturing all the women constables. No one dares to confront him. I was not feeling well and told him that I would not be able to continue with the duty today. He didn’t listen to my pleas and officially reported that I was absent from duty without any prior information. I want strict action to be taken against him so that he doesn’t try to harass anyone.” District police have ordered an investigation into the matter. Superintendent of police (SP) Manoj Kumar Sonkar said, “The entire matter has been taken very seriously. Circle officer of Sahawar has been asked to conduct an investigation. On basis of the finding of the investigation, suitable action will be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/woman-cop-tries-to-kill-herself-at-thana-after-alleging-harassment-by-sho-probe-on/articleshow/84152296.cms||Deepak Lavania

Speaking on the occasion of Paswan’s birth anniversary at the LJP office on Monday, Paras said the former always focused on uplifting the downtrodden. “Senior Paswan served as the Union minister under the leadership of six Prime Ministers. He was elected with record margins twice, which shows his popularity,” he added. Paras further said, “Keeping the departed leader’s contributions in mind, I urge PM Narendra Modi to confer Bharat Ratna on him.” While responding to a query, the newly elected national president of the LJP claimed that he had received a call from Union home minister Amit Shah on the occasion of Paswan’s birth anniversary. Asked about the reason, he replied, “Raz ko raz rahne dijiye (keep it a secret).” The LJP office near the Patna airport was decked up with colourful lights on the occasion. Big posters and banners were put up on the roads leading to the party headquarters. “We had also made arrangements for a feast for the partymen,” Paras said and added that he would not stop his nephew Chirag Paswan from coming to the LJP office if he wished to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/confer-bharat-ratna-on-rvp-paras-to-pm/articleshow/84154237.cms||Ramashankar

Bicholim PI Mahesh Gadekar assured them arrests would be made within four days, after the statement of the minor survivor is recorded. Activists warned of an agitation if the police failed to trace the accused within four days. Meanwhile, the social activists gathered outside the Bicholim police station on a call given on social media by Shailendra Velingkar, son of former RSS chief Subhash Velingkar, demanded to have a conversation with the victim before producing her before the magistrate to record her statement on July 9. On June 25, Bicholim police had arrested Arman Khan, 19, from Bicholim, for raping a 15-year-old girl. The case came to light after GMC authorities informed Bicholim police about finding the minor girl pregnant while she was being medically examined. The incident had taken place more than six months ago. Shailendra Velingkar, son of former RSS chief Subhash Velingkar, who was among the protesters, submitted a memorandum to the police demanding that all others involved in the rape be booked soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/minor-girls-rape-bicholim-police-face-public-fury/articleshow/84156485.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Tehri officials bungle up Covid test sample collection||Dehradun: In what could be a repeat of fake Covid testing scam during the Kumbh mela, a case of irregularity in checking Covid-positive status of people coming into the state has emerged in Tehri. On Friday, Chandi Prasad Dabral, a resident of Kanatal in Tehri and going to Chamba was stopped by the officials of the health department who collected his contact details to conduct a rapid antigen test later. Dabral said that while his sample was never collected for the test, he received an SMS confirming that his sample had been collected. On receiving the SMS, Dabral registered a complaint with Tehri district administration. Now, an investigation has been initiated to find out details of each and every sample collected that day by calling on all the mobile numbers. Reacting to the issue, Dr Sanjay Jain, chief medical officer, Tehri, said, “The teams deployed for sample collection had first collected details of almost 35-36 people and then they started collecting the samples. The complainant and family members moved further without getting the test done but still got a message from our automated system that their samples have been collected. I have asked the officials concerned to check how this happened.” Only two out of four members of Dabral’s family came forward to get their tests, according to Dr Jain. However, Dabral’s argument is that how was an ID generated without actually taking the sample. “They might have done this in the past as well, who knows? This is how the virus spreads,” Dabral told TOI. Incidentally, ever since the Covid-19 curfew norms have been relaxed in the state, tourist footfall in the hills has significantly increased. And this kind of laxity in monitoring the tourists might lead to spread of the viral infection. Dr Pukhraj Chauhan, in-charge of Chamba-based Community Health Centre told to TOI, “An investigation in this matter has been set and we are calling all the numbers which were noted down in the past two weeks and we will keep a watch in the coming days to find out if the staff deployed in the field is being careless.” Meanwhile, a lab technician at the Government Doon Medical College hospital was removed from his job today for his involvement in another scam involving RT PCR tests. The technician along with some more members of the staff was collecting samples from home and charging people a hefty sum while testing the sample for free at the GDMC – the state’s biggest Covid facility. A letter has been sent by the principal of GDMC to the state government for taking action against a doctor who is also allegedly involved in the scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tehri-officials-bungle-up-covid-test-sample-collection/articleshow/84152320.cms||Shivani Azad

They died within an hour and a half of each other. They have left behind their 13-month-old daughter. According to police, 25-year-old Akash Singh allegedly hanged himself to death while his wife, Aarti (23), cut her wrist veins in the bedroom, where their daughter was sleeping. Preliminary investigation revealed that Aarti used to work at a call centre and quit her job to take care of her ailing mother-in-law, a cancer patient. After her death, Aarti wanted to resume her job, but her husband was against it. They were embroiled in a tussle over this matter for the past few days. While Aarti was pursuing BCom in the second year, Akash was working as an executive in Kotak Mahindra Bank. Akash’s father, Manohar Singh, said he got up at about 2:30 am on Sunday to go to the washroom but he found it locked from inside so he went out of the house. After going back to bed, he heard his daughter-in-law's voice. He got up again to find out what was the reason. He recalled,“Suddenly, I heard the voice of my daughter-in-law asking for help and when I reached there, I found her lying half inside and half outside the washroom. She was completely wet,” he said. Manohar Singh added, “She requested me to save Akash, who had committed suicide by hanging himself in the bedroom. When I reached there, he was dead and his body was lying on the bed.” Singh said then he suddenly noticed blood near the bed but Akash was not bleeding from anywhere. “I immediately returned to the washroom to find Aarti’s bleeding from the wrist. She was also vomiting,” he said, adding that with the help of his relative the couple was taken to SN Medical College, where doctors declared Akash as brought dead while Aarti was admitted for treatment. However, she could not survive,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/couple-ends-life-in-agra-leaves-behind-13-month-old-daughter/articleshow/84152333.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Dehradun||Covid curfew extended in Uttarakhand by a week; malls allowed to operate with 50% capacity||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government on Monday extended the ongoing Covid curfew in the state by another week, commencing from July 6. The latest edition of the Covid curfew will remain in place till July 13 (6 am), cabinet minister Subodh Uniyal said. This time, the government has allowed the opening of shopping malls with 50% capacity. In another major relaxation, the government has allowed cities and towns to observe the one-day shutdown on their traditional closure day. Earlier, shops in all cities and towns, except Nainital and Mussoorie, were mandated to remain closed on Sunday. “Each place has its own traditional weekly closure day. For instance, shops in Dehradun are closed on Sunday, in Doiwala on Wednesday, in Rishikesh on Thursday, in Srinagar on Friday, and so on. The weekly closure days were decided by traders. Therefore, this time, we have allowed them to keep markets shut on their traditional closure day,” said cabinet minister Subodh Uniyal said. However, multiplexes, swimming pools and single-screen theatres would continue to remain closed. The minister added that people should not drop guard against Covid-19. “We have been successful in bringing down the Covid-19 infection numbers but there should be no laxity. We must remember that experts have already cautioned against the third wave of the virus. The vaccination process has been intensified in the state and the required medical facilities are being provided to hospitals. I would like to request people to step out only when it’s necessary,” said Uniyal. Meanwhile, the state government has maintained that a Covid-19 negative report will continue to be mandatory for the people coming to the Himalayan state. “People coming to Uttarakhand should produce an RT-PCR/RAT/CBNAAT/TrueNat negative report (taken not before 72 hours of arrival). We must not take chances even as the number of Covid-19 infections is going down,” said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-curfew-extended-in-ukhand-by-a-week-malls-allowed-to-operate-with-50-capacity/articleshow/84152376.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid-free rural areas can open schools for VIII-XII||MUMBAI: Paving the way for the reopening of physical schools in the current academic year, the state government on Monday has permitted educational institutions in rural areas that are Covid-free to resume classes VIII to XII. These schools may reopen in a few weeks. Last year, secondary schools in the state had reopened in November but had to shut down by March due to the second wave. In Mumbai, schools continued online learning throughout. This year, schools across the state reopened on June 15 in the online mode (June 28 in Vidarbha). Citing learning loss, lack of internet connectivity, gaming addiction, the high dropout rate among girl students, child labour, domestic violence, and depression among children, especially in rural areas, the state asked gram panchayats to open physical schools in areas that have remained Covid-free since the past few weeks. The actual reopening of schools in rural areas may happen in two to three weeks as local bodies have to meet and even obtain consent from parents, said a state official. Educationalists have been demanding the reopening of physical schools for all students due to learning loss. The state was wary of reopening schools this year as the third wave was feared to target children. State officials said the third wave is now unlikely to affect children below 18 years. The notification stated children below 10 years were least likely to be affected. Educationists said children of younger classes need to get back at school to overcome future learning losses. According to the notification, attendance in schools will not be compulsory. Students can attend class on alternate days or in two batches. The classes can be conducted for main subjects. The standard operating procedure for schools includes one student per bench and not more than 15-20 students per class. Teachers will need an RT-PCR negative report to attend school. The arrangement will have to be made for a teacher’s stay near the school. Students too should avoid public transport to reach schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-free-rural-areas-can-open-schools-for-viii-xii/articleshow/84163140.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Gold smuggling down 83% in pandemic year||AHMEDABAD: With restrictions imposed on international air travel, the smuggling of gold has reduced by a significant 83% in the pandemic year. According to the data provided by the Ahmedabad customs, about 17kg of smuggled gold was detected in 2020-21 at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad. In all, 102kg of gold was smuggled through Ahmedabad and Surat airports in 2019-20. Due to hampered international travel, carriers who used to smuggle gold were unable to fly and the smuggling went down. “Usually, when gold prices surge, its procurement through unofficial channels goes up,” said a well-placed source. “Till January this year, the basic customs duty on gold was 12.5%. International market factors too caused gold prices to spike significantly.” The source added: “However, a lesser amount of gold than usual was procured through unofficial channels to be smuggled into India from other countries, due to the restrictions imposed by the Union government on international travel.” In the pandemic year, about 40 cases of gold smuggling were detected by the Ahmedabad customs and several consignments of gold, valued at Rs 7.3 crore, were seized. In 2020-21, gold prices touched a peak of Rs 58,000 per 10 gram on August 7, 2020. However, due to the restrictions in the channels, lesser gold was smuggled in.“Gold is typically smuggled in from countries such as the UAE, Qatar, and Thailand where the prices of the yellow metal are lower than in India,” said a senior official of the Ahmedabad customs. “Due to the strict restrictions on international travel, carriers who used to ferry gold in various forms could not travel back to foreign countries. So the overall gold smuggling went down.” Bullion traders, however, said that in the run-up to new laws coming into force, compliance improved and the procurement from unofficial channels dropped too. “The demand for gold was as such less throughout the year due to the pandemic’s recessionary situation. Laws on money laundering and tax collection at source came into force in October 2020,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). “E-invoicing was also made mandatory under the GST Act fully from January 1. In a bid to improve compliance, the procurement of gold has reduced through unofficial channels.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-smuggling-down-83-in-pandemic-year/articleshow/84156489.cms||Niyati Parikh

The IIME, which had been accorded the status of ‘Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation by the ministry of science and technology, is run by city-based Dr DK Taknet and his wife Sujata. The organisation, which published the biography of governor Mishra, has landed into a controversy following the forced sale of books to 27 vice-chancellors of state varsities on July 1. The couple has authored over a dozen high-value books that may not be available in the open market but can be seen in the book shelves of Union ministers, chief ministers, governors, foreign dignitaries and business houses. The research institute has branches in Pune and Delhi while a major centre is coming up on Jhalana Doongri in Jaipur. “Former CM Vasundhara Raje used to present our book ‘Jaipur-The Gem of India’ produced with the support of Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) to foreign dignitaries and others. Gehlot has not ordered for any book so far. The ministries do order this book. Our book ‘The Oil: Lightening Up Lives,’ which was launched by former petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan in Delhi, was supported by his ministry,” said Sujata Tanket, a researcher at IIME. Established in 1990, Taknet, who is MPhil in business administration from Rajasthan University, is known for his books on history and the Marwaris and has a huge experience in documenting business families. Tanket connections in the political space are also well established. Every major leader from former prime ministers PV Narasimha Roa, Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Manmohan Singh have testimonials appreciating their literary work. The research institute has never fallen short of resources for writing books. The resource base includes University Grants Commission, Indian Council of Social Sciences, Union ministries and corporate social responsibility funds from various business houses. Responding to a question to share their scientific and industrial research work, Tanket said primarily their research work dealt in the area of social sciences. The IIME website says it is an autonomous body and non-profit organisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/publishing-house-that-is-at-the-centre-of-controversy-over-guvs-book-launch/articleshow/84156523.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Cops arrest two criminals after 1 km chase, 4 dacoits flee||PUNE: An alert woman’s timely call to police led to the arrest of two criminals in the early hours of Monday after a kilometre-long chase from the Pancharatna society, off Paud Road, to the Ajanta Avenue society, following a dacoity by six persons. The four others managed to escape but the police seized gold ornaments and sharp weapons from the arrested duo — Bablusingh Prabhusingh Tak (27) and Ujalasingh Prabhusingh Tak (30) — both from Wanowrie, besides an MUV the criminals had earlier stolen from Khadki and used for reaching the society. “Bablusingh has 63 cases of property and body offences. Ujalasingh has 70 similar cases,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said. A few months ago, they were released on bail. Deputy commissioner of police Pournima Gaikwad said, “The gang-of-six had broken into two flats at the Pancharatna society after snapping the building’s power supply around 2.20am. They could not find much in a flat but got ornaments in the other, belonging to a senior couple. The duo were at their son’s house.” Gaikwad said, “The woman in a nearby building alerted the police and two beat marshals reached the spot. They also noticed the activities and called a backup force. The police waited in the parking area for the gang to come down, while the woman provided them real-time details. Soon after they came down, the police pounced on them. One of the gangsters was held and the other five ran crossed the Paud Road and moved into the Ajanta Avenue society. Our team nabbed one more suspect there. His associates ran away.” Saurabh Kadam, one of the society residents, said he was watching television when he heard some noise in the neighbouring flat. He initially thought his neighbours had returned. He peeped through the eyehole of his door after hearing a loud noise and saw four men in front of his neighbours’ door. “The tube light in the passage was blinking. I woke up my wife, Rachana, and told her to call the police control room. I went to our main door to keep a watch on their actions,” he told TOI. Rachana said, “The police called me within a few minutes. I told them that the suspects were inside our neighbours’ flat. The policeman told me that they had laid a trap downstairs.” “The suspects spent around 15 minutes in the flat and went up. I immediately informed the police. As there was an office in that flat, they did not get much and came down within five minutes. I alerted the police immediately,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-arrest-two-criminals-after-1km-chase-four-dacoits-flee/articleshow/84156518.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Fewer taxis that were available asked for exorbitant fares. As a last resort, she had to hop on to a small goods vehicle along with 15 others which ferried her till Shyambazar for Rs 30. Ashish Biswas hopped on to a cycle van in Mullickbazar along with four others to reach his residence in Taltala. He paid a fare of Rs 50. Kolkatans used various modes of transport to reach their destinations in the absence of adequate number of buses and auto-rickshaws. According to regular passengers, government buses were getting filled up to capacity at their starting points only making it impossible for anybody to get up from anywhere in between. “We are left with no other option but to board goods vehicles along with several other people to reach our workplaces in the morning and back home in the evening. Even they are charging a lot but it is still affordable compared to yellow taxis which are asking for an extra Rs 100 to Rs 150,” said Kakoli Ghosh. The state government withdrew some restrictions allowing buses to ply from July 1 carrying 50% of their passenger load. While government buses started ferrying passengers, private buses stayed off the roads over demands of fare hike. Auto rickshaws and taxis ripped off commuters sensing huge demand. “Our employers have made attendance mandatory from July 1. They do not want to understand that the situation outside is not at all conducive. We are paving way for the third wave in the way we are commuting,” said Mohammad Akram, a vendor in Canning Street. Cops had to intervene when people waiting for buses spilled on the road along several points on CR Avenue, Chandni, Esplanade, Dalhousie, Lenin Sarani and S N Banerjee Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/desperate-commuters-look-for-alternative-modes/articleshow/84154397.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||India||Owaisi & Mayawati attack Bhagwat on his remarks, Naqvi hails him||NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's comments that the DNA of all Indians is the same and those asking Muslims to leave the country cannot call themselves Hindus drew reactions on Monday from opposition and some community leaders who said actions on the ground should match words. However, Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi hailed RSS chief's remarks, saying the RSS ideology has always been full of harmony, brotherhood and nationalism, and it was the propaganda by "Bharat bashing brigade" that had painted a negative picture of the Sangh. Addressing an event, organised by the minority wing of RSS on Sunday, Bhagwat said the DNA of all Indians is the same, irrespective of religion, and urged Muslims not to get "trapped in the cycle of fear" about Islam being in danger in India. Those asking Muslims to leave the country cannot call themselves Hindus and those indulging in lynching people in the name of cows must know that they are against Hindutva, the RSS chief added. Reacting to Bhagwat's remarks, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said if he is true to his words, he must give directions that all those BJP leaders who have "harassed" innocent Muslims be removed from their posts, while AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi alleged that cowardice, violence and murder "are an integral part of Godse's Hindutva thinking" and the lynching of Muslims is also the result of that. On the RSS chief's DNA remark, BSP supremo Mayawati said there is a difference between what the Sangh Parivar, the BJP and the government say and their actions. She also said the RSS chief's statement was like "Muh mein Ram, bagal mein chhuri", a Hindi expression that roughly translates to someone who is two-faced. Emphasising that in the past too, those in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), through their service to the people, did a lot of work for the unity of the society, Naqvi said but the 'gumrahi (misleading) gang', not only in India but in the world, always conspired to break the brotherhood and social fabric by creating hullabaloo about the Sangh. Some opposition leaders also called on the Centre to frame a strong law against mob lynching. "Actions should match words. If they are so serious about mob lynching, why don't they frame a law against mob lynching and also ensure it is implemented," BSP's Lok Sabha MP Danish Ali told PTI. Congress' minority cell chief Imran Pratapgarhi said his party has always demanded that there should be a strong law against lynching. "Now that Mohan Bhagwat has also condemned lynching, I appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he should bring a law against lynchings so that such 'terror acts' can be reined in," he said. Strongly reacting to Bhagwat's remarks on lynchings, Owaisi said those criminals who carried out lynchings may not know the difference between a cow and a buffalo but the names of Junaid, Akhlaq, Pehlu, Rakbar, Alimuddin were enough for them to kill. "This hatred is the product of Hindutva and these criminals have the patronage of a government backing Hindutva", the president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) alleged. Owaisi referred to a number of violent attacks on Muslims allegedly by cow vigilantes over the past few years. "Alimuddin's killers are garlanded at the hands of a Union Minister... the tricolor is laid over the body of Akhlaq's killer... a mahapanchayat is convened in support of the killers of Asif…," he claimed. "Cowardice, violence and murder are an integral part of Godse's Hindutva thinking. The lynching of Muslims is also the result of this thinking," Owaisi said in a series of tweets in Hindi. Tagging a report on the RSS chief's remarks, Digvijaya Singh said, "Mohan Bhagwat ji, will you pass on these views to your disciples, preachers, Vishwa Hindu Parishad/Bajrang Dal workers also? Will you pass on these teachings to Modi-Shah ji and BJP chief minister also?" "Mohan Bhagwat ji, if you make it obligatory for your disciples to follow this thought, I will become your admirer," the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said. Alleging that the RSS had instilled "hatred" between Hindus and Muslims, Singh said it was now not easy to remove the "seeds of hatred" that have been sown against Muslims from "Saraswati Shishu Mandir to the intellectual training provided by the Sangh." Referring to Bhagwat's remarks giving primacy to being Indian, he asked Bhagwat to explain this to his disciples first as they "advised me to go to Pakistan many times". Taking a dig at Bhagwat's remarks, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera tweeted,"elders have rightly stated about this organization: They don't do what they say and don't say, what they do." Aam Aadmi party MLA Somanth Bharti posted a video on Twitter which showed anti-Muslim slogans purportedly being raised at an event and said that in view of his recent brotherhood talk, "I would like to request Sri Mohan Bhagwat of @RSS_Org to lodge a police complaint against such attempts to poison minds of youth". "If he doesn't do a thing against such attempts then his brotherhood talks are meaningless," he added. Shahi Imam of Delhi's prominent Fathepuri Masjid, Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, said statements on Hindu-Muslim unity are welcome but actual targeting of Muslims on the ground must stop. "We believe the targeting of Muslims should stop. We don't say it is being done by people of Hindutva, Hindus, Sikhs. Whomsoever is doing it, action should be taken against them...He should also say that it is saddening to see such incidents," he said. Kamal Faruqui, member All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said Bhagwat's statement would be meaningless until backed by action as those targeting Muslims are roaming freely. "Mr Bhagwat should ask the Home Minister to take strong action against those people who are indulging in spreading hatred. If action is taken then such statements have value otherwise they are just nice jumlas," he said. On lynchings and other such incidents, Naqvi said it is unfortunate that the "Bharat bashing brigade and misleading gang" have played a role in portraying criminal acts as communal incidents. "A criminal incident is a criminal incident. Such an incident should not be projected as a communal incident. Action should be taken in such criminal incidents. Mohan Bhagwat has said the same thing," the Union minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/owaisi-mayawati-attack-bhagwat-on-his-remarks-naqvi-hails-him/articleshow/84160341.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Father Stan Swamy, the priest who lived and fought for poor||RANCHI: Father Stan Swamy, known for giving voice to the poor and marginalised people, would always be remembered as a friend of the poor-tribal and Dalit communities. He ultimately had to die in custody for “antagonizing political power corridors”. Born in 1937 in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, Swamy’s life is an example of relentless activism for safeguarding human rights, particularly of the tribal and the oppressed, and in turn become a victim of “institutionalized maiming” of such voices, people who knew him said. At the age of 20, he became a Jesuit priest and committed his life to the poor and marginalized people. Eight years later, he visited Chaibasa in the Kolhan division of erstwhile Bihar to live and understand the life of the Ho tribe, which dominated the region. For a brief period, he went to Manila in the Philippines to obtain a master’s degree in sociology and came back to Chaibasa again to learn the life and challenges of the tribal community. In the course of his interaction with the community, Fr Stan realized the need to further sharpen his understanding of academic sociology and went to Belgium to pursue a one-year course on the subject. He was chosen for a doctoral degree in sociology there but Fr Stan decided to come back and apply his knowledge gained to the service of humanity and returned to India, once again choosing Chaibasa as his work area. From Chaibasa, Fr Stan went to Bangalore where he served as the director of Indian Social Institute (ISI) for around 15 years but his love for the tribals of Chhotanagpur pulled him to Jharkhand (then Bihar) once again. Social activist Balram, who had witnessed Fr Stan’s journey in his earlier days, remembers him as a soft-spoken person who never thought for his personal needs. “I met him in Bangalore, now Bengaluru, in the 1980s when he was the director of the ISI. He drove down in a jeep to receive me which was a real humble gesture on his part,” Balram said. “In the 1990s, he came to Jamshedpur and stayed at Mango and we were neighbours,” Balram said, remembering how he would bring paper cuttings about the oppression of tribal communities or stories related to their oppression for land acquisition. It was the time when I was active with the anti-displacement movement,” he said. Other activists in Jharkhand believe that Fr Stan decided to settle down in Jharkhand after he noticed the tribal movement against the Netarhat field firing range and the Koylakaro project in the early 90s. Fr Stan was given a place to stay at the Agriculture Training Centre (ATC) operated by the Jesuits at Namkom in Ranchi in the late 1990s. From there, he laid the foundation of Bagaicha and started giving voice to the tribal people and helped them build up a movement to demand for their constitutional rights. “Bagaicha got a formal shape with the inauguration of its building in 2006,” said Father Tony, the director of the ATC. Later, Fr Stan could be seen almost everywhere whenever there was a protest of the tribal and the Dalit against the oppression by the state. He chaired the Ranchi unit of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties and extensively worked for repealing of the contentious Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) and also authored a book based on the case studies of tribals pushed behind bars under POTA without evidence. He had also championed the cause of undertrial prisoners and while working with the ‘Jangal Bachao Andolan’, he had highlighted the plight of several thousand tribals sent to jail for violation of the forest Act. He was also instrumental in pressing for the Forest Rights Act and lent his voice for the implementation of the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act. His support to the tribal people seeking administrative autonomy in Scheduled areas through the Pathalgarhi movement was met with an iron hand from the state government and cases were lodged against him and several other activists by the then Raghubar Das government for Facebook “posts”. Former general secretary of PUCL Jharkhand, Anand Kumar Singh, said Fr Stan was obsessed with the idea of implementing the constitutional provisions at the grassroots where people are usually unaware of their rights. “We cannot isolate him with any particular movement. Fr Stan was the first to raise his voice whenever there was a violation of civic rights,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/father-stan-swamy-the-priest-who-lived-and-fought-for-poor/articleshow/84154974.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Speaking as chief guest on the occasion, the party’s Jharkhand in-charge, Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav, said Lalu formed RJD in 1997 to empower the Dalits, the poor and the weaker sections of society. He said, “Lalu fought for the poor, the minorities, the Dalits and the Adivasis. I call upon all party workers to take the slogan of social justice, brotherhood, communal harmony and unity to every household.” Yadav claimed that the people of Bihar had given their mandate to Tejashwi to rule Bihar but the Janta Dal (U) and BJP combine snatched it and formed the government. He said the current government would collapse due to its “wrongdoings” and a Tejashwi-led government would come to power. Jharkhand minister and party MLA Satyanand Bhokta said the government was functioning well under the leadership of chief minister Hemant Soren. Former minister Radha Krishna Kishore said RJD should plan to fight more seats in Jharkhand in the next assembly election. On the occasion, messages by Lalu from Delhi and Tejashwi from Patna were also broadcast. State president of the party, Abhay Singh, inaugurated the function and the party leaders also paid homage to late Ram Vilas Paswan of LJP on his birth anniversary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rjd-foundation-day-party-resolves-to-take-lalus-messages-to-masses/articleshow/84154789.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Megaliths are large prehistoric stones which are erected at burial sites in memory of the departed. Superintending archaeologist Shiv Kumar Bhagat -- who led the ASI team which conducted a survey of the site -- while talking to TOI over phone from Ranchi, said, “Once we get the go-ahead from our Delhi office, work will begin for conservation of the site. Once that is done, researchers and students can conduct research work here. We will also set up some basic facilities so that visitors can come to this site.” He added, “The Hurnali region has many such important sites but some of them got damaged due to the negligence of the villagers.” Sources said that Chatra MP Sunil Kumar Singh had met ASI director-general in January for conservation of the megalith site, following which Singh’s team visited the site, conducted a survey and prepared a report, accordingly. Well-known Hazaribag-based writer and megalithic researcher Subhashis Das, who discovered the Pankri Barwadih megalithic site and an equinox point in Hazaribag, termed the Hurnali megaliths as ‘peculiar in shape’ and said, “I always call them the temple of ancient India which needed thorough research to reveal the many facts related to them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-asi-sends-proposal-to-develop-itkhori-megalith-site/articleshow/84154822.cms||---

While the final draft of the new Jharkhand Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy (JIPP) is due to be tabled before the state cabinet for its approval, the state industries department is currently formulating four new sector-specific policies in an attempt to draw investments. “Consultations with stakeholders, which include trade and commerce bodies and members from the MSME and heavy industries fraternities, have been completed. We are due to put up the JIPP before the cabinet very soon for its approval,” said a senior officer in the department on anonymity. Besides the JIPP, at least four new policies - Jharkhand Industrial Park Policy, Jharkhand Purchase Policy, Jharkhand Auto and Electronic Vehicles Policy and Jharkhand Food Processing Industries Policy – are currently being drafted. Apart from that, as many as three policies, which were approved during the tenure of former chief minister Raghubar Das, will be revisited. Chief minister Hemant Soren, who holds the portfolio of state industries minister, has been criticized by the opposition BJP and youngsters on social media for failing to keep up to his 2019 poll promise of providing five lakh jobs within the first year of his tenure. Though the government has blamed the sluggish pace of the scheme of things on the Covid-19 pandemic, industry insiders have pointed out other reasons. “There is widespread corruption in the rank and file. Though the government claims that all new clearances and licenses will be issued online through Single Window system, an entrepreneur invariably has to wait for months and pay hefty amounts to the officials to get their clearances,” Ramesh Sharma (name changed on request), a Jamshedpur based industrialist, told TOI. In his review meeting of the industries department, Soren had directed the officials to ensure that the sick industrial units, which are operational in the industrial parks of Ranchi, Adityapur and Bokaro, are revived. “However, if one unit closes down, the plot is not being put up for auction. This is a gross violation of the industrial policy rules. We have raised several complaints to the industry secretary (Puja Singhal), but nothing has happened,” a city based entrepreneur said. Singhal could not be reached for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/govt-mulls-policy-to-boost-industry-sector-entrepreneurs-seek-reforms/articleshow/84164539.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Goa||Goa: No extension, CZMP public hearing as per schedule, says NGT||PANAJI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has dismissed Goa Foundation’s review application, praying for a time limit of six months, instead of an August 31 deadline of to finalise the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Goa. Goa Foundation had sought the extended time to prepare the coastal plan stating that it is to ensure a fair public hearing and sufficient time to finalise the plan. The state government has announced a public hearing on July 8, after the Tribunal, in its order on May 31, had ordered a fresh hearing, upholding the argument by Goa Foundation that the hearing on March 7 violated the laws. “The public should not be penalised by a hasty public hearing and a shoddy final job, merely because the state government did not complete the CZMP on time, several years ago as it should have been done,” the application stated. The GCZMA cannot be faulted for delay in preparing the plan, as the state delivered maps to it on January 28, 2021, the petition stated. It further said that the GCZMA needs adequate time to amend 254 plans in 4,000 scale after the hearing, appraise the draft CZMP itself, then send all its recommendations to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai, which prepared the plan for adding details and that the state government can submit the plan to the ministry only after receiving a corrected version, which is not feasible by August 31. The plethora of glaring errors in the draft CZMP prepared by NCSCM - which the tribunal also noted in its order dated May 31 - has elicited 5,000 objections. A public hearing held in a hurried manner would severely impact coastal communities comprising especially those in the fisheries and tourism trade, Goa Foundation said. The hearing must be carried with utmost sincerity and cannot be treated lightly as 80% of Goa’s population lives in the coastal belt, the application stated. The time limit of six months to prepare the CZMP is as per the clause 5 of the CRZ notification 2011.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-extension-czmp-public-hearing-as-per-schedule-ngt/articleshow/84157029.cms||---

The dark clouds have vanished from the city leaving behind uncomfortable humidity and heat. Similar weather is expected to continue in Bhopal and Madhya Pradesh till July 10. North MP in Gwalior and Chambal divisions and the North West MP in Bundelkhand are seeing temperatures around 40 degrees Celsius and above. “Sun rays fall straight on earth when humidity is very less and varies from 50% in the evening to 65% in the morning. This creates very uncomfortable weather conditions,” Met officials said. The weather department predicts a revival of rainfall around July 10. As of now, there is no active weather system in Bay of Bengal of the Arabian Sea, which is favourable for rainfall. But one system seems to be developing slowly in the Bay of Bengal, which is likely to bring rainfall next week. IMD has released a yellow alert for rainfall in Annuppur, Dindori, Seoni, Mandla, Balaghat Betul, Harda Dhar, Ujjain, Dewas and Shajapur districts during next 24 hours. Bhopal willhave to put up with hot and humid days with day temperature around 36 degrees Celsius.

The searches started on Sunday night and were underway at some locations till late on Monday. The crackdown came after the CBI filed a fresh FIR in the case on July 2, naming 16 government officials and 173 firms and private entities as accused. Sources in the CBI said the FIR was lodged following revelations that surfaced while probing the original FIR in the scam lodged in 2017 in which only eight engineers were named as accused. The searches were carried out in Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Gorakhpur, Agra, Etah and Moradabad. The CBI teams also searched a property each in Alwar district of Rajasthan and in Kolkata. The premises searched included properties of two chief engineers, four superintending engineers, an executive engineer, assistant engineers who were posted with the irrigation department between 2015 and 2017 and had been associated with execution of the project. Premises of private entities associated with the scam were also searched. The July 2 FIR is in connection to the work related to the Gomti Riverfront Park that was executed between 2015 to March 2017 amounting to Rs 407 crore. “Probe revealed that Notice Inviting Tenders (NIT) for these jobs were not published in national newspapers as required and fake letters were allegedly sent to the information department instead,” the CBI stated in the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-searches-38-locations-in-3-states-linked-to-sp-era-scam/articleshow/84160450.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The department has also stated that in the case of khazan lands, the high tide line will be restricted to the baandhs and will not affect activities inland, beyond the baandhs, as per the fear expressed by some local communities. “Khazan lands are low-lying agricultural lands protected from the neighbouring estuary with the help of baandhs and sluice gates. The CZMP denotes the high tide line with the use of baandhs,” the department said. Further, it reiterated that mangroves that have come up in khazan lands will not have any buffer areas. The hearings will be held at SGPDA Grounds, Margao for South Goa and at Campal Parade Grounds, Panaji for North Goa.

---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad assault video: Now, police send notice to Twitter grievance officer who stepped down||GHAZIABAD: After dispatching a couple of notices to Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari, Ghaziabad police have sent a third notice – this time to the microblogging site’s former grievance officer in India Dharmendra Chatur – over circulation of videos in which a 72-year-old man assaulted on June 5 alleged it was a hate crime. Twitter India, a news portal and six individuals were booked in an FIR filed on June 15 over the sharing of what police claim was an “unverified” video. Police ruled out a hate crime, saying they had evidence to show that the victim, Abdul Samad and the main accused in the assault, Pravesh Gujjar, had known each other and Pravesh had a personal grudge. The notice to Chatur was issued under Section 41A of the CrPc. Notices to appear before police and record statements were also sent to Congress’s Salman Nizami, Maskoor Usmani, Shama Mohamed, who were named in the FIR, and the editor of the news portal. Akhilesh Kumar Mishra, the SHO of Loni border police station, said the notices were sent on July 2. “They have been directed to record their statements at the police station within seven days, failing which action can be initiated against them,” Mishra added. Chatur, who was interim resident grievance officer of Twitter India, had stepped down in June within a month of his appointment. Asked why a notice was issued to him, Ghaziabad police chief Amit Kumar Pathak told TOI, “The assault and beard chopping incident took place in Loni on June 5 and the fake video was circulated over the next few days. We have reasons to believe that during that point, Dharmendra Chatur was the grievance officer of Twitter India. In case there is a change in position, it is for Dharmendra Chatur to respond to the notice and state the facts through official channels.” So far, two others booked in the case – Alt News co-founder Md Zubair and journalist Saba Naqvi – have recorded their statements. Ghaziabad police sent a notice to Maheshwari under Section 166 of the CrPc on June 17 and a second one on June 21 under Section 41A after rejecting the Twitter India MD’s request to appear vi a video call. Maheshwari subsequently moved the Karnataka high court for relief. Hearings are on. Police have, meanwhile, filed a chargesheet in court against 11 accused in the assault case, including Pravesh. Charges have also been filed against Samajwadi Party functionary Ummed Phelwan Idris, who is accused of instigating Samad to make those allegations and giving a communal twist to the assault. Police later invoked provisions of the National Security Act against Idris and sections of the Gangster Act against Pravesh and another accused, Kallu Gujjar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/ghaziabad-assault-video-now-police-send-notice-to-twitter-grievance-officer-who-stepped-down/articleshow/84157135.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh not using Section 66(a) of IT Act repealed by Supreme Court, says ADG Yogesh Chaudhary||BHOPAL: Police in MP are not using section 66 (a) of the IT Act, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015. The apex court had expressed "shock" that the scrapped law is still being used in the country while hearing an application moved by Peoples' Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) and issued a notice to the Union government seeking a response. State’s ADG, cyber law, Yogesh Chaudhary, when asked whether the repealed law is being used by MP police as well to book people for "posting objectionable posts on social media" said, "We are not using it at least in the cyber cell headquarters and in the districts, too. I think there is enough awareness by now that the law has been repealed by the Supreme Court and it is not to be used. There can be some cases under the repealed law which are in the court or where investigation is underway, but as far as I know, it's not being used in MP at least for the last couple of years. I don't have the database but I can safely say that we in MP are not using it, he said. Chaudhary said "Earlier, there could have been instances, when I was in the intelligence wing, I had seen such cases and brought it to the notice of the officials concerned, but, I have not seen it happening in at least the past two years", he said. Chaudhary said the cyber police receives applications everyday seeking action against someone under section 66 (a) but "we ask them to go and file defamation suit or take recourse to some other legal remedy", he said. Chaudhary, however, said that MP never had the issue of misuse of section 66 (a) of the IT Act which prompted the apex court to strike it down as ultra vires. The Supreme Court came down heavily on the union government on Monday over people still being booked under Section 66A of the IT Act, calling it "amazing and shocking." A bench, comprising Justice RF Nariman, Justice KM Joseph and Justice BR Gavai, also issued a notice to the centre and listed the matter for hearing after two weeks. PUCL said in its application in the Supreme Court that despite the court's subsequent order in February 2019 directing all the state governments to "sensitise" their police personnel about the March 24, 2015, judgement of the court in which section 66 (a) of the IT Act was repealed, the section continues to be used in police stations as well as in trial courts across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-not-using-section-66a-of-it-act-repealed-by-supreme-court-says-adg-yogesh-chaudhary/articleshow/84160452.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

According to MahaMetro, the work of the Kamptee Road double-decker flyover’s viaduct is nearly 82% over. The first double-decker flyover built by the agency was on Wardha Road. Both have been funded by National Highways Authority of India. According to officials, the Kamptee Road flyover starts at LIC Square and ends at Automotive Square. Nagpur Metro’s viaduct of Reach 2 (Sitabuldi Interchange to Automotive Square) is being constructed above the flyover. Having a length 5.3 kilometres, the total cost is Rs573.16 crore. “While the city will be linked with Kanhan under Phase-II of Metro project, those travelling in the direction of Ramtek, Seoni, Jabalpur etc will not have to travel by the congested Kamptee Road. If the long distance traffic towards Mansar travels by the flyover, the congestion on Kamptee Road will be reduced benefiting those living in localities on both sides of this road,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kamptee-road-double-decker-flyover-to-be-ready-soon-mahametro/articleshow/84155010.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Petrol makes Rs 100 debut in Kolkata, 19 of Bengal’s 23 districts||KOLKATA: The price of a litre of petrol crossed the 100-rupee mark at two fuel stations in the city and at 19 of the state’s 23 districts on Monday. At most city petrol pumps, the price was a hair’s breadth shy of three digits, hovering between Rs 99.84 and Rs 99.90. “The way the price of petrol was rising, we were expecting it to hit the century mark in a week or so. That it happened on Monday itself took us by surprise,” said Sheojee Prasad, manager of Cossipore Service Station at Chiria More on BT Road, one of the two stations where the milestone was reached. The reason for the price difference at the two pumps — both of HP and in the same area, between Chiria More and the Sinthee crossing — from that of other pumps boils down to one reason: transportation cost. Oil tankers, carrying the fuel from the loading point at Budge Budge, are having to travel longer in order to reach fuel stations on the other side of the Tala bridge, as it’s closed for repairs. “Among the several components that add up to retail fuel price, the price variation is basically determined by the distance between the fuel-loading points and dispensing stations,” said an official of a fuel marketing company. An official of a fuel marketing company said: “In Kolkata, the price breached Rs 100 in only two petrol pumps, where there was additional travel cost involved because of the Tala bridge closure. Petrol was sold at Rs 100.04 at both those fuel stations on Monday.” Interestingly, other petrol pumps on BT Road, less than 3km from these two pumps, continued to sell fuel at Rs 99.84 on Monday. “The fuel station at Dunlop, which is less than 3km from the one at Sinthee crossing, has its fuel loading point at Mourigram in Howrah, which is closer than the one between those two pumps and Budge Budge,” the official added. As many as 19 of Bengal’s 23 districts also witnessed the ‘petrol century’. The increase of 49 paise per litre — the 35th hike in two months — has also pushed commodity prices to a new high. On Monday, TOI had reported that fuel stations across the city were seeking new electronic display panels that accommodate five digits, without which the maximum price that can be currently shown correctly is Rs 99.99. With the price of petrol crossing three digits, the price chart display panel (not the dispensing panel, which can display many more digits) at Friends Auto Service in Sinthee crossing got shut down automatically. “Even last year, we had sold petrol at Rs 72.50. Now, it’s shot up to Rs 100. As a result, our sales have come down like anything. Around this time last year, we used to sell around 2,200 litres of petrol per day. This time, there is an average sale of barely 1,600 litres per day,” said Sanjoy Konar, station manager, Friends Auto Service. The unprecedented cost of fuel has also burnt a hole in middle-class and upper-middleclass pockets. Bank official Saikat Das, who used to commute from Sinthee to Bhowanipore every day in his car, has started using a two-wheeler to manage his budget. “I used to travel in my car but to manage expenses, I have been using my old motorbike for the last month,” Das told TOI. Another car owner, Moulik Zaveri, said he had started taking out his car less often to save on fuel expenses. Around this time last year, petrol in Kolkata was priced at Rs 73.88. At the start of the year, it was Rs 85.19 in Kolkata. It had dropped by 17 paisa in the election month — from Rs 90.77 to Rs 90.62 — but steadily rose after the elections. “The price of petrol has been rising constantly since the assembly elections, which has impacted sales,” said West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association vice-president Snehasis Bhowmik. “Petrol pump owners hardly get Rs 2.80 as commission, and the major portion of the money a customer pays goes into tax collected by the Centre and state. Sales of petrol have come down by 25% to 30% despite a rise in personal vehicle use during the pandemic. Sales should have grown but slipped because of the unprecedented price-rise. As a mark of protest, we will shut operations for 30 minutes between 7.30pm and 8pm on July 7.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/petrol-makes-rs-100-debut-in-city-19-of-bengals-23-dists/articleshow/84157350.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The ‘Twitter Storm’ was planned by the young environment activists of the city. “We wanted authorities to be aware of the consequences of mindless development activities in Ajni Vann. To draw their attention, people of Nagpur as well as other cities used Twitter as a medium and told various authorities loud and clear to Save Ajni Vann,” said activist Kunal Mourya. The ‘Twitter Storm’ saw participation of people from all walks of life, all raising strong objections against large-scale felling of trees. The youngsters took to social media to make Save Ajni Vann a national issue. “This is not for the first time that the public movement has captured Twitter. The trend, #SaveAjnivann & #SaveTrees40000+, trended on spots two and three last month too. Such online platforms are helping us to reach out to the global audience when it comes to highlighting critical issues,” said activists. The deadline to submit objections against tree felling was June 30. As reported by TOI, the matter is likely to go to the state tree committee as per the amended tree rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/save-ajni-vann-trends-nationally-on-twitter/articleshow/84155214.cms||Manka Behl

The party said that while the government has convened the public hearing, it has also simultaneously imposed Section 144 and a statewide curfew that prevents people from gathering. Congress claimed that the state’s sole intention behind rushing through the public hearing was to implement the new CRZ Notification 2019, which will reduce the no-development zone (NDZ) to 50m, eventually permitting Goa’s coastal areas to be sold to private firms. “I condemn CM Pramod Sawant for being a mute spectator to the growing demand of citizens to postpone the public hearings for the CZMP,” said GPCC president Girish Chodankar. The party pointed out that curfew orders and Section 144 have been imposed, which clearly state that anyone violating the order will be booked under the Code of Criminal Procedure. He also said that many stakeholders may not participate in the hearing out of fear of running afoul of the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-wants-hearing-for-coastal-plan-called-off/articleshow/84157502.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Back-to-back hikes ‘cruel’; slash central taxes, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee urges PM Modi||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Monday, urging him to reduce central taxes on petrol and diesel to check inflation and provide relief to people. The Centre’s tax collections from oil and petroleum products had “jumped by 370% since 2014-’15” because of the hikes in duties, cess and surcharges at “the cost of the common people”, Banerjee’s letter said. Even amid Covid, she added, the Centre collected a revenue of Rs 3.7 lakh crore in the 2020-’21 fiscal year only from oil and petroleum products. “I have come to learn that petrol and diesel prices were hiked by your government eight times since May 4, 2021,” Banerjee wrote, adding that June alone saw six hikes. Four hikes, “shockingly”, came in one week, the letter said, adding that “the cruel hikes” had impacted common people and “directly impacted the dangerous” inflation rate. The wholesale price index rose by 12.9% in May 2021 (compared to May 2020), Banerjee said; the consumer price index rose by 6.3%, edible oil prices rose by 30.8%, the price of eggs by 15.2%, fruits by 12% and health item prices — even in the middle of a pandemic — rose by 8.4%. “I express my deep concern and anguish for the policies that have resulted in this significant hardship for common people,” she wrote, reminding Modi that the Bengal government had voluntarily reduced the state’s sales tax component on oil and petroleum by one rupee each this February as a “token of our empathy for the common people”. The Centre was “constantly increasing the cess component of central tax revenues”, Banerjee said, adding that this cess accrued wholly to the Centre. The Trinamool Congress on Monday announced a two-day campaign on July 10 and 11 “in every block and town” to protest against the fuel price hike. Party secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said the protests would conform to all Covid protocols. “I have never seen this (type of a hike) in my life. LPG prices, too, are skyhigh. It is affecting every aspect of life and kitchens are on fire,” he said. The Trinamool Youth Congress has already announced protests in districts, some starting from Tuesday, which will continue till Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/back-to-back-hikes-cruel-slash-central-taxes-mamata-urges-pm/articleshow/84157422.cms||---
---||India||Community’s interest outweighs Swamy’s right to liberty, said judge||MUMBAI: Tribal rights activist Fr Stan Swamy, picked up from his Ranchi home last October, was the last of the arrests in the three-and-halfyear-old Elgar Parishad case. The oldest of the 16-odd accused, his plea has remained one of innocence; he had fought for his liberty on grounds of ill-health and Parkinson’s disease. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) which arrested him a day before he was charge-sheeted, opposed his bail applications claiming that the investigation “established’’ him to be a “member of CPI (Maoist) and actively involved in its activities’’ and also “in contact with some of the conspirators — Sudhir Dhavale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Arun Ferrriera, Vernon Gonsalves, Hany Babu, Shoma Sen, MAhest Raut, Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Gautam Navalakha and Anand Teltumbde, etc for furtherance of its activities.’’ In its March 22 order, the special NIA court Judge D E Kothalikar, rejecting his plea for bail on merit, said he is accused of belonging to a “terrorist organisation” and conspiring to overpower the government, politically and by using muscle power. The court had said the “collective interest of the community” would outweigh the right of personal liberty and Swamy’s old age or alleged sickness would not go in his favour. Judge Kothalikar said from documents produced by NIA, it could be gathered that Swamy and other members of the banned CPI (Maoist) had hatched a conspiracy to fuel unrest and overpower the government. Swamy was carrying out activities to further the objectives of the organisation which was nothing but to overthrow “the democracy of the nation”, the court held. The court order also said, “…if seriousness of allegations made against the applicant are considered in proper perspective…there will be no hesitation to conclude that collective interest of the community would outweigh the right of personal liberty of the applicant and as such the old age and or alleged sickness, of the applicant would not go in his favour,” the court said. Fr Swamy’s contention was that mere allegations of being a Maoist does not call for continued custody. He had also pleaded that he was not present in Pune at the time of the Elgar Parishad on December 31, 2017, neither was he named in the January 8, 2018 FIR filed by the Pune police. The main thrust of his defence was on “admissibility of the documents”, that NIA was relying on “hearsay” evidence to connect him. His case was that nothing was seized from him and he was “not involved in any anti-national activitiy’’. The NIA also pointed to “exchange” of around 140 emails between Fr Swamy and co-accused, and the fact that Swamy, co-accused Sudha Bhardwaj and other members of the Persecuted Political Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC) had condemned the conviction of professor G N Saibaba and others under UAPA for Maoist links. His case was that the letters cited by the prosecution “do not establish that they were actually sent’’ and their authorship was uncertain. Swamy was actively helping tribals and ‘moolvasis’, had founded an organisation named Bagaicha, and had written and researched extensively on issues of caste, religion, land rights and people’s struggles, said his petitions. His plea was that the role of PPSC is to provide legal aid and that is no offence. But the NIA claimed he was a “staunch supporter of the activities of organisations like Visthapan Virodhi Jan Vikas Andolan (VVJVA)…frontal organisation of CPI (Maoist).” The NIA argued, and the trial court agreed, that such arguments on evidence could be considered during trial and had hence denied him bail in March, on merit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/communitys-interest-outweighs-swamys-right-to-liberty-said-judge/articleshow/84160494.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Rs 213 crore fake GST credit refund racket unearthed||NAGPUR: In what is said to be first of its kind case, investigation wing of the central GST department has reported an alleged racket of cash refunds to the tune of Rs 213 crore being availed for exports that never happened. Out of this, Rs 123.97 crore have already been taken by the assessee, and disbursal of Rs 90 crore was withheld after the case was detected. The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGSTI) has been mainly reporting cases of fake input tax credit (ITC) claims made on the basis of fictitious entries, to avoid cash payment of GST. This is for the first time there has been a direct loss to the government by way of fraudulent refunds. The action was taken by Nagpur unit of DGGSTI. Tonnes of smoking mixture, which mainly consists of tobacco, was shown as exported from the inland container depot in Mihan. The shipment was shown as headed for Spain, Croatia and other European countries. Smoking mixture is filled up in cigarettes and pipes. The exports were in the name of three alleged shell companies whose address was traced to a small shop in Butibori. Indirect taxes like GST have a system of input tax credit. The credit is accumulated on the basis of GST paid for purchase inputs, and can be adjusted against the tax liability on the end product. Exporters are also allowed to get cash refund on the surplus credit left, which cannot be adjusted against GST dues on any more consignments. The refunds can be taken from time to time, said a source. However, in this case, the authorities were convinced that the exports did not happen at all, though fake shipping bills were shown. The shop which was shown as the companies’ address belonged to someone else. The papers submitted for registration under GST were forged, said sources. Tobacco attracts 28% GST and 290% cess. With over 300% taxes on tobacco, the basic material, even refunds are huge. For export of every Rs100, the refund claimed was more than Rs300, said the source. The three companies were floated by a mastermind based elsewhere. The companies were registered under the Hingna division of central GST department. “It was also found that there was no record of incoming cargo meant for export. If there were no incoming goods, what could have been exported,” said an official. A press note by DGGSTI says there are chances that the racket may not be confined to one centre only. There is possibility that some more shell companies may have been formed.

It is transferring the 100-odd employees of the division to Bokaro, Rourkela, Bhilai and other places. A writ petition filed by the employees’ union in this regard was struck down by a single bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday. “We are being instructed to shift from Kolkata with immediate effect to the place where we’ve been transferred,” an employee of the division said. The division was set up in 1989 to bring captive mines under a single umbrella to ensure seamless supply of raw materials from the mines to the plants. The Maharatna PSU initiated a restructuring last month that brought iron ore and flux mines in Odisha under Rourkela Steel Plant, the mines in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh under Bhilai Steel Plant and those in Jharkhand under the Bokaro Steel Plant. The coal mines in Bengal were put under the administrative control of Bokaro Steel. The PSU has three plants in Bengal — Durgapur Steel Plant, Alloy Steel Plant and IISCO. The SAIL order on restructuring issued in June said: “All coal mines of SAIL in Jharkhand along with the coal mine in Bengal at Ramnagore and coal washeries will be under Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL). Director in-charge of BSL will be designated owner of these mines.” State finance minister Amit Mitra wrote to Union steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan to reverse the decision to dismantle the raw material division in Kolkata. He alleged in the letter that ever since the NDA government had come to office in Delhi, there was an ominous pattern of shifting headquarters of PSUs from Kolkata. Pradhan refuted the charges, but Mitra expressed surprise over him not clearing the air about the raw material division. State INTTUC general secretary Ritabrata Banerjee had also strongly protested the move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/protests-ignored-sail-begins-winding-up-kol-raw-material-div/articleshow/84157471.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

The 84-year-old ailing activist’s arrest by the NIA, his nine-month incarceration in Taloja Jail where he contracted Covid-19, alleged lack of timely medical attention and repeated denial of bail — all came in for criticism. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights Eamon Gilmore tweeted: “India: I am very saddened to hear that Fr #StanSwamy has passed away. A defender of indigenous peoples’ rights. He was held in detention for the past 9 months. The EU had been raising his case repeatedly with authorities.” India: I am very saddened to hear that Fr #StanSwamy has passed away. A defender of indigenous peoples’ rights. He… https://t.co/piLAijW1L2— Eamon Gilmore (@EamonGilmore) 1625483762000Mary Lawlor, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights defenders, wrote: “The news from #India today is devastating. Human Rights Defender & Jesuit priest Fr Stan Swamy has died in custody, nine months after his arrest on false charges of terrorism. Jailing HRDs is inexcusable.” The internet buzzed with condemnation from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who said “Fr Stan deserved justice and humaneness”, human rights activists to mediapersons, activists, NGOs and citizens. Heartfelt condolences on the passing of Father Stan Swamy. He deserved justice and humaneness.— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) 1625478543000Fr Stan’s home state of Jharkhand led by chief minister Hemant Soren and the churches of Ranchi and Jamshedpur all grieved his loss. Oswald Cardinal Gracias, head of the Catholic Church in India and Archbishop of Bombay, was personally acquainted with Fr Stan’s work in the tribal hinterland. He said, “Fr Stan’s arrest was very painful. Under the Indian criminal law, one is innocent until proved guilty. Fr Stan’s case did not even come up for hearing. We were eagerly waiting for the case to be taken up and the truth to come out... Fr Stan worked tirelessly for the underprivileged and the downtrodden. I witnessed his dedication to the exploited tribals. I do hope that the truth will come out soon and his name will be cleared of all criminal conspiracy.” His community of Jesuit priests, in particular, mourned his loss. Fr Errol Fernandes said he was “now free from all earthly jails” while Fr Vincent Vaz described him as the “Mahatma of tribals”. Hours before his death came to light, the People’s Union for Democratic Rights, a Delhi-based civil liberties body, had written an open letter to the Chief Justice of the Bombay high court to end his incarceration. “Arresting an elderly activist suffering from multiple ailments in relation to a false and malicious political case, and then letting him die in custody by opposing desperate requests for release, is nothing short of custodial murder,” wrote secretaries Radhika Chitkara and Vikas Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eu-un-officials-join-civil-society-in-mourning-death/articleshow/84160522.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

Like in the other states across the country, the surge of Covid cases during the peak of second wave had pushed the demand for medicines like Remdesivir and Immunoglobulins, leading to acute shortage. Family members of the patients had to desperately search for these medicines, especially Remdesivir and many of them had to even purchase them from the black market. The state also faced a shortage of Amphotericin injection required to treat Mucormycosis (black fungus). By creating a buffer stock, the government aims to prevent such shortages during the third wave that is expected to hit its peak between October-November late this year. The government has initiated the process of purchasing the medicines through the health department and National Health Mission (NHM) for district hospitals and medical colleges. Hussan Lal, principal secretary, department of health, maintained that based on projections, the requirement of all hospitals and medical colleges has been assessed. "A comprehensive plan has been drawn and tenders of different drugs have been floated. To ensure sufficient stock in hand by the time the third wave hits, the department has started purchasing these medicines in a phased manner," said Husan Lal. Principal secretary of the department of medical education and research DK Tiwari stated that the department has been provided with 16,500 injections of Remdesivir, 1,500 Immunoglobulins and 300 Amphotericin for its four colleges located in Patiala, Amritsar, Faridkot and Mohali. "We have received the first lot of the medicines and more doses are expected to be supplied in coming days," said Tiwari. Separate cold stores are being set up to store these medicines -- one each has already been set up in the four medical colleges. Private hospitals providing Covid treatment have also been asked to create buffer stocks. Tenders have also been floated for the purchase of required equipment and furniture for laboratories, intensive care unit (ICU), Mucormycosis and paediatric wards. The first two waves of the infection rattled Punjab, recording a higher number of cases and deaths. As many as 1,60,954 people got the infection and 5,197 succumbed to the virus in the first wave (July to December) while in the second wave of infection that started in mid-February 4,20,201 people contracted the virus till July 3 and 10,409 died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/third-wave-in-mind-punjab-lines-up-buffer-stock-of-life-saving-drugs/articleshow/84157721.cms||Vinod Kumar

The CBI conducted searches on nine premises of the accused in Delhi and Chennai and recovered around ₹2.75 crore in cash and around 23 kg gold. The CBI said it has also detained four others in the case. The case against the 1984 batch IRSME officer was registered “for indulging in various activities in collusion with a woman director of a Chennai-based private firm and others in the award/execution of tenders in respect of mechanical division of the ICF.” The CBI said the accused had collected bribe from the director of a private firm and others between February 2019 and March 31, 2021 (the date of his retirement). He used the services of the director of the private firm as a conduit for collecting bribe on his behalf and also as a custodian for keeping the alleged illegal gratification of around ₹5.89 crore received on his behalf. The CBI said on Kathpal's demand, the director of the private firm had arranged to deliver ₹50 lakh as the first installment of the total bribe kept in her custody through another private person of a company based in Chennai and her working partner in Delhi to his brother. Kathpal was caught red-handed by the CBI while accepting ₹50 lakh as the second installment of the bribe amount, CBI said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cbi-arrests-former-official-of-integral-coach-factory-for-graft-in-chennai/articleshow/84160498.cms||---
