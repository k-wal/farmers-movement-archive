---||Bengaluru||As Bengaluru opens up today…Do your bit to avoid going back into lockdown!||We began the year 2021 with a certain sense of comfort and normalcy, so much so that one may have thought that was the end of the dastardly COVID pandemic. But the second wave proved everyone wrong. A lot of us are still reeling with the effects of the increased cases, the shortage in resources and the multiple cases and deaths that put Bengaluru on the global map as one of the most affected cities. With the city opening up further today as part of Unlock 3.0, let us, Bengalureans, pledge that we won't repeat those mistakes that may leave us with no other option but another lockdown to combat the crisis. Mask up and sanitizeEarlier this year, we let our guards down, quite literally. A lot of people were roaming with no masks or masks worn shabbily. As a testimony, reports state that the BBMP and Bengaluru traffic cops have collected as much as Rs 10 lakh in fines from those violating the rule of this safety norm in Bengaluru urban alone. Irrespective of whether you are through with your first or second dose of the vaccination, do mask up and always sanitize to stay safe and help contain the virus. Avoid unnecessary outingsYes, we all have been cooped up at our homes for a long time. Even though the city is opening up, it is up to us to help ourselves stay safe. Do not step out if you can help it, and do so only if you really are required to. Let us each help avoid adding to chaotic traffic jams, avoid being part of gatherings and keep your distance as much as possible. Don't fall for the 'revenge' trendOne of the social trends that hit us post the first wave was of revenge dining, shopping and travelling. Too many people jumping on the bandwagon was what let our guard down. Control those urges when you do step out. Stay alert and stay safe and you would have done your bit to keep the impending third wave under control. Keep celebrations minimalCan’t wait to catch up with your friends finally? That is exactly the feeling we had post the lockdown after the first wave of the virus. People may have stayed away from public parties, and gatherings, but doors to private home and farm house parties were thrown open. This again, yet another way we had let our guard down. This time around, may be a little more resistance and patience could help us steer clear of yet another wave – after all, the pandemic is not over yet. Work from home, if you canOffices and spaces are opening up, and working from home might not be the option everyone prefers. Though, if your job gives you the option of continuing to work from home, do take it. It is always better to be safe than being sorry about putting your health at risk. Use public transport, but carefullyWith the metro, bus services and other public transport services in the city opening as well, it almost reassures people that life is limping back to some semblance of normalcy. However, if one is using public transport, one must ensure social distancing, do mask up and do sanitise often.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/as-bengaluru-opens-up-todaydo-your-bit-to-avoid-going-back-into-lockdown/articleshow/84113201.cms||---

An NC leader, who did not wish to be named, said on July 3 that the party held several rounds of internal discussions over the issue. “The NC president [Farooq Abdullah] will take the final call on the issue most likely tomorrow [July 4]. He may then announce the decision himself,” he had said. The NC president has not yet made any announcement. Majority of NC leaders have expressed their willingness to join the exercise, asserting that the party’s suggestions will help the commission to frame an “unbiased report”, party sources said. According to sources, NC has directed party workers to submit their requests to take part in the meeting to the district election officer. The Delimitation Commission will be on a four-day visit to J&K from July 6-9 to interact with political parties, their leaders and government officials to gather first hand inputs on the ongoing process of redrawing the boundaries of electoral constituencies. Simultaneous meetings will be held in Jammu and Kashmir on July 6. Altaf Bukhari’s APNI party and Sajjad Lone’s Peoples Conference has already accepted the invitation. Congress on Sunday announced its decision to join the deliberation.

The daily haul was 2.8kg during 2019 and has touched nearly 11kg since January 1, 2020. On average, the worth of drugs seized daily by city cops increased from less than Rs 1 lakh in 2019 by more than five times to touch Rs 6.7 lakh over the past one-and-a-half years. While police presence at checkpoints was increased, peddlers preferred to use dark web and cryptocurrency to supply drugs to customers, sometimes even posing as delivery agents. Police, however, say they managed to foil the peddlers’ methods, citing the increase in drug seizure and presence of a large number of first-time offenders — including students, techies and others who had lost jobs during lockdown — among the arrested traffickers. However, the curbs on inter-state and international travel did little to check the inflow of narcotics . A police officer said vehicles used for essential services were employed to ferry drugs to the city and peddlers used labels of e-commerce platforms and pretended to be delivery representatives. Besides, the use of dark web also ended in trails in many cases going cold. “What we observed in 2020, especially during lockdown, was that narcotic traffickers used various routes to enter the city. We saw an increase in darknet orders and cryptocurrency transactions to procure drugs. Also, peddlers supplied drugs in the disguise of food delivery staff. We were able to reach smuggling routes and crack many cases last year and this year,” said Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (crime). In 2019, Bengaluru police registered 768 cases and seized drugs worth Rs 3.5 crore. The numbers touched 2,766 and Rs 21.4 crore in 2020. This year, 1,680 cases have been registered and drugs worth Rs 14.8 crore seized till date. In 2020 alone, 3,870kg of ganja was seized, which is about 261% increase from the haul of 1,047kg in 2019. Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) also made seizures worth several crores of rupees during the pandemic. While synthetic drugs were procured through dark web, ganja, which is usually grown within Karnataka or in neighbouring states, saw an increase as local peddlers started receiving it from many within the state. A forest officer in Biligiri Ranga Temple Tiger Reserve said, “Many who lost jobs in Bengaluru returned and started growing ganja on their agricultural land and on forest fringes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/daily-drug-haul-worth-up6-times-during-pandemic/articleshow/84124373.cms||Kiran Parashar

By wielding a dagger, the gang created panic among customers at Vinod Auto Service Center’s Bharat Petrol Bunk near Coles Park at 4am. CCTV footage of the incident has gone viral on social media. Fuel station cashier, S Pramod, 22, was on night duty on Friday when two persons came on a bike and asked him to fill petrol for Rs 250. They gave him Rs 500 note and while he was taking out the balance amount, the pillionrider tried to snatch cash. But, he missed it as the rider moved his bike by then. The duo stopped the bike a few feet away. The pillionrider then alighted from the bike wielding a dagger. “I was refilling another customer’s scooter when the robberer threatened me and demanded cash. Suddenly, two scooters stopped in front of me. Three more miscreants, who were riding pillion on the two scooters, approached me and one of them held my hands tightly. The person holding the dagger took cash from my pocket and all of them sped away in three vehicles,” Pramod stated. Pramod had sold 280 litres of petrol and 313 litres of diesel till he was robbed. “The collection of the night was Rs 58,302 and payment of Rs 14,872 was made on cards. So, I had Rs 43,430 in cash,” he said. Bharathi Nagar police have taken up a case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gang-of-7-robs-petrol-bunk-staffer-of-43k/articleshow/84124421.cms||Santosh kumar.B

Based on a complaint filed by Vikram Chaubey on July 1, Kempegowda Nagar police have named Kiran M of KP Agrahara and his employees Basavaraju C, Vijay and Manjunath as suspects in the FIR. Police said Kiran, in-charge of a mega store, was an agent for Amazon to supply groceries to its customers. The company had sent parcels to Kiran for delivery to its customers who had ordered food and grocery items in May and June. But Kiran’s agents said many of the customers’ addresses were not traceable and a few others had cancelled their orders. The company returned the payment to their customers but recently found that Kiran did not return the cancelled parcels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/amazon-files-cheating-plaint-against-agent-3-employees/articleshow/84124422.cms||---

A 320-metre stretch has been redeveloped by Bengaluru Smart City Limited (BSCL) under the TenderSURE project at a cost of Rs 4.3 crore. The work, which began in January, had left the business community sulking as they were yet to recover from the losses that they incurred during last year’s lockdown. According to BSCL managing director P Rajendra Cholan, the work was taken up after consulting the business fraternity. Another official said traders on Brigade Road were initially not happy with the timing of the project but the government officials managed to convince them. Cholan said the lockdown during the second wave of Covid-19 helped them complete the work fast. Brigade Road was selected for redevelopment in 2015 when then chief minister Siddaramaiah announced it. The redeveloped stretch now is 7.5-metre wide and pedestrian paths are 1.8 -3.2 metres wide. The road has exclusive ducts for OFC, rainwater and sewage water. Besides, 31 LED light poles have been installed. Suhail Yusuf of the Brigades’ Shops and Establishments’ Association said: “We’re hoping business will gradually bounce back. The fraternity here has incurred huge losses due to the lockdown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/brigade-road-ready-after-4-3cr-facelift/articleshow/84124461.cms||---

Activist T Narasimha Murthy, who filed the complaint under Section 35 of the Consumer Protection Act 2019, stated he visited the hotel near Infantry Road in March this year and his bill totalled 264.60. However, it was rounded off to Rs 265, something which Murthy terms an unfair trade practice. Seeking an explanation, he approached the hotel manager and others, but failed to receive a satisfactory answer. Requests made by Murthy to show directions or orders passed in this regard were also futile. “If the hotel collects an excess amount to the extent of 40 paise or 50 paise on the actual bill, it will earn lakhs of rupees annually by cheating innocent customers,” Murthy claimed. The commission heard the matter on Friday and adjourned it to August 20. “Perused the complaint and documents...The complainant is directed to take the photo of the notice prepared by this office in his mobile and send/deliver it to the opposite party personally or through WhatsApp and SMS to the effect of filing of the complaint, its register number and date for appearance,” the commission’s order read. PC Rao, president, Bruhat Bangalore Hotels Association, said, “I will refrain from making any comments since the matter is sub-judice.” However, another hotelier told TOI there was no malafide intention behind rounding off the bill amount. “Since 50 paise coin or other coins of denominations less than Re 1 are not in use, we round off the amount to the nearest rupee. For example, if the bill totals Rs 264.50, we will round it off to Rs 264,” he said. Asked whether everyone follows the same rule, he said: “We are not sure. We will discuss the matter in our next association meeting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/advocate-sues-hotel-for-rounding-off-bill/articleshow/84124801.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Supaul Sadar SDPO Kumar Indra Prakash said Santosh Kumar, Ramanand Kumar, Maya Devi, Urmila Devi and one Rajendra Sharma of Pipra police station area of Supaul were arrested in the rape case with two girls, including a minor. He said that Santosh allegedly raped the 14-year-old minor girl in one room and Ramanand raped her married elder sister, aged around 23 years, in another room. “Maya, Urmila and Rejendra, an e-rickshaw driver, stood guard outside,” he said. Prasad said they were arrested from different locations in Pipra. “The incident took place on June 30. But the matter came to light on July 2 when someone informed the police about a panchayat meeting going on in the village for compensating the victims,” he said. He said their mother lodged an FIR against Maya, Urmila and four others for her daughters’ rape. The SDPO said the investigation revealed that Maya and Urmila, who were neighbours of the victims, allured them to pay Rs6,000 for paddy plantation. “Both sisters went with the two women, who instead took them to the guesthouse in a secluded place. Later, the accused made them board a bus and sent them home,” he said. Prakash said when the matter surfaced, Maya and Urmila fled from the village. He said Urmila was the first one to be arrested. She helped police identify the hotel rooms from where forensic experts collected samples. “All those involved in crime have been arrested. Police have strong evidences. We would try for speedy trial of the case for their conviction,” the SDPO added.

Issuing an order to this effect, Srinagar district magistrate Aijaz Asad said that to secure the aerial space near vital installations and highly populated areas, it is imperative to discontinue the use of drones in all social and cultural gatherings to eliminate any risk to life and damage to property. The order states that people already having drone cameras/similar UAVs in their possession shall ground and deposit the same in the local police station under proper receipt. “Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has provided draft guidelines/standard operating protocol to regulate the use of drones in terms of weight classification, generation of unique identification number, height/altitude restrictions, speed restriction, enforcement/panel action etc.,” the order reads. "Keeping in view the security situation, apart from concerns of breach of privacy, nuisance and trespass, it is extremely dangerous to let UAVs to wander around in the skies within the territorial jurisdiction of Srinagar district," the order says. Regarding use of drones by government departments, the order says: “Moreover, government departments using drones for mapping, surveys and surveillance in agriculture, environment conservation and disaster mitigation shall inform the local police station before undertaking any such activity in public interest.” Asking senior superintendent of police, Srinagar, to ensure implementation of the order in letter and spirit, Asad said any violation shall attract punitive action as warranted under relevant laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/srinagar-admin-bans-use-sale-possession-transportation-of-drones-similar-uavs/articleshow/84124611.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: With printing delayed due to pandemic, book banks help rural students in Ramanagara||BENGALURU: With printing and distribution of textbooks to schoolchildren being delayed by several months due to Covid-19, book banks have come to the rescue of students. This is especially the case in rural areas where schools have managed to collect a good number of books from students promoted to the next class. TOI visited a few schools in Ramanagara district and found the ‘book bank’ concept has been doing wonders for students. Government Primary School in Heggadagere, Bidadi is among the institutions where 95% of the books of promoted students have been collected. While in some schools, teachers have already handed over the old books to students, others are waiting for the government’s direction. Bailappa ML, headmaster of the school, said, “Most people who live here are farmers and are uneducated. Online classes or those broadcast on TV may not help their wards as many of them are either unaware or reluctant. But when the children get the books, they are more enthusiastic to study.” “This may appear to be a new concept but if you recall, we used to borrow books from our seniors or neighbours when there was no supply. This is now the new normal in our schools, and students have handed over their books. Not all books were in great shape but whatever we were able to get has been distributed among kids. We have dedicated a room to store the books. Students promoted from class 4 to 5 hand over their books to us, which will help their juniors moving from class 3 to 4. The older student too is benefited from his seniors,” Bailappa added. Block Education Officer (BEO) BN Marigowda said, “Because of Covid-19, there has been a delay in printing of textbooks and we were prepared for it. Last year, despite the lockdown we got books on time but this year, there has been a delay due to the second wave. We have collected books from students.” In some government schools, the occasion of distributing midday meal rations to parents was used to collect books. Siddanna Gowda, headmaster of the higher primary school in Mallahalli village of Surapura taluk in Yadgir district, said some parents were initially reluctant to hand over their wards’ books but they managed to convince them. Aware of the delay, the Karnataka Textbook Society has written to block education officers, asking them to collect books in good condition from last year’s students and preserve them. A teacher from a high school in Maragowdanahalli, Mysuru district, said there are 107 students and eight teachers in their institution. “We shared the responsibility and encouraged students to hand over the books. We are yet to distribute the books as we cannot call students to school and since the pandemic situation continues, we are unable to visit them as well. We are waiting for government orders. If Vidyagama starts, it will become easy to hand over the books,” the teacher added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/with-printing-delayed-bookbanks-help-rural-students/articleshow/84125305.cms||Kiran Parashar

While extending the lockdown in Goa till 7am on July 12, chief minister Pramod Sawant had stated fully vaccinated travellers will not have to produce a Covid-negative report before entering Goa. “People who have taken both doses and have a certificate stating the same will be allowed to enter the state...,” he had said. However, many who have travelled long distances to come to Majali, in order to enter Goa, are forced to undergo RAT though they are fully vaccinated. “We believed the media reports in which Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant had stated that fully vaccinated people can enter the state without any hindrance. However, police and the medical staff here are not allowing us to enter, saying we don’t have RT-PCR test report. We were not aware of this. Had they publicised it earlier, we would have brought a certificate,” said Manjula, a traveller from Bengaluru. “Initially, they did not allow us to enter even after we showed vaccination certificate. But after a long argument, they allowed me inside,” said Satish Kamat from Mangaluru. When police and health personnel on the border were asked about this, they said they are following instructions of the government to not allow anyone without RT-PCR negative report or RAT into Goa. Goa govt approaches HCThe Goa government has approached the high court to allow fully vaccinated people to enter the state without any Covid-negative certificate, after the HC passed an order that all those who want to enter Goa must carry a Covid-negative certificate having a validity of 72 hours. The court had asked the state government to seek the opinion of the expert panel of doctors, who have concurred with the government view. The court is likely to reveal on July 12 whether it agrees with the government suggestion to allow fully vaccinated people into Goa without Covid negative certificate. Currently, any traveller wanting to enter Goa has to either produce such a certificate or get tested at the border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mandatory-covid-ve-report-irks-travellers-seeking-to-enter-goa/articleshow/84125309.cms||Deepak Kumar Shenvi

However, it also expedited the Karnataka government’s efforts to integrate IT solutions in administration and schemes. From monitoring projects to setting up its in-house learning management system (LMS) and beneficiaries application portal, the government has accelerated IT solutions implementation. “What was once a 5-10 year project to integrate IT solutions now takes 12-24 months,” said a senior government official. Take, for instance, the recently implemented software Avalokana. The system designed and developed for Karnataka has become a benchmark for taking stock of development in remote villages. “Prior to the pandemic, a Karnataka Development Programme (KDP) at the district level would see ministers asking for details 15 days in advance. With this software, ministers have details of the work and financial progress, etc. at their fingertips while in the headquarters or Bengaluru,” said another official. The government in the past year has been forced to use technology for education by bringing its in-house LMS technology to train teachers and providing online schooling for students via IT solutions. “We spent just Rs 4 crore during the first half of the pandemic, in 2020, to set it up. Karnataka is a pioneer in using its own software in education,” said higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan. The state accelerated the use of e-Office due to the pandemic. Though it remained dormant for six months before implementation, the pandemic forced chief minister BS Yediyurappa to stay away from meetings and had to use this software. Overall, since March 2020, the government has launched at least 10 IT solutions for various departments due to reduced human interaction and necessity. While this may have been acceleration of IT solutions, the state has been trying to improve efficiency using technology. Smart learning, e-marketingAt a recently released handbook of 20 best practices implemented by Karnataka to improve its position in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) rankings, at least 14 were directly linked to IT solutions used to make it more efficient. These include smart learning in 122 government schools at Yadgir using solar power, applying and securing death and birth certificates through e-Janma, e-Manasa for tackling mental health concerns and e-marketing solutions for the agriculture market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pandemic-forces-state-to-deployit-solutions-in-administration/articleshow/84125310.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Tamil Nadu CM replies to BS Yediyurappa, asks Karnataka to drop Mekedatu||BENGALURU: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Sunday, in a tit-for-tat move, shot back a letter to chief minister BS Yediyurappa “urging” Karnataka to drop the controversial Mekedatu balancing reservoir project along Cauvery river. Stalin said: “The comparison of that (Mekedatu) project intending to store 67.1 TMC of water with the two hydro power projects of TN would not be correct. There is no consumption of water in these hydro power projects with the available water being just re-circulated by pumping to meet the peak power demand…” Yediyurappa in his letter had referred to the Kundah and Sillahalla Pumped Storage hydro-electric projects. Stalin added drawing of water from the river for drinking purposes for Bengaluru, though being permitted by the courts, which has been cited by the state for constructing the Mekedatu reservoir “does not sound valid”. Beneficial for both: BommaiMeanwhile, in Bengaluru, law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai said Tamil Nadu had a habit of disputing anything related to Cauvery river water sharing and it's a continuation of the same with the Mekedatu project. “The government headed by Stalin wants to create some ripples to make its presence felt in Tamil Nadu, so it has resorted to this political adventure. We’ll fight it out since we are legally right in our position,” Bommai said. He said TN’s objection is unwarranted since the project will be beneficial to both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu as the building of the balancing reservoir is aimed at utilising the excess waters of Cauvery. “There is no reservoir except KRS to store water that can be utilised when there is shortage of rain and the Mekedatu project will be helpful in providing drinking water to Karnataka while ensuring excess water to Tamil Nadu during distress. Despite knowing this is the win-win proposition, the Tamil Nadu government has approached the Supreme Court against the project,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tn-cm-replies-to-bsy-asks-ktaka-to-drop-mekedatu/articleshow/84125549.cms||---

The leopard accidentally dropped the prey, and the dog scampered back to its safe turf in the house of Sathish Kotian of Padukoanje, in the Moodbidri forest range limits. Sathish, a hotelier, has been living in the house for nearly 20 years and this is the first instance of a leopard sighting near his house. Manjunath Ganiga, deputy range forest officer, Moodbidri, said the incident was reported from near Padukonaje government school around 11.20pm. “CCTV footage from Sathish’s house shows the leopard stealthily entering the frontyard and approaching the sleeping dog. It digs its teeth into the dog’s neck before walking away with its prey,” he said. Sathish said the leopard returned to his house at 11.42am (as per CCTV footage) looking for the dog that it lost while carrying it away. But the frightened dog returned to the sit-out of the house only by 2.30am after wandering about in a hilly track. The dog has since been treated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dog-escapes-from-leopards-clutches-in-dk/articleshow/84125554.cms||---
---||India||NHAI for special monitoring of projects with ‘abnormally low bids’||NEW DELHI: Highway projects bid out at “abnormally low” price to private players will now be put under a separate list for critical monitoring by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Officers concerned will have to visit sites every fortnight to see the actual progress and will also need to ensure that the contractors have deployed adequate resources. The NHAI issued a circular on Friday to deal with “abnormally low bids” (ALBs). TOI had on Monday reported how private bidders quoting very low prices for government-funded highway projects has become a cause of concern and it was also flagged by a parliamentary standing committee. The number of bidders for such projects has increased significantly since the government did away with compulsory deposit of additional bid security from contractors who quote low prices. Many of the projects have been bid out at 20-30% less than the price offered by the government agencies. “Even as we continue with the current norm under the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme to give relief to domestic bidders, the focus is to ensure better monitoring of works to ensure there is no slippage. We will not spare those who don’t perform after bagging projects since they have bid after carrying out their assessments,” said a government official. According to the NHAI circular, such ALBs will be identified separately in the “data lake” (central database of all projects) so that details uploaded there can be monitored by the project director, regional officer and officer concerned in the technical division. Monthly reports will be generated for monitoring and perusal. It has been made mandatory for officers concerned to take steps to ensure the contractors deploy required resources and they review monthly drone videography of work. NHAI will deploy more engineers for day-to-day monitoring. Quality inspections will be carried out once in three months for projects bid out below more than 20% and for those tendered below 10% to 20%, such inspections will be carried out in every six months. The policy says the project directors, regional officers and people from headquarters will need to carry out inspections work at site every fortnight, two and three months respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nhai-for-special-monitoring-of-projects-with-abnormally-low-bids/articleshow/84126611.cms||Dipak K Dash

Of the 96.8 lakh teachers in the country, 49.2 lakh are women. In 2012-13, there were 35.8 lakh women teachers across the country against 42.4 lakh men — marking a rise of more than 37% or 13 lakh over seven years. In the same period, the number of male teachers rose from 42.4 lakh to 47.7 lakh. There is a catch, though: women teachers top the head count only at the primary level. The report points out that upper primary onwards, the number of male teachers continues to be higher.

Among the states that have more kids in English medium than in vernacular are Punjab, Haryana and Delhi,At the pre-primary level, the number of women teachers stands at more than 1 lakh, compared with around 27,000 men. The ratio is more balanced in the primary grades, with 19.6 lakh women and 15.7 lakh male teachers. In the upper primary classes, there are 11.5 lakh male and 10.6 lakh women teachers. From then on, the gap increases. In secondary schools, there are 6.3 lakh men and 5.2 lakh women teachers. In higher secondary, it’s 3.7 lakh men to 2.8 lakh women. In government and aided schools, the number of male teachers is higher while in private unaided schools, women teachers are ahead. The trend of male teachers outnumbering women in higher grades is seen across states, with the exception of Kerala, Delhi, Meghalaya, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, among big states. In these states, the number of women teaching is higher than men even in secondary and higher secondary classes. “Any dynamic and vital profession, and I consider teaching as one, must have an equitable distribution of men and women. Children need to learn from teachers who can offer a male as well as a female perspective. Undoubtedly in younger classes, many schools in India prefer women teachers, since they are seen to be more nurturing. However, I think it’s good for male teachers to demonstrate nurture too! Otherwise, we’re demonstrating a sexist bias in favour of women teachers,” said Maya Menon, founder director of Teacher Foundation. “In higher classes, where the curricular load is heavier, traditionally both male and female teachers are sought after. There are also differential salaries in India between primary and secondary school teachers,” Menon said. This is not the case in other countries: all teachers regardless of the levels they teach require similar qualifications and, therefore, start with similar salaries. “Male teachers in India prefer to teach in secondary school because they get paid more, especially with government scales. Private schools that have more male teachers tend to be international schools where the pay is better than in other private schools,” she said. The U-DISE report is released annually by the department of school education and literacy under the Union ministry of education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-first-women-schoolteachers-outnumber-men/articleshow/84126769.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Sadagopan led the institution for 22 years. He was the founder-director of the institution which started in June 1999 and was among the first of the infotechspecific institutions envisioned by the government. IIIT-B was funded by the Karnataka government, with support from the IT industry, and has functioned as a deemed university, awarding Master's and doctorate degrees in engineering. Sadagopan also taught for over 25 years, including at IIT Kanpur, IIM Bangalore, IIT Madras and IIIT-Bangalore. During his tenure at IIIT-B, the external affairs ministry gave him a lead role in helping set up the Myanmar International Institute of Information Technology in Mandalay. Anand Parthasarathy, who has reported on the tech academic scene for decades, said Sadagopan’s tenure is arguably the longest stint of an infotech academic in India as the head of an institution of professional higher education. The professor, he said, was always soft spoken, and his sincerity and zeal in helping to turn out the next-gen Indian world beater was infectious. “You couldn’t say no to him,” he said. Debabrata Das joined IIIT-B as an assistant professor in 2002. He was the dean of academics and R&D from 2014 to 2017. Before joining IIIT-B, he had served at IIT Kharagpur, and later at Kirana Networks in New Jersey, US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iiit-b-director-prof-sadagopan-retires-after-22-yrs/articleshow/84125173.cms||---

No forecasting model in the world has 100% accuracy even with the best of technology, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of Meteorology at the IMD. Mohapatra argued that the “unpredictable” nature of the monsoon can only provide 55-60% accuracy even with the best of technology and forecasting models in place. “Our goal is to have the technology which will be able to forecast weather phenomenon with 100% accuracy. However, that day is still far. Till then, we need human experience and understanding of the data,” Mohapatra told TOI. “Our forecasts made on July 1 regarding the monsoon to slow up considerably and come by the middle of the second week of July is on track so far. However, in some cases, the forecasts over a longer duration may not hold true as well. It is extremely difficult to forecast how the monsoon will progress over a period of more than 15 days,” said Mohapatra. The forecast accuracy is over 80% in a 24-hour period and more than 60% over a five-day period, he added. According to the IMD, it relies on human intervention to assess models, since dependence on technology alone can leave data open to interpretation in some cases. Every morning, the IMD holds a video conference where scientists from across the country use their experiences to assess the weather pattern for the next few days, relying on forecast models generated by machines, satellite imagery and radar technology. Met officials say while the reliance on technology is 70%, the 30% human interpretation plays a critical role in the forecast for the day. “A combination of machinery, models and human skills and experience is used each day. A 24-hour forecast is sometimes unable to capture a sudden change in the weather, which may occur within a matter of hours. For that, our nowcast feature, which gives forecasts for every three hours, is the most accurate,” said a Met official. “The weather is particularly volatile during the monsoon and late summer. There is low-pressure due to high temperature. There is high moisture content in the air as the monsoon gets closer and a cyclonic circulation can lead to cloud formation and rain within hours. This is not always easy to forecast,” the official added. While one can rely on satellite imagery and radar technology for a short-term forecast of 3-4 hours, the same may not hold true for 24 hours, a scientist who works on forecasting told TOI pleading anonymity. “Conditions in the tropical belt are more dynamic than in other parts of the country. The monsoon, plus the weather changes during summer are more dynamic, hence a short-term forecast can capture it. Within 24 hours, it can change completely, which is why releases an updated forecast in the morning may not match with that of the previous evening,” said the scientist. “At times, only a small patch of land across the entire city receives rainfall. While this means the forecast was accurate, it may appear that it did not rain and so the forecast did not hold true,” the scientist added. For ‘soft’ indicators, the IMD uses terms like “unlikely” (less than 25% chance of occurrence), “likely” (25-50% chance), “very likely” (75% chance) and “most likely” (more than 75% chance) in its daily forecast, according to officials. “This gives a rough estimate that if rain is forecast, it may not always occur and will depend on the category of likelihood it is placed in,” they added. Navdeep Dahiya, an amateur weatherman who runs ‘Live Weather of India’, said climate change has played a key role over the last decade, making weather patterns more unpredictable, despite the best of technologies in place. “This summer alone, we have seen heatwave days in the end of June and early July, which is unusual. We are seeing more rain in some places and less in other parts. Weather patterns are more volatile now,” said Dahiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-forecast-model-100-accurate-imd/articleshow/84127022.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The court found that the thana — Akbarabad police station — mentioned by the Bijnor police officer did not exist. Manavvar (who only uses his first name) was arrested from his home in Roorkee by Bijnor police on the evening of March 31 when he was busy playing with his seven-month-old son. The 30-year-old car mechanic was accused of being part of an interstate auto-lifter gang. “During his bail hearing in a Bijnor court in April, police told the court that Manavvar was a dreaded criminal,” his lawyer Umair Mahmood told TOI. Manavvar was denied bail following which he approached the Allahabad high court. On June 25, the additional government advocate (AGA) on the basis of instructions received by the Bijnor police officer told the court that the accused had a case against him lodged in 2015 under the Gangsters Act in Akbarabad police station in Amroha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/man-denied-bail-for-case-in-up-thana-that-doesnt-exist/articleshow/84127448.cms||Ishita Mishra

The 84-year-old tribal rights activist was put on ventilator support, prompting NHRC, NGOs and individuals to raise concerns about his health. His friend and colleague Father Joseph Xavier told a website, “Fr Stan was put on ventilator early Sunday morning and is in critical condition.” In October last year, the NIA had arrested Fr Swamy from Ranchi in the Elgar Parishad case and imprisoned him in Taloja jail for nine months, where he contracted Covid-19. Already suffering from Parkinson’s Disease, he was shifted to Holy Family Hospital in Bandra on May 28 after the intervention of Bombay high court. As word spread of his failing health on Sunday, the NHRC issued a notice to the Maharashtra government after receiving a complaint. It wrote to the state chief secretary, urging him to ensure proper medical care to Fr Swamy. The commission sought his case papers and asked for a report over the allegations. The notice followed an earlier order where the commission had advised the state government to provide adequate medical care and treatment to the elderly Jesuit priest, and submit a report within four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stan-swamy-on-ventilator-nhrc-sends-notice-to-maha/articleshow/84127576.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

In a tweet on Sunday morning, Modi said, “Warm felicitations and greetings to @POTUS @JoeBiden6 and the people of the USA on their 245th Independence Day. As vibrant democracies, India and USA share values of freedom and liberty. Our strategic partnership has a truly global significance." On July 1, neither the Centre nor any Indian political party sent any congratulatory message to the CPC on its centenary celebrations. The deafening silence from the Indian establishment was broken only by CPM, whose general secretary, Sitaram Yechury, marked the occasion with a congratulatory letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, where he described Marxism-Leninism as a "creative science" which the CPC used to "innovate for the development of China". Read AlsoIn a phone call with PM Modi, Joe Biden pledges steadfast support for people of IndiaWASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden, in a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Monday pledged steadfast support of his entire administration for the people of India in its fight against Covid-19 pandemic, the White House said. Biden spoke with Modi committing that the US and India willNeither BJP nor Congress or any other party acknowledged the event. The CPC centenary is not merely that of the largest political organisation of the world. China, the nation that was born in 1949, is almost synonymous with CPC. Chinese troops continue to threaten India on the LAC in eastern Ladakh, with a stand-off that is now over a year old. Questioned why India had not greeted the CPC, the MEA spokesperson batted away the query, telling journalists it was "not a government matter". Interestingly, BJP had, in February, sent greetings to the Communist Party of Vietnam for its anniversary during the five-year party Congress. There is almost no likelihood of any greetings going out from India to the People’s Liberation Army on August 1, celebrated as PLA Day. Attention will focus on two other events later this year — October 1, the National Day of China, which has always seen official greetings from the Indian government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-wishes-biden-on-4th-of-july-sends-silent-message-to-china/articleshow/84128215.cms||---

A close ally, DMK under chief minister Stalin is set to make a clean sweep of the 3 RS vacancies from the state which have come up midway. DMK agreed to leave a seat in also 2019 for former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the request of Congress, but a vacancy unexpectedly came up in Congress-ruled Rajasthan, and Singh was accommodated there. This time, DMK is learnt to have offered the seat. Congress sources said president Sonia Gandhi is finalising the candidate from Tamil Nadu. Coupled with the berth in Maharashtra that recently fell vacant with the death of young MP Rajeev Satav, the Tamil Nadu RS seat has set off speculations in the party over the possible choices, with all eyes on whether the two seats will be used to accommodate senior leaders of the G-23 bloc, led by former Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad. Else, a young party manager from TN is also seen as under consideration. Well-placed sources said there are three probables for Maharashtra, all of them RS veterans — Mukul Wasnik, Rajiv Shukla and Rajni Patil. Wasnik is from the G-23 Block that wrote a letter seeking reforms in the organisation. Congress is grappling on many fronts as it seeks to reorganise internally in view of future political challenges. A decision likely to come this week is the rejig in crisis-ridden Punjab and Uttarakhand units, both states headed for polls in early 2022, while the issue of leadership in Lok Sabha has also gained prominence. After the decimation in West Bengal elections, questions hang over the continuation of Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who led the party’s ill-fated campaign against TMC, as leader in the lower House. The two possible contenders are Manish Tiwari and Shashi Tharoor —both signatories to the G-23 letter. However, Ravneet Bittu, a Punjab MP, led the Congress contingent during the Budget session when Chowdhury was unavailable. In Punjab, how Navjot Sidhu, the mercurial cricketer-turned politician, is accommodated is being watched. While the post of state president, campaign committee chairman and deputy CM are on the table, the first option has internal opponents including chief Minister Amarinder Singh. There is also the possibility of twin portfolios like deputy CM and campaign chief, or campaign chief with nomination to the CEC. However, a senior leader claimed Sidhu is keen on his post-election positioning as a credible face with concern for issues rather than posts. Manish Tewari is also a candidate for Punjab PCC. In Uttarakhand, Congress may name former CM Harish Rawat as campaign chief while it may pick an MLA close to him as state chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-may-accept-dmks-rajya-sabha-offer-in-bid-to-placate-rebels/articleshow/84127867.cms||---

Taking to Twitter, Sidhu said: “Punjab already provides 9000 Crore Subsidy but we must do more for Domestic & Industrial consumer giving power at Rs 3-5 per unit instead of surcharge inflated Rs 10-12 per unit, along 24-hour supply with No Power-Cuts & Free Power (Upto 300 Units).. It is definitely achievable.” Earlier this week, Sidhu had locked horns with chief minister Amarinder Singh on the issue and had even made a tweet-by-tweet suggestion about handling the power crisis in the state. Drawing a comparison with Delhi, Sidhu stated that the Delhi government was giving only Rs 1,699 crore as power subsidy. He said that instead of copying the Delhi model, his state needs an original “Punjab model”, not a copied model. “If Punjab copies the Delhi model, we will get merely Rs 1,600 to Rs 2,000 crore as subsidy,” he said in another tweet. After Kejriwal had made the announcement of providing 300 units free, Punjab Congress leaders and Amarinder’s cabinet ministers had accused him of stealing their idea of offering free power as conveyed by the party high command to the Punjab chief minister as part of the 18 public welfare initiatives to be taken before the next elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-kejriwal-navjot-singh-sidhu-pitches-for-300-power-units-free-says-it-is-definitely-achievable/articleshow/84128985.cms||---

This could well be what your great grandfather had as his daily menu. A large number of foodgrain, vegetables and fruits that were popular over three to four generations ago but faded away from the daily spread, is, set to make a comeback. Agricultural scientists here have taken up the task of reviving foods that provided nutritional support to forefathers. Scientists at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (Icrisat) in Hyderabad have prepared a mega list of food grains, vegetables, fruits and oil seeds that were widely cultivated about 100 to 150 years ago. Some of them were popular as recent as four to five decades ago. The list also includes leafy vegetables, fruits and vegetables that are fast disappearing from the farmers’ priority crops. According to scientists, tuber crops like sweet potato and yam and pulses like red gram and masoor dal (lentils) are losing popularity. And, grains like sorghum has already made it to the “forgotten foods” list. Even the popular potato, jackfruit, tamarind and custard apple are losing their sheen as preferred foodstuff. The list, prepared by the Icrisat team and scientists from other research bodies, is part of a global manifesto to be submitted at the UN Food Systems Summit later this year. Icrisat scientists, who said these foods are not only nutritious but would also help solve the food shortage, held an international seminar last month, on “grandpa’s foods” in the run-up to the UN summit. “Forgotten foods have the potential to fix several problems that our food systems face today and will face in the future as the world population grows, climate uncertainty becomes more common and diet-related diseases rise. It is time that we rid them of their ‘forgotten’ tag,” said Joanna Kane-Potaka, assistant director-general, Icrisat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/grandpas-foods-could-be-back-on-menu/articleshow/84129015.cms||Syed Akbar
---||India||‘In 2020, wildlife board cleared land diversion for 48 projects’||NEW DELHI: The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), an apex body which takes a call on use of land from different conservation areas for development activities, had approved diversion of around 1,792 hectares — an area equal to the size of 3,349 football fields — of wildlife habitat for 48 projects in 2020, the year of the pandemic which severely restricted ground visits for taking crucial decisions. A study, analysing all the clearances granted by the Standing Committee (SC) of the NBWL last year, has found that the SC-NBWL considered 82 proposals, out of which 25 were for diversion within wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. Most of the projects cleared were for linear diversion within sanctuaries, national parks and tiger reserves, said the study, carried out by a New Delhi-based not-for-profit organisation, Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE). Linear projects are land-disturbing activities that are linear in nature such as roads, railways, transmission lines, pipelines or any utility lines. It said, “Linear projects are known to be especially destructive because they fragment the entire landscape and interrupt movement range of animals.” Around 1,040 hectares was approved for diversion from eco-sensitive zones while nearly 594 hectares were approved from within tiger habitats for linear projects, defence and infrastructure development. Remaining around 158 hectares were diverted in wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and conservation reserves, it said. The SC-NBWL is headed by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar. It consists of a member secretary and different members, including a non-official, nominated by the minister. The SC-NBWL had also approved deletion (de-notification) of 1,08,983 hectares (around 1,089 sq km) of protected areas (PA) from Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary (HWS) in UP and Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary in MP. Analysis by LIFE shows PA of over 38,303 hectares was de-notified in 2018 which involved de-notification of the entire Turtle Sanctuary in Varanasi, while 5,445 hectares of PA was de-notified in 2019. Though the ministry did not respond to TOI’s questions on findings of the study, an official who requested anonymity said the decision to de-notify area of the HWS was taken to simply rationalise the boundary of the sanctuary as the portion was basically non-forest land and it’s being used for agriculture and habitation for years. He said, “The forest area will continue to be part of the sanctuary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-2020-wildlife-board-cleared-land-diversion-for-48-projects/articleshow/84129084.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Disruption in trade in this region can have a major impact on our economy. Under `Operation Sankalp’, we will continue to deploy a frontline warship, either a destroyer or a frigate with a helicopter and a marine commando intervention team, in the region,” a senior Navy officer said. India, in fact, launched Operation Sankalp in June 2019 after mysterious explosions on board two foreign oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, MV Front Altair and MV Kokuka Courageous, amidst heightened tensions between Iran and the US. With the attacks underlining the vulnerability of sea-borne trade transiting through the constricted geographical locations, the Navy had then dispatched destroyer INS Chennai and patrol vessel INS Sunayna to the Gulf of Oman. “Indian Navy was the first to deploy ships to safeguard the passage of merchant ships through the region. It was taken on independently and not as a part of any coalition,” the officer added. Two years later, the continuous forward naval deployment continues. As many as 23 Indian warships in rotation have been deployed to the Gulf region, with an average of 16 Indian-flagged merchant vessels and tankers being provided safe passage on a daily basis. “Given the prevailing security situation there, the presence of an Indian warship acts as a deterrence to any hostile threat as well as reassures our merchant vessels. If requested, we also embark a security team of marine commandos on a vessel for some duration,” the officer said. “Around 60% of India’s oil imports, after all, comes from this region. Despite diversification of sources for import of oil, Gulf countries are likely to continue as major suppliers for India. Moreover, the Indian diaspora numbers around 8.5 million in the region,” he added. Operation Sankalp is now a part of the “mission-based deployments (MBDs)” launched by the Navy in 2017 in the Indian Ocean Region, stretching from the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait. Under MBDs, several warships are deployed on a “sustained basis across our areas of interest” to meet any operational contingency from conventional threats and maritime terrorism to piracy and humanitarian disaster relief. “This not only helps us undertake foreign cooperation initiatives for the nation, but also enables our ships to respond to any emerging situation without any delay,” another officer said. The Navy says one of its key roles as a security provider for the country’s “Blue Economy” includes maintaining a secure and stable maritime environment to enable unhindered pursuit of maritime economic activities.

The decision, in what is seen as a generation shift, is also an attempt to spur the party cadre ahead of the state election. Other than belonging to the Rajput community, which constitutes over 32% of the state population, Dhami’s long term organisational experience and rapport with party cadres came handy for him. Successive wins from Khatima in Kumaon region counted as a factor as the region is considered a stronghold of Congress veteran and former CM Harish Rawat. Party sources said Ritu Khanduri Bhushan, daughter of senior party leader and former CM B C Khanduri, and MLA from Yamkeshwar, was also considered as Tirath Singh Rawat’s replacement. However, her elevation was seen as a compromise with the party’s opposition to dynastic succession in politics. Being a first time MLA, she lost the race to second time lawmaker Dhami. Party sources said appointing Khanduri as deputy CM was considered, which could have worked as a caste (Brahmin) as well as regional balancing act with Garhwal getting a nominee. Dhami is only the second BJP leader from Kumaon region after his mentor and Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to take over as state CM. Party sources claimed that his elevation will be a direct challenge to Harish Rawat’s hegemony in the region. Most of the senior BJP leaders and known faces hail from Garhwal. However, Dhami faces an uphill task as assembly polls are a few months away and his appointment is set to cause resentment among party leaders who were aspiring to take the mantle after two CMs were changed in four months. Although Koshyari has been holding a constitutional position, he seems to have played a crucial role in the nomination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-bets-on-dhami-affects-gen-shift-in-uttarakhand-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/84129215.cms||Akhilesh Kumar Singh

At least three confirmed cases of avascular necrosis after Covid-19 have been scientifically reported from Mumbai, and doctors fear more are likely in the next few months. The common factor between mucormycosis and avascular necrosis is the use of steroids, the only drug proven to help Covid patients. Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, treated the three young (under 40) patients who developed necrosis two months after they were treated Covid. “They developed pain in their femur bone,” said Sanjay Agarwala, medical director of Hinduja Hospital. His research paper, ‘Avascular necrosis as a part of long Covid-19’, was published on Saturday in BMJ Case Studies. Other orthopedic specialists told TOI they too had seen one or two cases among post-Covid patients. His study underlines two trends: Post-Covid patients had lower threshold dose of steroid and earlier onset of presentation. They were given a mean dose of 758mg of corticosteroid prednisolone that is less than the 2,000mg dosage known to trigger AVN. Secondly, it usually takes six months to a year to develop AVN after post-steroid use. “But these patients developed early AVN at a mean of 58 days after their diagnosis,” he said. “Covid survivors, who have been on steroids, and then develop hip or thigh pain, need confirmatory MRI to establish a diagnosis of AVN of the hip,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-steroids-linked-bone-tissue-death-worries-doctors/articleshow/84129280.cms||Malathy Iyer

Speaking after Congress accused the Modi government of corruption, BJP said the opposition party has been hurling abuses, in what was seen as a reference to Rahul Gandhi’s jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It is because Gandhis were denied the commission?” asked BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra. “Congress should answer as to why for 10 years, despite a depleted squadron strength of the Indian Air Force, its government didn’t procure the much-needed Rafael fighter planes? Is it they did not get their desired ‘commission’?” Patra questioned. He said the pricing, procedures of procurement and all other aspects of the deal have been examined by the CAG and Supreme Court. “In India, the ‘verdict’ is out of the highest epitome of justice. Congress’ accusations sound hollow and carry no water,” Patra said, alleging that Congress is “blatantly lying” about a tender during their regime. He said it is astounding that yet again the Congress has taken the “abuse” way. “It followed the same strategy of abusing PM Modi during the 2019 LS polls. We had then seen the fallout... if they still want to experiment with the dejected ‘toolkit’ they are welcome... the people of the country will give a befitting reply to Rahul Gandhi and Congress,” he further said. “If there was a tender during the UPA regime, then why was the fighter jet not procured,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-angry-because-it-could-not-make-money-counters-bjps-patra/articleshow/84129286.cms||---
---||India||Congress, CPM join forces to demand JPC probe into Rafale deal||NEW DELHI: The opposition kept up the attack on the Modi government over the Rafale deal, with Congress and CPM joining forces to demand a JPC probe into the purchase of fighter jets claiming that the French judicial probe initiated into the deal “reconfirms” apprehensions of corruption in the purchase. On Sunday, Congress member Rahul Gandhi carried out a survey on Twitter asking people to decide why the Modi government was opposed to a JPC probe on the Rafale deal. Among the multiple choices offered were “guilty conscience”, “saving friends”, “JPC does not want a Rajya Sabha seat”, and, “all the above”. More than 63% respondents to the survey chose ‘all of the above”. Congress functionaries also joined the chorus demanding a JPC investigation, calling it the only way to find the truth. Former Union minister P Chidambaram said events and facts related to the deal are tumbling “out of the cupboard one by one”. CPM chief Sitaram Yechury said, “The French public prosecution services (PNF) has ordered an investigation by a French judge into the 2016 Rafale fighter jets purchase deal entered into by the Modi govt. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s turnaround was mired in deep corruption and money laundering suspicion. Constitute a JPC now.” Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said that the French judicial investigation validated Rahul Gandhi’s stand on the deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-cpm-join-forces-to-demand-jpc-probe-into-rafale-deal/articleshow/84129313.cms||---
---||India||How a Brahmin priest found pride of place in St Thomas Cathedral||MUMBAI: Behind a cluster of tall trees and amid the thickets of shops and buildings, smog and traffic in Fort area, the three-century-old St Thomas Cathedral has seen it all. But past its famous arches and inside its walls lined with sculptures, stained glass and liturgical art stands an intriguing piece of history that remains in good part unknown. Inside the city’s oldest Anglican church, on its west wall, lies an imposing marble memorial that is decidedly out of place at first glance. It is the monumental figure of a Hindu Brahmin priest in dhoti and shawl with a downturned visage and his hands joined in prayer under a banyan tree, bending gracefully over an urn. To understand how this monument found pride of place in a church, one would need to delve into the life of Jonathan Duncan, Bombay’s longest-serving governor from 1795 to 1811, who lies buried at the Cathedral and to whom the memorial is dedicated. At the heart of the memorial — erected in 1817 by British inhabitants of Bombay and sculpted by John Bacon Jr. — is a biographical sketch of the Scotsman who arrived in India as a writer for the East India Company at the age of 16 and went on to distinguish himself as an administrator, a patron of ancient Indian learning, who established India’s first Sanskrit college in Benaras, and as a social reformer who stamped out female infanticide in Benaras and Kathiawar. According to James Mackintosh, the Recorder of Bombay, Duncan had been ‘Brahmanised’ by his long residence in India for 39 years.

The fuel bill for travelling from New Alipore to New Town by private car daily now gives me a nightmare. There has been a 40% hike in our monthly expenses over the past six to eight months, though the income has remained the same. Even with a double income, people like us are trying every way to cut costs to cope with the rising expenses. Fuel for the car is draining a lot of our income since we have double travelling expenses to bear. At the vegetable market, I am now paying at least 50% more for almost every green vegetable. Only chandramukhi potatoes are selling at Rs 22, but even the humble brinjal is selling at Rs 80 a kg and okra at Rs 60-Rs 70 a kg. It is the same at the fish market. We have stopped buying tiger prawns since they have crossed the Rs 950 mark, up from Rs 550 post-Yaas, when there was distress sale. Good quality katla is selling at Rs 400 a kg. Fruits are the most expensive items, with mangoes having suddenly shot up to Rs 60 a kg. So we stopped buying fruits. We have cut down on dining out and have limited getting outside food delivered home to just once a week. We are foodies and cannot limit ourselves much. So we have cut down on the number of times we allow ourselves this luxury. My wife used to do a lot of online shopping, but we have completely stopped that as well and are sticking to necessities.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Find a student for engineering college, get Rs 20,000||AHMEDABAD: In times of coronavirus pandemic, there is a work opportunity for enterprising individuals. Hardsell engineering courses in self-financed colleges and get handsome incentives of Rs 13,000-20,000 per student in return. One private university in north Gujarat recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a consultant to help them enrol more students in its diploma and degree engineering courses. “For enrolling minimum 70 students in the diploma engineering students, the consultant will be paid Rs 13,000 per student while the incentive for enrolling up to 40 students will be Rs 18,000 per student and Rs 20,000 per student for recruiting more than 40 students,” reads the MoU. For getting students in MSc courses, the consultant will be paid a Rs 5,000 incentive. Many SFIs are reported to have taken this route to boost their student enrolment as a big number of colleges were struggling to remain afloat after more than 50% of degree engineering seats remained vacant. Barring reputed institutes which attracted students on merit, other self-financed colleges were given a cold shoulder by students who opted to study in SFIs in other states. In 2020, 58% of 64,087 degree engineering seats had remained vacant. In 2019, 57% seats had remained empty while in 2018, 52% seats were vacant. “It is a matter of survival. If we get more students who pay upwards of Rs 1 lakh fee, the commission to agents is worth it,” said an official of a private university that has signed an MoU with a consultant for higher admissions. This year due to mass promotion, there would be 54,000 class 12 A group students against 65,000 degree engineering seats. Experts say SFIs are seeing a big opportunity to fill their classrooms and strengthen their fledgling finances. Janak Khandwala, president of the Gujarat State Self-financed College Management Association said the high number of students passing class 12 is expected to throw a lifeline to colleges fighting for survival. "Many SFIs are known to have signed MoUs with consultants to get them students. It is part of colleges going the extra mile to induce more students," said Khanwala. Provost of Parul University and ex-vice chancellor of Gujarat University MN Patel said the university has hired agents to recruit students and it has helped them get students from across states. "Last year, against a target of 11,000 students, we got 13,000 students. This year, we are expecting 15,000 students," Patel said. Officials said that agents are also being recruited to look after the welfare and lodging and boarding needs of students from specific states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/find-a-student-for-engg-college-get-rs20000/articleshow/84125258.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified 13 cities and towns in Andhra Pradesh as non-attainment cities for not meeting national ambient air quality standards. These cities should prepare appropriate action plans aimed at reducing the air pollution levels to the prescribed norms. The action plan will indicate steps to be taken to check different sources of pollution having speedy, definite and specific timelines for execution. The Union government sanctioned Rs 73 crore to the GVMC as per the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission in order to improve the air quality in Vizag city. While Rs 36.5 crore would be spent on air quality improvement measures including capacity building, the remaining Rs 36.5 crore would be used for improvement in solid waste management. The GVMC has already got approvals for seven works to the tune of Rs 31.2 crore. The state government about two weeks ago gave its nod for the remaining five works, amounting to Rs 41.8 crore. Visakhapatnam city is located in the north-eastern coast of Andhra Pradesh and the entire city lies within two major hill ranges, i.e., Yarada and Adavivaram (Simhachalam). These two hill ranges lead to temperature inversion, particularly during the winter season. The major habitation and industries co-exist in the bowl area as residential colonies sprang up in the surroundings of industries. Due to rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, population in the city increased from 7.52 to about 22 lakh while vehicular population has increased from 74,000 to as much as 14 lakh over the last two decades. In addition to industrial pollution, re-suspension of road dust, vehicular emissions, municipal solid waste, construction activities, etc. are also contributing to ambient air pollution in Visakhapatnam city. According to GVMC officials, the civic body would take up various measures with the Rs 73 crore, including remediation of the existing dumpsite in Kapuluppada, creating mini transfer stations, development of traffic junctions for free flow of traffic, pollution monitoring machines, electric vehicles, development of greenery and heavy vehicle management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-rs-73cr-plan-to-boost-air-quality-gets-govts-nod/articleshow/84122465.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Confined to homes, screen-addicted toddlers find it difficult to walk, talk||AHMEDABAD: A city-based couple worried over their four-year-old girl not walking beyond baby steps consulted a psychiatrist recently. They feared the girl who also showed signs of limited vocabulary-- she would not chatter like children nextdoors her age-had developmental issues.  The psychiatrist, after consulting with his colleagues dealing with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), concurred that the child's perceived delayed milestones were the result of staying in four walls of her home due to the pandemic. The doctors assured the parents there was nothing to worry about. “It turned out that the girl spent most of her time indoors due to the pandemic. More than a year is too long a time for a child to remain largely indoors sans any external stimuli of speaking to kids of her own age and doing the running around in open spaces at pre-school and at home. Due to lack of stimuli, she had shown reduced signs of vocabulary and movement,” said Dr Jinesh Shah, a city-based child and adolescent psychiatrist. “If it were not for the Covid, the scenario might not have arisen.” If Covid-19 ravaged many citizens’ bodies, its after-effects have affected many minds – including toddlers and children, say city-based experts. Excessive screen timing, lack of interaction and stressed behaviour of their parents balancing work and domestic duties all from home, impacted their natural growth. The experts have witnessed issues ranging from attention deficit to aggressive behaviour that compelled their parents to seek professional help. Dr Punita Grover, a city-based child and adolescent psychiatrist, says many children are reporting issues with speech development. "In one of my cases, a six-year-old child had not developed the speech capability matching her age. In such cases, we believe that the screen cannot be an alternative of the person-to-person communication,” said “At developmental stage, the speech progresses with learning of new words and how to arrange them. When the communication is one-way (with screen), it can cause problems for some kids.” Covid-19 pandemic has seen unprecedented exposure of young children to screens for online education. Doctors are reporting screen addiction in children as young as five years old. Dr Nehal Shah, a city-based psychiatrist, the child was diagnosed as `addicted' as he would not eat without the screen in front of him. At a very young age, the children need something constant to hold their attention. The parents – who were also working from home – tried to engage them with the screens which later became a need for some kids,” he said, adding that they advise the parents to reduce their screen time as well to set an example for the kids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/confined-to-homes-screen-addicted-toddlers-find-it-difficult-to-walk-talk/articleshow/84125337.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Petrol @ Rs 99.65 in Kolkata, over Rs 100 in more districts||KOLKATA: Costlier petrol — over Rs 100 a litre — is looming on the horizon for Kolkata. The petrol price, which breached the Rs 100 mark in north Bengal, saw its replication in south Bengal — Krishnagore, Behrampore, Purulia and Jhargram — on Sunday. In Kolkata, the petrol price inched towards the century mark after an increase of Rs 0.41 per litre to reach Rs 99.65. The increase — 34th in petrol price and 33rd in diesel price in two months — also pushed prices of all commodities to a new high. The price variation is basically determined by the distance between the fuel-loading points and the retail fuel dispensing stations. So now the prices of fuel in North Bengal — in Darjeeling, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar — are costlier and a day or two behind the century mark in Kolkata, said an official of an oil marketing company (OMC). OMCs revise rates of petrol and diesel at regular intervals based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15 days and foreign exchange rates. International oil prices soared in recent days on optimism of a quick recovery in fuel demand with restrictions being eased across the globe. Brent crude touched the $75 per barrel mark, the first time since April 2019, said an officer of an OMC. “We have been seeing this rise almost without break since the election was over. The price of petrol has become so exorbitant that a lot of people have stopped buying it. Our sale has dipped. We are losing these customers permanently as there is no hope that petrol price will be reduced in a short while,” said Snehasish Bhowmick, vice-president of West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association. The price of petrol would have crossed the Rs 100 mark a few days ago if the Bengal government, in February, had not offered a relief of Re 1 per litre of petrol and diesel. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. This is why diesel prices have also crossed the Rs 100 mark at these places. Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes, such as VAT and freight charges. Due to this, petrol has crossed the Rs 100 a litre mark in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Bihar, Punjab and Ladakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/petrol-rs-99-65-in-kol-over-rs-100-in-more-dists/articleshow/84124130.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Business||‘Insolvency law’s aim is biz rejig, not recovery’||Amid concerns over poor realisation from insolvency resolution, M S Sahoo, chairman of Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), tells TOI that how much money is realised depends on a variety of factors and the law is not for recovery, but resolution. Excerpts from an interview: There is fear that many of the ousted promoters are trying to get entry through the backdoor through people they know. Are the fears justified?Let me make it clear that there is no prohibition on promoters to retain their company through a competitive resolution plan. The prohibition is on a person, whether a promoter or not, who does not have credible antecedents. Any person, which is connected or related to the prohibited person, is also prohibited. He is also prohibited from buying assets in liquidation or participating in compromise or arrangement of the company. Therefore, backdoor entry is not possible. However, in their endeavour to cling on to the company, some promoters may genuinely believe that either they are not prohibited, or the law prohibiting them is not just, or there is a way to get around the law. They try their luck up to the highest court. There has, however, not been a single instance, where a prohibited person has gained control of the company through a resolution plan. They may not be promoters or their family members but those who have been associated with the promoters. Are more steps required?Some of it may be hearsay. The law prohibits every person, natural as well as artificial, who is connected with the business activity of the prohibited person. Further, a basic premise of any law is that what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly. I think, the extant provisions are adequate. One of the major concerns is about a haircut, which in one case was described as a tonsure. Is that a concern?The question to ask is why does IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) process yield zero haircut in one case and 100% haircut in another for creditors? It depends on the nature of business, health of the economy, marketing efforts, etc. It critically depends on at what stage of stress, the company enters IBC process, as much as at what stage a patient arrives at the hospital. If the company has been sick for years, and the assets have depleted significantly, the IBC process may yield huge haircut or even liquidation. The IBC maximises the value of the existing assets, not of the assets which do not exist. It has been realising, on average, 190% of the liquidation value of the existing assets, for creditors. Tinbergen Rule, named after the first Noble laureate in Economics Sciences, Jan Tinbergen, stipulates that a policy must not have more than one objective. The IBC has only one objective, that is, reorganisation. It reorganises the affairs of a company to rescue it if its business is viable or to close it if its business is unviable. Such reorganisation has several intended benefits, namely, promoting entrepreneurship, improving credit availability, maximising the value of assets of the company, balancing interests, etc. Recovery is neither an objective of the IBC nor even one of the intended benefits, as evident from its long title. It may be appropriate to talk about haircut in case of a law/ policy, which has recovery as a target. Will the Supreme Court order on guarantors help banks in recovery?The haircut, as quoted in case of IBC, is deceptive. It is typically amount of realisation/ amount of claim. The amount of realisation often does not include the amount realisable through avoidance transactions and insolvency resolution of guarantors. The amount of claim often includes loan amount as well as its related guarantee amount, interest on interest, and penal interest. These understate the numerator and overstate the denominator, projecting a higher haircut. The Supreme Court order paves the way for resolution of personal guarantors which will help to reduce or eliminate haircut. Are you seeing banks approach much more quickly compared to earlier?In the initial days, banks were a bit hesitant to initiate the process. That is why probably the banking law was amended to authorise the RBI to direct banks to initiate IBC proceedings in case of default. In the first instance, the RBI directed banks in June 2017 to file applications for insolvency proceedings in respect of 12 accounts having very large NPAs. With attractive outcomes, IBC is now attracting bankers as a possible option to resolve stressed assets. They may not be exercising this option, at the first instance of default, but only when they are sure of better outcomes keeping in view the prevailing economic and sectoral performance. How many cases of MSME resolution have come under the alternate prepack framework?It takes three-six months for the stakeholders to understand a new framework, compare it with other available options and prepare themselves to use it. Prepack requires prior understanding between debtor and creditors before initiating the formal process. It is too early to witness inflow of applications. It’s been three months since the IBC freeze was lifted. Have you seen a spurt in cases being filed?Since expiry of suspension on filing, applications for initiation of insolvency proceedings against 200 companies have been filed. This is on expected lines and has been the experience internationally. The higher threshold of default of Rs1 crore coupled with support and forbearances has limited the flow of applications. More importantly, the stakeholders like to use the Code when the likelihood of resolution is high. They may be waiting for the appropriate time to invoke the Code. One of the idea was to fast-track resolution process and therefore 180 days time limit was set with possible extension of another 90 days. But it is taking longer. Are you satisfied with it?Yes and no. Yes, as compared to pre-IBC days. Earlier it took more than four years. Now it takes around 400 days. No, as compared to our intention. It must be appreciated that we are doing something for the first time. We must allow some more time for the new law and ecosystem to mature and settle down. Do you think there is a need to focus on certain sectors, such as real estate, where resolutions are lower than average?This law is optional. It is not the only law for reorganisation. The stakeholders use it only when they consider it as a better option as compared to other options available to them. They will not invoke IBC if they are apprehensive of outcomes. Further, this law is sector neutral. If one sector gets a preferential treatment as compared to another, it would distort the level playing field and consequently misallocate resources impinging on economic growth. The laws relating to resource allocation, namely, insolvency, competition, securities are always sector neutral. What are the next set of measures that should be taken?Constantly bettering the insolvency ecosystem and enhancing the legislation with value adding features is the endeavour of the Government and the regulator. In keep with this, some work has been done in group insolvency and cross-border insolvency for corporate insolvency, and fresh start process for individuals. These will require amendment to the law. After successful implementation of corporate insolvency, individual insolvency could be the next frontier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insolvency-laws-aim-is-biz-rejig-not-recovery/articleshow/84125959.cms||Sidhartha

The project was started to detect leakage and minimise non-revenue water in Delhi through real-time monitoring of water flow in the city pipeline system. These special bulk meters are being set up from water treatment plants up to colony reservoir levels for water accounting. This much delayed project has seen several deadline revisions since 2018 when the project was started. Official reports show that 362 primary nodes and 2,842 secondary nodes in the pipeline system have been covered, but issues like electricity connections for these meters continue to plague several sites. A senior DJB official said 98% of the primary supply system and 97% of the secondary supply system have been covered and the project is expected to be completed by end of September. “Out of the 3,285 selected points where flow meters were to be fitted, 3,204 have been installed,” the official said. DJB has also been facing the issue of energising the flow meters. “Power connections for 571 flow meters have been pending but for the time being they have been energised with batteries,” official stated. A SCADA data center has already been set up at DJB HQ in Varunalaya, Jhandewalan, from where the entre water audit will be conducted on a real-time basis following the installation of the metres at ward, colony and district levels. The jal board runs a water supply network of pipelines comprising of 14,000 km. DJB’s objective has been to establish a real-time monitoring system for the capital’s water supply as well as the proper functioning of water treatment plants through the SCADA system. This system provides details such as the pressure and flow of water at pre-decided important locations in the water supply system. It also provides integration of other instruments like water quality sensors, benchmarking of water supply, auditing of the quantum of water distributed and calculation of losses. “This project is designed to ensure that water losses are reduced and maximum utilisation of water is achieved,” the official said. The deployment of an effective alarm system in SCADA is expected to help issue timely alerts on the quality and quantity parameters. DJB faces regular crises in water production due to various pollutants, such as ammonia, chlorides and turbidity. “An alarm system will go off as soon as the parameters cross their limits in raw water. This in turn will allow the DJB team here to take any preventive measures required,” the board had earlier announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/project-to-fix-water-supply-leaks-gets-new-date/articleshow/84126650.cms||Paras Singh

Now I have stopped taking my car out. The driver is now off. Not only petrol prices, the ever-rising costs of accessories and lubricants have added to my woes. I will have to take an app cab to take my wife to the doctor, even though the fare has gone up by 15%. Retired people like me are the worst hit. Our earnings from the small savings have nose-dived because of successive cuts in interest — reduction in bank interest rate from 10% to 5.3%, company deposit rate from 11% to 6.3% and senior citizen’s savings from 10% to 7.4%. The price of every essential edible item has gone up too, since rising fuel prices affect each commodity price. The kitchen budget is literally on fire and we kept cutting corners to strike a balance. We even had to dismiss the domestic help. We have cut down heavily on food, clothing, gifting and entertainment expenditure. In clothing, I no longer use the brands which I used to wear. We have the habit of going to theatres, but that, too, has stopped. My daughter is studying abroad and I have been forced to reduce the financial support as well. My wife and I are dependent on medicines, but I now have to look for cheaper varieties of the same formula. I broke my glasses and could not buy the progressive lens I used to wear. Instead, I use two pairs of spectacles — one to read and another for distance viewing. Even the prices of pet medicines have gone up. I pay through my nose to meet my pet’s medical expenses. The income tax benefits for senior citizens are paltry compared to our loss of income. We now use AC sparingly. The only positive fallout, according to my wife, is my cutting down on cigarettes and alcohol. Ganguly, a retired citizen, lives with wife Purna, a homemaker and their pet. Their daughter studies abroad.

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Smugglers evade checks, bring in liquor from Odisha||VISAKHAPATNAM: As tipplers in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts struggle to get a variety of liquor brands at government-run shops, smugglers have found new ways to procure different brands from neighbouring Odisha and selling them in Andhra Pradesh. Inflow of liquor from Odisha, in fact, has been on the rise in the two districts despite routine checks and raids. Though the AP government set up the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) and checkposts along the Andhra-Odisha Border (AOB) to stop the inflow of liquor into the state, a number of organised rackets continue to operate. Smuggling of liquor from Odisha has also become a lucrative business. The SEB and police personnel have been seizing anywhere between 100 to 150 liquor bottles in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts, smuggled in from Odisha, for the past few weeks. But this is only the tip of the iceberg, as the major haul of liquor smuggled in from Odisha goes undetected in the region. A senior officer with the SEB said they have seized small to medium quantities of liquor of Odisha origin in parts of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts, both of which share a border with Odisha. “We are now focusing on some of the interior village routes that are connected to Odisha as liquor smugglers are now taking interior roads instead of highway to evade the police radar,” the officer said. “Since the organised gangs have been getting good profits by selling Odisha origin liquor in the state, they continue the trade in spite of arrests of bootleggers and seizure and destruction of the liquor. We are chalking out some more strategies to check the illegal trade,” officials added. Apart from Odisha origin liquor, on average, officials of SEB and police seize at least 200 to 300 litres of hooch, besides destroying the fermented jaggery wash used for brewing the substance in the two districts. Brewing hooch along the AOB has resumed, with many adopting innovative methods to transport the drink to villages and towns in the two districts where they are sold at high prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/smugglers-evade-checks-bring-in-liquor-from-odisha/articleshow/84122861.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Patna||Many trains cancelled due to rise in water level||PATNA: Railways has cancelled, short terminated and diverted the routes of several pairs of special passenger trains due to rising tendency of Gandak river near rail bridge number 248 located between Sagauli and Majhaulia stations on the Muzaffarpur-Paniahawa section of Samastipur division under the East Central Railway (ECR) jurisdiction on Sunday. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways has cancelled the Narkatiaganj—Muzaffarpur special passenger (05216) from Sunday itself while Anand Vihar—Bapudham Motihari special passenger (04010) has been short terminated at Bettiah instead of Motihari. Besides, Patliputra Junction–Narkatiagnaj special passenger (05201) was short terminated at Muzaffarpur on Sunday instead of going to Narkatiaganj, the CPRO said adding these two short terminated special passenger trains will originate from the respective terminating stations for their return journey from Monday onwards. Railways has also diverted the route of Muzaffarpur–Anand Vihar special passenger (02557) via Muzaffarpur—Chhapra instead of its original Muzaffarpur—Paniahawa route while Bandra Terminus—Barauni special passenger (09039) has been diverted via Chhapra–Muzaffarpur route. Porbander—Muzaffarpur special passenger train ( 09269/09270) has been diverted via the same Chhapra– Muzaffarpur route instead of the original Paniyahawa–Muzaffarpur route, the CPRO said. Likewise, Anand Vihar—Raxaul special passenger train (05274) is being diverted to Narkatiaganj–Sikta–Raxaul route instead of the original Narkatiaganj– Sagauli–Raxaul route while Amritsar—Darbhanga special passenger train (05212) is diverted to Chhpara—Muzaffarpur route instead of Paniyahawa—Muzaffarpur route. The Dehradun–Muzaffarpur special passenger train (05002) is also diverted to Narkatiaganj–Sikta—Raxaul—Sitamarhi— Muzaffarpur route instead of Narkatiagnaj–Raxaul—Muzafarpur route. Meanwhile, taking a serious note of the rising tendency of the Gandak, railways has intensified its monitoring of the water-level at most of the vulnerable rail bridges in Samastipur division. Railway safety track men are keeping a close watch on the rising tendency of rivers as precautionary measures. “Railways has put safety staff and traffic officials on high alert at each vulnerable place in the division,” the CPRO said adding stone boulders, sand bags and coal ash bags in sufficient numbers have been stored at vulnerable sites located all along rail tracks and bridges on the Saharsa–Badlaghat and Samastipur–Darbhanga routes of the division in particular. Railways has already installed water-level measuring devices at each major river to get warning signal in advance in case of any emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-trains-cancelled-due-to-rise-in-water-level/articleshow/84122682.cms||Kumod Verma

From visiting flood-hit areas to holding meetings with party leaders, the younger son of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad is leaving no stone unturned to corner the state government, particularly chief minister Nitish Kumar. Though Tejashwi had “single-handedly” taken RJD-led Mahagathbandhan closer to power by campaigning extensively across the state during the assembly election last year and missed the CM’s post by a whisker, matching the skills of a seasoned politician like Nitish is always a tough job for a young neta like him, experts feel. Nitish had succeeded in convincing Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) to leave Mahagathbandhan and join NDA just before the assembly election. Similarly, Mukesh Sahni-led Vikassheel Insaan Party had also deserted the RJD-led alliance in a dramatic fashion days before the election only to join NDA. RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha, once a bête noire of Nitish, also merged his party with JD(U) after drawing blank in the assembly election. Kushwaha and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi had formed a front of six parties before the assembly election and named it ‘Grand Democratic Secular Front’. As far as Tejashwi is concerned, he has set eyes on Jamui MP Chirag Paswan, who is facing rebellion from his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras. Tejashwi’s recent claim that the Nitish-led NDA government might fall in “two-three months” has created ripples in state’s political circles. Patna University’s former dean (faculty of social sciences) and political expert Nawal Kishore Choudhary said Tejashwi’s posturing would continue, but breaking NDA partners is altogether a different ball game and a difficult job for younger Yadav scion. “State social welfare minister Madan Sahni may have offered to quit citing bureaucratic high-handedness and Manjhi may be unhappy in the alliance, but NDA is in power at the Centre and engineering a split in this alliance is a tough job. Even JD(U) is a strong party and Nitish knows the art of keeping his flock together. Everyone wants power and Tejashwi’s claim that Mahagathbandhan will come to power in the state soon was aimed at convincing these netas not to leave the alliance,” Choudhary said. He added Lalu’s presence may boost the morale of party workers, but will not make much difference as Tejashwi has already taken over responsibility of the RJD from his father. RJD’s Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson Manoj Jha said Tejashwi’s skills were different from Nitish. “Nitish uses all techniques to come to power. He also ignores people’s mandate. There is a communication gap in the NDA government in the state and it will fall soon,” Jha said. Asked about Tejashwi indirectly inviting Chirag to join RJD-lead alliance, Jha said, “That was a big statement. He (Tejashwi) had left it to Chirag to decide whether he wanted to stay with those who are against the Constitution or the ones who are working to protect the pages of the Constitution.” Senior JD (U) leader K C Tyagi said Nitish’s skills were par excellence and no one could match it, not even Lalu. “Nitish is the last icon of socialist movement. He is not facing corruption, dynastic politics and disproportionate assets charges. All the NDA partners in the state are united and the Nitish-led government will complete its full term,” Tyagi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwis-posturing-aimed-at-keeping-flock-together-in-state/articleshow/84123184.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The two entities were incorporated a little over a fortnight before RIL unveiled its green energy plans at its annual shareholder meet on June 24. In February this year, Anant, 26, was inducted as a director of Reliance O2C, where Saudi Aramco is expected to be an investor, and a year before that, he was appointed on the board of Jio Platforms, where his siblings Isha and Akash too are members. RIL didn’t respond to a questionnaire from TOI. While Mukesh Ambani, 64, hasn’t yet spelt out succession planning at RIL, questions like ‘who’s next?’ have started popping up within the investor community. In Ambani’s own case, after the death of his father, RIL founder Dhirubhai Ambani, in 2002, there was a feud over succession between him and his brother Anil. Dhirubhai had not left a will and the family business had to be split, with Mukesh gaining RIL (oil refining and petrochemicals) and Anil getting the energy, finance and telecom units as part of the settlement. Besides Jio Platforms, Isha and Akash, the 29-year-old twins, are on the board of Reliance Retail Ventures. Both Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures had attracted billions of dollars in investments and brought on board global names such as Google, Facebook, Silver Lake and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to help expand their digital and e-commerce footprint. With Anant’s latest board appointments, all the three children now have representation in RIL’s key businesses. After the recent separation of the refining and petrochemicals unit to Reliance O2C, RIL looks similar to Tata Sons, the holding company of Tata Group’s diverse businesses. RIL is also paving the way for initial public offerings of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures, which are expected to take place in the near future. Apart from Reliance New Energy Solar and Reliance New Solar Energy, RIL incorporated five other entities since June — Reliance New Energy Storage, Reliance Solar Projects, Reliance Storage, Reliance New Energy Carbon Fibre and Reliance New Energy Hydrogen Electrolysis. Their names indicate that the entities were established for the clean energy game. All the seven companies have three directors each. A common director in all these entities is Shanker Natarajan. At the annual shareholder meeting last month, Ambani said that RIL will invest Rs 75,000 crore in clean energy over three years, but details about how it intends to execute the green play have not been disclosed. RIL’s renewable power move comes more than a decade after Mukesh and Anil cancelled all non-compete business agreements between them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/youngest-ambani-takes-seat-on-boards-of-rils-2-new-solar-cos/articleshow/84125501.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The meeting, held in virtual mode under the chairmanship of Patna Training College principal Ashutosh Kumar, decided that as per the directions of the UGC and AICTE, NCC must be included as an elective subject in the two-year BEd course. The state education department has also decided to introduce NCC as an elective subject under the choice-based credit system (CBCS) in different colleges and universities of the state. Even the academic council of Patna University has endorsed this decision. In the first phase of the implementation, NCC, as an elective course or subject, will be offered only in those colleges, which already have NCC senior platoon or company and to only those students who enrol as NCC cadets. Likewise, private colleges which are allotted NCC under the ‘fully self-finance scheme’ (FSFS) will also be allowed to offer NCC credit course, the meeting resolved. The NCC course will comprise 24 credits, of which 14 are to be allotted for institutional training (eight credits for theory and six for practical classes) and 10 for two annual training camps of 10 days each. After completing the prescribed criteria, cadets would be able to earn the credits for their degrees along with the A, B and C certificates of the NCC which will enhance their employment potential. The meeting further decided to revise the BEd curriculum in the light of the NEP, 2020 in order to make the course more purposeful and attractive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-universities-to-include-ncc-in-bed-curriculum/articleshow/84122808.cms||B K Mishra

It is coming up at the Transport Complex in Phulwarisharif area near Patna airport. Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the ADTT would be spread over 28 acres of land, including 302sq metres for test track. “It will be the state’s second hi-tech driving test track after Aurangabad’s Institute of Driving Training and Traffic Research. The ADTT will be ready in the next 12-15 days,” he said. “It has been observed that in the absence of driving skills, chances of road accidents increase. When things are manual, people take the driving test in a casual way. After passing the automated driving test, there will be less scope for committing mistakes and road accidents will be reduced,” Agarwal said. ADTT is equipped with scientifically-designed test tracks with multiple high-definition cameras to assess the applicants against 20 essential driving skills. Tracks are lined with sensors. Hitting sensors during the test would result in loss of marks. Agarwal said the department has developed a mobile software through which people would get all the details about the ADTT, including parameters on which the marks would be given to the applicants seeking driving licence, passing marks and other information regarding the hi-tech tracks. The Transport Complex includes Bihar State Road Transport Corporation building (G+4), six residential blocks (each G+5), district transport office building (G+3) and the other offices, bus depot, central workshop for maintenance, cleaning and servicing of buses, covered parking bays for buses and fuel stations, including CNG. The estimated cost of the project is around Rs164.3 crore. A 1,200 kilowatt charging station was already set up. Total eight charging points have been installed, including six of 120 KW and two of 240 KW. The transport officials said the department has planning to increase the charging points as per the requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnas-first-hi-tech-driving-test-track-ready/articleshow/84122741.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar 8th among 31 states in availing digital health service||PATNA: Bihar has bagged eighth rank in the country among 31 participating states in utilising ‘eSanjeevani’, a digital health service platform of the Union ministry of health and family welfare. As per the data shared by the ministry, around 2,23,197 people from Bihar have so far availed consultation on free telemedicine platform. The 31 states together account for 70 lakh doctor-to-patient tele-consultation since the launch of the scheme. Of total consultations recorded in Bihar, 2,22,482 took place through Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centre (AB-HWCs) programme and 715 through online OPDs. The technology-based health service is currently operational in 31 states/union territories in the country and widely used for telemedicine advice by non-Covid patients across the country. Andhra Pradesh has topped in utilising the facility with 16 lakh consultations, followed by Tamil Nadu (12.6 lakh) and Karnataka (12.1 lakh). On the sixth anniversary of Digital India initiative, PM Narendra Modi commended eSanjeevani and virtually interacted with a woman beneficiary from East Champaran in Bihar, Kanti Devi (70), who is being treated digitally by KGMC Hospital, Lucknow. The eSanjeevani was launched in Bihar in February this year and the novel digital service rapidly gained popularity during the second wave of Covid pandemic. Dr B P Jaiswal, associate professor of paediatric department at NMCH-Patna, said it was encouraging that so many people in Bihar used the digital health service during the second wave of pandemic. “Such services prove helpful during the crisis situation when people are not allowed to go out. However, the situation is improving now and health facilities are functioning to their full capacity,” he said. Indian Medical Association (IMA)-Bihar has also launched its own telemedicine service for the people of state. Dr Sunil Kumar, IMA-Bihar’s secretary, said during the Covid-19 surge, they received 300-400 calls per day for medical consultations. “Now, the number of consultations has come down to 5-7 on an average. Such digital health service platform is very important to provide medical facilities to patients during the pandemic situation,” he said. Dr Kumar added the telemedicine service played a very important role in April, May and June this year, and many people were cured by following the doctors’ suggestions. Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, former president of IMA-Bihar, said telemedicine is a crisis management-type medical support system and it cannot be a routine practice. “The state needs to strengthen its medical infrastructure. For the medical council and academic bodies, telemedicine is just a short-cut method and this service gives only temporary relief to patients,” he added. Dr Arun Shah, a Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician and former president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics-Bihar, said people in the state are not tech-savvy, especially in rural areas. “Internet connectivity is a big problem in the state. Secondly, many people are not even aware of the digital health service and telemedicine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-8th-among-31-states-in-availing-digital-health-service/articleshow/84122528.cms||Faryal Rumi

He is also promoting the theme, ‘Give nature a home, grow butterfly gardens and be a life-keeper’ among the nature lovers and environmentalists. Raja Bose, who has worked for months to develop the butterfly garden, says his concern over the depleting number of butterflies motivated him for this initiative as butterflies are important for plant flowers’ pollination for fruits. Bose said pollination is one ecological service that butterflies provide and about 90% of the flowering plants and 35% of the crops rely on pollination for production of fruits/grains. His objective is not only aimed at conservation of different varieties of colourful butterflies but also for maintaining ecological balance and conserving nature besides promoting better fruit/grain production. Bose said his butterfly garden on his sprawling campus has become a habitat for various lepidopterans, including butterflies, skippers, moths etc that are helpful in creating a natural harmony at his home garden. At present he has recorded more than two dozens of butterfly varieties, including plain tiger, common mormon, gull, lime swallowtail, evening brown, janeta, blue morpho, summer azure etc. Environmentalist Deepak Jha said butterflies are on the verge of getting extinct due to massive use of pesticides and chemicals in farms and even gardens. “Now the people are motivated towards creating rooftop and terrace gardens and also going for organic farming. Bhagalpur and adjoining regions have vast farmland areas and wetland besides government wasteland where the state government, local administration along with forest department officials and nature activists can jointly develop ‘butterfly park and sanctuary’,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhagalpur-man-develops-butterfly-garden-at-home/articleshow/84122895.cms||Kumar Rajesh

---||Kolkata||Bengal’s transport minister Firhad to meet bus operators to find solution but commute woes likely to continue today||KOLKATA: Commuting woes are likely to continue on Monday, the first beginning of a week after public transport resumed operations, since private buses will remain off the roads. With most workplaces now operating with 50% workforce, the bus operations run by the state transport undertaking (STU) is overwhelmed by the heightened commute demand. The revision of diesel price to Rs 92.33 on Sunday challenged any intention of private bus operators to take their vehicles out on the roads, and the long queues at bus stands, passengers travelling on matadors, autos carrying five passengers instead of the stipulated two — the picture is likely to remain unchanged on Monday. Bengal’s transport minister Firhad Hakim will hold a meeting with bus operators to find a solution. He has issued a warning against private bus operators: “Being part of the city’s transport system, which is an essential service, they cannot go off the road citing non-viability because of diesel price rises. STUs are facing the same problem.” However, private bus operators have refused to suffer. “Private bus operators should not be compared with STUs, which get subsidies. Moreover, like any other transportation mode, private buses run on a certain principle of profit. But we cannot even strike a break with the current fare structure,” said Tapan Banerjee, secretary of Joint Council of Bus Syndicates. According to sources, the government has a ‘Plan B’ in case private buses remain off the road. The transport department may requisition contract carriages — school buses, chartered buses and app-buses — to narrow the demand-supply gap. However, the gap is unlikely to be bridged completely as it will be impossible to compensate for the absence of over 5,000 buses. Taxis continued to fleece passengers with demand far exceeding the supply on Sunday. During peak hours, most app cabs are going offline to run shuttle services on a fixed route, like Esplanade to Shyambazar, with five passengers for Rs 150 per head. “This is the reason that even surge fares don’t attract enough drivers in the system,” said an official of an app-cab aggregator. Apart from cycles, bike taxis are ferrying a large number of people as Metro operations are suspended. “A lot of us can breathe easy if Metro services resume,” said Gouranga Karmakar, who travels from Dum Dum to Garia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/firhad-to-meet-bus-operators-to-find-solution-but-commute-woes-likely-to-continue-today/articleshow/84124348.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Expert agency to hold energy audit at Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has come forward to turn the Tirumala temple into an eco-friendly and energy efficient pilgrim centre. The BEE has given its consent to AP State Energy Conservation Mission for providing technical and financial support for conducting large-scale investment-grade energy audit in Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams and its allied temples and choultries. Of the total energy consumption of 68 million units per annum in TTD, around 30% of the consumption is met from solar and wind power generation. The remaining 70% of electricity needs of 435 lakh units for TTD and its allied temples around Tirumala hills is being supplied by Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited. A national-level expert energy audit agency, empanelled with BEE, will now take up an investment-grade energy audit of water pump sets from July 5 at TTD. This would find out the performance and efficiency of the existing water pumps, and list those which require replacement. As water management is a priority for TTD, efficient water pumping management plays a key role. In the existing 399 pump sets with a total load of 3,500 HP, it is preliminarily assessed that 20% of energy, i.e. around 1.14 million units, can be saved. In a preliminary energy audit by APSECM in TTD temples, it was observed that energy savings through replacement of existing 38,000 fans with superefficient ones with an investment of Rs 9.5 crore would save 5.02 million units per annum. In monetary terms, this would save Rs 4.5 crore per annum. Similarly, replacement of no star/single star air conditioners with five-star ACs and installation of AC savers for the existing 1,608 ACs with an investment of Rs 8.4 crore is estimated to save 3.09 million units. This would save Rs 1.85 crore per annum.

Swapna, who is the second accused in the case before the NIA special court at Ernakulam, is facing charges under provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA. She has contended that the allegations raised against her would not attract any offence under the UAPA and that the chargesheet does not disclose sufficient material evidence to connect her with the alleged gold smuggling. Bail plea was filed at the high court as her petitions seeking bails before the special court when the investigation was going on and after filing of the chargesheet were declined. In her bail plea, Swapna has relied on a high court ruling, on bail petitions filed by the accused in another gold smuggling case, that gold smuggling is not a UAPA offence and is to be dealt under Customs Act. The bar under UAPA in granting bail was wrongly interpreted by the lower court in a manner prejudicial to her, Swapna said in the plea. While the said provision in UAPA gives discretion to the court in granting bail, it should not have been interpreted as prohibition in granting bail, the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/swapna-moves-hc-seeking-bail/articleshow/84154396.cms||---

Paytm said it will expand the market for institutional credit as it would be available to those who have otherwise not availed of such finance. Paytm CEO (lending) Bhavesh Gupta told TOI that the company was now able to expand credit as it has a view of their customer across platforms in online and offline payments and payments as a merchant. “This gives us an edge over others foraying into ‘buy now, pay later’ products and we can activate a large number of customers and allow them to use the product across a large number of merchants,” he said. The credit product, which the company describes as the postpaid mini is offered in partnership with Aditya Birla Finance. Paytm has applied for a small finance bank licence, and should it get one it will be able to offer these loans on its books. The company has announced plans for an IPO, which will comprise fresh issue and the share-sale by existing investors. It plans to raise Rs 12,000 crore through a fresh issue of shares. Paytm already offers instant credit of up to Rs 60,000 under Paytm postpaid to creditworthy customers. Postpaid mini is targeted at those who find themselves short of funds to make regular payments like fuel, electricity or other utilities or shop. There are no annual fees or activation charges, only a minimal convenience fee, Gupta said. The postpaid mini can be availed at first and the proceeds utilised for shopping or customers can switch to postpaid as a payment option at the time of shopping. “We want to help new-to-credit customers to start their credit journey and develop a financial discipline. Through postpaid, we are also making sincere attempts to help drive consumption in the economy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-offers-rs-250-1000-mini-loans/articleshow/84125584.cms||---
---||Kolkata||I spent Rs 861 on one gas cylinder this time||By: Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey and Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay KOLKATA: Ours is a big family and the expenses are high, particularly the ever-spiking prices of cooking gas — LPG cylinder. This time I spent Rs 861 on a cylinder. In the past seven months, the price has risen by almost Rs 250. Since we sometimes need more than two cylinders a month, it hurts the budget. With the rising fuel bills, travelling expenses have shot up and now we are trying to make the most judicious use of the car. The elders in the family have monthly medical bills that are shooting up too. If you look at the market, there has been a price hike of at least 50% on an average. We have been forced to revise our monthly budget almost every month. It is impossible to stay within the budget that fit us six months ago. We have cut down on dining out, which invariably causes a deep hole in the pocket. Only once in a while are we getting some food delivered, but we are trying to keep within the budget and are not splurging by ordering extra. We have curtailed our weekend mall visits, since, with two school-going children, we end up buying extra things that are not really necessary. After so many days of staying cooped up at home, it does feel exciting to hang out at the malls, but we are controlling ourselves. Even when we are buying grocery and monthly essentials, we have stopped going for the “offers” because that way, we won’t be buying what we don’t need immediately. There is no point stocking up stuff at home. We have also stopped impulse buying from online stores. This is quite an addiction and keeps us mentally busy, but also burns holes in the pocket. We, as a family, have decided to strictly follow the budget for the time being. We are comfortable with what we have and we don’t want to experiment. Kumar, the principal of a school, lives with husband Maneesh, the regional head of healthcare company, two school-going kids and her in-laws.

---||Patna||Lalu, Rabri back on RJD posters ahead of party's silver jubilee event||PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi were back on the party posters along with Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on the eve of the party’s silver jubilee function on Monday. However, Lalu’s elder son Tej Pratap and daughter Misa Bharti were missing from the main poster put up outside the party headquarters here. Though a separate poster of Tejashwi and Tej Pratap was put up in the evening, Misa remained missing. However, Tej Pratap was conspicuous by his absence on the first day of the two-day silver jubilee celebrations of the RJD foundation day at the party office here on Sunday. During the 2020 Bihar assembly election, Lalu was nowhere on the official party posters. It was Tejashwi, who held the fort alone, inviting criticism from the JD(U) and BJP for “ignoring his parents for votes”. Lalu was then in jail in the fodder scam cases and political observers felt the move to keep him out of the frame was part of the strategy of Tejashwi to project himself with a clean image without any corruption baggage of his parents. Since Lalu is out on bail and recuperating at the residence of his daughter Misa Bharti in Delhi, the RJD leaders and workers are overzealous in the hope that their political ‘chanakya’ of his time may bring back to power the RJD, which missed the bus by a thin margin in the last assembly elections with the Mahagathbandhan winning 110 seats against the four-party NDA with BJP and JD(U) as main components bagging 126 seats. The Asaduddin Owisi-led AIMIM, which surprisingly bagged five seats in the Seemanchal area, supports RJD on the floor of the House. Taking a dig at the RJD, BJP spokesman Arvind Singh said Tejashwi can’t keep the party intact without Lalu and that’s why he brought his father back on the posters to celebrate its foundation day. “Why had Tejashwi apologised to the public during the assembly elections for any wrongdoings during the RJD (Lalu) regime? Even last year, Lalu was missing from the posters on the RJD foundation day. Then people had thought that a new era had begun in RJD. But the RJD posters with Lalu back in the frame are proof enough that the party is the same,” he said. However, RJD spokesman Mritunjay Tiwari accused the NDA leaders of suffering from “Lalu phobia”. “We don’t indulge in poster politics. Laluji reigns in people’s hearts. During the last assembly election, Tejashwi was the bridegroom. He is Lalu’s ‘lal’, who is also the leader of the opposition in the state assembly. The NDA leaders have become anxious as they have a very thin majority and they fear of losing power," Tiwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-rabri-back-on-rjd-posters/articleshow/84123234.cms||Jai Narain Pandey
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Krishna district acts to quash fake seed sale||VIJAYAWADA: In a bid to eradicate the fake seed and fertilizer mafia, the agriculture department and Krishna district administration have started implementing an action plan on seed and fertilizer distribution. Farmers across the district are being supplied fine quality seeds from AP State Seeds Development Corporation under the initiative. The kharif season has great significance in the district. Farmers in around 3.5 lakh acres cultivate paddy. In view of this, officials have assured water supply for crops through the Krishna delta canals. Manufacturers of private seed usually cash in on the situation and supply fake seeds at high prices. In comparison, government supply was very low this rabi season with only 12,000 quintals of seeds distributed through this channel. Officials of the agriculture department have set a distribution target of 24,000 quintals of seed this season. “Choosing the right seed will help farmers get high yield. Many farmers don’t know the nature of soil and simply rely on shop owners for seeds. But this time we have done soil tests and arranged certain variety of seeds at nearby Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). Farmers can walk in and get the seeds. We have already received indent of 10,000 quintals from farmers and AP Seeds is making the necessary arrangements,” district collector J Nivas told TOI. Officials said they hoped that the distribution of seeds through AP Seeds will reduce the sale of fake seeds in the market. Meanwhile, irrigation authorities are gearing up to release water to the Krishna delta canals from Monday. Officials said they have completed minor repairs and asked farmers to make necessary arrangements for sowing of the paddy crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/krishna-dist-acts-to-quash-fake-seed-sale/articleshow/84122800.cms||Venu Lanka

State government advisor (public affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, who inaugurated the canteen, showered praises on minister Cherukuvada Sriranganatha Raju for taking up the project with personal funds. “We need such kind-hearted people to serve the poor. The charitable trusts and societies could adopt the model in other teaching hospitals to serve food to the poor,” said Sajjala. Moved by the plight of the kin of in-patients during a visit to GGH at the time of the lockdown last year, district in-charge minister Cherukuvada Sri Ranganatha Raju decided to provide free food to the attendants of patients. He donated Rs 1 crore from his pocket as an initial grant, and visited GGH several times to oversee the progress of the work. “I know GGH is the only hospital that provided the best in healthcare to all sections from West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam. I have decided to repay my debt to the institution by launching the canteen,” said Sri Ranganatha Raju.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/new-canteen-launched-at-ggh-guntur/articleshow/84122865.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||Ad campaigns match rapid shifts in market||Mumbai: Fifteen months and two highly varied waves of Covid have resulted in quick shifts in consumer behaviour across categories. While there was stress on Covid-appropriate behaviour last year, this practice has now become hygiene. Last year also saw consumer purchases shifting dramatically into the digital mode, notwithstanding the issues faced on the supply side. However, the brutal second wave has made the consumer more tight-fisted. In keeping with the situation, brand communication, too, has changed. In the ‘Dettol Salutes’ campaign, Reckitt for the first time replaced the brand’s logo with pictures of selected individuals who stepped up during the pandemic to help others. Reckitt’s regional marketing director (health & nutrition), South Asia, Dilen Gandhi said, “Indians are largely optimists, but this was the first time we saw a change in mood where hope gave way to fear, panic and hopelessness. Dettol has been at the forefront and we wanted to address the despair around us.” Gandhi said a brand has to continue being agile and relevant. If Dettol told stories this year through its packaging in a disruptive manner, Lifebuoy earlier last year launched a public service announcement, encouraging people to use any soap, even that of a rival, to help prevent the spread of Covid. And this year, Lifebuoy ran a campaign (‘It’s in your hands’), which was a direct appeal to the consumer from the frontlines — doctors, nurses and social workers who, through a symbolic gesture of folded hands, plead everyone to play their part in practising good hand hygiene. “What makes this message so unique, besides its encouragement to use any soap, is that for the first time, a hygiene brand went beyond encouraging simple hygiene habits to talk about the other critical public health measures to stay protected,” said a spokesperson from Hindustan Unilever (HUL). Similarly, Domex built on its core messaging on disinfection even while the situation began normalising earlier in the year. With the onset of the second wave, the brand amplified the messaging. HUL says it is pertinent to make a distinction between discretionary categories and categories/brands that operate on the frontline. “In sync with this distinction, it is necessary and only empathetic that brands also craft a differentiated approach on how they communicate to consumers. Therefore, keeping in mind the sensitivities, our ‘non-frontline’ brands were relatively low-key in their outreach. Apart from this, it is logical that when many parts of the country were facing lockdowns during the second wave, discretionary categories would dial down communication,” said the HUL spokesperson. Some brands adopted a strategy to remain quiet during the grim second phase. But marketing experts believe brands should continue to talk to consumers, like a friend would, in thick and thin. Subramanyeswar S, group chief strategy officer at MullenLowe Lintas Group, said, “The unexpected second wave this year threw people completely off gear. Every family had a story to tell. A plethora of puzzling doubts invaded the consumer’s mind. Unlike last year, people do have money, but are not spending. They are holding back expenses for the fear of unintended or unanticipated healthcare needs. Brands need to communicate to remove doubts from people’s minds.” Euronics CEO & MD Viknesh Jain, however, said during a “frightful phase”, communication on a company’s behalf should be carried out internally rather than externally. “Active promotion of your products and services may seem atrocious when people are suffering physically, mentally and emotionally. One can still remain in touch with them by genuinely caring for them,” said Jain, whose company has seen an increase in demand for contactless products in washrooms and also products like contactless sanitiser dispensers. Empathy, said Jain, is critical during times like these. “Brands that use this time to be commercially exploitative will not fare well. Companies should shift their focus from a hardcore business strategy and instead lean into the message of longevity and well-being,” said Jain. Given that convenience and value would play a key role in future and younger people will demand brands with a purpose, Subramanyeswar said trust-multiplier will be a key driver in brand currency. “We are advising brands not to be silent or absent from the consumer’s life during this tough phase. We are asking them to have a meaningful dialogue, but don’t try to buy or lure consumers with discount messages,” said Subramanyeswar. Gandhi said if a brand has something meaningful to say, it must be voiced. “Brands must learn to change their strategies by adapting to ever-evolving consumer behaviour and their consumption patterns. It is crucial now more than ever for brands to be active, relevant, and live up to their consumers’ expectations,” said Gandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ad-campaigns-match-rapid-shifts-in-market/articleshow/84125545.cms||Namrata Singh

---||Kochi||Kerala: Accused revealed presence of third gang, says customs||KOCHI: Customs on Monday submitted before the court that they have received a statement from Karipur gold smuggling case accused Mohammed Shafeeque that a third gang had also come to the airport to receive the smuggled gold. He revealed that this was due to a gang rivalry between Arjun Ayanki and another person. The agency produced Shafeeque back in court on completion of his Customs custody period. Shafeeque has also told Customs that the gangs operated by Ayanki had informed him that two persons, Kodi Suni and Shafi, who were convicted in the T P Chandrasekharan murder case, were there to back Ayanki and that he will be extended all protection, if the Koduvally gang threatens him. Shafeeque informed the sleuths about the life threat he faced from the ‘Cherpulassery gang’ while in judicial custody at Manjeri sub-jail and identified the photo of the person who had threatened him. Shafeeque told the court that he was threatened by one Musthafa of Cheruplassery gang, who was arrested by police. He also requested the court to remand him in a jail in Ernakulam . The court directed him to give a complaint and is likely to order an investigation based on it. Customs told the court that Shafeeque cooperated with the probe and has revealed many facts and provided clinching evidences in the case. “He has also stated about the involvement of a number of persons from Koduvally, Kozhikode and Kannur who run a smuggling network from Dubai. His statements bring out the fact that members of one gang recruit men from other gangs as informers. These gangs then deploy criminals to abduct the carrier and assault him and steal the smuggled gold,” Customs said. Meanwhile, Ayanki’s wife Amala appeared before Customs for giving her statement. Sources said she was summoned to find out the veracity about Ayanki’s claims about his financial sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/accused-revealed-presence-of-third-gang-customs/articleshow/84154461.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Kalraj Mishra's biography sold to 27 Rajasthan vice-chancellors for Rs 68,000 each, governor house denies its role||JAIPUR: Governor Kalraj Mishra‘s office distanced itself from the controversy of allegedly ‘selling’ copies of his biography to vice-chancellors of 27 universities in the state for an amount of Rs 68,383 each. The official statement categorically said that the governor’s house had no role to play in the ‘sale’ of books. Immediately after the statement was issued, the vice-chancellors, who found themselves with ‘unwanted’ copies of the biography, responded saying that they would return the copies to the publisher. The book, titled ‘Kalraj Mishra: Nimitt Maatra Hoon Main’ (I am Just A Medium)' and authored by D K Taknet, was released on July 1 to mark the 80th birthday of Mishra and was attended by CM Ashok Gehlot, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Vidhan Sabha Speaker CP Joshi along with 27 VCs. After the event, the VCs found 19 copies of the book left in a carton each in their cars. Their drivers were given a bill totalling Rs 68,383 after a 10% discount. The price of the book is Rs 3,999. The VCs were surprised that they were not informed of the ‘purchase’ of the book during the five-hour programme. The move appeared to have been designed in advance as the bills were digitally made in the name of the registrar of each university. Since they thought that the decision may have been made by the chancellor, they kept silent until information was leaked to the media. The VCs made it clear that forced purchase of books, that too of no academic value, was against rules. But they were in a fix on what to do about the books 'imposed' on them. As per university rules, books can be purchased on the basis of a demand made by the library committee and duly approved by the purchase committee. The governor's official statement said that the publisher, the International Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship (IIME), had requested the book to be launched at the governor's house and that it was granted to them. The governor's house had no role in the sale of books, says the statement, which also doesn’t clarify how a private entity was allowed to hold a commercial event inside the premises. “The governor's house was not aware that the publisher had given 19 books and bills. He is disappointed over the issue and is considering taking some action against the publisher,” said a source at the governor's house. Clarifying the issue, the source added that CM Gehlot, Birla and Joshi were invited by IIME, the publisher. The source also denied that Mishra’s OSD Govind Ram Jaiswal had co-authored the book as mentioned in it. “Jaiswal's role was just to provide information to authors on the behalf of Mishra. It is misleading to say he has co-authored the book,” said a source. TOI has accessed documents exchanged between IIME and CMO indicating that the former had invited CM Gehlot. TOI called Subir Kumar, secretary to the governor’s house, who expressed ignorance beyond the official statement released earlier in the day. When TOI spoke to four VCs who attended the event, they outrightly rejected the official statement. “The official staff of the governor's house had collected details like car and drivers' numbers from us. The books were loaded in the vehicles in full view of the security staff present,” said a VC. Another VC said since the books were given without the consent of the chancellor (governor), they would now be returned. “The biography doesn’t hold any academic importance for students leaving us with no scope to keep it,” said a VC requesting anonymity. Reacting to the controversy, the author and the director of IIME, D K Taknet, told TOI, “I fully agree with the governor’s office statement that they were not aware of the sale of books. It is a standard practice that during such events we carry books for sale. The books were given to VCs on the condition that if they didn't want it they could return them.” He added that they had carried 500 copies of the book to the event and given complimentary copies to almost every guest. Though TOI called up two VCs to verify whether they were asked to return the books, both of them denied there was any such request.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/guv-office-says-no-hand-in-sale-of-mishras-book/articleshow/84126583.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Transport, discounts lead to 3-fold jump in footfall at Kolkata malls||KOLKATA: Availability of public transport coupled with end-of-season sales by retailers clocked a three-fold jump in footfall and a corresponding increase in sales at malls across the city against the first weekend since malls reopened after the second pandemic-led shutdown. And even though restaurants continue to lose out on business as 8pm closure is too early for diners, food courts did brisk business with 30-45 minute wait for a table as seating continued to be restricted at 50%. South City, the largest mall in the region, drew more than 60,000 shoppers between Friday and Sunday, up from 20,000-odd shoppers it had recorded last weekend. Compared to what the mall had recorded during the corresponding weekend last year after the mall reopened in June 2020 post the lockdown, the growth is nearly three times. “Every passing day, we are seeing an increase in numbers of visitors at the mall. The numbers are translating into higher sales. The recovery has definitely been a lot faster than last year,” said South City vice-president Manmohan Bagree. Acropolis that had a slow start this year, clocked twice the footfall during the weekend. “Last year, it took more than two months to record the kind of footfall we have reached in three weeks. This is due to the confidence people have developed post vaccination. Unless the third wave rears its head, business will continue to grow,” said Acropolis mall GM K Vijayan. While apparel and shoes were doing well ever since malls opened with children’s wear and toys topping the sales, cellphones and jewellery too have been top grosser, particularly as postponed weddings are lined up now. Even Forum mall on Elgin Road, clocked a footfall of 37,000 this weekend. “Footfall is steadily increasing even on weekdays. We are very bullish,” said Forum mall head Ujjal. “The food court is doing well. Customers are appreciating the adherence to Covid norms in the mall and care taken to maintain hygiene. They, too, are behaving responsibly,” said Quest mall VP Sanjeev Mehra. With the two City Centres in Salt Lake and New Town dependant on public transport, footfall has witnessed a quantum jump. “From Friday onwards, there has been a remarkable improvement in footfall and sales at both malls,” said Ambuja Neotia Group whole-time director Ramesh Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/transport-discounts-lead-to-3-fold-jump-in-footfall-at-city-malls/articleshow/84124395.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Pune||Restrictions lead to surge in wildlife sightings in Pune areas||PUNE: Wildlife sightings in city areas have surged over the past year, with animals like Chinkaras, Indian Gaur, rare bird species and aquatic animals being spotted frequently, senior forest department officials confirmed. It is believed that the animals are roaming out of forest areas adjoining city limits. Deputy conservator of forest, Pune region, Rahul Patil told TOI that Chinkara sightings have increased near Baramati-Indapur road while Indian Gaurs are now frequently spotted near Paud road and Lonavla city area. He said that there have been at least four Indian Gaur sightings in the city in the last year, two sightings in Lonavla, one such sighting in Daund and Baramati urban areas. “A leopard was recently sighted near Vishrantwadi. Relatively less human disturbance in forest areas on account of the drop in tourist activities due to Covid-19 restrictions has caused a significant surge in wildlife sightings in city areas. Subdued human movement, including drop in vehicular traffic, has caused the city to calm down to an extent, giving animals a chance to move about freely. The Indian Gaur in fact is being sighted once every two months, which was a rare occurrence till a year ago,” he said. Around mid-March, a tiger was seen in the wildlife habitats situated within Aurangabad district after a gap of around eight decades.Chief conservator of forests for Kolhapur (territorial) region Clement Ben said, “Due to the lockdown, human interference in forest area and its surroundings has been restricted and the animals are free to roam. Since last year’s lockdown, several incidents have been recorded where the wild animals have come out of their habitat in search of food or while roaming.” He said that a leopard was spotted on the road leading to Pargad fort in April whereas another was spotted near Karad. It was sitting on the Pune-Bangalore National Highway. “Sambar and spotted deers were seen in the month of May in the Chandgad forest region. This was a rare instance, as these animals prefer grassland habitats whereas Chandgad is a rainforest area. A family of four elephants was spotted last week at Gudwale village in Chandgad taluka of Kolhapur district. They may have migrated in search of food,” added Ben. On June 21, a leopard was found at the ticketing counter of Ajanta Caves at around 2 am on June 21. The big cat, which may have strayed towards the caves in search of prey such as monkeys or dogs, moved into the nearby green patch after a brief stay of around 90 seconds. “The mountain range where the Ajanta and Ellora caves are located is the natural habitat for different wildlife. We should not perceive sighting of leopard or any other creatures as man-animal conflict,” divisional forest officer (Aurangabad) Vijay Satpute said. Earlier, around mid-March, a tiger was seen in the wildlife habitats situated within Aurangabad district after a gap of around eight decades. Honorary wildlife warden Kishor Pathak said pandemic-related curbs may have made big cat’s journey via Yavatmal, parts of Telangana, Akola, and Hingoli much easier. “Lesser vehicular and restricted public movement saw the tiger reaching Gautala Autramghat wildlife sanctuary,” he said.

---||Delhi||BJP seeks ACB probe into ‘DTC scam’||New Delhi: Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, Leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and MLA Vijender Gupta on Monday submitted a memorandum to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal seeking a probe by anti-corruption branch into the alleged DTC bus “scam”. The LG assured the delegation that an appropriate probe by the branch would be ensured after the ongoing high-level inquiry was over. The memorandum stated that the AAP government had been continuously flouting legislative rules. The assembly session was not prorogued indefinitely so that it could be convened without the consent of the LG. So much so that the BJP MLAs were not even informed about the visit of ministers or the chief minister to their constituencies, BJP said in the memorandum.  “Roads are broken, and dust is causing pollution. During the pandemic and even before it, the healthcare system of the capital was at its worst and there had been no change in it even now. The transport system is on the verge of a collapse,” Bidhuri said. The delegation claimed that, in recruitment of civil defence volunteers, rules and norms were not being followed and demanded the hiring be done under the supervision of Delhi Police. Despite repeated attempts by TOI, AAP did not respond on the allegations.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-seeks-acb-probe-into-dtc-scam/articleshow/84156631.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Cops said that they will track down the accused and try to ascertain if he was drunk at the time of the accident.

He subsequently started blackmailing me with those pictures and for years, exploited me physically, mentally and economically,” the FIR reads. She said they eventually got married at an Arya Samaj temple. She said when she came to know of his real identify and questioned him, he was furious and forced her to accept Islam. In the FIR, she also alleged that the suspect used to beat her and had threatened to kill her mother, if she objected.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bars, restaurants experience best weekend since easing of curbs||KOLKATA: Bars and restaurants in the city witnessed the best weekend on July 3 and 4 since relaxation started from June 15. There was better footfall compared to the last couple of weekends as public transport and app cabs resumed services. Opening up of more offices with a higher number of employees also contributed to the numbers. The government had allowed bars and restaurants to remain open only till 8 pm and cater to only 50% of the capacity. But due to restrictions on transport and most offices operating with only 25% of employees, the footfalls have remained low.  The president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) Sudesh Poddar, who owns restaurants like Songhay and Manthan, said, “Saturday was very good and there was also waiting around 6.30 pm for dinner. Sunday too was really good for both lunch and dinner. We hope the next 15 days will be even better,” he said. The owner of Peter Cat and Mocambo, Nitin Kothari, pointed out that opening up of public transport and offices has made a huge difference. “There was queue for lunch in both my restaurants on Sunday. People were waiting for lunch from 1 pm and Saturday also lot of people came early for dinner,” he added. Syed Anwar Azim of India Restaurant pointed out that sales have increased by 20% despite the inclement weather. “We are expecting footfalls to pick up further in next few days,” he added. Aminia director Kabir Azhar said that business this weekend was good but it would have been better if there was no further restrictions in outskirts like Jessore Road, Baruipur.  The owner of Moulin Rouge, Floriana, Magnolia at Park Street, Charles Mantosh had a very good business this Saturday. On Thursday, Friday, he pointed out that the lunch was very good but dinner was affected following rain. “I think August would be much better,” he added.  “The reduced capacity was full. As transport resumed lot of staff had also joined back,” added owner of Mio Amore and KK’s Fusion, Pradip Rozario. Pratap Daryanani of Oasis Restaurant on Park Street said, “We want to conduct our business keeping everybody’s safety in mind. We started vaccinating our staff in April itself and many have even received their second dose of the vaccine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bars-restaurants-experience-best-weekend-since-easing-of-curbs/articleshow/84124445.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

Vijay Kumar, who lives in Shakur Basti in northwest Delhi, is the only breadwinner of his family. On June 30, he had withdrawn Rs 1 lakh from his bank account in the capital and bought 55 kg of ration items to head back to his hometown in Uttar Pradesh’s Khurja, where he wanted to build a house for his children. A bag found by #DelhiPolice Ct Narender on Shivaji Bridge railway platform contained ₹1 lakh cash, adhaar card etc.… https://t.co/fE6jMyrQfO— #DilKiPolice Delhi Police (@DelhiPolice) 1625425621000But unfortunately, he loaded the two bags of ration in the Bareilly-New Delhi intercity express and left his cash bag behind on a bench at the platform. Meanwhile, constable Narender Kumar posted with the New Delhi Railway police station was on duty at Shivaji Bridge station and taking rounds at the platform after the train left the station.  Constable Narender found the carry bag on the bench. “On checking it, I found the cash along with an Aadhar and ration card,” he said. “I immediately informed my seniors about it and tried to get in touch with Vijay Kumar but when I was unable to get through to him, I decided to wait till someone comes to enquire about it,” he said. Hours later, around 6.30pm, Vijay returned to Shivaji Bridge station in search of the money and was safely handed over the carry bag and Rs 1 lakh by the constable after due formalities. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Railways) Harendra Kumar Singh said, “Vijay Kumar left his carry bag at the station. Our constable Narender found the bag unclaimed and returned the belongings to Kumar along with his cash of Rs 1 lakh.”  Recalling the day, Vijay said it was very hot and he was sitting on a bench at the platform waiting for the train to arrive. As the train arrived, he loaded the ration items and boarded the train in a hurry leaving behind his “thaila” (carry bag) on the bench.  “When I got off at Anand Vihar station, I felt thirsty and that is when I realised that I had misplaced my thaila. I panicked and was in tears because I had Rs 1 lakh cash in it. This money was very important for me. I had been saving it to build a small house for my children,” he said.  “I am a poor man. For a labourer like me, Rs 1 lakh is a huge amount. No one helped me when I requested a few of them at Anand Vihar station to keep my ration for a few hours until I return so that I could go find my money. I had lost all hopes but Narender babu was a saviour. He handed over my belongings and also got me boarded in the next train safely,” a relieved Vijay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cop-returns-lost-rs-1l-cash-to-labourer/articleshow/84126628.cms||---
---||India||Lalu, Rabri back on RJD posters ahead of silver jubilee event||PATNA: Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi are back on RJD posters in Bihar, along with Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, on the eve of the party’s silver jubilee function on Monday. However, Lalu’s elder son Tej Pratap and daughter Misa Bharti were missing from the main poster outside the party headquarters. Though a separate poster of Tejashwi and Tej Pratap was put up in the evening, Misa did not feature on it. Tej Pratap was conspicuous by his absence on the first day of the two-day silver jubilee celebrations of the RJD foundation day that began at the party office on Sunday. During the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, RJD chief Lalu was nowhere on official party posters and Tejashwi, who held fort alone, faced criticism from the JD(U) and BJP for “ignoring his parents for votes.” Lalu was then in jail in the fodder scam cases and political observers felt the move to keep him out of the frame was part of Tejashwi’s strategy to project his clean image and as a leader without any baggage of corruption. Lalu is now out on bail. In Patna, the mood among RJD leaders and workers appeared to be upbeat with many saying that Lalu’s return may soon turn the political fortunes of the party, which lost by a whisker in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lalu-rabri-back-on-rjd-posters-ahead-of-silver-jubilee-event/articleshow/84129371.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

Police clamed that they had arrested three people linked to the module, near Smalsar in Moga district, on Saturday night. A man identified as Arshdeep Singh alias Arsh Dala is said be to the Canada-based operative. The three men who were arrested in Moga have been identified as Yadvinder Singh alias Yadi, a resident of Eena Kheda village in Muktsar; Racchpal Singh of Chakk Walian village in Tarn Taran; and Talwinder Singh alias Mintu of Majha Patti village in Muktsar. Police have recovered a grey-coloured Chevrolet Cruze (DL 3CAE 4302), one 0.32 bore pistol along with live cartridges, and 20 grams of heroin from their possession. Moga police had recently busted a target killing module by arresting three more men — Lovepreet Singh alias Ravi, Ram Singh alias Sonu and Kamaljeet Sharma alias Kamal. They were allegedly involved in the murder of a Dera Sacha Sauda follower, attack on a priest, and Supershine murder case. Dala is alleged to be the main conspirator in all these crimes. Moga senior superintendent of police Harmanbir Singh Gill said they had gotten information that Dala had made threatening calls and texts to a shop owner at Talwandi Bhai in Ferozepur district, threatening to kill him in case he failed to pay a ransom of Rs 30 lakh. He said following a tip-off that Arsh had tasked these three persons to collect the ransom from the shop owner, joint police teams were deployed to nab the three and they were arrested. SSP said the trio had confessed to the crime and that they were acting on the directions of Dala. SSP said the three are history-sheeters and already facing criminal cases. Yadi was a close aide of slain gangster Vicky Gounder. “Since National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken over the probe into targeted killings, we have also shared these inputs with it,” said the SSP, adding that the process to extradite Dala and his co-conspirators was underway. A case has been registered against them under Arms Act and NDPS Act at Smalsar police station, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/cops-terror-group-linked-module-busted-in-moga/articleshow/84126657.cms||---

Under this technique various native species of plants are planted close to each other, which ensures their growth upwards is rapid by receiving sunlight from the top.Three months after the seedlings were sown close to each other, the vacant land near lecture hall – Orion-- has over 6-feet tall green cover. Another land where this forest was developed is also showing progress.“It was surprising to find the green cover growing in such short period, which is irrigated using drip irrigation. Butterflies have started coming to this piece of land besides birds,” said Mini Shaji Thomas, director of NIT-Trichy.We have a couple of ponds inside the campus, which store water for short period of time in a year. We are planning to take up Miyawaki plantation around the pond with an aim to ensure water storage throughout the year. This could be possible as dense Miyawaki forest will help store water under the soil, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/nit-trichy-to-extend-miyawaki-forest-to-more-spots-on-campus/articleshow/84126642.cms||---

Police said one of the accused, Harshad Patel of Ahmedabad, has been sent to remand for two days by the court. “Except Patel, all other accused have been granted bail in the gambling case. Patel, who had booked the rooms in the resort, was found in possession of nine liquor bottles, so a separate case under the Prohibition Act was registered against him.

The group included seven women who were called to work as dealers on the gambling tables. People involved in the gambling included those from Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Surat, Vadodara and Amreli. Patel used to hold trips to Goa for gambling as there are casinos there. But with the casinos not working due to Covid-19 pandemic, he organized a gambling party in this resort.

He was speaking after inaugurating Lokmanya Hospital’s facility for special surgery, equipped with four state-of-the-art robotic systems, on Saturday. This is the hospital's fifth super specialty unit located on Senapati Bapat Road. “Pune's medical fraternity has contributed a lot to control the pandemic. We need many such hospitals to help patients lead a healthy life, reduce morbidity and mortality,” Pawar said. Spread over 47,623 sqft, the specialty surgical unit has the latest advancements and operation theatres for treating critical patients. “It is the only hospital in India with four robotic-assisted joint replacement technologies - Rosa, Navio, Brainlab, and Cori - under one roof,” the hospital's medical director, noted joint replacement surgeon and robotic expert Narendra Vaidya, said. The region around Pune has been developing at a rapid pace, and to access medical care one needs quality health services close to the community. “LHSS serves patients with comfort, care, respect, and dignity with 24x7 emergency medical care,” Vaidya added. The hospital will create awareness for early detection of diseases and ailments by organizing health camps. “People from the interior parts of the state don't have access to quality medical facilities. Many avoid long-distance travel for treatment. We started super-specialist OPDs in Nashik, Jalgaon, Aurangabad, Sangli, Satara, Karad, Belgaum, Solapur and other cities are in pipeline to screen patients and provide them the best medical services,” Vaidya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/surgical-unit-with-4-robotic-systems-at-lokmanya-hosp/articleshow/84124489.cms||---

Patil said, “Schools should be more courteous towards students.” The PCMC’s education officer Parag Mundhe said they had received over 40 complaints, so far, regarding the demand in increased fees and around 30 complaints regarding no granting of admissions under the RTE Act. “For the fees issue, there are multiple written complaints regarding some private schools. In such a case, we send a supervisor to inquire about the issue and resolve it.

---||Agra||Scores of Samajwadi Party workers, including MLA, booked in Bijnor & Firozabad after UP’s district panchayat polls||BIJNOR/AGRA: Scores of Samajwadi Party (SP) workers, among them an MLA, were booked for alleged “abductions” in Bijnor and Firozabad districts hours after the results for UP’s district panchayat chairpersons election were announced on Saturday giving a clear lead to the ruling BJP amid allegations of “misuse of power” by it. BJP bagged 67 out of the total 75 seats of chairpersons. Ironically, the ruling party and the opposition SP had almost equal number of district panchayat members who vote to elect the chairpersons. But, the scale is usually tilted towards the ruling party when it comes to the election of district panchayat chairperson. In the previous polls, SP had clinched 60 seats. Like in the past, allegations of misuse of state machinery were made this time too. The charges were trashed by BJP. On Saturday night, an SP MLA from Bijnor’s Nageena constituency and several other workers of his party were booked for alleged abduction of a district panchayat member. The SP’s candidate for the chairperson’s post, Charanjeet Kaur, was also among those booked. Bijnor’s superintendent of police (SP) Dharamveer Singh said, “Police have registered a case against Nageena MLA Manoj Paras, SP candidate Charanjeet Kaur and some other SP leaders for kidnapping district panchayat member Sonam Chaudhary, her husband Madanpal and two children. The FIR was registered against the accused based on the complaint filed by the brother of Madanpal. It was alleged that the accused had kidnapped his relative for not casting vote in favour of the SP candidate. All kidnapped persons have been rescued." When contacted, Kaur rejected all the charges and alleged that the BJP had “abducted her party members” to win the election. “We had enough members to win the poll. Our voters were in Punjab with my husband. While being brought to Bijnor on Saturday morning, they were stopped on Ganga barrage. BJP candidates kidnapped our voters with the help of the administration,” Kaur said. BJP’s Sakendra Pratap Singh secured 30 votes and won the Bijnor chairperson’s seat. Kaur had to settle with 25 votes. SP MLA Manoj Paras termed the police action as “murder of democracy”. Meanwhile in Firozabad, five district council members backed by the SP were also booked and sent to jail on Saturday evening. SP leaders alleged that it was done in “revenge” as the five council members had refused to vote in favour of the BJP candidate. Police said that four of the five council members were involved in the “kidnapping of a women district council member”. The other member was accused of disrupting government work. Additional superintendent of police Mukesh Chandra Mishra said, “The arrests were made on the basis of complaints filed against them before the voting. All of them were allowed to cast their vote. They were sent to jail after a court order.” Samajwadi Party MLC Dileep Yadav said, “Fake cases were registered against our party’s council members to pressure them into voting in favor of the BJP candidates. The five members sent to jail had voted against the BJP candidate.” In Firozabad, the ruling party had just five of the 33 seats. While SP had 16 seats. But BJP candidate Haristha Singh defeated the SP’s Ruchi Yadav by a margin of 6 votes. Ruchi said, “District administration openly supported the BJP candidate. We lost the election because of them.” Just hours after the results were announced, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had said, “The ruling party has made a mockery of elections. Never saw such a disgraceful face of power. To convert its defeat into victory, BJP used force with the help of police and administration to kidnap voters, stop them from voting and forcefully got the members to vote in their favour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/scores-of-sp-workers-including-mla-booked-in-bijnor-firozabad-after-ups-district-panchayat-polls/articleshow/84122603.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||Delhi: Why not all trees may help you breathe easy||NEW DELHI: Not all trees planted in Delhi are effective to counter pollution and a tree needs to be picked after considering multiple factors, Delhi University’s environmental studies department has found during a two-year study. The department has found that areas with high pollution content due to high traffic or industries require trees such as neem and peepal as they have high air pollution tolerance index (APTI). The study was conducted under professor Chirashree Ghosh of the department in collaboration with Babli Moitra Saraf, principal of Indraprastha College for Women, on the college premises. It was an extension of the tree census of the campus, which listed 803 trees across 91 species. “Delhi government has announced a target of planting 3.3 million saplings in the coming monsoon months and draft Master Plan Delhi 2041 targets to create green belts,” Ghosh said. “Vanmahotsav is organised with a lot of publicity every year. While such policy initiatives are welcome moves, we need to be careful about the rationale behind the choice of the species that are planted,” she added. She explained that plantation without a proper basis behind the selection of species might result in suboptimal and unwanted outcomes. “It is important to follow scientific methods of evaluating different species of trees for selection before starting plantation drives.” The purpose of planting trees, Ghosh explained, is to “use their biological qualities to our advantage”. In addition to cooling, providing shade and improving the ambiance, trees prevent soil erosion, retain rainwater and, most importantly, sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide and other gases. Dust consisting of particles of different types and sizes settle on leaves, purifying the air. “We need to introduce the concept of green infrastructure, which is like a green web that encompasses a wide variety of interactions between biological species and multiple human functions,” she said. “The purpose of urban greening is to conserve the biological ecosystem and utilise its benefits, such as reduction of air pollution, improvement of air quality, control of ambient temperature, and attenuation of noise pollution.” Trees can lower the pollution levels in areas in the vicinity of heavy vehicular traffic, congested bus terminals, petrol pumps, etc, she added. The study at IP College was essential as it “is located at a disadvantageous location in north Delhi, near Ring Road and Interstate Bus Terminus at Kashmere Gate and high pollution-emitting commercial sites”, said Ghosh. The team monitored the responses of all trees within the campus to the concentration of particulate pollution and calculation of vegetation diversity Index, APTI and anticipated performance index. “We recommend trees with high APTI values for mega plantation, such as semi-evergreen peepal or deciduous neem along with few moderately tolerant species like deciduous shahtoot and chamrod and evergreen ashok that act as fantastic dust filters,” Ghosh said. Barren patches, she added, should be replaced with ground vegetation of native shrubs like arni, chhoti-ari and hedge caper, while vilayati kikar, being an invasive exotic, is strictly not recommended for plantation despite being a highly tolerant variety. According to Anindita Roy Saha of Centre for Earth Studies and teacher coordinator at IP College, the study can help in improving the life on the campus and “can be used in developing models for efficacious designing and development of urban forests, community parks and green belts in highly polluted sites in a city like Delhi”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-not-all-trees-may-help-you-breathe-easy/articleshow/84126734.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

The road, being developed as one of the 15 projects across the state, will be a leg-up for the state’s industrial infrastructure besides providing a quick alternative link for the people in the western districts to reach Chennai. Initiated as part of the east coast economic corridor (ECEC) by the department of industrial policy and promotion of the Union government, road networks in 23 districts were included in the project to upgrade to industrial networks. The 31-km link between Thuraiyur in Trichy district and Perambalur district headquarters is touted to help the cement industry and shallot traders to reach the western districts including Namakkal and Tirupur. While the existing road with a lot of steep curves was considered as unsafe, people were not utilising the road much. As per the proposal, CKICP will realign the road to straighten the curves. The project also envisages creating two new bypass roads at Nakkasalem (1.5km) and Kurumbalur (2km). The road will be widened to 12 metres from 9 metres using the state highways department’s land. “Goods heading to the western districts and Kerala from the central region can utilise the link and can avoid entering Trichy city. Textile hubs in Karur and Tirupur can also utilise the link to reach Chennai via Perambalur in a short time,” N Saravanan, Thuraiyur-based road safety enthusiast, said. The untapped tourism potential of Trichy and Namakkal districts will also get a push as the 31-km link between Thuraiyur and Perambalur merge with Chennai-Trichy-Madurai NH. “We are planning to complete the work before February 2023 hoping that the pandemic and lockdown restrictions will not impact our progress. The link road will benefit banana and shallot farmers to market their produce,” an official involved in the road project said. Upon completing the work, Chennai-Kanyakumari industrial corridor project will maintain the road for seven years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/industrial-corridor-work-begins-in-trichy/articleshow/84126727.cms||Deepak Karthik

The bovines originally donated by devotees to the temple were surplus cattle and was therefore handed over to the temple priests whose income was impacted by the pandemic. HR&CE officials said that the Srirangam temple receives cows and calves as donations from devotees on a monthly basis. The Ranganathaswamy temple had 179 bovines including milch cows and calves. They were maintained at the temple and in a cow shelter in the outskirts of Trichy city. The cows were providing dairy products such as ghee and milk for the temple’s pooja and free food for the needy. Meanwhile, the temple management said 111 cattle was considered as the capacity to manage the expenses to maintain them. The HR &CE proposed the remaining 68 cows and calves to be donated to the rural temple priests whose livelihood was affected by the pandemic when temples were closed. About 34 beneficiaries including non-Brahmin priests were identified for handing over the cows and calves. They were employed in the HR&CE rural temples across Trichy district under orukala pooja scheme (one pooja a day scheme). “The rural priests were earning only with the offerings made by the devotees. As their income is hit, the cows were provided,” S Marimuthu, joint commissioner, Srirangam temple told TOI. Of the 34 beneficiaries identified, only 30 turned up and received 60 bovines. Each of them was handed over two animals at Kambarasampettai on Sunday. Srirangam MLA M Palaniyandi distributed the bovines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/hrce-dept-donates-surplus-cows-calves-to-temple-priests/articleshow/84126739.cms||---

Zoo director Rajkumar Jadhav hopes that the gates will open to the public by next month. “We are yet to receive directives from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to open the zoo. Only when all restrictions are completely lifted, the zoo will be allowed to open. I am hopeful it will happen soon,” he said. Visitors will get to see three new enclosures once the zoo reopens. “We have three new species, including the jungle cat, leopard cat and Indian giant squirrel. They are still at the rescue center but we should have them shifted to their enclosures by the end of July or early August. Presently, we are working on some finishing touches to their enclosures. The jungle cat was bred in captivity, but the leopard cat was rescued and has recovered. These animals could not be released into their natural habitat due to various problems,” said Jadhav. “We request for a budget after taking into account the expenditure for developmental activities, maintenance work and so on, which is then granted by the PMC. Last year, everyone faced a shortage of funds, but this year (2021-2022) we have been granted the amount we requested with regard to our master plan. According to the plan, we were supposed to complete Phase I and II by the end of 2020, but currently we are lagging behind as we are still working on Phase I. We have completed the new enclosure for nilgai and lion, implemented conservation efforts and we are participating in scientific studies,” said Jadhav. Phase II of the master plan will focus on attracting avian life by turning the Katraj lake into a roosting ground for migratory and local birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/visitors-will-see-new-enclosures-and-three-fresh-arrivals-once-zoo-reopens/articleshow/84124602.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The prison officials are, however, yet to respond to the request made, officials from Tihar Jail said. The officials said that the two-time Olympic medallist, Kumar, who is currently lodged in Tihar Jail, has made this request through his lawyers. “He has made this request on the grounds that he will stay updated on wrestling matches,” an official from the prison said.

---||Mumbai||New institutes tap Mumbai University for piece of Kalina land||MUMBAI: The Mumbai University is receiving a spate of requests for land on its 243-acre Kalina campus for various new institutes. It has got proposals for the establishment of the Master Deenanath Mangeshkar international music school, which would need 5 acres, and for a new skill university on 15 acres. Also, there is a request for 5 acres to set up the Dadasaheb Phalke school for performing arts; if not possible, it could come up in Goregaon. Sources said a few more proposals have been submitted to the university for plots for institutes or amenities, like an Urdu Bhavan and a 500-bed state government hostel that will not be restricted to students. Besides educational needs, Mumbai University has had to give up its land for civic necessities too. The Kalina campus recently gave over 8 acres to MMRDA for road widening. After the Covid pandemic, land allotted to the university for its Sindhudurg sub-campus was given away to set up a hospital. Spread over 243 acres, the idea was to develop the MU Kalina premises into a mini campus town where students could move across schools to pick credits before graduating, said a senior official from the higher and technical education department. “With the New Education Policy, we want to widen the offerings on campus. All these schools will be public institutes and will be affordable to all students across economic stratas,” he added. Members of the management council, the final decision-making body of the university, said there have been “phone calls” from Mantralaya to the vice chancellor to part with a few acres on its Kalina campus. “All the proposals requesting land will be forwarded to the chancellor’s office. But, as management committee members, we are not going to allow any more land to be given away (for private institutes or non-educational facilities). The university is expanding, the number of affiliated colleges has gone up and these numbers are only going to rise,” said a management committee member. A proposal for the music school was floated by the Mangeshkar family, following which a government resolution was passed. Now, a committee has been appointed with Hrudaynath Mangeshkar as its head. The idea to house the new skill university has been only informally discussed so far. While no official request has been forwarded by the state government, the inner core group of senior officials has been speaking about the “pressure from the top for the land”. “I believe that the skill university should be set up in the thick of industrial activity, not in an isolated patch in Kalina,” said a senior educationist. Land issues are a constant sore for the university. It is yet to receive compensation from MMRDA for the 8 acres given away. Earlier, the Bombay high court, wanting to expand, had asked for the university’s Fort campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-institutes-tap-mu-for-piece-of-kalina-land/articleshow/84158644.cms||Hemali Chhapia

We will be happy if Sikhs and Hindu community members coming to India from any part of the world can stay with us. We will ensure everything for them, including starting of their livelihood,” said All Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (ASGMC) Kashmir spokesperson Pervender Singh Chopra, while talking to TOI on Sunday. Chopra was the part of a delegation of Sikhs from the valley who met Union home minister Amit Shah and apprised him of the demands of Kashmiri Sikhs. ASGMC Kashmir chairman Baldev Singh Raina and members of various gurdwara committees from Budgam, Pulwama, Srinagar, Anantnag and Baramulla were part of the delegation. Expressing concern over the declining growth rate of Sikhs the UT, the spokesperson said they had urged Shah to declare Kashmiri Sikhs a minority community. “Only 1.5 lakh left with 60,000 registered voters from Sikh community, which is spread across six districts and 135 villages. And we are managing 135 gurdwaras, some of which are historical,” he said. The delimitation was in progress in J&K so they had urged the Union minister to reserve two seats for Sikhs, he added. They also urged Shah to arrange a meeting of the community representatives with delimitation commission head Ranjana Prakash Desai, who was to visit the UT on July 6 and 9, so they could bring their issues to his notice. He said they had also sought to declare old gurdwaras as national heritage and starting international flights from Awantipora, especially for the ‘darshan’ at Mattan Sahib gurdwara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jk-sikhs-meet-shah-suggest-kashmir-space-in-caa-equation/articleshow/84126844.cms||Yudhvir Rana

After the tenure of Dr Bharat Shah came to an end on Saturday, the state government has decided to hand over the charge to the VC of Anand Agriculture University (AAU). An order issued by the agriculture, farmers welfare and co-operation department of the state government stated that AAU VC will handle the additional charge of GOAU till further orders. It is worth mentioning here that Shah was the first VC of the organic agricultural university but the process of appointing his successor through formation of a search panel which in turns recommends shortlisted candidates for the post has been delayed. Traditionally, in all universities, the process for formation of the search panel begins six months before the tenure of a VC comes to an end. In the case of GOAU, the university that currently operates from Gandhinagar with scarce manpower does not have a campus of its own. Sources said that although the state government has decided that the university will function from Halol in Panchmahals district much of the formal process regarding it is pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/goau-still-waits-for-new-vc/articleshow/84124705.cms||---

For at least four decades, the late doctor had resided in the town and helped women in the remote hamlets deliver babies. Elderly residents said though Phyllis Rodrigues was her actual name, she was often addressed as vellaikaramma doctor (white woman) or sattaikaramma (woman wearing a shirt) by her patients. Pannai Sokkalingam, whose family rented out their house on Town station road in Mayiladuthurai to Phyllis, said the gynaecologist was born in Australia in 1923. After graduating from Madras Medical College in 1949, she moved to Mayiladuthurai town and started practising. “Phyllis’s husband was employed in southern railway. After retiring from service, they moved back to Australia. Her family members informed us about her demise,” Pannai Sokkalingam said. Some of those born under the supervision of Phyllis and aged around 40 now took to social media to pay tributes to her. “She did not collect money from patients,” S Somasundaram, an accountant, 65, in Dharmapuram adheenam (mutt) office, said.

After brief persuasion, she signalled them towards the other platform and held the hand of one of the women police constables, following which the team accompanied her. A woman along with a baby boy was found lying unconscious at the railway station platform number 5. The RPF team said that the government railway police was immediately informed of the incident, following which an ambulance was called and the woman was rushed to the district hospital. Emergency medical officer, district hospital, Dr Shobhit (who goes by his first name only) said, “The GRP brought a patient along with two children from the railway station. The woman, who seems to be in her 30s, has been put under observation. The identity of the woman and her kids could not be ascertained as she is currently in a semi-unconscious state. Further action will be taken up as soon as the woman gains consciousness.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/girl-2-finds-mom-unconscious-on-platform-approaches-cops-for-help/articleshow/84129442.cms||Maria Khan

After the fencing started in 1992, the lands of some farmers went into the international zero line and fencing. Now, BSF will give relaxation to the farmers on their Khatedari land. A new gate has been opened at the border fencing and farmers will be able to go into their fields for farming after showing ID card issued by BSF. Strict watch will be kept on farmers going inside for farming from security point of view. Farmers will be allowed into the fields only during day time. On the lines of Punjab, the gate at Chauhatan’s Jat ka Bera and Sarla area will be opened. In 1992, fencing was done at the western border. Under the international agreement with Pakistan, fencing was done 150 metres inside the international border, but farmers got just 4 metres of land that came under the fencing. For the last two decades, the remaining land was in Khatedari of farmers but they could not use it for farming. A few days back, BSF DIG Vineet Kumar held a meeting with farmers in Sarla area and asked to apply for farming across the fencing. He told farmers that pass will be made on getting application for farming and watering across the fencing. BSF will issue passes to the farmers whose lands have come between the fencing and zero point for which the farmers will have to give their photo ID and land settlement papers and will have to apply at BSF outposts concerned. After necessary investigation, BSF will issue the pass, the DIG added. The DIG said that BSF will give entry to farmers at 9am with pass and conduct strict checking at 5pm after which they can go back. They will be allowed to do farming for eight hours across the fencing. BSF has prepared a room at every post where women farmers will be checked by women jawans. Reportedly, around 11,468 bighas of land is caught between border fencing and zero line for the last two decades. The farmers neither got compensation nor could farm on the land. However, in the government records, the land is in Khatedari of farmers. The farmers had moved high court to get the right on their land. In 2013, the high court gave a decision in favour of the farmers directing to give them land or compensation but till now they haven't got their right. On September 27, 2020 home ministry border management additional secretary H K Dhasmana through a letter told farmers that their land coming between fencing and zero line has not been acquired by the government of India. The right of the land is with farmers and it is their khatedari land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/farmers-in-border-areas-to-be-allowed-to-till-on-land-taken-for-fencing/articleshow/84126822.cms||---
---||Trichy||Lull in Sunday vaccine drive blamed on misconceptions: Trichy||TRICHY: Like other cities, Trichy has also been witnessing a heavy demand for vaccines, but surprisingly, Sundays have been an exception and seeing much lesser crowds. Officials say this is because a section of people harbour misconceptions, like vaccinating on a day they consume meat may cause health complications. For instance, on Friday and Saturday, Trichy city saw more than 5,000 people getting the jab daily, including first and second doses in all age categories. However, on Sunday, the vaccination camp organised at a school at Karumandapam here saw extremely poor patronage. While on other days, people make a beeline to get the token as early as 6 am, Sunday’s drive left 14 vials of the vaccine unused with only 741 taking the shot. Although the venue of the only vaccination camp in the city was disclosed on Saturday, many did not turn up. The civic body made many announcements to invite people. June 20 was another Sunday when there were no takers for as many as 33 vials. Doctors said people believe they should not take the jab if they are having non-vegetarian food on vaccination day. Since Sunday is synonymous with meat consumption, this belief is strongly suspected to have played spoilsport. “People can avoid allergic food before vaccination, but there is no relation between non-veg diet and vaccination,” Dr A Mohamed Hakkim, coordinator of urban vaccination camp, said. Doctors said many told them they are afraid of developing sudden heart ailments if they consume meat before or after vaccination. Similarly, many who consume liquor on weekend nights were hesitant to take the Covid vaccine “We are planning to sensitise people about the facts on vaccination to clear the misconceptions,” the official added. While the tokens are distributed usually before 12 pm, Trichy corporation on Sunday took much time to complete the distribution. Another reason suspected for the low turnout was a fear that the lone vaccination centre in the city may witness crowding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/lull-in-sunday-vaccine-drive-blamed-on-misconceptions/articleshow/84126837.cms||Deepak Karthik

He also handed over appointment orders to 14 people in the urban local body on compassionate grounds. The postings included a junior assistant, office assistant and sanitary workers in the civic body. The corporation sources said that the discussion focused on new infrastructure proposals in the city. Sources said that a PowerPoint presentation on redeveloping the Kollankulam tank in E Pudur as a leisure site was shown to Nehru. The proposal suggested storing of the surplus rainwater in the 47 acres tank and developing the bunds as a leisure site. The minister was also updated about the plan to convert abandoned stone quarries in Karumandapam and Periyamilagupaarai as common storage tanks to store rainwater. The corporation said that the proposals were in the cost estimation preparation stage. When asked whether the location for the integrated bus terminus proposed at Panjappur was decided, officials said that an announcement may come soon as the expert team is studying the plausible locations and plans best suited for the available space. Other Smart cities mission projects including the commercial complexes in Thillai Nagar, Puthur and West Boulevard road were reviewed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/progress-of-trichy-corpn-projects-reviewed/articleshow/84126873.cms||---

She met her partner in this venture, 48-year-old ex-serviceman Dinkar Patil, just a day before they began their ride on June 19. The two are travelling around 200 kilometres a day. When Patil was asked if he faced any problems in Delhi, apart from the heat, he said, “No one follows traffic rules here and people come from any side. While cycling, it gets tough when you don’t know which side a commuter could come from.” Velankar, a mother of two girls who are state champions in athletics, resides in Bengaluru. She has done a PhD in life sciences. She returned to India after living in South Africa and the USA only for the love for her country. She has been cycling for a decade and likes doing unique events. Speaking to TOI while cycling to Faridabad, Velankar said, “We reached Delhi on Saturday and were exhausted. We parked our cycle at a dhaba and went to a hotel to relax. We wanted to do a budget trip and are grateful to all those who have been helping us and arranging accommodation. We have a WhatsApp group and our ride can be tracked live. This helps people give us water and snacks on the way.” A part of the cycling circuit, Velankar asked Patil if he wanted to be her riding partner and he readily agreed. Their Golden Quadrilateral journey runs through 12 states and a Union Territory, including the cities of Bengaluru, Pune, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, New Delhi, Allahabad, Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar, Vizag and Chennai. “Dinkar is a strong person and in great physical shape. I thought it would be great to partner with him. We have covered around 2,300km from Bengaluru to Delhi. We have been facing issues of traffic, heat, tyre punctures and tube blast, which has happened 10-15 times so far,” said Velankar. Both the cyclists went to Kapashera police station on Sunday to endorse their documents so that they could show proof of their visit to Delhi. “The police officers treated us well. Usually, they alert their counterparts elsewhere too so that we don’t face a tough time. It’s amazing how people have been trying to help us. The highway to Delhi is quite busy. Trucks brushed past us at least three times. India doesn’t have roads that are made for cycling, which makes it tough. But we hope for things to change,” said Patil. “Women must follow their passion and not think that they cannot pursue it after marriage and children,” said Velankar. Patil added that the key to survival was staying fit and healthy, the message he was trying to spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cyclist-on-6000km-ride-gives-her-take-no-one-follows-traffic-rules-in-delhi/articleshow/84126885.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP-led municipal corporations are exploiting traders by hiking taxes, AAP standing by them, says Durgesh Pathak||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party’s Durgesh Pathak claimed on Sunday that Bharatiya Janata Party-led municipal corporations had exploited traders by increasing the taxes during the pandemic and AAP had been highlighting this issue by running a signature campaign in all major markets of Delhi from July 1. Pathak alleged that all three corporations were bringing new schemes to harass traders and even during Covid-19, taxes had been increased. Pathak said the signature campaign had been started in all 272 wards in the city. The campaign started at Town Hall Bazaar, Chandni Chowk in the north corporation area and was led by its leader of opposition, Vikas Goel. In east Delhi, the campaign started at Gandhinagar Market and was led by leader of opposition Manoj Tyagi, and in the south corporation areas, leader of opposition Prem Chauhan launched it from the Lajpat Nagar market. He said AAP was advising BJP to take back the increased taxes or a movement from streets to Parliament would follow. He claimed the campaign had got widespread support from traders across Delhi. He said all party MLAs and councillors were participating in it. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that though AAP might be trying to politically provoke traders, the latter knew that the increase in trade licence fees had come after over 10 years and the corporations were already reviewing it. Referring to the recent inclusion of traders as entrepreneurs under MSME, Kapoor said, “We at BJP don’t do lip service for traders but do groundwork to benefit the trade.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-are-exploiting-traders-by-hiking-taxes-aap-standing-by-them-says-pathak/articleshow/84126941.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Khadi commission plants 5,000 bamboo saplings to help tribal economy in Udaipur||JAIPUR: In a bid to reduce desertification, provide livelihood opportunities in tribal areas and support rural industry, Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) planted 5,000 bamboo saplings in tribal village Nichla Mandwa in Udaipur on Sunday. Kicking off the project ‘Bamboo Oasis on Lands in Drought’ (BOLD) in the presence of local MP Arjun Lal Meena and over 2,000 villagers, Vinai Kumar Saxena, chairman of KVIC said they will replicate the initiative in Gujarat and Leh-Ladakh August this year, planting 5,000 saplings at each location before August 21. Saxena said the green patches will help in reducing land degradation, while on the other hand they will be havens of sustainable development and food security. “Bamboo plantation drive on such a large scale will create additional income for the local tribal population while supporting the local bamboo-based industries and boosting the rural economy. In three years, these bamboo patches will be able to meet the requirement of agarbatti manufacturers in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.” Additionally, Saxena said, the bamboo patches will contribute to the larger UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) of reducing land degradation and preventing desertification in the country. “KVIC created a world record of planting the highest number of bamboo saplings on a single day at one location on Sunday,” added Saxena. Bamboos grow fast and in about three years’ time, they could be harvested, generating income for the tribal populace. “The 5,000 bamboo plants will produce at least 20,000 bamboo logs weighing about 500 tonnes. At the current market rate of Rs 5,000 per tonne, the produce will generate an income of nearly Rs 25 lakh after three years and later on every year, which will support the local economy,” added Saxena. Meena said the bamboo plantation programme in Udaipur will boost self-employment among a large number of women and unemployed youths in the region. We will also connect them to skill development programmes where bamboos are used for various products. Bamboo can be used for making agarbatti sticks, furniture, handicraft, musical instruments and paper pulp while the waste can be used in making charcoal and fuel briquette. Bamboos are also known for conserving water and reducing evaporation of water from the land surface, which is an important feature in arid and drought-prone regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/khadi-commission-plants-5000-bamboo-saplings-to-help-tribal-economy-in-udaipur/articleshow/84126877.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Delta strain eight times less sensitive to vaccine antibodies||NEW DELHI: The Delta variant of coronavirus is eight times less sensitive to antibodies generated by vaccines compared with the original strain that came from China’s Wuhan, revealed a new study. The study, which was conducted on over 100 healthcare workers (HCWs) at three centres in India, including Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH), found that the B.1.617.2 Delta variant not only dominated vaccine-breakthrough infections with higher respiratory viral loads compared with non-Delta infections (Ct value of 16.5 versus 19), but also generated greater transmission among the fully vaccinated HCWs. The collaborative study, SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 Delta Variant Emergence and Vaccine Breakthrough: Collaborative Study, from India with scientists from Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease is yet to be peer-reviewed. It revealed that in vitro, the Delta variant was approximately eightfold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies compared with Wuhan-1. “Across all scenarios considered, our results suggest that the Delta variant is both more transmissible and better able to evade prior immunity elicited by previous infection compared with previously circulating lineages,” the findings of the study read. Dr Chand Wattal, chairperson, Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, SGRH, said, “From this study, it appears that we have miles to go before we sleep in case of the pandemic. These mutations are bound to happen if we lower our guard and allow ourselves to fall prey to this virus, giving it an opportunity to multiply.” “This is an eye-opener to the fully vaccinated people that you cannot lower your guard in the name of vaccination. This mutant has come back with enhanced spike proteins for attachment to the lung epithelial cells that have provided it with a much higher capacity to infect many more than the Wuhan strain,” he added. These combined epidemiological and in vitro data indicate that the dominance of the Delta variant in India had been most likely driven by a combination of evasion of neutralising antibodies in previously infected individuals and increased virus infectivity resulting in the second wave, the study said. Severe disease in fully vaccinated HCWs was rare. However, breakthrough transmission clusters in hospitals associated with the Delta variant are concerning and indicate that infection control measures need to continue in the post-vaccination era, it said. Based on recent data and dominance of new infections by this variant, the B.1.167.2 Delta variant appears more transmissible than B.1.1.7 in the UK, it added. “In the absence of published data on the transmissibility of the Delta variant, we predict that this variant will have a transmission advantage relative to Wuhan-1 with D614G in individuals with pre-existing immunity from vaccine/natural infection and in settings where there is low vaccine coverage and prior exposure,” the study stated. Lower protection against B.1.351, the variant with the least sensitivity to neutralising antibodies, had been demonstrated for at least three vaccines. However, progression to severe disease and death was low in all studies, it said. Therefore, at population scale, extensive vaccination will protect against moderate to severe disease and reduce hospitalisation due to the Delta variant, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delta-strain-eight-times-less-sensitive-to-vax-antibodies/articleshow/84156904.cms||---

In 2015, ACB had caught inspector Shankar Pujari allegedly while accepting a bribe of Rs 5,000 from a club. The club owner lodged a complaint with ACB, alleging that Pujari who was attached to Mulund police station demanded a monthly bribe to allow the club to restart. The ACB got Pujari arrested. He was placed under suspension and an inquiry initiated.  A search of his Thane house had yielded Rs 19 lakh, officials said. “During the inquiries it transpired that between 2000 and 2015 he had amassed assets worth Rs 16.90 lakh which was more than 28.57% of his known source of income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cop-held-for-graft-booked-for-possessing-excess-assets/articleshow/84126919.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Nagpur||Nagpur’s population fifth largest in state, gets second lowest vaccine doses||NAGPUR: Like in the case of Covishield, Nagpur district has received one-fourth the doses of Covaxin as compared to Pune district. In the latest allocation, Nagpur, with the fifth largest population among 35 districts in the state, got lesser vaccine than all other districts, except Palghar, which got the fewest doses. Looking at the past performance and stock availability in district-wise allocation, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to start Covaxin jabs for 18-44 age group from Monday. TOI had reported on July 3 that the district was allocated 45,100 doses of Covishield as against demand for 3.5 lakh. The district’s allocation was 1,09,700 doses since resumption of vaccination of 18-44 age group on June 23. At the same time, Pune district’s allocation was 3,73,280 doses, 3.4 times more than Nagpur district. On Saturday, Nagpur received 4,400 doses of Covaxin, the least after Palghar district (2,200), while Pune district got 30,600 doses. After Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik, Nagpur district has the highest population in the state as per the state public health department (PHD). Since June 23, the district has received total 14,700 doses of Covaxin while Pune district has got 58,250 doses. As per PHD’s data, estimated population of Nagpur district is 52.72 lakh and Pune district’s count is double at 1.17 crore. But when it comes to Covaxin, Pune district has got four times more doses as compared to Nagpur district. BJP MLA from East Nagpur Krishna Khopde alleged discrimination in allocation of vaccine by the state government. “Nagpurians are getting vaccine for one or two days in a week. But I havent’t heard about any vaccination break in Mumbai and Pune for lack of doses,” he said. Director of state health services Dr Archana Patil had told TOI that allocation of Covishield to districts was as per performance of last three days. About Covaxin, Dr Patil said that the allocation is based on how many beneficiaries are due for second dose. On whether Covaxin is allowed for 18-44 age group, Dr Patil said that instructions have been given to allow it if second dose of earlier vaccinated people is completed. NMC has facilitated Covaxin at only three of total 142 centres for last two months or more. It was available only for second dose of 45-plus category for over a month. First dose of 45-plus resumed a few days ago. The civic body had around 18,500 doses of Covaxin available on Sunday. But it kept three centres shut as there were no doses of Covishield for remaining 138 centres. Strangely, NMC did not resume first dose of Covaxin for 18-44 age group even though there is not much waiting for second dose. As per NMC data, 39,387 had taken first dose and of them 34,367 have taken the second dose. The difference of 5,020 beneficiaries might be due to the first jab being taken in last 28 days or some might have been infected, thus delaying the second dose. NMC officials told TOI that government has instructed to use Covaxin for only second dose. “Therefore, we were not giving first dose to 18-44 age group. In latest allocation we received very few doses when compared to other districts. Therefore, we took the decision to start Covaxin to all. We also increased the number of centres,” they said. Majority of doctors had suggested people, especially comorbid, should take Covaxin due to its higher efficacy and very less minor adverse event following immunization (AEFI). But many people did not get Covaxin due to lack of doses. There was no vaccination on Sunday in the city due to lack of Covishield doses. At 11 private hospitals, 3,978 people took the jab. In rural areas, 4,585 people were administered doses at 45 centres. There will be no vaccination in 138 centres of Covishield in the city on Monday too, for the second consecutive day, and for the sixth time in the last seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpurs-population-fifth-largest-in-state-gets-second-lowest-vaccine-doses/articleshow/84126159.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Bengaluru||For first time, more women teachers in schools than men||BENGALURU: For the first time ever, women school teachers in India outnumber their male counterparts, according to the Unified District Information on School Education report for 2019-20. Of the 96.8 lakh teachers in the country, 49.2 lakh are women. In 2012-13, there were 35.8 lakh women teachers across India against 42.4 lakh men — marking a rise of 37% over seven years. In the same period, the number of male teachers rose from 42.4 lakh to 47.7 lakh. There is a catch, though: women teachers top the head count only at the primary level. The report points out that upper primary onwards, the number of male teachers remains higher. At the pre-primary level, there are over 1 lakh women teachers to 27,000 men. In Karnataka, 57% or 2,57,790 of the 4,50,592 teachers are women. More male teachers in govt, aided schools: ReportThe ratio is more balanced in primary grades, with 19.6 lakh women and 15.7 lakh male teachers. In upper primary classes, there are 11.5 lakh male and 10.6 lakh women teachers. From then on, the gap increases. In secondary schools, there are 6.3 lakh men and 5.2 lakh women teachers. In higher secondary, it’s 3.7 lakh men and 2.8 lakh women. In government and aided schools, the number of male teachers is higher, while in private unaided schools, women teachers are ahead. The trend of male teachers outnumbering women in higher grades is seen across states, with the exception of Kerala, Delhi, Meghalaya, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, among big states. In these, number of women teaching is higher than men even in secondary and higher secondary classes. “Any dynamic and vital profession, and I consider teaching as one, must have equitable distribution of men and women. Children need to learn from teachers who can offer a male as well as female perspective. In younger classes, many schools in India prefer women teachers, since they are seen to be more nurturing. However, I think it’s good for male teachers to demonstrate nurture too! Otherwise, we’re demonstrating a sexist bias in favour of women teachers,” said Maya Menon, founder director of Teacher Foundation. “In higher classes, traditionally both male and female teachers are sought after. There are also differential salaries in India between primary and secondary school teachers,” Menon said. This is not the case in other countries: all teachers regardless of e levels they teach require similar qualifications and, start with similar pay. “Male teachers in India prefer to teach in secondary school because they get paid more, especially with government scales...,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/for-1st-time-morewomen-teachers-inschools-than-men/articleshow/84129488.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Private engineering colleges seek fee hike for CET seats||BENGALURU: The Karnataka Unaided Private Engineering Colleges’ Association (KUPECA) has sent in a proposal to the government, seeking an increase in fees for students joining private colleges under government quota for the upcoming academic year. KUPECA chief Panduranga Shetty said they had formed a technical panel to make the calculations on revision in fees, adding: “We’ve sought a 30% hike.” The government is yet to take a decision on the plea. “We have not increased the fees for three years though the government has allowed medical and dental colleges to hike their fees.” ‘Can’t run colleges without fee hike’The government has to understand our concerns. We will not be able to run colleges without a fee hike as all our expenditures are increasing,” Shetty said. The technical committee has said it has not sought specific percentage, but has told the government where their expenditure is increasing. According to the proposal made to the chief minister and the deputy chief minister, the association has sought to fix the other fees at a maximum of Rs 20,000 under various heads. “Whichever college is providing infrastructural facilities for skill labs/industry hub/industry connect may be permitted to collect skill lab fees to a maximum of Rs 20,000. Optional fees for training and placement, hostel and transportation as actuals incurred. Tuition fees should be increased every year minimum 15%-25%. The National Fee Fixation Committee, AICTE, government of India, in their process handbook, has suggested the fee structure for the engineering courses Rs 1,44,900 to Rs 1,58,300,” the proposal added. ‘Need 25% more teachers’“The engineering colleges collected Rs 65,340 as fees for CET seats as specified in the consensual agreement for 2020-21. Fees fixed in the consensual agreement during 2012-13 was at Rs 38,500 for both engineering and medical colleges. However, while engineering colleges collect Rs 65,340, medical colleges are collecting Rs 1,28,746. According to the new teacher-pupil ratio, we need at least 25% more teachers. The starting scale of teachers in 6th Pay Commission was Rs 32,000, the Seventh Pay Commission wages start at Rs 55,000,” said Manjunath Bhandary, member of the technical committee and chairman of Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pvt-engg-colleges-seek-fee-hike-for-cet-seats/articleshow/84129492.cms||---

The flotsam they picked up weighed more than 50kg which was an assortment of empty bottles of alcohol, plastic, dead fish found floating in the water and strewn around the lake. The lake, better known as Bandra talao, is an oasis amidst a concrete maze. A heritage structure, it is wedged between SV Road and the Bandra railway station road. The BMC did undertake some beautification work a few years ago but things were back to square one, said Gauri Kulkarni (26) who was involved in the clean-up drives for the past three weeks. “There’s no proper lighting or railing around the periphery of the water body. Drug addicts lurk around the place, making it unsafe ,” said Kulkarni who lives a stone’s throw from the lake. She said they plan to spruce up the place until the BMC appoints its cleaning staff for the upkeep of the lake. Mushtaq Ansari, another volunteer who was also joined in the clean-up, said they have created a WhatsApp group called #ChakachakBandraTalav. “Years ago, the lake was a popular tourist spot,” he recalled. “But now, its condition has deteriorated with garbage thrown all around.” Between 2016 and 2019, the civic body had carried out several beautification works along the talao. BMC had also taken up revamp of the lake in phases. Locals claimed that whenever they have tried to deter people from illegal activity around the talao, they have been threatened. Like, Dr Shantaram Kerkar, a Bandraiite. “I see fishing going on here although it is not permitted. Also, pigeons are being fed around the lake,” said Dr Kerkar. “When I have confronted people, I have faced threats.” Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria said that following several complaints from residents, the issue was discussed at the civic ward committee meeting last week.  “BMC is struggling to maintain Bandra talao. This has resulted in lack of aeration to the water due to which algae formation is happening, causing the water to turn green,” said Zakaria. “The way forward could be to transform the talao as a water sports hub for sailing, kayaking, boating and to transform it into a tourist spot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bandra-lake-or-bin-50kg-trash-cleared-in-clean-up/articleshow/84126958.cms||Richa Pinto

The KYC forms of 1.88 lakh beneficiaries in a printed form is yet to be sent to the dealers, as per a food department data. The department had earlier announced that all benefits under the public distribution system (PDS) will be made available to the people through Jan-Aadhaar card in the state. Under a pilot project in the first phase, the data verification of 10 lakh NFSA ration card-holder families seeded through Jan-Aadhaar card had started on July 1. Following the enrollment and Jan-Aadhaar card seeding of ration card holder families, they will also start getting benefits under Chief Minister Chiranjeevi Health Insurance Scheme. “About 98% seeding of NFSA ration card-holder families has been done through Jan-Aadhaar. Of these, mapping of about 82% members has been completed. The mapping of the remaining 18% will be done via Jan Aadhaar database in a phased manner through KYC,” food and civil supplies secretary Naveen Jain had earlier said. “The ration card holders, who do not have seeding with Jan-Aadhaar card, their cards will be accepted through KYC. When they go to the ration shops, then ‘KYC Required’ will flash on the POS machine indicating that the form is required to be filled by the family concerned,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jan-aadhaar-data-verification-of-5-5l-families-completed/articleshow/84126937.cms||---

---||Amritsar||Farmers to head for Parliament daily during monsoon session||BATHINDA: Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) has decided to send batches of farmers daily towards Parliament during the upcoming monsoon session. The session will start on July 19 and end on August 13. Batches of over 300 farmers each will start moving towards Parliament in buses from July 22 as session will be lifted for the day on July 19 and July 20-21 will be vacation days. The batches will continue heading towards Parliament till the last day of session. During this action, if farmers are arrested, they will prefer to go to jails. All farm organisations participating in the protest have given their consent to the action plan in the meeting of SKM held at Singhu border on Sunday. It was decided that every farm organisation will send five members daily till the session lasts. With the action plan given by farmers, the chances of monsoon session turning stormy, outside the august house than inside, could not be ruled out. Before this, warning letters will be sent to MPs from opposition parties on July 17, asking them to “chuppi todo ya kursi chhodo” (speak up or quit). MPs from opposition parties will be asked not to let Parliament function till government does not agree to repeal farm laws. It is learnt farmers are planning to submit an action plan on Independence Day on August 15. Farmers had initially planned a march towards Parliament on foot on February 1, but after the violent happenings during farmer tractor parade on January 26, it was postponed indefinitely. The matter was raised again, but some differences had cropped up between farmer groups over the action plan and it was put on the backburner. Only two days ago, farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni had sought views of farmers about the action plan and it was adopted by the SKM in its meeting on Sunday. Farm leaders Buta Singh Burjgill and Balbir Singh Rajewal said, “We have decided to start sending jathas of farmers in buses towards Parliament from July 22, which practically will be first day of monsoon session. Farmers will hold a protest outside Parliament or till where they are allowed to go. Before this, we will approach MPs from opposition parties urging them to raise a voice against farm laws or they too may have to face the ire of farmers. MPs will be urged to not allow Parliament to function.” Farm leader Jagmohan Singh said it had been decided that if farmers are not allowed to go towards Parliament and are arrested, farmers will not try to get bails. Charuni said farmers will comply with the action plan. Farmers have also given a call to hold protests against fuel price hike for two hours on July 8 by sitting or standing on roadsides without disrupting traffic on highways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/farmers-to-head-for-parliament-daily-during-monsoon-session/articleshow/84127001.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana CP: Will take up complaints that require long probe only if complainants jabbed||LUDHIANA: The Ludhiana Police will consider complaints that require long investigation only if the complainants have received vaccination against Covid-19. Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal says he has taken the decision so that more people get themselves vaccinated and the third Covid wave could be prevented. However, the move has not gone down well with some residents, who call it illegal. On Saturday, the city police had organized a ‘know your case scheme’ camp at different police stations, including those at Divisions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, Model Town, and traffic unit. There, the cops did not take up the complaints of those who were not jabbed. They were asked to first get vaccinated and then come to know the status of their cases. Agarwal says, “Even as the Covid cases are on the decline, we all should try to prevent the third wave that is likely in October. It is important for everyone to get inoculated. Therefore, the Ludhiana Police has decided not to act on the complaints of those who have not been vaccinated.” “However, this is only for the cases involving long investigation, like monetary and matrimonial disputes. Action in cases like murder, rape, accident, theft, snatching, among others, will be taken immediately. People with genuine reasons for not getting jabbed will be excluded from this,” Agarwal adds. Senior advocate Parupkar Singh Ghuman says, “Police system is a justice delivering system. Cops are bound by their duties. They cannot refuse to entertain a complaint for any reason, be it vaccination or anything else. This order of the commissioner of police is similar to those that were issued during the British rule.” In a press note, Ludhiana Police states that in the next ‘know your case scheme’ camp, which will be organized on July 10, only those complainants will be entertained who are vaccinated. Agarwal said, “In case vaccine is not available, the police will not enforce it on those days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/top-cop-will-take-up-plaints-that-require-long-probe-only-if-complainants-jabbed/articleshow/84122788.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Meerut||Hundreds of building maps approved using fake IDs of architects in Meerut, probe on||MEERUT: A new policy in Uttar Pradesh that allowed registered architects to approve building maps was allegedly misused by workers of the Meerut Development Authority (MDA) who submitted fake IDs of architects to illegally sanction hundreds of maps and pocket crores of rupees as “fees” from house owners. The MDA has ordered a probe into the matter after a delegation of local architects met the MDA secretary, Praveena (who uses her first name), on Saturday and sought an investigation. Prior to March 2020, local development authorities in UP used to approve all maps. Then the UP government brought out a policy allowing architects to approve and upload building maps on Uttar Pradesh Online Building Plan Approval System Portal (UPOBPAS). There were two conditions to this — the construction area should be 300 sq m or less and located in an authorised colony. All architects would earn a certain amount of fee from the client for passing each map ranging between Rs 25,000 and Rs 2 lakh. According to the Meerut chapter of UP Architects’ Association, hundreds of maps in the city were “approved” by MDA workers on fake IDs of architects or the same ID was used to pass several maps. “In one instance, we found that at least 144 building maps were approved using just one ID. Our estimate is that at least 800 maps were passed illegally in this manner,” said Ankit Agarwal, president of the Meerut Architects’ Association. When the association contacted the architect, whose ID had been used to approve 144 maps, he told them that he had not sanctioned any building map in the area last year and was not aware of his data being misused, Agarwal told TOI. Agarwal said the association got wind of the scam when some internal sources in the MDA mentioned names of architects in Meerut that the architect community had not heard of. Chirag Gupta, secretary of the association, told TOI that upon inquiry they found that between April and July 2, the architects’ association had approved 20 building maps and yet 56 maps had been approved on the government portal in the same period. “This means that at least 36 maps were illegally approved,” said Gupta. Gupta said the maps passed illegally could possibly be in unauthorised colonies. In other cases, people who were not aware that an architect can approve the map landed in the MDA office where they were lured in by unauthorised people to get the map sanctioned. The association added that the scam likely spilled over to buildings that were to be built in construction areas larger than 300 sq m. In cases where the construction area was larger, the architects were to upload details and then the MDA would grant approval. “It’s likely that fake IDs of architects were used to upload details so a building map that flouted norms could be approved,” said an association member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hundreds-of-building-maps-approved-using-fake-ids-of-architects-in-meerut-probe-on/articleshow/84122812.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Mumbai||How a Brahmin priest found pride of place in Mumbai’s cathedral||MUMBAI: Behind a cluster of tall trees and amid the impregnable thickets of buildings, smog and traffic in Bombay’s Fort area, the three-century-old St Thomas Cathedral has seen it all. But past its famous arches and inside its walls lined with sculptures, stained glass and liturgical art stands an intriguing piece of history that remains in good part unknown. Inside the city’s oldest Anglican church, on its west wall, lies an imposing marble memorial that is decidedly out-of-place at first glance. A monumental figure of a freestanding Hindu Brahmin priest in dhoti and shawl with a downturned visage and his hands joined in prayer under a banyan tree, bending gracefully over an urn. A closer examination of the frieze reveals a rare study in history, worship and art that steers the spotlight away from the realms of religion to one of social and cultural legacy. To understand how this one-of-its-kind monument of a Brahmin priest found pride of place in a church, one would need to delve into the life of Jonathan Duncan, Bombay’s longest-serving governor from 1795 to 1811, who lies buried at the Cathedral and to whom the memorial is dedicated. At the heart of the pyramid shaped memorial — erected in 1817 by British inhabitants of Bombay and sculpted by John Bacon Jr. — is a biographical sketch of the Scotsman who arrived in India as a writer for the East India Company at 16 and went on to distinguish himself as an administrator, a patron of ancient Indian learning who established India’s first Sanskrit college in Benaras and as a social reformer who stamped out female infanticide in Benaras and Kathiawar. According to James Mackintosh, the Recorder of Bombay, Duncan had been “Brahmanised” by his long uninterrupted residence in India for 39 years. The uppermost tier of the memorial features the young Brahmin and a female figure holding the scales of justice inscribing the words ‘He was a Good Man and A Just…’ on the urn. Near her feet are two books, an open scroll and a mirror with a serpent coiled around its handle. “The books and open scroll represent his erudition and patronage of learning. The woman, personifying justice, highlights Duncan's standing as a just and noble administrator,” noted historian Anila Verghese in a journal on South Asia Studies. The mid-section designed like an altar holds a plaque eulogising Duncan and below this, two infants holding a scroll engraved with ‘Infanticide Abolished in Benares and Kattywar’. According to a 1958 thesis on ‘The Life and Career of Jonathan Duncan’ by historian VA Narain, Duncan was the first to notice and repress the prevalence of female infanticide among the Rajkumar clan. “After directing the attention of the Bengal government to the existence of infanticide in Benares in October 1789, he devised a plan by which it might be checked. He recognised the special position of the Brahmans and had an extract from the Vratim Vayanta Parana translated to prove that this practice was against the Hindu religion. Then he assembled the Rajkumar chiefs and reasoned with them to sign an agreement renouncing the practice on 17 June ,1789. As infanticide also prevailed among the Raghuvamsis in Jaunpur, Duncan took similar engagements from them,” wrote Narain. As for the western symbols in the memorial — weeping willow and urn or the face and physique of the Brahmin that conform to the Greco-Roman allegorical style — Vijaya Gupchup who authored ‘St. Thomas’ Cathedral Bombay - A Witness to History’ observes that it was a “fusion of the best from the East and West that characterised Duncan himself… In keeping with British ideas and ideals of the early 19th century.” Indeed, the memorial tablets at Mumbai’s oldest church have been a reminder of British India for centuries, agrees Rev Avinash Rangayya, presbyter-in-charge of St Thomas Cathedral. “There’s a lot of indigenization in much of Bacon’s sculptural works but Duncan’s memorial is perhaps the most intriguing. People see it from a reformer’s perspective,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-how-a-brahmin-priest-found-pride-of-place-in-st-thomas-cathedral/articleshow/84127049.cms||Mohua Das

For the past many years, people had been facing tough times due to waterlogging at Panj Peer Road and adjoining colonies, where at least 15,000 live. Officials had been trying to remove encroachments for long, as every time they made an effort it was met with resentment from the other side. On Sunday, Punjab food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, Congress leader Sunil Kapoor and senior officers visited the area. Ashu said due to encroachments by some dairy owners on the seasonal rain drain, water was not able to end up in Buddha Nullah. He said the encroachments have been removed with the efforts of the officials from Ludhiana municipal corporation and irrigation and drainage departments. Sandhu said about 15,000 residents of Mandeep Nagar, New Surya Vihar, Mehar Singh Colony, Chand Colony, Radhe Sham Colony, Corporation Colony, Mayur Vihar, Sukhdev Enclave, Amrit Colony and Haibowal Dairy Complex Block B, besides several others, would be benefitted. Cleaning of the sewerage line in Rishi Nagar is also going on, so that rainwater does not accumulate. Earlier, the civic body had opened a drain near Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib that was closed by the railway authorities. It will also bring relief to the people living in Millar Ganj, Dholewal, Gill Road and adjoining areas.  Park at dairy complex On the demand of dairy farmers, the cabinet minister agreed to give funds for a park at Dairy Complex, Hambran Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/encroachments-removed-panj-peer-road-drain-opened/articleshow/84122835.cms||---

The robbery came to light around 7.30am on Sunday, when a priest (pathi) reached the house as per daily routine and found everyone unconscious. He called a relative of the family who lives in the same locality. The relative, Swarnjeet Singh, took the family and their other helps to a private hospital and informed the police. The victims have been identified as Hari Singh, 78, his wife Gursharan Kaur, 76, security guard Khem Nand, 50, watchman Swaran Singh, 60, domestic helps Rumila, 19, and another of 16 years.

The elderly couple were alone at home with the domestic helps and security guards. The family had hired accused Anil Bahadur and Sushmita on the reference of a man named Hari Bahadur. Hari Bahadur had arranged helps for the relatives of the industrialist and so, they asked him to find cooks for them too.” “The family had hired Anil and Sushmita as cooks without police verification. On Saturday around 10.30pm, the two gave food laced with sedatives to the family and other helps. When they fell deep asleep, the accused called their two accomplices, including a woman, and robbed the house. They broke open the almirahs and escaped with cash and valuables. We are yet to get the loot details as the elderly couple are under treatment and Gurmeet is on way back to Ludhiana,” the inspector added. Swaranjeet said, “Pathi Charanjit Singh comes to Hari Singh’s house every morning as path is performed there daily. On Sunday morning, I received a call from the pathi that the main gate of the house was open and everyone was lying unconscious.” The inspector said CCTVs installed at the house have captured four accused.

They say that a dedicated health minister will be able to deal with the pandemic more effectively. The last two CMs of the incumbent BJP government — Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat — held the health portfolio with themselves. “In the past four years, including the pandemic phase, we haven’t seen the CMs conducting a one-to-one departmental meeting with the director general (health) and the 13 chief medical officers in an offline mode. The CM has a lot on his plate and thus, it is difficult for him to monitor every programme being run as per the illnesses dominating the state,” said a senior doctor of the health department. The doctors of Provincial Medical Health Services (PMHS) also echoed a similar sentiment. “Half of the posts of specialist doctors, staff nurses, lab technicians and grade IV employees are lying vacant in the state. A full-time health minister will understand that along with hiring more doctors, the state needs to recruit more staff nurses, lab technicians and grade IV employees as well,” said a senior doctor working in the health department. Meanwhile, Dr DD Choudhury, a senior doctor and member of the prestigious Central Working Committee (CWC) of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), India, told TOI, “Uttarakhand certainly needs a full-time dedicated health minister to bring its health services on track. A glimpse of government health facilities in Mussoorie, Vikasnagar, Sahaspur is sufficient to highlight the state of remote health facilities in the state. The remote areas continue to be appalling in terms of health infrastructure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/why-does-uttarakhand-require-a-dedicated-health-minister/articleshow/84122853.cms||Shivani Azad

These sketches are of the persons who lost their lives to the pandemic. “It started in April when daily I used to get news of death of someone in our extended family or friend circle. One of my maternal uncles had died due to Covid, and I could not go. After thinking much about what I could do in his memory, I sent a pencil sketch to his family, a gesture which they liked very much,” recounts Gajjar. “Afterwards, I also sent the similar portraits to a couple of more relatives.” A graphic artist with city-based NGO Chetna, Gajjar has worked extensively on gender issues, rural Gujarat and women empowerment in the past 25 years. His daughter Khyati is a mass communication graduate, but like her father, is interested in fine arts. “I first put up a message on social media, asking the relatives or friends of the deceased to share pictures. I then started making sketches and sending them back on the same email. As the movement got popular, I sought help of Khyati, who would make the outline and I would finish the drawings,” says Gajjar. So far, Anil and Khyati have made over 75 portraits under the initiative. “For us as artists, it’s the best homage we can offer to the victims’ families. The picture of the deceased is one thing that would stay forever on their walls. We are lucky to be part of their lives, as we don’t know majority of them and might not even meet,” says Gajjar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/artists-sketch-homage-to-covid-victims/articleshow/84127254.cms||---

---||Amritsar||A 1st: SGPC remembers 1955 Golden Temple police attack||AMRITSAR: The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), on Sunday, marked the anniversary of July 4, 1955, police attack on the Golden Temple aimed at crushing the demand for Punjabi Suba. Last month, the Sikh body had for the first time displayed the bullet-hit saroop of Sri Guru Granth Sahib ahead of Op Blue Star. The unusual moves by SGPC are being seen as efforts to help SAD regain ‘panthic’ ground ahead of the assembly elections early next year. Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh alleged the respective governments at the Center had always made efforts to suppress the voice of Sikhs and it was in this context that the July 4, 1955 attack was carried out. “Reneging on the promises made by the then government to the Sikhs was similar to breaking of promises and oaths made by the ‘Pahadi Rajahs’ (hill kings) at Sri Anandpur Sahib to 10th Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh. When the states were formed in India on the basis of language, justice was not done with Punjab,” he said. He claimed police were sent on the orders of then Jawaharlal Nehru government. “Shots were fired and hundreds of Sikhs were arrested,” he alleged. Addressing the gathering at Gurdwara Sri Manji Sahib Diwan Hall, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said the event was aimed at making Sikh youth aware of the atrocities perpetrated on the community. “Then PM Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Punjab chief minister Bhim Sen Sachar had tried to suppress the legitimate demands of the Sikhs, but the Sikh community always emerged victorious from the challenges,” Kaur said. She also said events would be chronicled after conducting research on the attack. “Efforts will be made to preserve memories by searching for eyewitnesses of the time who saw the attack in July 1955,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/a-1st-sgpc-remembers-1955-golden-temple-police-attack/articleshow/84127167.cms||---
---||Nashik||Jalgaon-Bhusawal third railway line to boost train traffic||NASHIK: The successful testing of the third line between Jalgaon and Bhadli stations — connecting Jalgaon and Bhusawal junctions, the busiest section in the Bhusawal division — will provide major boost to the running of trains on this Central Railway (CR) route. The last leg of the third line between the two stations was recently completed and commissioner for railway safety AK Jain tested the section for speed of 122 kmph, though the movement of trains will be restricted to 100 kmph. “We have a 5-km railway flyover, Rail over Rail (ROR) corridor, that enables third and the fourth tracks to cross over the existing tracks for easier movement of the trains. All of this is completed now,” said divisional railway manager Vivek Kumar Gupta. The construction of the 21-km-long third and fourth lines between two junctions was sanctioned way back in 2012, and it involved an elevated railway track. Land acquisition for the project was also carried out during the period. Half of the section, Bhusawal to Bhadli, has already been commissioned and is in use, while the second half Bhadli to Jalgaon will be used after some work related to signal and telecommunications is carried out. The entire project is estimated to cost around Rs 190 crore. “The work on the fourth line between Bhusawal and Bhadli is being carried out at a brisk rate. The work in this next section will also completed in the next one-and-a-half year as the basic infrastructure is ready now,” Pankaj Dhaware, deputy chief engineer (construction), said. About the usage, the DRM said there was heavy congestion between Jalgaon and Bhusawal junctions. “The completion of the third line will ensure faster movement of freight trains and non-stop passenger trains that will save their time. This will also help us increase the number of trains on the route,” said the DRM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/jalgaon-bhusawal-third-rly-line-to-boost-train-traffic/articleshow/84120861.cms||Abhilash Botekar

With the number, the youngsters became the biggest category of the vaccine recipients in the state. Those in 45-60 years age group account for 34% and those in 60-plus year category 27% of the total 2.68 crore vaccinations so far. Gujarat is third behind Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh in total vaccines administered. The percentage however is much higher in the four major cities of Gujarat as Rajkot had 18-44 years accounting for 54% of vaccines, 52% in Ahmedabad and Surat, and 51% in Vadodara. Experts pointed at the early start of vaccination in seven cities and three districts as the reason behind the stats. The state is facing acute vaccine shortage for the past few days as vaccination was halted in several vaccination booths across Gujarat. Long queues of the beneficiaries were seen in Ahmedabad and other cities as the authorities were forced to introduce token system to ensure vaccine jabs for all. Analysis of the vaccination for the younger population reveals that among Gujarat’s neighbouring states, Madhya Pradesh has the young population accounting for 50% of total vaccination. Rajasthan had 37% in 18-44 years age group, whereas the figure was 33% for Maharashtra. Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh had 38% of the beneficiaries in the said age group, whereas Kerala’s total vaccination had 22% among the younger population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/people-below-45-account-for-39-of-vax/articleshow/84127243.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: RWAs hold vaccine camps after a lull||KOLKATA: After a brief lull following a state government order, vaccination camps resumed at some of the city’s prominent housing complexes on Sunday, with Greenfield City housing complex in south Kolkata flagging off the drive. While a few more joined in across the city, there are few fresh applications for off-site camps in Kolkata, according to the state urban development authority (SUDA), the nodal agency for Covid vaccination. It is unlikely to pick up till the supply of vaccines rise, according to private hospitals. The Greenfield City Foundation that has been organizing these camps in the complex was the first one to get permission from the state health department. At Urbana, the complex representatives will launch a fresh round of vaccination drive at their compound — mostly for daily wage earners in the neighbourhood — on Tuesday. “Thankfully, the drive has resumed but the process has got lengthier. It took us more than a week to get the relevant permission which earlier used to take barely a day or two,” said Debjani Mukherjee, director, Urbana Facility Management. Deepak Agarwal of Diamond City West, too, said they have made fresh application for a second dose vaccination drive. “We are likely to get the permission by Monday and will conduct the vaccination drive in our complex next week,” said Agarwal. Applications for housing complex vaccinations were few in Kolkata, according to SUDA joint secretary Joly Chaudhuri. “Most private hospitals are eager to hold such camps in the districts for which they need to get in touch with the CMOHs of the respective districts,” said Chaudhuri. Private hospitals said while supply of vaccines has been low, demand for off-site vaccinations has slumped over the last 8-10 days. “We have enough to meet our commitments but attendance at our off-site camps has gone down. Generally, private hospitals are not planning to add off-site venues now,” said AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua. The jabs at Greenfield were administered by a private healthcare group and this was the ninth camp in the complex that has a huge population housed inside its 4,066 flats. On Sunday, 142 residents were jabbed. Other camps have also been lined up. “The process has become long now. We applied to the state health department, to the district magistrate and CMOH of the South 24 Parganas. In our application, we had to mention which healthcare group we had chosen for the camp. The CMOH got the necessary checks of the vaccines done after which a permission was issued to us by the state health department,” said chairman of the foundation, Saurav Chandra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rwas-hold-vaccine-camps-after-a-lull/articleshow/84125079.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The association asked that while on weekends non-essential shops are not permitted to remain open, how were such exhibitions permitted in star hotels. Assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s K-West ward, Vishwas Mote, said, “The exhibition organised at JW Mariott was stopped as they were operating without permissions. No permission is granted on weekends.” Viren Shah, president of FRTWA said that he had sent an email to the authorities regarding the same. “This is gross violation of the ‘break the chain’ order of the Maharashtra government. Maharashtra falls under level-3 wherein non-essential shops are permitted to stay open only till 4pm on weekdays. A team should be deployed to oversee such exhibitions held at various places during the festival period,” said Shah. The BMC K-West ward in a reply to a tweet to FRTWA said, “The location is inspected by our team and stopped immediately further action is being initiated against the organisers and hotel management.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-stops-expo-in-juhu-5-star-on-weekend-after-traders-complain/articleshow/84127157.cms||---

The court was hearing the criminal appeal filed by the three accused challenging the conviction and sentence imposed by the II additional sessions and district court at Tirunelveli in 2016. The three had sexually assaulted the woman when she was grazing goats. The trial court convicted and sentenced them to undergo seven years rigorous imprisonment and imposed Rs 1lakh fine under Section 354B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) of IPC. They were also sentenced to one-year rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 under Section 342 (wrongful confinement) of IPC. The sentences were to run consecutively. Justice K Murali Shankar observed that despite the imposition of severe punishments, the attitude of society towards women has not changed completely and that we must work to make sure women are treated well. In the present case, since the victim is a woman with speech and hearing disability, the punishment imposed cannot be claimed to be excessive. “Everyone accepts that we are to treat women well. But that is not enough. It’s time to work, to make sure that all men treat women well,” observed the judge. On this hope, the judge observed that the accused cannot be dealt with leniently and hence dismissed the criminal appeal preferred by the accused. The court directed the trial court to take necessary steps to secure the accused to undergo the remaining period of sentence, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/disabled-women-face-double-discrimination/articleshow/84122897.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Kids’ focus shaken by corona||AHMEDABAD: The parents of a 12-year-old child approached a city-based psychiatrist when they got worried about his well-being. The child, apart from spending about four hours on schooling, used to spend about four to five hours on social media and gaming. It had started affecting his academic performance, as the child complained that he could not remember anything taught in the class even on the same day. While the pandemic has had its social impact, it has also left a psychological impact on all age groups, said city-based experts. They said that apart from the obvious issues arising out of being confined to home, several kids bore the brunt of bereavement due to the pandemic or had to see a family member being hospitalized. The second wave infected more children compared to the first wave. Thus, many also experienced the isolation associated with the infection. Dr Nehal Shah, a city-based psychiatrist, said that in several cases, the impact of the pandemic is more acute among kids. “The need of the hour is to dispel myths about the pandemic, teach the right safety practices, and ensure that the child doesn’t get alienated,” he said. “Many spent so much time with their families for the first time — that also caused some of the issues.” Experts said that in several cases, the parents brought in kids as they would surf the internet for undesirable content on the pretext of studying. Dr Deepti Bhatt, a city-based psychiatrist, said that while boys are a bit more in percentage compared to the girls when it comes to such cases, the girls were found to be spending more time on social media and worrying about the likes. “With almost no other way to socialize, the teens tried to make up for it with their virtual persona,” said a city-based child psychologist. At Government Hospital for Mental Health, experts recorded a case of violence where a 16-year-old teen beat up his parents when they did not buy a new data pack. His father had lost his job, but the teen would not hear of it. The experts counselled him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kids-focus-shaken-by-corona/articleshow/84127239.cms||Parth Shastri

Only limited doses of Covaxin will be administered within municipal limits of Aurangabad on Monday, while there is no stock of Covishield. After progressing with a sluggish speed for the major portion of time in the recent past, the immunization programme, hit by a shortage of vaccines, witnessed 6,172 vaccinations on July 3 by virtue of the fresh supply. The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), however, has run out of stock again after the earlier stock was exhausted. The health authorities said the recent expansion of vaccination drive by incorporating citizens aged 18 years and above, has increased the demand for vaccines. “We are giving maximum possible doses on a single day as and when the stock of vaccine arrives. The available stock is not used in a staggered manner like in the past to carry out mass vaccination as quick as possible,” said authorities concerned, preferring anonymity. While vaccination witnessed a halt on Sunday as it was a holiday, the total number of vaccinations in Aurangabad city has reached 4,65,976 by Sunday. It included 1,29,259 beneficiaries between the age of 18 and 44 years, who have received the first dose of the vaccine, as per the official data.

But it is two key witnesses who, they believe, hold the key to the prosecution as it is preparing to slap the attempt-to-murder charges on the fake IAS officer Debanjan Deb and his associates for arranging fake vaccination camps. Cops have already begun proceedings to get the necessary court approval to record before a magistrate the statement of Sanjay Mokim, from whom the amikacin sulphate IP medicines were reportedly purchased by the accused. In the name of his employee, P Anjelina Leslie, Deb had opened a fake KMC account at a private bank for disbursing salary. According to police sources, Mokim and Leslie are expected to record their statements before a magistrate (CrPC 164) in the coming week. “We will get some vaccine recipients too to record their statements before the magistrate in the long run,” said a police officer. Mokim refused to comment, stating that the case was under investigation but assured that he will cooperate with police. Cops have already recorded the statements of four public representatives and politicians — actress and Jadavpur MP Mimi Chakraborty, actress and Sonarpur South MLA Lovely Maitra, Rajya Sabha MP Shantanu Sen and TMC leader from Taltala Ashok Chakraborty alias Mana. The police probe will also take into account fresh allegations against Deb from Siliguri on Sunday when a trader claimed to have met Deb at a function in Kolkata. Meanwhile, it has now emerged that Deb had not only bought amikacin sulphate at Rs 13-77 per vial but he had also stocked triamcinolone acetonide Injections. “This is to clarify that we have not yet found anything suggesting that steroids were used. Reports from FSL or drug test report are yet to arrive,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-scam-probe-over-50-statements-recorded/articleshow/84125097.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

They claimed that they did not receive any SMS on their vaccination after taking the jab. The detective department of Kolkata Police has asked them to lodge a formal complaint with local police. “Since the fake IAS officer Debanjan Deb had organized a camp at Sonarpur, every complaint will be investigated,” said an officer.

BJP claims Sena’s rank and file are unhappy with the party's decision to oppose the project on environmental grounds as they believe it would boost their job prospects. Jathar said differences on the issue will prompt more Sena activists to shift to BJP including office-bearers and corporators. “We will not let the refinery go from Rajapur (Ratnagiri). There are hundreds of Shiv Sainiks who have come out in support of the project,” he said. A Rs 3 lakh crore oil refinery and petrochemicals complex was proposed as a joint venture between Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and Saudi Aramco in Ratnagiri by the Centre during Devendra Fadnavis’s tenure. However, Sena had opposed it citing concerns about the huge land requirements as well as pollution concerns. The project was proposed with a capacity of 60 million tonnes per annum, with a potential to generate 1.5 lakh direct and indirect jobs. However, concerns about its impact on agriculture and fishing which are the big sources of employment in Konkan, had generated fears. According to those backing the plan, it would boost job opportunity and incomes. However, Sena opposed it citing ecological concerns in the green, coastal belt. In March, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said it will be shifted to another site due to local opposition. The CM had also said that the state has identified a few alternative sites for the project. MNS chief Raj Thackeray then wrote to the CM, demanding that the project be revived in Konkan without disturbing the environment. Meanwhile, the union petroleum minister has ordered a feasibility study for setting it up in Vidarbha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sainiks-in-konkan-join-bjp-support-refinery-in-nanar/articleshow/84127180.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

As Gajendran was conducting inquiry with Santhosh, Suresh Balaji, a constable attached to the special branch arrived and dragged Santhosh outside the police station and took his photos on his cell phone.The petitioner objected to the action and there was a wordy duel between them. Taking advantage of the situation, accused Santhosh escaped. Subsequently, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the petitioner and his increment was postponed for two years. When he filed a mercy petition against the punishment, it was rejected by the authorities, following which he moved HC Madurai bench last year.The petitioner submitted through his counsel that constable Suresh was also awarded punishment of increment postponement for two years with cumulative effect, but on appeal it was modified to one year without cumulative effect. After Suresh filed a mercy petition his punishment was further modified as a ‘black mark’.The counsel further submitted that while Suresh, who was the person responsible for the escape of the accused, has been punished with only ‘black mark’, the punishment imposed on the petitioner, who is not responsible for the incident, is invalid. Justice V M Velumani observed that considering all the materials, he is of the view that the finding of the inquiry officer is erroneous as it is not based on the evidence. It is contrary to the evidence placed before the inquiry officer. Saying that the punishment based on the inquiry report is invalid and illegal, the judge set it aside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madras-hc-quashes-punishment-of-cop-for-escape-of-accused/articleshow/84122919.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: FIR against trolls for bullying actor Shruti Das with ‘dusky skin’||KOLKATA: Police on Saturday registered a case against Facebook users for abusing Bengali television actor Shruti Das. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said the case has been registered under different sections of the IPC as well as the Information Technology Act. The ‘Desher Mati’ actor had lodged a police complaint after being subjected to online hate comments regarding her dusky complexion since 2019. “On the basis of a complaint by Shruti Das, we have started a case at the Cyber crime police station against certain users of Facebook for posting objectionable remarks against her. The case pertains to Section 66C of IT Act. We have also added sections of the IPC pertaining to criminal conspiracy, stalking and insulting modesty of a woman,” said Sharma. Reacting to this, 23-year-old Das said, “Our society collectively loves Tagore’s ‘Krishnakoli’ song that celebrates a woman with a dusky skin tone. In the same society, there are people who insult me for my complexion. It is time we got over our hypocrisy. Black lives matter. So does dusky complexion. It can’t be a reason for hate. I’m glad the cops have acted on my complaint.” According to Section 66C of IT Act, whoever, fraudulently or dishonestly, makes use of the electronic signature, password or any other unique identification feature of any other person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine with may extend to Rs 1 lakh. Cyber police sources said they are writing to Facebook for the IP addresses. A decision on requesting FB to suspend these accounts will be taken soon. “Once we establish that the accused had been serially abusing her, harsher sections are in the offing,” said an investigating officer. The police are also likely to ask Das to record her statement before a magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fir-against-trolls-for-bullying-actor-with-dusky-skin/articleshow/84125104.cms||---

The state government has asked the corporation to award the work and facilitate biomining immediately. Though a private firm had submitted a proposal to carry out the biomining of the legacy waste months ago, the work couldn’t be awarded due to objection from opposition councillors. “In the wake of the NGT order, the government has issued an order asking the corporation to award the work immediately. We have also taken steps to prepare a comprehensive plan for utilizing around 100 acres at Brahmapuram. A private firm has been entrusted with the preparation of the detailed project report (DPR) of the project,” mayor M Anilkumar said. The corporation council to be held soon will consider the issue. Biomining is the technique of extraction and segregation of minerals and useful materials from mounds of waste. The local body has also started measures to construct a new solid waste treatment plant to replace the existing dilapidated plant at Brahmapuram. The local body has earmarked Rs 9 crore as the first phase of allocation for the works. The NGT had asked the government and the corporation to construct a scientific plant for the treatment of solid waste generated in Kochi. Flaying the corporation and the state government for not complying with its earlier order for taking urgent steps to biomine the legacy waste, the NGT warned of strict action against all, including the state chief secretary. Criticizing the callous attitude of the authorities, the NGT had also asked them to construct a leachate treatment plant for the existing plant at the earliest. Even after more than two years since the NGT giving a similar order, the corporation has not taken any steps in this regard. “A leachate treatment plant will be constructed,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Asharaf. According to opposition councillors, the private firm which the corporation planned to award the work had a tainted past. “First of all, the firm had no experience in biomining. Moreover, there are legal disputes pending against the company over the works it had done earlier,” said Henry Austin, deputy leader, the UDF parliamentary party, Kochi corporation. “It is learnt that the local body will have to spend around Rs 54 crore for biomining the legacy waste. Meanwhile, the waste-to-energy plant proposed by the state government for treating the solid waste and generating electricity from it is pending for more than four years. It was the corporation which mooted the project. As the corporation failed to implement the project in a time-bound manner, the government stepped in. The Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) was deployed as the nodal agency for the project. But the KSIDC also failed to implement the project so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-initiates-steps-to-biomine-waste/articleshow/84125100.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Chennai||Dam at Mekedatu will hurt Tamil Nadu farmers: M K Stalin||CHENNAI: Responding to Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa’s letter urging not to oppose the Mekedatu dam project, chief minister M K Stalin reiterated that the project was against the interests of the farmers in Tamil Nadu and requested the former not to pursue the same. Stalin’s letter on Sunday was also silent on the request by Yeddiyurappa for a bilateral talk on the issue - a sign that TN was not keen on the proposal for talks. The view that Mekedatu dam would not affect the interests of Tamil Nadu cannot be agreed upon, as it would hinder the flow of water from catchments areas below Kabini and Krishnarajasagar dams, Stalin told Yeddiyurappa. He said the final order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, which was later modified by the Supreme Court, had clearly identified the three components contributing to the annual quantum of water to be delivered to TN. “The proposed Mekedatu dam will impound and divert the first component of uncontrolled flow to Tamil Nadu, which is from the uncontrolled catchment areas downstream Kabini reservoir and catchment areas below Krishnarajasahar dam and uncontrolled flow from Simsha, Arkavatahy and Suvernavathy sub-basins,” Stalin said. Stalin noted that constructing a major reservoir at Mekedatu, which is too far away from Bengaluru, to meet the drinking water requirements of the metropolis did not sound valid. He said the justification by Karnataka on the need for a reservoir with a storage capacity of 67.18tmc (thousand million cubic feet) for meeting 4.75tmc requirement of drinking water was not acceptable, especially when Karnataka had adequate infrastructure to draw water for drinking purposes of Bengaluru. “This will definitely jeopardise the availability of water to Tamil Nadu,” he said. Stalin said the comparison of Mekedatu project with Sillahalla and Kundah dams was not correct. Yeddiyurappa had said in his letter that TN had not obtained consent from Karnataka for the two projects to buttress his point that since TN was going ahead with such projects it should not object to Karnataka taking up projects. But Stalin said the latter were hydro power projects, where water was recirculated by pumping to meet peak power demand. There was no consumption of water and hence those projects would not affect availability for irrigation or drinking purposes, he said.“I request you to consider the above facts and the sensitivity of these issues and strongly urge you not to pursue the Mekedatu project,” Stalin said in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dam-at-mekedatu-will-hurt-tn-farmers-stalin/articleshow/84127202.cms||---

After deferring the exams for around six months due to the Covid pandemic, the university completed its winter session tests a few days ago. The university had asked all affiliated colleges of all the three districts — Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara — to begin the academic session online. Also, the syllabus will remain crunched for the coming semester exam as well. Gajanan Palase, chief controller of exams SUK, said, “Unlike earlier semester exams, the coming summer session exam will be only through online mode. The students will not have any choice of manual mode as Covid continues to ravage these three districts. We have asked the colleges to complete the practical exams in the last week of June. Around 2.5 lakh students are eligible and therefore we have to meticulously plan the dates for the exam for each subject to ensure the students do not miss out. We are planning to complete the exams for all courses within a month.” Each exam will be for 50 marks comprising 25 questions for 2 marks each. The exams for professional courses will be held in clusters meaning few colleges will be selected at a time for the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/summer-session-exams-from-aug-10-suk/articleshow/84120953.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Unmasked in Gujarat: Big cities major offenders||AHMEDABAD: An analysis of figures shows that the highest number of mask offences were registered in the four big cities of the state: Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat, and Vadodara. This trend has been seen because these cities have large populations and cops continued to hold drives against people without masks. Senior police officers said that Ahmedabad city has a population of about 60 lakh and it has registered 6.63 lakh cases of mask offences between June 24, 2020, and June 28, 2021. This means that over 10% of the population of the city was caught by cops for not wearing masks for which they paid Rs 53.21 crore in fines. Similarly, other major cities also recorded a high number of mask offences and the total fines collected from the four big cities has reached nearly Rs 117 crore. The state has collected Rs 253 crore in fines between June 24, 2020, and June 28, 2021, and the major cities contributed nearly 47% of the mask fines to the state exchequer. This huge collection came even after the cops showed a lenient approach in collecting fines during the festival season in October last year and during the local body polls in February this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/unmasked-big-cities-major-offenders/articleshow/84127262.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Father-son duo held for killing woman over ‘unpaid loan’ in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The JJ Marg police have arrested a 51-year-old man and his juvenile son for the murder of a 62-year-old woman whose partly decomposed body was found in her flat in Nagpada area last week. Police had earlier registered a murder case against unknown persons, but cracked the case on Saturday with the arrest of the father-son duo. Police said that while main accused, Ayub Khan, was produced before the court and remanded to police custody, the boy was sent to juvenile justice board’s custody since he is 17 years old. The murder took place on July 1, and the deceased woman, identified as Rehana Siddiqui, was found lying dead in her flat in Diamond Cutter building in South Mumbai by her maid. When Siddiqui did not open the door, the maid immediately alerted the neighbours, who then contacted her son and daughter. They also alerted the JJ Marg police. Police then broke open the door and found Siddiqui’s body in a partially decomposed state. There were blood stains below her nose. Police also recovered a broken rope near her body and suspect she could have been strangled to death. The woman had died 24 hours earlier, said a police official. Police said Siddiqi was living alone after the death of her husband and her son and daughter lived in the vicinity and visited her regularly. During the course of investigation into the murder, police stumbled upon CCTV footages, and some witnesses said they had seen Ayub Khan and his son going inside the building. When police picked up Ayub, he confessed to the killing and said they were the victim’s neighbor earlier and his mother had given Rs 16 lakh to Siddiqui which she refused to return. This had led to a scuffle between the two families. Ayub told police he killed Siddiqui in a fit of rage and fled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-father-son-duo-held-for-killing-woman-over-unpaid-loan/articleshow/84127212.cms||---

With the process to verify 250 more beneficiaries going on, the numbers are expected to increase. DCPU sources said the health department has given the list of about 1,100 people who died of Covid-19 in Madurai district. From this, 108 children who lost at least one parent were shortlisted. A few applications were received from candidates who did not figure in this list provided by the health department. “We are in the process of verifying details of 250 more kids whose parents are said to have died of Covid-19. The age of the children is also being verified since the scheme is applicable only for children below 18 years. We are yet to come across a child whose both parents have died due to Covid in Madurai so far,” an official of the district administration said. The shortlisted 108 children were produced before the child welfare committee and certified. The state government has announced Rs 5 lakh as aid to children who lost both parents and Rs 3 lakh to those who lost one parent. A sum of Rs 3,000 per month will be given to the child if a guardian or relative comes forward to take care of him or her till the age of 18. Another official said that only families under the below poverty line (BPL) will be eligible to receive the aid. In case both the parents have died, the child will be eligible to receive the aid irrespective of the annual income of the parents. If one of the parents died and the family features in the BPL list available with the government, there is no need to submit an income certificate. If the family does not figure in the list, steps will be taken to ascertain if it is is eligible to be included in the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/108-kids-who-lost-a-parent-to-covid-identified-in-madurai/articleshow/84122957.cms||V Devanathan

The meeting, coming against the backdrop of the Enforcement Directorate’s action against present and erstwhile ministers of the state, ended with neither the CM nor any minister outlining the agenda for the media. The MVA also cancelled the traditional tea party where opposition members are invited. An official said the state will table resolutions during the session to: oppose the three farm laws enacted by the central government; seek empirical data on OBCs in the wake of a Supreme Court banning a quota for them in local body elections; demand resumption of a process at the central level for a Maratha quota; and seek more vaccine supplies. It is also likely that the MVA may defer polls for the speaker’s post, which fell vacant after Nana Patole of the Congress stepped down to take charge as state party chief. The official said the MVA will not implement the farm laws in their present form. As reported by TOI on Sunday, he said the state will table amendment Bills. But they are unlikely in the two-day monsoon session; only the resolution to oppose the Central Acts will get passed in the session. A cabinet minister said the speaker’s poll was not discussed. Another minister said the CM is not keen to hold the election as he was not consulted when Patole resigned from the post in February. It is also said that MVA fears cross-voting. The state will table five Bills in this session including an amendment in the Maharashtra (urban area) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act 1975 to introduce a provision for ‘heritage trees’ and to set up the Maharashtra state tree authority. Meanwhile, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis launched another broadside saying "this government is doing exactly what happened during the Emergency." At a press meet, he said the monsoon session is only for two days and only a few Bills, supplementary demands and obituaries are to be allowed. "Ever since this government came to power, there have been seven legislative sessions for a total of 36 days and if the monsoon session is included it will be 38 days as against 69 days of Parliament. Parliamentary tools such as Question Hour, Calling Attention Motion will not be allowed during the session. As a responsible opposition, we are raising people's issues but this government under the pretext of the pandemic is running away from addressing them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-anti-farm-law-pro-maratha-quota-resolutions-to-be-tabled/articleshow/84127271.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal writes to PM for Bharat Ratna to doctors, health workers for Covid service||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting that the nation wants Bharat Ratna be given to the “Indian doctor” this year. He said that by this, he meant the entire medical fraternity, including all doctors, nurses and paramedics. Kejriwal has written that many doctors and nurses have lost their lives in the battle against Covid-19 and if they are honoured with Bharat Ratna, it will be the real tribute to them. He also said that if the rules didn’t allow a group of people to be given Bharat Ratna, those rules should be changed. Bharat Ratna is the highest civilian award in the country and was last given to Pranab Mukherjee, Bhupen Hazarika and Nanaji Deshmukh in 2019. “This is the greatest manner in which we can pay our respect and homage to all those who have martyred while serving the nation on Covid duties,” Kejriwal said during an address as the chief guest of Project StepOne’s Doctors’ Day celebrations. Project StepOne is a volunteer-run group of doctors and other citizens that helps provide telemedicine services during the pandemic. “The medical community stepped up to serve our nation during the Covid-19 crisis, we are all deeply grateful to the community. I personally know a lot of doctors who could not be home for months because of their Covid duties. Without thinking twice about their families and children, they relentlessly served the country, putting their own lives at stake,” he said. “They were not getting any special benefits, extra payments or promotions, they weren’t getting anything in exchange. Yet they all did their best because of their love for humanity. We salute all these brave doctors, nurses and paramedics.” “I received an interesting message once; it read that all temples are shut during Covid because God is serving at hospitals wearing a white coat,” he said. “Despite this there were some incidents around the country where doctors were mistreated; yet in 99% cases, our doctors bore through the agony in empathy for the patients and their families.” Kejriwal said the ex gratia of Rs 1 crore being given to the families of frontline workers and doctors was not compensation, but a token of respect for their services. “We tried our best to fix the system as much as was in our capacity... This is not compensation, this is a way of thanking their service, and reinforcing that we care for them, and the country and the society stand with them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-writes-to-pm-for-bharat-ratna-to-doctors-health-workers-for-covid-service/articleshow/84125125.cms||---

Fresh statistics show that Amdavadis are six times more complacent in not wearing masks compared to not wearing helmets — even after the second Covid wave cost us the lives of our dear ones. Between June 24, 2020, and June 28 this year, 6.63 lakh Amdavadis paid Rs 53.21 crore in fines for not wearing masks. In comparison, 1.58 lakh citizens faltered on the helmet rule and paid Rs 7.92 crore in fines between January and December 2020. City-based surveys say that mask wearing has been next to an impossibility for Amadavdis. But a small bunch of community health experts at AMC-NHL Medical College wish to conduct a sociological experiment to improve mask wearing. “We have chosen the NORM model followed by Bangladesh’s public health experts under which they improved mask wearing from 13% to 42% between August and November,” says a senior professor at NHL Medical College. The professor is preparing an action plan for the possible third wave. The NORM model hinges on three basic actions: free distribution of masks directly to households, at religious places, and at markets; popularizing mask wearing by religious and community leaders; and catalyzing the government’s mask programme. The model does not rely much on police to enforce the mask rule but on community monitors who gently request people to wear masks. If they don’t have one, a free mask is given. “We have to make sure that people understand the scientific reasons for wearing masks,” the professor says. “We must also ensure that people in a marketplace or any such given area who have received the masks are wearing them to protect each other.”The fourth ingredient in the NORM model is the deployment of monitors in marketplaces to gently intervene when people aren’t wearing masks. “One has to understand that fines or arrests are not what people are worried about,” the professor says. “An informal sanction works.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/masks-ideas-to-prevent-the-fatal-slip/articleshow/84127310.cms||---

Revenue officials have prepared a plan to complete land acquisition along the stretch within three months and hand it over to National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). The allocated fund is for acquiring around 205hectare for widening 63.5km stretch of the national highway from Kadikkad in Chavakkad taluk to Methala in Kodungallur taluk. Revenue minister K Rajan will inaugurate the disbursement of compensation to the land owners at a function to be held at Methala on Monday. The total amount earmarked for compensation for the land owners along Edappally-Kuttippuram stretch of the national highway is Rs 5,400 crore. The land acquisition process which was started in 2009 hadn’t progressed much till recently. The notification for acquiring land was issued in the same year. The government expedited the land acquisition process after 2018. The acquisition process was completed as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. The revenue officials are serving notices to the land owners asking them to move out within 60 days. The compensation amount will be given to the land owners as they submit various documents regarding their holdings. The money for holdings with dispute over ownership will be deposited with the court. The land acquisition process along Moothakunnam-Edappally stretch of the national highway is also progressing. The road along the stretch has a width of around10 metres. The government had acquired the land required for widening the road to 30m more than three decades ago. But NHAI couldn’t widen the road. Now, measures are being taken for widening it to 45 metres. Foundation stones have been laid in areas where the survey works are completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-allots-rs-1777cr-to-acquire-land/articleshow/84125147.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: First physical Sunday mass after curbs ease||KOLKATA: All 65 Catholic churches across the city on Sunday saw physical services (mass) conducted by the parish priests and a limited 50 members attending with enthusiasm and piety, following all safety protocols and praying for a ‘softer third wave’. Temperature checks, hand sanitization, masked entry, distanced seating were all in place and priests ensured that only those who had been vaccinated registered for Sunday services. Those yet to be jabbed were advised to come in only after they took the vaccine. Though the Catholic churches had re-opened on Thursday and not more than 20 people were allowed in, the archdiocese had allowed the numbers to increase to a maximum of 50 on Sunday, since the services done on this day were special for the community. Since a majority was still at home, the services were streamed live for them to attend from home. In every church the services saw a prayer for better times to come as priests and parishioners prayed that the third wave doesn’t turn out to be as harsh as the second. Archbishop Thomas D Souza set the tone for the Sunday services by reading mass at 6.30 am at the chapel of St Joseph’s home for the aged with the elderly inmates attending in fervent prayers. The archbishop had called out to parish priests two days ago to adopt special programs for the elderly, who should feel that the church was by them in this hour of crisis. The first priest installation ceremony of the Catholic Church this year was held on Sunday at Our Lady of Happy Voyage Church, where vicar general Dominic Gomes installed Father Sunil Kujur at a two-hour ceremony attended by 50 parishioners. Starting with the morning services, several churches held special services throughout the day so that every time 50 new eager faces could enter the church. “We held four services throughout the day. Fear still hangs in the air and utmost precautions have been taken but there was no denying the happiness in the eyes of those who came in,” said Father Lucas, priest of St Thomas Church Middleton Row. Sunil Baptist, a member of St Teresa’s Church was happy that he was back in church after a gap of two months. “It’s not the same as attending service online. I am so happy that I received communion physically,” he said. The church has two floors on which the parishioners were evenly spread out. Irving Kleinman (70) was, however, sad that he could not be among the 50 who attended service physically at Christ the King Church at Park Circus. “I will wait for next time. I joined virtually,” he said. Summing up the mood of the first physical Sunday church service, vicar general Dominic Gomes said, “The refrain across was of hope and earnest prayers to the Lord that the coming days be smoother, the horror of the second wave be over and the third wave, if at all, passes gently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-physical-sunday-mass-after-curbs-ease/articleshow/84125146.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The blast took place on platform number one of Darbhanga railway station on June 17. An IED was kept inside a parcel containing clothes which had reached there from Secunderabad junction. The NIA had taken brothers Nasir, who was trained in Pakistan to manufacture IED, and Imran into custody on Saturday and Kafil Ansari on Sunday. They were then taken to Delhi for interrogation. The alleged LeT recruiter, Haji Salim, is lodged in Beur central jail, Patna. All are from Kairana in Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli. The brothers were arrested on June 30 from Hyderabad where they had settled two decades back. The others were arrested from Kairana on July 2. Sources said the IED containing liquid explosives inside a glass bottle smaller than size of a cough syrup container was the first one Nasir and Imran had prepared for live test. “Had it exploded successfully, larger version was to be manufactured for future terror attacks across the country,” a source said. Sources said that the two brothers had told NIA that their plan was to explode the IED inside train’s parcel van near Kazipet junction. “However, the NIA and intelligence agencies have suspicion over the information shared by the duo. They strongly suspect that the parcel containing the IED was to be taken somewhere from Darbhanga, but it exploded due to mishandling by a worker who dumped it on ground,” a source said. Sources said Nasir and Imran had developed the IED based on concept of mixing of two liquid chemicals, causing explosion with generation of heat and fire. A source said the brothers had told NIA that they used a cardboard as separating layer in Darbhanga parcel IED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/let-operatives-had-planned-more-terror-attacks-in-country/articleshow/84123024.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The city in 24 hours ending 5pm on Sunday recorded 19 new positive cases and death of one positive patient, whereas 25 got discharged, reducing seven active cases. For the past fortnight, the city’s daily death toll has not exceeded two. With the daily state death toll hovering around three to four, the city accounts for 33% to 50% of the total daily deaths. “The number of patients in private hospitals is below 10 now, whereas in government hospitals, the number doesn’t exceed 50. Thus, majority of the patients are getting treated at home based on the number of active cases. The biggest takeaway for the past one month is low mortality rate,” said a city-based critical care specialist. Among other districts, Dang has zero active cases, whereas Chhota Udepur, Dahod, Morbi, Narmada, Panchmahal, Patan, Surendranagar, and Tapi have less than 10 active cases. Out of 33, 18 other districts have 10 to 50 active cases. Only Ahmedabad, Surat, Gandhinagar, and Gir-Somnath have more than 100 active cases. On Sunday, only Ahmedabad and Surat had more than 10 daily cases, whereas 17 cities and districts had zero new cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/active-cases-now-close-to-1k-in-abad/articleshow/84127336.cms||---

The machine, sponsored by Tripunithura Rotary Club under their corporate social responsibility initiative, will help in getting Covid test results within 24 minutes as against the current RT-PCR tests, which take eight hours for the results. Insulation works of the machine are underway at the lab. Training for technicians has begun at the lab. The new machine will be utilized to test the samples of non-Covid patients who need emergency treatment, including ventilator facility. Presently, the samples are tested using CB NAAT, TrueNat and open RT-PCR. CB NAAT shows results in 50 minutes, while TrueNat gives results in one-and-half hours and open PCR test results take four to five hours. As per diagnostic tests, four parameters — sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value — are considered for diagnosing true cases. “If a patient who met with an accident, is brought to the casualty or a sick patient needs better treatment, he is currently tested under CB NAAT or TrueNAT or open RT-PCR to know whether the person is Covid positive or not. Since these tests are time-consuming ones, we can use rapid RT-PCR tests, the result of which will be out in half an hour. This is helpful in emergency cases where waiting long for test results is difficult. The new test facility has a reasonable degree of precision,” said Dr Nikhilesh Menon, nodal officer of RT-PCR/Covid test. The samples for rapid RT-PCR testing will be transported from government hospitals to the regional lab using the existing integrated sample transportation system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-rt-pcr-test-result-in-30-mins/articleshow/84125175.cms||T C Sreemol

Though a few bookings were cancelled, the waiting lists are rarely showing any movement at all. The reason behind such rush is that only 50% of the space could be utilised and 50% of the staff could be called in to work there. Salons compared the situation with what they usually see during Durga Puja every year. Their phones kept ringing relentlessly while they were flooded with requests for booking online. The owners of these salons said that their weekend business was extremely encouraging and could be compared to the pre-Covid puja booking time. “Perhaps the vaccination drives helped people become confident about venturing out and going for high touch services,” said Priscilla Corner, a partner of June Tomkyns. In each of the six outlets of Eye Catchers, there are 12-15 clients who are in the waiting list. “At one of our outlets in a popular city mall, 25 clients are waitlisted. This surpasses our pre-Puja 2020 booking scene,” said Julie Chung, the business head. Shreya Kanungo, a private firm employee, who walked into one of the A N John salon outlets, said, “I am happy to get the long awaited hair and skin services.” Soumi Sinha, an employee of a city school, has been waiting for her salon to give her an appointment for the past four days for her unkempt hair and eyebrows. Those running salons said that many clients are preferring stylists and beauticians as they do not want their services to be done by others. This was making the queues longer. Most of the salons have done away with walk-in slots temporarily and for each appointment, they are allowing maximum 10-minute delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/long-waiting-lists-at-salons-across-kolkata-as-they-record-puja-like-weekend-footfall/articleshow/84125181.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Initially, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) plans to ply 50 buses on nine different routes comprising 240 bus stops. Also, the civic body recently carried out successful trial run of the buses on these routes. The NMC had planned to launch the city bus service from March 1, but the idea got delayed due to the second wave of the Covid pandemic. Mayor Satish Kulkarni on Saturday met Fadnavis and invited him to inaugurate the bus service. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, BJP state president Chandrakant Patil and former ministers Girish Mahajan and Jaykumar Rawal will also remain present during the inauguration. The NMC has developed an Intelligent Transport Management System (ITMS) software for real time monitoring of buses and ensuring buses ply on time. It will also benefit the commuters as they will get real time information about arrival and departure of buses at the bus terminal. More importantly, a mobile application has been created under the project that commuters can download and book their tickets online. The application will also enable commuters to know monitor the movement of the buses. The Nashik civic bodyhas deployed two private agencies on procure, operate, maintain and manage basis. Both the agencies have already procured 250 buses, including 200 CNG and remaining 50 diesel buses. The agencies will be paid on per km basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fadnavis-set-to-inaugurate-city-bus-service-on-july-8/articleshow/84121069.cms||Tushar Pawar

A recent example is of Paltan Bazaar where water got collected in the open ducts putting traders and people coming to the market at risk. Shopkeepers said that they were forced to flush out the rain water from their shops. “Is this how the government is planning to make Doon a smart city by making things even worse than they were earlier?” an incensed shopkeeper asked. Traders claimed that newly constructed drains were not connected due to ongoing construction at Paltan Bazaar. Due to that the rain water is accumulating in front of the shops, they said. Arun Juneja, a shopkeeper, said, “Tiles had come off after the first rains and now owners are ending up suffering losses as water is entering the shops.” Cleaning of old drains has also been a concern for traders which were blocked for years. Taking cognisance, Dehradun mayor assured everyone of getting the drains cleaned to avoid inconvenience to traders and the general public. “The work of cleaning drains has been started. It will be completed by Tuesday," Mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama said. On Sunday, the mayor visited Paltan Bazaar to get the drains cleaned along with officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/monsoon-rains-clog-drains-cause-waterlogging/articleshow/84123062.cms||---

The members of the community told TOI that they expect Dhami to address the tribal related issues in Dehradun. "Several women of the Tharu tribe tie 'rakhi' to Dhami every year. He enjoys good support among the Tharu people and they vote for him overwhelmingly. Dhami eats at tribal homes as well and doesn’t differentiate between a tribal and a non-tribal,” said Surenderi Devi, who lives in the Tharu dominated village of Ratanpur located on the outskirts of the Khatima city. Devi added, “We live around 20 minutes from his Nagla village, and have cordial relations. He always attends our event whenever we request him. If he is busy, then he will make sure that his wife attends in place of him.” Another Tharu member told TOI that she hopes Dhami to address the tribal related issues after becoming the chief minister. “Now, as a CM, he has much more power and can address our issues as well.

And considering that children are likely to be vulnerable to the virus during the third wave, the South Goa district hospital has focused on strengthening its paediatric care facilities. Apart from a new paediatric ward, six neo natal care units have also been created in the hospital, nodal officer Dr Rajesh Patil told reporters on Sunday. Stating that audit of the existing ventilators has been initiated, Patil said that experts were on the job to make them suitable for use for paediatric patients. Besides as intensive care units (ICU) and intensive treatment unit (ITU), a five bedded high dependency unit has been created near the casualty ward that is equipped with a ventilator. Critical patients coming to the hospital are first admitted to the high dependency unit where they are stabilised before shifting them to the ICU or ITU, thereby preventing any delay in treatment, Patil said. Facilities for providing dialysis treatment to kidney patients have also been made available at the hospital. Patil said that the hospital’s focus has also been on providing post Covid care as cases of pulmonary fibrosis post-Covid infection have been on the rise. A post-Covid Ayush centre has also been opened at the South Goa district hospital where Ayush doctors train patients in breathing exercises, it was informed. Patil further said that the hospital has been sending swabs of Covid positive patients, particularly of those having severe infection, and those who have contracted the infection despite being fully vaccinated, for genomic sequencing. “Once we get the reports, we will be able to determine which variant is in circulation, and which is more serious, and accordingly appropriate treatment will be given to the patients,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/s-goa-hospital-strengthens-its-paediatric-care-facilities/articleshow/84127435.cms||---

The LDF government is committed to ensuring an investor-friendly atmosphere for all those who are showing interest in investing in the state. The chief minister tweeted this as a reply to the tweet of RPG Enterprises chairman Harsh Goenka. In his tweet Harsh Goenka had said that “RPG is the largest employers in Kerala. We find the local government very supportive”. To this the chief minister replied, “Thank you for allaying the apprehensions over Kerala’s EoDB. Your honesty is much appreciated. Kerala has been one of the most investor-friendly states in India and will continue to be so. The LDF govt ensures that sustainable and innovative industries thrive here”. The reply made by the CM is seen as an apparent response to Kitex managing director Sabu M Jacob who had levelled serious allegations against the state government for the continuous raids his company had to face in the last one month. Jacob had come out in open criticizing the attitude of the state government in insulting the investors by ordering continuous raids. Meanwhile, industry minister P Rajeeve came down heavily against Jacob and said if he had any complaints he should have approached the government first. “He could have levelled allegations if the government had not acted on his complaints,” said Rajeeve. “He created an impression to the world that the fate of investors in the state are not encouraging, which should not have been done. His company has reached to this heights with the support of all the help provided by the successive state governments. He should not forget this fact,” said Rajeeve. The CM has convened a high-level meeting on Monday to discuss the issues raised by Jacob.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-ensures-that-innovative-industries-thrive-here-cm/articleshow/84125196.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Differences within Uttarakhand state BJP unit, upcoming assembly polls biggest challenges before Pushkar Dhami||DEHRADUN: The new chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, is unlikely to get a honeymoon period due to the several hurdles in front of him. The BJP, at present, is an extremely divided house with some of the cabinet ministers, who were eying the top post, upset with the party leadership for appointing a young MLA as the CM. Bhagirath Sharma, a political analyst, told TOI, “With very little time left for the next polls, he will have to take along the experienced voices in the party. The simmering dissent among some party MLAs might pose some problems for him and he will need to manage the differences to ensure the party’s win in the assembly polls.” Before the oath ceremony, CM Dhami went to the residence of Satpal Maharaj, who was one of the frontrunners for the top post. Dhami is believed to have persuaded Maharaj to join his cabinet. Significantly, senior state leaders have their factions within the party and taking everyone along will be the biggest challenge for Dhami, especially when the assembly elections are just seven-eight months away. “Yes, it is not going to be an easy ride for Pushkar Singh Dhami, considering the dissatisfaction of a few party MLAs with his appointment. He must take everyone along, especially the veteran party leaders,” said a BJP leader privy to the developments. Additionally, experts believe that Dhami may also have a difficult time dealing with issues like protests against the Char Dham Devasthanam Board. Anoop Nautiyal, the founder of social organisation Social Development for Communities Foundation, believes that managing bureaucracy, bring all senior party leaders on board, altering the negative public perception on frequent change of guard will be the biggest challenges for Dhami.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/differences-within-state-bjp-unit-upcoming-assembly-polls-biggest-challenges-before-dhami/articleshow/84123100.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Innovation to make eye surgeries easier||AHMEDABAD: A city-based couple along with their colleagues were granted a patent for their forceps for iris claw lenses by the Patent Office of the Government of India on July 2. The innovation will help eye surgeons during complicated cataract surgeries. The patent has been granted to Dr Deepika Singhal, her husband Dr Deepak Saxena, Nazli Khatib and Shilpa Gaidhane. The researchers said that the intraocular lens (IOL) implant is one of the most common eye surgeries. But in the cases where the patients don’t have back support due to aphakia (absence of lens in the eye), it becomes difficult for the surgeon. “In such cases, the surgeons use the iris claw lens, which has an advantage — it can be fixated to the iris without sutures because the peripheral iris is incarcerated between the claws,” said Dr Singhal, professor and head of ophthalmology, GMERS Sola. The process requires a lot of manoeuvrers with ophthalmic forceps. The forceps used currently posed some challenges in holding the lens and fixing it appropriately. Thus, the team at the department of ophthalmology, GMERS Sola, started working on a design better suited for the purpose. Their aim was to develop an instrument that can lead to minimum damage and ease of the process of surgery with better outcomes. They also got support from the Innovation Centre at Dutta Meghe Institute of Medical Science. The design was further calibrated at a firm in Gandhinagar whereas IIPH-G, where Dr Saxena is a professor, helped design the protocols. “We followed the testing procedure in 50 patients who underwent surgery with this forceps. The results were observed independently,” said Dr Aneri Shah from the department of ophthalmology at GMERS Sola. “After ensuring the success and taking suggestions from colleagues at various ophthalmic institutions, the instrument was formally submitted for patent.” The team has also applied for an international patent. The department has already won NEWGEN grant and is currently developing innovative technology solutions for keratoconus. The department officials said that another faculty member, Dr Vaishali Prajapati, is working closely with a Japan-based university and M&J Institute of Ophthalmology for the management of amblyopia (lazy eye or abnormal visual development).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/innovation-to-make-eye-surgeries-easier/articleshow/84127441.cms||Parth Shastri

However, many of them were told to take a token and try their luck in the next two days. As the priority is given to those above 45, people below 45 were turned away if they approached the centres early. “I have been trying for the past one week at the Corporation Elango Boy’s Higher Secondary School from as early as 6am, but I was unlucky,” said S Shanmugapriya, 32, a working woman. All the urban PHCs have started issuing tokens asking people visit to see whether slots are available, as they are distributing the vaccines equally among the PHCs to ensure that the entire city gets covered. Vaccines are not available when they come after 10am, said a PHC staff. The nodal officer for the vaccination, Dr Pon Parthiban, said the 18-plus age group was not being vaccinated at the UPHCs. “We get to know about the status of vaccine availability only in the evening,” he said. As many as 9,340 doses were available with the PHCs on Sunday, and just 20 with the GRH. Other government hospitals had 250 doses. About 6,04,738 people have been vaccinated in the district, with a little less than one lakh having received both doses. The Meenakshi Mission Hospital has started administering Sputnik V vaccines. It is available for Rs 1,145 per dose and the hospital administration has said that there is no need for registrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vaccine-shortage-continues-in-madurai-uphcs-distribute-tokens/articleshow/84123101.cms||---

The first such re-structuring of the English language and literature syllabus and that of Indian languages has been announced on the Council’s website. A circular has been sent to the respective principals asking them to check the changes made and teach children accordingly. This has been done keeping the pandemic situation in mind since physical teaching-learning is suspended and the online mode is on. “Schools continue to struggle to cope with the disruption in educational activities brought about due to extended lockdowns in the country. In addition to a significant loss of instructional hours, teaching-learning processes have also been impacted due to various alternate modes of syllabus transaction that needed to be adopted due to closure of schools,” the circular said, citing this as the reason behind the Council’s decision to revise the syllabus. The circular says that the revised syllabus of other subjects will also be announced shortly. The reduction has been done in such a way that the quality of the academic intent will not be compromised while helping students to cope. The reduced English literature syllabus for ICSE will now have just three Acts from Merchant of Venice, four poems, and four short stories. Similarly, in ISC there will be just three Acts from The Tempest, five poems, and five short stories. “Reduction will take the load off students but there is no denying that their understanding and appreciation of literature will remain incomplete,” a principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cisce-reviews-syllabus-to-reduce-load-for-22-icse-isc/articleshow/84131685.cms||---

Out of the Rs 45 crore, Rs 22 crore was spent during the first wave and remaining Rs 23 crore during the second. But during the second wave, the civic body had used the infrastructure created during the first wave, thus reducing the expenses. An NMC official said they need to create medical infrastructure for treatment of paediatric patients along with enhancement of oxygen beds ahead of the third wave of the pandemic. Moreover, two operation theatres to conduct surgeries of patients suffering from mucormycosis are to be set up at Bytco and Zakir Hussain hospitals. The NMC has asked the state government to provide the funds to tackle the third wave effectively. Nashik city registered the first Covid positive patient from Govind Nagar area of the city on April 5 last year and the first Covid death was reported on May 5 last year. The city, during the first wave, recorded a total of 80,717 Covid patients out of which 1,039 have succumbed to the infection. But the second wave was worse during which the city registered 1.46 lakh cases and 2,846 deaths. Considering that there will be more need for oxygen during the third wave, NMC is adding around 1,200 oxygen beds. The NMC is upgrading two Covid Care Centres (CCCs) into Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) with all oxygen beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-seeks-rs-75cr-from-state-to-tackle-third-wave/articleshow/84121208.cms||Tushar Pawar

The main thoroughfares of the state capital are flooded with posters put up by the two rival groups. While posters put up by Paras faction invited people for a feast at the party headquarters on the occasion, those by Chirag’s supporters urged them to be present at ‘ashirvad yatra’ to be launched from Hajipur. What is noticeable is that Chirag is missing from the posters put up by the Paras group, while Paras and Prince Raj have not found place in the posters put up by Chirag’s supporters. Chirag-led faction’s state president Raju Tiwari said preparations for the main function to be held at Sultanpur village near Hajipur were completed. Tiwari said the decision to start the yatra was taken keeping in mind that Hajipur happened to be the ‘karma bhumi’ of late Ram Vilas Paswan, who nurtured his parliamentary constituency for several decades. On the other hand, the Paras faction has made elaborate arrangements for the senior leaders and workers at the state party office here. The party office has been decked up with colourful lights and a separate pandal has been erected on the premises. A senior functionary said arrangements have been made for over 20,000 people on the occasion. Paras was seen monitoring the preparations. “Whatever I have to say have already been made public,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ljp-factions-to-flex-muscles-today/articleshow/84123117.cms||Ramashankar

Petitioner M Manoharan was working as a head constable in Pettai police station when disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him in this regard. He submitted through his counsel that his wife was running a charitable institution and a function was organised to donate saris and dhotis to the needy in Thenpathu village. He accompanied his wife to the function and was not aware that it was organised by a political party. However, the authorities in their counter said that he participated in the meeting and delivered a speech even after coming to know that it was organized by a party. The petitioner was also felicitated at the meeting. Since the charges were proved, he was awarded punishment of reduction in time scale pay. When Manoharan filed a mercy petition, the authorities modified the punishment as postponement of increment for a year without cumulative effect. Since his second mercy petition was rejected, the petitioner moved HC Madurai bench in 2019, challenging the punishment orders. Justice V M Velumani observed that it is not the case of the authorities that the petitioner had arranged the meeting along with the political party. The petitioner, who is in uniformed service, participated in the meeting and inquiry officer held that charges are proved. Considering the materials in their entirety, the judge observed that the charges against the petitioner are proved which warrants punishment. However, taking into consideration the nature of charges against him, the judge modified the punishment to postponement of increment for six months without cumulative effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-modifies-punishment-for-cop/articleshow/84123167.cms||---

Many of these new centres have been established in various wards of corporators, who have come forward to speed up the vaccination drive in their wards. Many corporators have provided chairs and water for the beneficiaries coming to centres to get vaccine. A section of corporators have also sought the NMC administration to make a special queue for the elderly at the centres and priority must be given to them. Rajendra Trimbake, a senior official from the NMC’s health department, said corporators have provided spaces for vaccination in their wards. “Our objective is to administer vaccines to maximum beneficiaries as per the availability of vaccines,” he said. Shyam Badode, a BJP corporator from ward no 30, said he has provided a vehicle to ferry elderly citizens to the vaccination centre and bring them back home. It also for senior citizens from other parts of the city. “Earlier, there had been a scarcity of vaccines, but the supply of vaccines has improved to some extent during the last few days. Earlier, there was only one vaccination centre in my ward, but another two centres have been opened,” said Badode. Corporator Varsha Bhalerao said increasing the number of vaccination centres is a good initiative by the health department. “Earlier, city residents had to go to vaccination sites that were far from their homes. But the new centres in every ward will facilitate the beneficiaries. Some wards have two to three vaccination centres, while some have only one. Hence, more centres are needed,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/31-more-vaccination-centres-in-nashik-city/articleshow/84121217.cms||Tushar Pawar

Director of the NGO G R Sivakumar and his accomplice Matharshaw were caught by the Theni district police when they were fleeing to Kerala state on Saturday evening. They were brought to Madurai city at midnight. In order to avert the attention of the media the duo was taken to Koodalpudur police station instead of the Tallakulam police station to record their confession statement. DCP (law and order) P Thangadurai and Tallakulam range ACP conducted an inquiry with Sivakumar and Matharshaw on Sunday. Thangadurai told TOI they have checked all the four accounts in the name of trust and individuals. There was not much money left in the account. They will obtain the statements from the bank to check monetary transactions made by them. He said that since Sivakumar was a professional photographer, he used his skills to prepare fake documents to prepare Covid-19 death certificate for the children. Matharshaw was the one who filled it using a pen. “They told us that they sold the baby to provide them better care as their mothers were not in a position to raise them. But they knew the consequences of the crime. Both of them were involved in negotiation of money with the parents,” Thangadurai said. Police sources said that Kalaivani, in-charge of the shelter home, Sivakumar and Matharshaw shared the money they got through child sales. They have already spent the money they got. Police sources added that they started running fearing police arrest after the child trafficking incident started to unravel on Tuesday night. They went to Chennai by taking the circuitous route via East Coast Road after reaching Ramanathapuram. They tried to get some help in Chennai to stay safely there. As they did not get any help, they kept on moving. They visited various places including Krishnagiri, Thada, Bengaluru, Mysuru and Coimbatore before going to Theni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/illegal-adoption-key-accused-not-involved-in-other-cases-say-police/articleshow/84123194.cms||V Devanathan

The race, however, was not the only instance of its kind in the recent past. The Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling that bans bullock cart races and the Covid-19 restrictions since March last year are no deterrents for people in the villages of Ambegaon, Shirur, Junnar and Khed talukas in Pune district. they hold clandestine gatherings and organize bullock cart races. Pune rural superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said 22 organisers have so far been held this year. “Similar arrests were made during the previous two years and, in some cases, notices were issued to the organisers,” he said. Deshmukh said, “Earlier, people from the entire village would gather for the bullock cart race featuring multiple participants and multiple races, besides spectators from villages around the hosts. Now, bullock cart races are organised surreptitiously with barely 200 to 250 people and five to six participants. The villagers do not even call people from neighbouring villages. Our police teams rely on local intelligence and are thwarting these races. All the 15 cases this year were registered on the spot.” Manilal Valliyate, a veterinarian and CEO of the Indian branch of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), said, “We have been receiving numerous complaints about illegal bullock cart races scheduled to take place in different parts of the state and we were successful in working with the district police to stop many cruel spectacles from going ahead.” The Supreme Court in its 2014 judgment has made clear that bullock cart races are illegal and there’s no place in a civilised society for beating bulls with sticks, administering electric shocks with a live wire, chewing their tails, and breaking their tail bones to force them to run, he said. ‘Bullocks already have a hard life without the additional torment of being forced to race,” he added. Valliyate said PETA India in September 2017 filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking its direction to strike down the state law that aim to legalise bullock cart races and the plea will be heard by a constitutional bench. Farmers and political leaders, like Amol Kolhe, the Nationalist Congress Party’s MP from Shirur Lok Sabha seat, have been consistently speaking in favour of reviving bullock cart races. “I support bullock cart races, but I am against ill-treatment of the animals. I have repeatedly requested animal right activists and other officials to visit farmers and stay with them to observe how the bulls are loved by the farmers,” Kolhe told TOI on Sunday. He said he respected the feelings of animal right activists but it was equally important to develop an economic model of bullock cart races which help farmers to prosper. “Khilar is a beautiful breed but since the races are banned, the male population of this cattle has seen a sharp decline, which has been reported in the cattle census. I am waiting for the outcome of my discussion on the issue with different authorities. We hope that the ban will be lifted soon. Till then, I have appealed to the farmers not to conduct such races,” he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bullock-cart-racing-on-despite-ban-curbs/articleshow/84125225.cms||---

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, Eastern Zone, will be uploading its project details on its portal in the next few days, IRCTC (east) group general manager Debashis Chandra said. “For the first time, we are linking hilsa with tourism. Depending on the response we might have bigger plans with ‘ilish’,” quipped Chandra. The project, that will be launched in July-end, will be on till September when the monsoon bids adieu. The Indian Railways subsidiary, which organizes tours to major destinations across the country, is now foraying into day-trips or tailor-made family bubble trips around the “hilsa” theme. Priced at a moderate Rs 2,500, one can opt for either Kolaghat or Diamond Harbour, the two hilsa fishing destinations. “We are tying up with two leading hotels — one on the banks of Rupnarayan for Kolaghat and another on the banks of the Ganga for Diamond Harbour,” said Chandra. The day-trip will happen mostly on Sundays, tailored for individual families as well, in case one is reluctant to travel with groups. It will include morning pick-up and evening drop. Clients will be served breakfast, lunch and evening tea. “The highlights of the package include the stopover at a hotel or resort for a sumptuous lunch, with three hilsa dishes, a trip around the hilsa fishing site and then back to the city. We will ensure that the best quality hilsa is served. Though the lunch will be prepared by the hotel, our staff will be there for support and insight, so that premium hilsa delicacies are dished out,” Chandra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/irctcs-hilsa-tourism-on-monsoon-platter/articleshow/84125214.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The vaccination drive is being carried out on priority for the physically disabled, as they may not be able to move around without assistance. “We have asked the health teams to visit the villages and inform the people about the campaign in advance and then conduct the campaign so that beneficiaries above the age of 18 years can get vaccinated in their village,” said medical officer Mohan Bachchhav of Sinnar taluka. The move is to ensure the vaccination of the physically disabled is done easily as they are not just likely to be affected by Covid but also, some of their immunity is compromised due to prolonged medication. According to the officer, the vaccination is carried out at the primary health centres and the gram panchayats depending on the numbers of the registered people. “At times, when there are very few people in a village, but the number is high in the neighbouring village, we club such villages. The health teams first carry out the awareness among the beneficiaries and ask them to come to the pre-decided spot for the vaccination. The registration is also carried out by the health teams,” he said. In Sinnar town, 119 beneficiaries were vaccinated recently. Similarly, vaccination was also carried out in the PHC in Pandurli village. He said there were over 900 disabled people across the taluka. “We have planned to complete the first dose of vaccine for all the beneficiaries in a month,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/physically-disabled-gets-vax-in-sinnar/articleshow/84121226.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Prior to his death, Sapte had also shot a video claiming harassment by a labour union leader and others, who have also been booked in the case but have not yet been arrested. Assistant inspector Anil Lohar of the Wakad police told TOI, “We have found a note, purportedly written by Sapte, which mentions names of four persons, including that of Thakare.” For now, the police have registered a case under sections 384, 385, 386, 387 (all related to extortion), 306 (abetment of suicide), 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 120-B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Lohar said Sapte mentioned in the suicide note that the suspects were harassing him for the past three years. “Sapte narrated in the note that his business partner had duped him of over Rs1 crore,” Lohar said. Sapte also stated that the labour union leader and three others had threatened to kill him and had demanded Rs10 lakh and Rs1 lakh for each and every project of his. They had threatened him that they would not allow workers to join his projects otherwise. “Sapte’s note mentioned that they had already forced him to pay Rs2.5 lakh,” Lohar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biz-partner-held-on-charge-of-abetting-art-directors-death/articleshow/84125250.cms||---

Along with the drop in active cases to about one-fourth, the number of fresh Covid cases has also reduced to 230 per day from 700 during the same period. “After the first week of June, the state government announced relaxations in the restrictions and helped open up trade and business, though on a limited scale. But the numbers have reduced, which is a good indication,” said Dr Anant Pawar, the nodal officer for emergency operation centre of civil hospital. The number of patients recovering was more than the number of new cases till June 21, after which the fresh cases increased marginally for about seven days. “Now the number of the fresh cases is again reducing and the number of patients recovering is more. But the difference is narrow and hence it would be difficult to comment on the current phase,” he said. The slight rise in the cases during June end was witnessed both in the rural and the city areas. The cases in the rural areas have started reducing as against cases in the Nashik city. “The rise is marginal. We are observing the trend minutely. Though it is not worrisome at this point, we have asked the health teams to be vigilant and sensitive about the rise in the cases next week. We expect the cases to fall,” said Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical officer of the civic body. Rise in deaths in rural areas There has been an increase in the number of Covid deaths in Nashik rural. While the health authorities reported about four deaths per day on average in the past week, the authorities registered 12 deaths on July 3. Pawar said the deceased include the elderly and those with comorbidity, who were in critical condition for more than 25 to 30 days||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-district-more-than-70-drop-in-active-patients/articleshow/84121254.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Sunday saw 164 new infections and a case positivity rate of 3.6 percent. Goa is among 586 districts that reported a weekly district- wise test positivity rate of below five percent between June 27 and July 3. The weekly test positivity rate for South Goa was 4.9 percent and for North Goa, 4.58 percent. Of the positive cases, 71 percent in South Goa and 58 percent in North Goa were detected using rapid antigen tests (RAT) while 29 percent in south Goa and 42 percent in north Goa were detected through RT-PCR testing. However, four persons succumbed to Covid-19 over the past 24 hours — three at GMC and one at the Valpoi health centre. All the four deceased were between the age group 52-62. A 52-year-old man from Sattari with no comorbid conditions died of Covid pneumonia within 30 minutes of reaching the Valpoi health centre. He was tested for Covid after he reached the hospital. Another 52-year old man from Valpoi with diabetes, hypertension and cirrhosis passed away at GMC after four days of hospitalisation. He tested positive on June 30 and had complained of symptoms eight days prior. In another case, a 54-year-old woman from Sawantwadi with diabetes and hypertension also succumbed to Covid pneumonia at GMC after 10 days of hospitalisation. She was tested for Covid four days after hospitalisation and complained of symptoms 11 days prior to being admitted. A 62-year-old man with hypertension from Pernem died a day after hospitalisation at GMC. He had tested positive on June 18 and complained of symptoms 20 days prior. The state’s current count of active cases stands at 2,087, similar to the situation seen in the first week of April. Fifteen persons were hospitalised over the past 24 hours and 20 were discharged.

---||Kochi||Kerala: T-shaped groynes mooted for Chellanam||KOCHI: With the state government conducting a detailed study to find a permanent solution to the sea erosion in Chellanam, a team of researchers, naval architects, shipbuilders and people working in the field of sustainable development came up with a new idea. They propose to build T-shaped groynes using a floating structure which can prevent seashore erosion and wave-related destruction of the coastal area and at the same time harness energy using waves. The Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (Kufos) has been inviting opinions and suggestions for the Model Fishing Project to be implemented at Chellanam. The objective is to create a hybrid technological solution for the protection of seashore and generate energy in the selected sites. Kufos will be adding the proposal in its fishing village interim report to be submitted before the state government. Santhosh Thannikat, a responsible-tourism consultant and the coordinator of the team, said that seawalls, groynes using stones / concrete tetrapods, offshore breakwater barrier, geotubes and other solutions have failed and drained a lot of public money from the treasury. “Most of those man-made solutions are environmentally hazardous and not sustainable,” he said. The team proposes to make a T-shaped groyne using stainless steel and it will be jetting out from the coastline into the sea up to 200m. It is fixed on the seashore and also anchored in the sea. The T end, which has a width of 50 to 100m, will have a power generator that can harness power from any of the sources or combined sources — wave, tide, current, air / buoyancy, ballast water pressure or wind. “Our objective is to make a steel T-shaped groyne at a cost similar to that of a stone / concrete based T-Shaped groyne, serving the same purpose,” Thannikat said. Other team members include Anantha Subramanian, retired faculty of IIT Madras, naval architect Sandith Thandashery, Hatch Marine Consultants founder Ruchi Kalra, geo-data collection specialist Jagadish Vallarampara, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/t-shaped-groynes-mooted-for-chellanam/articleshow/84125249.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: From cabbie to mask producer, man survives all amid pandemic||PUNE: Kailas Autade’s struggle to sustain himself and his family began last year. The Covid-19 pandemic took away his avenues of income one after another. After over a year, he can finally breathe easy with his latest venture of the mask-manufacturing unit. “Aap keh sakte hain ki ek sahara mil gaya hain ab! (you can say, I have got something to hold onto),” the 37-year-old Sinhagad resident told TOI when asked for an update aboutlivelihood. Autade had a fairly comfortable life as a private cab driver and earned decent money to support his family — wife and two children — until the pandemic struck. Compelled by the situation, like many others, he turned vegetable vendor. He soon found out that earning decent money was tough due to fierce competition. He then started selling masks at a petrol pump. Then came the second wave and he was told that he could no longer stand at a petrol pump. “I was selling masks until March this year. As soon as I was ‘jobless’ again, I started to think as to what I can do,” Autade said. “Selling masks had helped me to know people involved in a mask manufacturing business. I was contemplating an idea of setting up a manufacturing unit and with the help of a friend, who was ready to help and be a partner,” Autade told TOI. “We can’t say everything is fine now but it is definitely a start. All of us learnt the art of making masks with the help of the internet (YouTube) as well by interacting with other manufactures and wholesalers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/from-cabbie-to-mask-producer-man-survives-all-amid-pandemic/articleshow/84125295.cms||Joy Sengupta

However, once we heard about the Deccan Express having the Vistadome coach, the plan changed and we travelled on the coach to and from Mumbai. It was a unique experience, something which we had not experienced ever,” Marathe, a working professional told TOI. Since services were resumed from June 26, the state-of-the-art Vistadome coach has been fully occupied on most days with many passengers shuttling between the two cities just for the experience. Railway officials said that the response has been overwhelming with almost all seats booked since operations began. “The response has been very good and we hope that it continues. All 44 seats of the coach have been fully occupied, both from Mumbai to Pune and vice versa on almost all days,” Pune rail division’s public relation officer Manoj Jhawar told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vistadome-coach-on-deccan-exp-brings-big-bookings-for-railways/articleshow/84125287.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Rewards for youth after he reports a bug in program||PUNE: When Solapur resident Mayur Fartade joined computer engineering in 2017 in a Kolhapur college, he was daunted by the subject. Coming from a semi-English, rural school, his knowledge of computers was limited and at first he felt it was beyond his scope. But, soon programming started to make sense to him. Fartade used the time at home during the lockdown to learn new programming languages which led him to the Bug Bounty Hunt program launched by Facebook encouraging people to find computer bugs. After almost a month of intensive research and testing, Fartade found a bug causing a privacy issue in the profiles of Instagram users. He reported it to Facebook and was rewarded with Rs 22 lakh for his effort. The success opened many doors for Fartade and he has a flood of job offers on his Linkedin profile. But he has picked one which offers Rs 4.5 lakh per annum from a company in Pune as it is in his area of interest. “I scored 74% in HSC and not very well in the Common Entrance Test. I enrolled in Tatyasaheb Kore Institute of Engineering and Technology for computer science engineering. My initial nervousness about the subject gave way to confidence. I discovered bugs in two Union government websites which would have made hacking them easy in my second year. I mailed this information to the website and they sent back an acknowledgement,” Fartade said. While working on the internet, he accidentally came across Facebook’s Bug Bounty Program. “I am an avid Instagram user, and decided to check it for bugs. I found nothing even after two weeks. I read blogs about such programs and started testing the applications for another two weeks before I found the bug,” Fartade said. He sent the report to Facebook on April 16 and three days later Facebook’s security team sought more information which he sent the same day. It happened two more times and finally on June 15, he received an email stating that he was being awarded a bounty of $30,000. “I expected Rs one lakh or may be Rs two lakh, but this amount is unexpected. I gave it to my parents. There are job offers on LinkedIn but none in the areas that I want to explore. The offer from the Pune company suits me. My dream is to be a developer for one of the top IT firms,” he said. His father works in a sugar factory, his mother is a homemaker while his elder brother has completed ITI and works in the industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rewards-for-youth-after-he-reports-a-bug-in-program/articleshow/84125323.cms||Ardhra Nair

They killed him by strangling. Then tried to burn the body, and later threw the half-burnt mutilated body parts in a canal. After that, they had joined the search for the missing boy. Case details reveal that the incident happened on September 26, 2018. In the wee hours on that day, the accused Jyotsna Patel and her husband’s younger brother, Ramesh Patel, were having sex at their home in Jalampura village in Viramgam taluka of Ahmedabad district. At that time, Jyotsna’s five-year-old son Hardik happened to see them in compromised position and the accused also spotted the kid looking at them. Then and there, they decided to kill the child to keep the truth of their relationship concealed. Jyotsna picked up her son in her lap and left towards cotton crop fields with her brother-in-law. They reached a field, ensured that there was nobody around. Then, Jyotsna pressed her child’s mouth and strangled him, while Ramesh held his hands so he couldn’t escape. After a couple of minutes, Hardik died. Ramesh collected some wood of a babool tree, bushes of cotton crops, set them on fire and put the child’s body in the makeshift pyre. As the body was taking long to burn, he decided to dispose of the remains of the body later, and rushed to town for his daily wages. During late evening on September 28, 2018, they began acting as if the kid was missing and they were worried as he did not return home. On September 29, Ramesh went to the place where he’d buried the body, dug it up, and threw it in a canal. Villagers too joined the search operation and approached cops who registered a case and had been searching for the missing kid since September 30, 2019. “Even after searching for him and inquiring with almost every villager, cops did not get any lead in the case for a long time,” said Anti-human trafficking wing PI, Umesh Dhakhhda. Later, Ramesh moved to Bharuch without any reason due to which a needle of suspicion moved towards him. “We called him in for recording his statement and we found variations in his statement. Meanwhile, we also began questioning Jyotsna and found some discrepancies in her account as well,” said Dhakhda. When cops questioned them strictly, the duo broke down and confessed their crime saying that it was the only way they thought they could avoid embarrassment and to continue their relationship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/5-year-old-boy-killed-by-mother-and-uncle/articleshow/84125363.cms||---

Employed with the enforcement wing of civil supplies department in Mahabubnagar, Maachana has been spreading awareness about the adverse effects of smoking and consumption of tobacco. “My friend Deeksihtutlu was addicted to chewing tobacco and smoking when I was in college. He helped me a lot while pursuing higher education. However, the evil habit of tobacco consumption took away his life. It was after his death that I realised that more people should be made aware of the ill effects of this habit,” said Maachana. For the last two decades, he has spent hours counselling people, shadowing them to help them quit smoking. Whenever he spots people smoking and chewing tobacco, he engages with them in a conversation and explains to them the ill effects of the habit. “Many people told me to quit smoking, but their words never had any impact on me. But, it was different when Raghunandhan sir suggested the same. He knows how to convince people and keeps in touch with them so that they don’t start smoking again,” said Srikanth A, a government employee, who had quit smoking about a month ago. He said that he started smoking at the age of 22 and continued for almost a decade. “Neither my parents, wife, or kids could make me quit smoking. But they are all happy that I stopped smoking now,” he added. Seconding what Srikanth said, Balaji J, who quit smoking about 8 months ago, said that he now buys fruit or biscuits for his child with the money he usually spends on buying tobacco products. “Raghunandhan sir always used to suggest buying fruit instead of spending money on cigarettes or gutkha. That’s what I am doing now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dy-tahsildar-convinces-addicts-to-quit-tobacco/articleshow/84128991.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Watermelon seeds to cement concrete structures, heal cracks||NAGPUR: Watermelon seeds, known only for its nutrient qualities until now, can also be used to strengthen and heal concrete structures, thanks to a new technique developed by a team of civil engineering researchers at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT). Led by associate professor Madhumati Latkar, the researchers proved that biocementation using watermelon seeds can strengthen and heal concrete structures in cost-effective and eco-friendly manner. Following the study, a patent has been granted by Indian Patent Office to principal investigator Latkar and her team. The research was carried out in view of the increased demand of durable building materials and need for efficient techniques to augment the physio-mechanical properties of cementitious materials. “Durability of structures is a prime issue, and large amount of money has already been invested in it. Presently, a number of chemical admixtures are used for crack healing as well as to increase durability of structures. Using chemical admixtures has many drawbacks such as high cost and environmental pollution,” said Latkar. The team has been working for about last six years in the area of biocementation to find out several innovative ways to strengthen and heal cement-based materials. The researchers claim biocementation using watermelon seeds is the best environment-friendly and economically feasible approach to ameliorate strength of structures, and also a best solution for crack healing of structures. One of the well-known researchers in the area of biocementation, Latkar has published several research articles in esteemed international journals and has four patents to her credit. “Watermelon seeds are magic beans when it comes to imparting strength to cementitious materials,” she said. The watermelon seeds are innately rich in an enzyme called urease. This enzyme is the key player in the biocementation process, causing strength enhancement of cementitious materials. Snigdha Bhutange, a team member, performed multiple experiments to establish statistical reliability of the work. Tapan Chakrabarti, former director, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), Nagpur, and former chair professor (MPCB), VNIT, Nagpur, mentored the team. Latkar reported around 22% increment in compressive strength and 19% reduction in water absorption, in seeds’ blended concrete specimens as compared to conventional concrete. The biocemented concrete also qualified various durability tests, and in fact proved to be significantly more durable than conventional concrete. This technology has also been proved to be excellent in concrete crack healing. Info Bonding With The Magic Beans * Traditional biocementation techniques involve use of ureolytic bacteria * Factors such as involvement of bacteria, nutritional requirements to grow the bacteria and experts’ supervision to achieve the purpose may limit the on-site application of biocementation using bacteria * Use of powdered seeds instead of bacteria as a source of urease eliminates all these disadvantages * It reduces overall cost, as it does not require special supervision or maintenance like required for ureolytic bacteria * Storage and maintenance of seeds is much easier than that of bacteria, thus making the process practicable * Watermelon seeds, which are of inferior quality and regarded as waste material, can be effectively used for biocementation purpose to make the process practicable and economical * Laboratory scale studies have shown excellent results in both strength enhancement as well as crack healing of concrete using this technology *On-field validation of this technology is initiated. Once the field applicability is established, the technique would certainly prove to be a major tool in achieving sustainable development||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/watermelon-seeds-to-cement-concrete-structures-heal-cracks/articleshow/84127556.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Vaccination for people without ID cards will also be held this week in South Goa. In North Goa, around 1,000 persons without ID cards have received their first doses at Panaji and Assagao. The sessions for this category of people are being held after the collector assessed the number of persons in the area. The sessions however are not open to foreign nationals other than that of Nepal. A total of 10,927 persons were vaccinated on Sunday, over 70% of whom got their first dose. In Goa over 6,000 persons in the 18-44 age group have been fully vaccinated while 3.7 lakh have received their first doses till date. A total of 1.29 lakh persons in the state are fully vaccinated which is around 12% of the eligible 11 lakh-odd population. Another 65% of the eligible population have taken the first dose. The state plans on administering its entire population with the first dose by July 31. The ministry of health and family welfare has stated that there are no scientific evidence suggesting that the Covid-19 vaccination causes infertility in men and women. All vaccines and their constituents are tested first on animals and later in humans to assess any side effects, the ministry has stated. National expert group on vaccine administration has recommended Covid-19 vaccination for all lactating women as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vaccination-for-pregnant-women-to-start-soon/articleshow/84127606.cms||---

Although, some minor work is still underway. The stretch is not yet ‘formally’ inaugurated. However, on Wednesday it had already seen vehicular movement. In the background, a political tug of war is already brewing. Opposition leaders from Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena ‘symbolically’ inaugurated the infrastructure citing inconvenience caused to the commuters.  The BJP leaders alleged that the opposition was trying to hog the credit eyeing the civic elections next year. “We received many complaints from citizens of inconvenience caused due to stalled opening of the infrastructure. Hence, keeping citizens’ convenience in mind, we decided to go ahead with the inauguration,” Sanjog Waghere, NCP’s Pimpri Chinchwad city president, told TOI. Waghere further added, “The road which connects Yamunanagar and Pradhikaran should have been opened to the public at least three weeks ago. BJP is delaying it for minor reasons. Now, we will ensure that it remains open to commuting, no matter what.” BJP claimed that the opposition wanted credit for the project. “We gave a green signal to this project but the opposition wants to take all the credit. We are waiting for the completion of minor pending work before opening it to the public,” Namdev Dhake, BJP house leader reacted to the symbolic inauguration. PCMC’s mayor Usha Dhore, also from BJP, said, “We wish to inaugurate the infrastructure at the hands of former CM Davendra Fadnavis and waiting for confirmation about his availability.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rotary-traffic-and-grade-separator-awaits-opening/articleshow/84125377.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The document, which will be subjected to a series of consultative processes in the coming days before finalization, shows that the total area of green space available in the city is roughly about 2.2sq km. This accounts for only 0.01% of the total land use. The per capita availability of green spaces in Thiruvananthapuram is just 2.23sq m and is way below 10-12sq m/person, the standards set according to urban and regional development plans formulation and implementation (URDPFI) guidelines issued by ministry of housing and urban affairs. The document notes that with the development of the city, unorganized green spaces are being converted into built-up area. “Much of the green spaces that the city was once proud of have been lost in the mindless pursuit of urbanization,” the document notes. The draft plan says that planned green spaces are lacking in the city, except for museum and zoo compounds, Veli and Akkulam. The draft plan takes note of Vellayambalam-Kowdiar road as a model road that incorporates environmental aspects. “This road with a good driveway, lowered footpath with trees providing ample shade shows how greenery can be added on roadsides,” the document notes. It also mentions traffic parks near major junctions which significantly contribute to the city’s landscape. The guidelines note that open spaces include three main categories — recreational space, organized green and other common spaces (such as vacant lands/open spaces, including flood plains, forest cover, etc). The organized green is spread across housing clusters, neighbourhoods, communities, district and sub-city centre.

---||Hyderabad||2 from AP move T HC over hydel power order||Hyderabad: Two farmers from Andhra Pradesh on Sunday approached the Telangana high court challenging GO Rt No 34 issued by the Telangana energy department’s principal secretary on June 28, 2021, asking TS Genco to generate hydel power in the state to 100% of their installed capacity. Petitioners Gudavalli Siva Ramakrishna Prasad and Murala Venkatappaiah contended that they derive water from the Krishna delta to meet the irrigation needs of their fields in Gannavaram and Guddur mandals in the Krishna district, but the action of Telangana would adversely affect their irrigation water needs, they said. Telangana has to raise a demand before the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) conveying its intent to use water at hydel projects. But the unilateral issuance of the GO asking Genco to make hydel power stations work at full capacity was contrary to the AP Reorganization Act, the agreements between both states, and the norms of the Krishna and Godavari river tribunals, they said, while urging the court to set aside the GO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-from-ap-move-t-hc-over-hydel-power-order/articleshow/84128184.cms||---

The walkathon dubbed ‘Hyderabad to Huzurabad for Democratic Telangana’ was announced by Sanjay during the state executive meeting here on Sunday. The walkathon will begin on ‘Quit India Movement’ anniversary on August 9 from Bhagyalakshmi temple at Charminar in the Old City and conclude on October 2, Mahatma Gandhi Jayanthi, in Huzurabad. Announcing the decision, Bandi Sanjay said during the walkathon he would try to interact with people, know their issues and concerns and expose the failure of the TRS regime. “I will also explain to people about the administration of BJP-led NDA government, we will explain what BJP will do for Telangana, if voted to power” he said. The walkathon would continue for 55 days in the first phase, covering 755 km , on an average of 15 to 20 km a day. Talking about the current water dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, he said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had signed for only 259 TMC water during the apex council meeting. “He is now alleging that AP is building projects illegally on Krishna river, it is ridiculous, all this is being done to take political advantage. CM now wants water in 50: 50 ratio. How can this be possible,” he said. The CM even deferred two meetings of the apex council by colluding with AP, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sanjays-walkathon-to-start-on-aug-9/articleshow/84128005.cms||---

Also, CM KCR should stop seeking postponement of KRMB meeting and instead attend it to ensure that the river water interests of Telangana were protected. “KCR claims of being an expert on river waters. In such a case, he should attend the meeting, likely to be held on July 9, and strongly put forward the stand of Telangana on river water issue,” Revanth said. “It is a KCR-friendly government at the Centre. The TRS MPs had supported Modi government on GST and demonetisation. What is stopping KCR from meeting Modi on river water issue?,” asked Revanth.

---||Pune||Amitabh Bachchan lookalike lifts patients’ spirits during hard times||PUNE: Videos of actor Amitabh Bachchan’s doppelganger have been trending as viewers are amazed at the performer’s uncanny resemblance to the former. The performer Shashikant Pedwal — a teacher at Industrial Training Institute, Aundh —has taken up the initiative of using his talent to lift the spirits of Covid patients. “When the second wave of the pandemic hit, everyone was pitching in to help out in any way they could. Some were providing food, some were helping raise funds, some were helping people get oxygen and beds. With focus on more urgent matters, there was hardly any attention to the patients’ mental wellbeing. I believed that motivation can go a long way to help them recover, and when my videos started trending on social media, I thought the best way I could help in the situation was to perform for Covid patients and boost their morale,” Pedwal said, adding that he took the idea for this initiative to a Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official, who approved and applauded his work. The teacher has attended video calls with 378 Covid patients and their families over the last three months as a part of his pro-bono initiative. “Friends and family members of the patients get in touch with me to organize the call. I tell them to take their phones to the patients and ask them if they want to talk to the person on the line without telling them who it is and then I greet them in the typical Bachchan style. Patients sometimes think it is Amitabh Bachchan himself at first. Sometimes they ask me to say their favourite dialogues from his movies, sing a song, or even perform one of Harivansh Rai Bachchan’s poems,” he said. Pedwal said from senior citizens to teenagers, everybody is a fan of Amitabh Bachchan. “I get requests to perform from different eras of his career — from the 70s to his latest releases — according to the patient’s age and the movies they have seen or liked of the actor. I tell them to have courage and that I am with them through this difficult time. I encourage them to have strength and focus on being positive. I have got feedback from their families that this helps them feel better.” In instances where patients are in the hospital and do not have access to talk on video calls or are not in a condition to do so, Pedwal sends video messages to their relatives or doctors, who can show it to them to cheer them up. Before the pandemic, Pedwal had been visiting cancer patients in a hospital in Warje for a few years to cheer them up. “Since I was around 16, my friends started noticing and telling me how I resembled the actor. I started to consciously mould myself like the actor too while growing up. Some years ago, when I was invited to a function, people thought I was Amitabh Bachchan himself,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/actors-doppelganger-lifts-spirits-of-patients-in-the-city/articleshow/84125417.cms||Mandar Deshpande

The chief minister had made the promise of extending the scheme during the state election campaign in 2018. So far, only those aged 65 and above were eligible for the pension scheme. The move to reduce the minimum age for eligibility was made with a view to support more persons in their advanced years who are below the poverty line.

The accused were slapped with the stringent Gangster Act. Anil Kumar Mehrotra, one of the key accused, allegedly made fake arrear bills of lekhpals and conducted the fraud worth crores at the district treasury department. There were at least 12 others involved. Nine of them, including two ex-lekhpals, are still absconding. An FIR was registered against the 13 suspects at Civil Lines police station in 2018. SP (City) Amit Kumar Anand said, “Acting on a tip-off, raids were conducted by police teams. Four of the 13 accused, including the gang leader Anil Kumar Mehrotra who is a retired clerk, were arrested. The others are Mahindra Singh, Pravin Singh and Harish Giri. All are residents of Moradabad.” The "treasury fraud" at the collectorate had first come to light in 2018 following a suspicion in official chores by the then ADM (administration) Laxmi Sankar Singh who had ordered a secret probe in the matter. Inspector Gajendra Tyagi, who was part of the team involved in Saturday's raid, said, “After the crime came to light, FIR was registered under IPC sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).

After a series of bike theft cases were reported in Suryapet town, district SP R Bhaskaran formed three special team to solve the cases.  Police analysed CCTV footage near the crime scenes and, by working on the leads for four months, arrested eight members of an inter-state gang, including main accused Chall Prabhakar of Tallampadu village in Khammam. Apart from Prabhakar, police also arrested stolen bike receivers B Swamy, from Perika Singaram village, B Upender from Kusumanchi, U Sitaramulu and M Satish, both from Muthyalagudem, G Venkatesh from Chegomma village, J Chiranjeevi from Lokya Thanda and K Naveen from Mellepally village, all from Khammam district. Based on the confession of the accused, police recovered 40 bikes worth Rs 22 lakh from their possession. Among the recovered vehicles, 13 were stolen from Suryapet, five from Khammam, four from Kodad, one each from Hyderabad and Hanamkonda in Telangana, four from Nandigama, six from Jaggayyapet of Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh and details of the remaining vehicles were yet to be ascertained. During the interrogation, Prabhakar confessed that he had incurred loss in the fast food centre business at Kusumanchi. To overcome financial problems, Prabhakar started committing bike thefts from March 2021 on the advise of the other accused, mostly bike mechanics. Prabhakar mostly committed the offences alone and he used to travel to busy areas of the towns in bus with a helmet in the bag and commit theft of bikes during the day time in crowded areas to avoid easy identification by police through CCTV footage analysis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/8-of-inter-state-gang-held-40-bikes-seized/articleshow/84128140.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||18% of new projects in major cities are coming up in non-TP areas: GujRERA||AHMEDABAD: In an insightful document last week, Gujarat’s Real Estate Regulatory Authority (GujRERA) office claimed that 18% of all new building projects in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot are forced to come up in areas where there are no town planning schemes (TP). In tier-2 and tier-3 Gujarat cities like Ankleshwar, Bharuch, Junagadh and Navasari nearly 60% of newer developments are in non-TP areas. The non-TP areas lack planned network or roads, infrastructure and amenities. “In Ahmedabad, only 5% to 7% new housing and commercial projects are coming up in non-TP areas when compared to other three tier-1 cities,” said a senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official. The non-statutory document has suggested reforms in the existing town planning department and further flags that development demand in Gujarat’s cities has often outpaced the supply of planned and serviced land provided through TP scheme mechanism. GujRERA had teamed up with department of urban development and urban planning consultants to come up with three non-statutory manuals — Town planning schemes, Development plans and Local Area Plans (LAP) — and have uploaded them on their website. This is the first time that such an exercise has been carried out in the state. Among key recommendations, to reduce delays ahead of an intention of TP scheme, are including public consultation process where land owners and beneficiary are consulted before freezing land records with shape, size and ownership boundary. The concept paper has also added a stage for preparation of vision while preparing draft TP scheme. Among other major recommendations are that the state government appoint an expert review committee (ERC) which shall review and recommend approval of TP schemes submitted to the government at different stages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/18-of-new-projects-in-major-cities-are-coming-up-in-non-tp-areas-gujrera/articleshow/84125439.cms||---

Not just the Meerut Commissionary but small neighbouring towns like Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Hapur and Baghpat are facing unscheduled power outages even as temperatures hover over 42 degrees Celsius. On Thursday, seven areas in Meerut district faced an hour-long power outage. The power outages are so frequent that Arvind Mallappa Bangari, MD, Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), had to pay a surprise visit to sub-stations at midnight and transferred a junior engineer (JE) after the latter failed to give a concrete reason for the shut down. Fourteen districts --Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Gautambudh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Shamli, Bijnor, Moradabad, Sambhal, JP Nagar and Rampur -- fall under PVVNL. The average load of electricity in May was 4,212 MW. The load increased to 5,562 MW in June and since the last week of June, the demand has peaked between 7,500 and 8,000 MV. “As the power consumption almost doubled in the past one month, the PVVNL has resorted to unplanned power cuts of two hours each three times in my area on Monday which was reduced to an hour on Tuesday,” said Kishan Chand of Balwant Nagar here. Power cuts were also reported from outskirts and villages besides affecting industries. Following reports of frequent power outages, the MD of PVVNL has directed the JEs posted at the power station to keep a record of daily details of the reason for shutdowns. “I conducted a surprise inspection at Electricity Urban Distribution Board, Meerut under Shastri Nagar, Mohkampur, Rangoli, Ramlila Ground-1, Ramlila Ground-2 and Begumpool power station on Thursday and found that there were some unscheduled power cuts the reason of which couldn’t be explained by the JE. I have transferred the official immediately,`` Bangari told TOI. He added that the western UP is experiencing peak power consumption and the delayed monsoon has escalated the demand but one cannot cut power without a plan. Bangri also directed the executive engineer and officials at subdivision level to inspect power stations randomly, every four days, and that too, at night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/delayed-monsoon-causes-power-outages-in-western-up/articleshow/84121406.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Hyderabad||Farmers’ body calls for clearance of pending pension applications||HYDERABAD: An umbrella organisation of farmers’ associations, Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), has demanded the state government sanction pending pension applications. These applications also include those of widows of farmers who died by suicide. A right to information (RTI) reply from the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty revealed that around 1.9 lakh families have not received pensions under Aasara scheme for the last two years and that their applications are still pending. Most cases of pending pensions are from Nalgonda, Hyderabad, Khammam and Rangareddy districts and include the likes of widows, persons with disabilities, toddy tappers, weavers, beedi workers, single women, those diagnosed with HIV and filaria. Of them, widows (82,485 pending cases), old age pensioners (44,466) and persons with disabilities (39,356) were the largest groups in the wait. “Widows of farmers who applied for pensions have been waiting for help. These families are already in distress, and they have not got any other help so far. They have been waiting for the past two-and-half years. While compensation for suicide cases is still pending, widow pensions are also not being paid,” said RSV’s B Kondal Reddy. The government had allocated Rs 11,728 crore in the 2021-22 Budget for Aasara pension scheme. The pension amount, which used to be just Rs 200 in the undivided state, was hiked to Rs 2,016 after state formation. Currently around 40 lakh in the state are availing Aasara pensions. While the Centre provides Rs 200 per month for 6.6 lakh persons, the state government adds another Rs 1,816 to it. “The Covid-19 pandemic has only added to the woes of widows and old-aged persons. The number of applications are piling up. In some places, requests are taken and processing is done but no pensions are paid. In some mandals, no applications are taken hence there is no processing. The RTI was filed in February, the numbers would have gone up now,” said RSV’s Sree Harsha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-body-calls-for-clearance-of-pending-pension-applications/articleshow/84127916.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Experts have said that not all red eyes are mucormycosis cases and not all diabetics will be affected by the fungus. Consulting a doctor when in doubt is best, but only those with uncontrolled diabetes recovering from Covid-19 and have received steroid treatment or those who received oxygen through nasal masks, cannulas or were on ventilators are at high risk. Eye surgeon Jeevan Ladi of Dada Laser Eye Institute said, “It has been more than three months that patients are coming to us to rule out mucormycosis. Still, about 60% of the total patients I see have a sense of fear psychosis when they have red eyes. Even well-controlled diabetic patients are unduly and unnecessarily worried.” The marked increase in cases of Covid associated mucormycosis, the myths, and misconceptions spreading through social media are among fuelling anxiety. “We had seen a few mucormycosis cases in the first wave too. However, as the number of cases increased in the second wave, people have become more afraid. Misinformed social media messages have added to the fear psychosis. Many still visit us only to rule out black fungus,” eye surgeon Vardhmaan Kankariya of Asian Eye Hospital added. Older patients who are more worried about getting the fungal infection. “They want to rule out mucormycosis when they have complaints of a burning sensation, irritation or redness in eyes. However, in most cases, it has been the dry eye syndrome or allergy,” Kankariya said. Non-Covid patients t0o approach doctors to rule out the cause of their symptoms as mucormycosis. “There is a myth that mucormycosis is contagious, so non-Covid patients are always worried that they will get it from another Covid patient in their family or vicinity. Mucormycosis is not contagious,” Kankariya said. Eye surgeon Aditya Kelkar of National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO) said, “Various age groups complaining of white spots called pterygium (growth of pink, fleshy tissue on the conjunctiva), floaters, red eyes due to seasonal allergies rush to the OPD. The one thing weighing on their mind is to know that their symptom is not mucormycosis related. In some cases, patients do not want to get treated for the symptoms after they are clear that it is not mucormycosis.” This fear is driving even those with minor nasal tract oral infection to rush to doctors. There is an increased apprehension among people that their nasal stuffiness or one-sided headache or toothache is a warning sign of mucormycosis. “People are unnecessarily anxious. If an individual does not have diabetes or if the blood sugar is controlled, there is no need to panic,” oral surgeon J B Garde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/black-fungus-cases-down-but-anxiety-fuels-visits-to-doctors/articleshow/84125465.cms||Umesh Isalkar

After testing Covid-positive, the MLA made a Facebook post stating that he didn’t contract the virus earlier as he took homeopathy medicine which was distributed as immunity boosters. According to the MLA’s FB post, he was working among the public ever since the outbreak of the pandemic and he had done RT-PCR and antigen tests more than 15 times. Last week, he got his second jab of Covaxin. Also, he strongly believed that homeopathy preventive medicine had helped him avoid contracting the virus, despite all the exposure. The comment did not go down well with many people. “Dear comrade please understand homeo is a pseudo-science and it doesn’t work…Get well soon,” wrote Jose Stephen. Dr Unnikrishnan Bhaskaran Nair who works at Kerala health services commented, “Homeopathy is a treatment method without a scientific foundation and it is a pity that responsible and educated people like you (V K Prasanth) promote these kinds of unscientific methods.” Meanwhile, others rallied in support of the MLA against the negative comments. Rahul S G claimed that for the last 10 months not a single case of Covid-19 was reported in his friend’s ward (Thiruvali grama panchayat in Malappuram district) as they were given homeopathy preventive medicine. Reeja R stated that homeopathy medicine had saved her 80-year-old father who contracted Covid-19 but recovered without much complications. According to sources, the MLA’s opinion was purely based on his personal experience and he didn’t mean to pitch one against the other. He received his Covid-19 vaccination, and since he was always among the people, including health workers, he had the homeopathy preventive medicine too, his office informed. Meanwhile, the health condition of Prasanth, who is in quarantine, remains stable and he has shown mild symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-hit-mla-faces-flak-for-backing-homoeopathy/articleshow/84125488.cms||---

However, while transitioning to upper primary (classes VI-VIII), secondary and higher secondary, the enrolment in government schools is much higher. In terms of gender-wise distribution, the preferred option was sending girls to government schools and boys to private schools irrespective of the class. In pre-primary, 92,660 more students were enrolled in private schools. However, in the primary section (classes I-V), there were 42,995 more students in private schools. Educators said the number of students in the pre-primary section was more in private schools because most government schools began from Class I. UDISE+ showed that when students were admitted in Class I, 1,52,059 were from the same school, 1,48,831 from another school, and 30,993 from anganwadi centres. Interestingly, Delhi was one of the few states where enrolment in pre-primary classes was high. For a large state like Uttar Pradesh, only 8,840 students were enrolled in the pre-primary section, which is said to be important for imparting early childhood education, as enlisted by National Education Policy 2020. When students transitioned from primary (classes I-V) to upper primary (classes VI -VIII) and higher classes, the enrolment in government school surpassed that of private institutions. In classes IX-X, 2,57,434 more students were studying in government schools. In classes XI-XII, the gap narrowed with 1,26,786 more students in government schools. Explaining the phenomenon, AK Jha, principal of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8 Rohini, said, “In the primary section, parents admit children in small private schools as fees are lower. They think that putting children in private schools will strengthen their foundation. But as the children move forward, the fees increase and parents are not able to afford it. So, they move them to government schools for free education.” The different between the number of girls compared with boys in private schools was found to be more in higher classes. In classes XI-XII, 32,441 more boys were found studying in private schools. Similarly, in classes IX-X, 49,640 more boys were enrolled in private schools. Jha said, “The Indian mentality give a preference to boys. If a couple has two children, they will send the boy to a private school and the girl to a government school. For instance, government schools in the morning shift meant for girls may have around 3,000 students. In the evening shift meant for boys, the enrolment would be around 1,500.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-girls-sent-to-govt-schools-than-private-in-higher-classes/articleshow/84125539.cms||Shradha Chettri

Swiftly responding to a complaint lodged by the youth’s father, Bulandshahr police tracked down the location of the mobile phone used for making the ransom call and with the help of the Mumbai Police, they got Aman Singh, an Indian Police Service aspirant, and his two friends, who accompanied him to Mumbai earlier this week, freed from the abductors in Mumbai around 3 am. No arrest was, however, made in this connection, said police. Divulging details, senior superintendent of police Santosh Kumar Singh said Bulandshahr resident Lokman Singh had lodged a written complaint at New Mandi police station, stating that his son Aman was abducted in Mumbai and he had received a ransom call for Rs 2 lakh from the kidnappers, who used his son’s mobile phone to demand the money. “As the kidnappers had threatened Lokman Singh with dire consequences if he informed police, Singh deposited Rs 1 lakh into the bank account number given to him out of fear. Upon tracing, we learnt that the bank account belonged to one Multinter Prize Malkapur Ltd in Maharashtra. Sensing the gravity of the matter, I directed the surveillance team to track the location of Aman’s mobile and coordinate with the Mumbai Police,” said the SSP. The surveillance team soon tracked the mobile number that was moving in three different locations under the jurisdiction of three police stations. Police, meanwhile, also got the bank account in which the ransom money was deposited frozen. “We coordinated with Jalgaon, Jamod and Nadura police stations and the youth was finally recovered from a roadside eatery falling under the Nadura police station jurisdiction. Mumbai Police also got two of his friends freed from the abductors. The trio were thrashed by the abductors and found in an unconscious condition,” said Sanjay Kumar of the Bulandshahr surveillance team. Lokman Singh, meanwhile, told TOI that his only son had gone out along with his two friends like any other day. “I got worried when Aman didn’t return and approached police after receiving the ransom call. My son told me that someone had drugged him and then kidnapped him. He will return home tonight,” added Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-youth-2-friends-drugged-abducted-in-mumbai-rescued-within-7-hours-after-getting-ransom-call/articleshow/84121452.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Citizens decry mosquito menace, blame civic authorities||HYDERABAD: Leaving the windows and doors open to enjoy some fresh air could be a common practice for many households. But for residents in several parts of the city, such simple pleasures can come at a risk of being invaded by swarms of uninvited guests - mosquitoes. To stay clear of this menace, which has now become a never-ending problem, residents in several areas are seen keeping their doors and windows shut after 5.30 pm. Many say that the polluted water bodies and open drains, accentuated by the delay in civic authorities carrying out monsoon related works, has turned the city into a notorious hotspot for mosquito breeding. “It has become impossible to keep windows or doors open for even a minute after 5.30 in the evenings. We wouldn’t be facing this problem if the civic staff did not leave the drainage lines open in the entire area to finish laying pipelines as part of the Charminar Pedestrianization Project,” said Fazil Ali, a resident of Charminar. Similarly, residents from Dilli Darwaza, Nayapul, Petlaburj, Ghansi Bazar, Char Mahal, Moosa Bowli, Phool Bagh, Begum Bazaar and other areas surrounding Musi river also said the menace has reached alarming proportions in past few months. “We lead a miserable life and stay indoors all the time due to this mosquito problem. It feels as if the entire city has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and this is despite the fogging activities being done by the GHMC staff on a regular basis. It’s high time the government took measures to find a permanent solution to control breeding,” said Tarun Gupta, a resident of Begum Bazaar. In Moosapet, residents urged GHMC authorities to clean IDL lake, which has turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes. “The lake is about 2 kms from where we stay and still this mosquito problem is giving us sleepless nights. We have also raised complaints on the GHMC app multiple times but there don’t come up with any concrete solution other than fogging,” said Suresh Kumar, a resident of Aanjaneya colony. Agreeing that the mosquito problem is due to pollution in Musi river and open nalas, P Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC said, “While the problem of open nalas is being dealt by the engineering wing of GHMC, we have deployed a team of 54 members covering 21 kilometers of Musi river to conduct sanitation, fogging, anti-larval operations and other activities to control mosquito population. Similar measures are being taken in other water bodies. We have also removed water hyacinth from 31 lakes, while the work is going on in two lakes at present.” “The citizens should also take responsibility. This problem can be solved if apartment don’t release their domestic waste into water bodies or people stop dumping waste directly into the lakes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/citizens-decry-mosquito-menace-blame-civic-authorities/articleshow/84129019.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Goa||Set up genome sequencing lab within 15 days: Cong||Panaji: The new Covid-19 variant, Delta Plus, has already reached the neighbouring Konkan region, Karnataka and Kerala, and the Goa government needs to take proactive and immediate steps to control the entry and spread of the new variant in Goa, said Congress state president Girish Chodankar. Congress said that by permitting people to enter the state with just a rapid antigen test, the government is endangering lives of Goans. “This variant can only be detected with speedy genome sequencing test. The irresponsible BJP government under chief minister Pramod Sawant must immediately take steps to start genome testing in Goa,” Chodankar said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that a very dangerous period lies ahead because of the spread of the contagious Delta variants. Healthcare experts warn that the third wave could hit Goa by August or September. “The spread of this variant can be controlled with early detection and containment and hence Goa should have its own laboratory for genome sequencing testing,” Chodankar said. “It is high time that a full-fledged laboratory is setup to test all variants of Covid-19.” At present, samples from Goa are sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and the results are often obtained after over a month, if not longer. Congress claimed that the absence of a genome sequencing laboratory in Goa resulted in the failure of timely detection of new Covid-19 variants and a high number of Covid fatalities. The party has demanded that the health department immediately setup a virology lab with genome sequencing facilities within 15 days or the party would launch an agitation. In March 2020, health minister Vishwajit Rane announced that Goa would set up its own virology lab at Goa Medical College (GMC), but till date nothing has been setup. “Chief minister Pramod Sawant must explain why the full-fledged testing laboratory has not been established till date,” Chodankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/set-up-genome-sequencing-lab-within-15-days-cong/articleshow/84127744.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telugu man helps trace Telangana native lost in Dubai, kin relieved||HYDERABAD: A WhatsApp forward which went viral on social media helped a Karimnagar native in dire straits in Dubai get connected with his family back home after two years. The family had lost touch with Madishetty Srinivas after he stopped calling since 2019. They did not even know about his whereabouts until his story played out in front of them in the form of a video that was captured by a Telugu man in Dubai. A weak and disoriented Srinivas with unkempt looks managed to give the names of his wife, son and brothers and said that they lived at Krishnanagar in Karimnagar town. “I cannot recollect their telephone numbers,” he was heard saying in the video. “One of our volunteers noticed a man who has been living on the roads and in a poor condition. He approached the man to find out who he was. We circulated the video in different groups and it eventually reached his family who recognised him. We are making efforts to bring him back home from Dubai. We got in touch with officials in Consulate General of India (CGI), Dubai,” Patkuri Basanth Reddy of Gulf Telangana Welfare and Cultural Association (GTWCA) told TOI. In April 2019, Srinivas, a tailor, reportedly paid a job agent Rs 2 lakh and went to Dubai. On landing there, he had no employment as he was allegedly cheated by the agent. A depressed Srinivas looked for work but ran into problems. With no home, no friends and no one to help, he started living on the streets until he was discovered by the Telugu man who played the good samaritan. Srinivas was given a pair of new clothes and taken to the CGI with a request that he be helped to return home. “The consulate officials responded well and are making arrangements to send Srinivas back to Karimnagar,” Basanth Reddy said. The video of Srinivas in a pathetic condition was noticed by P Mahesh Kumar of Karimnagar who, in turn, showed it to Jamuna, wife of Srinivas. In a video appeal, while thanking Basanth Reddy for circulating the video, Jamuna urged the social worker to help her husband return to Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telugu-man-helps-trace-t-native-lost-in-dubai-kin-relieved/articleshow/84129016.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

It was one such crazy idea, a long-cherished wish, by a couple to acquire the copy of a lost photograph that framed their 40 years of togetherness. The couple, K M Prasanna Kumar and C Shailaja, was thrilled to trace the photo that appeared 40 years ago in a vernacular newspaper on their wedding day. “During those times, rarely would people announce their wedding through a newspaper. My friends gave our wedding photo and other details in the newspaper on our wedding day. And we had kept a copy of it safely in our album. But somehow, we lost it. Later, I thought it would be nice if we could get the very same photo so that we can publish it along with our latest one on our 40th anniversary. And I enquired with the advertisement wing of the daily. Fortunately, they had a copy of the same in their library at Kozhikode,” said Kumar, managing director, Airwing Academy, Thiruvananthapuram. The present photo and the old one came out as a designer collage, much to the joy and surprise of family members. After publishing the 40-year-old photo alongside the latest one, the couple had received several calls from their family, friends and well-wishers. Most of their friends were nostalgic about the couple’s wedding day after seeing the photo. “Some of our friends said that it rained heavily on our special day. Recollecting some funny moments of the day, they exclaimed how we have changed over a period of 40 years,” said Kumar. Their children and grandchildren who are settled in Bengaluru were also excited to see the old picture of the couple printed in a daily. Kumar and Shailaja, who love to travel a lot, are waiting for the pandemic to subside so that they can fly to their favourite destinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/couple-traces-wedding-pic-from-daily/articleshow/84125644.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Fr Stan Swamy put on ventilator, Maharashtra govt gets NHRC notice||MUMBAI: The condition of Elgar Parishad accused Fr Stan Swamy deteriorated in a private hospital in Bandra on Sunday. The 84-year-old tribal rights activist was put on ventilator support, prompting the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) as well as several NGOs and individuals to raise concerns about his health. His friend and colleague Father Joseph Xavier told a website, “Fr Stan was put on ventilator early Sunday morning and is in critical condition.” In October 2020, the NIA had arrested Fr Swamy from Ranchi in the Elgar Parishad case and imprisoned him in Taloja jail for nine months, where he contracted Covid-19. Already suffering from Parkinson’s Disease, he was shifted to Holy Family Hospital in Bandra on May 28 after the Bombay high court's intervention. As word spread of his failing health on Sunday, the NHRC issued a notice to the Maharashtra government after receiving a complaint. It wrote to the state chief secretary, urging him to ensure proper medical care to Fr Swamy. The commission sought his case papers and asked for a report over the allegations. “The NHRC, looking into the complaint alleging serious health condition of imprisoned Fr Stan Swamy (84 years), has today issued a notice to the chief secretary, government of Maharashtra, calling upon him to ensure that every possible efforts are made in providing him proper medical care and treatment as part of life saving measure and protection of his basic human rights (sic)," read the NHRC statement. This notice followed an earlier order where the commission had advised the state government to provide adequate medical care and treatment to the elderly Jesuit priest, and submit a report within four weeks. The NHRC had previously received a complaint on May 16 that Fr Swamy was being denied medical facilities in jail during the pandemic. The complainant claimed he had not been vaccinated although a majority of jail employees had tested Covid positive, especially the kitchen staff. Fr Swamy had earlier waged a legal struggle for a sipper to drink from, given his unsteady movements. On Sunday, activists including Melwyn Fernandes of AOCC and several NGOs clamoured for his release. The Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha demanded that the high court grant him bail immediately. The United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, Mary Lawlor, called upon the authorities to provide “every possible specialist treatment” to Fr Swamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/swamy-put-on-ventilator-state-gets-nhrc-notice/articleshow/84127771.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

The accused Mohan Desai is a resident of Vasudha apartment on CG Road in Navrangpura. For around one hour he had continued to scare people openly brandishing a knife and attacked people indiscriminately. According to a complaint filed with Gujarat university police, a 39-year-old man from the Gota area of city, Pravindan Gadhvi, was having tea near Dadasaheb Na Pagla Crossroads when Desai tried to loot him. When Gadhvi resisted, he slashed his shoulder and right hand. Gadhvi managed to escape and he called up police control room. Meanwhile, Desai went towards Viay Crossrods where he demanded money from a paan shop owner Gautam Galchar, a resident of Naranpura, and when Galchar refused, he took out his knife and slashed Galchar on his right hand. He did not stop there and slashed two other customers at the paan shop, Ram Galchar and Jayesh Galchar, both residents of Naranpura, on their hands and shoulders. At that time, a constable of Gujarat university police, Prabhatsinh Shantubha, rushed there and tried to snatch the knife from him.

---||Delhi||Corporation schools have dragged down Delhi’s showing: Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Citing the Unified District Information System for Education data, particularly the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR), deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday said that the BJP-led municipal corporations had made a mess of primary schools in the last 20 years.  He added that due to the poor performance of their schools, the overall performance of Delhi’s educational institutions had gone down. Sisodia claimed almost 98% of Delhi government schools had PTR as mandated by Right to Education Act. However, the PTR of municipal schools in east Delhi was 57.7%, north 45.9% and south 38.9%. “The Narendra Modi government at the Centre has corroborated that the BJP-led corporations have made a mess of primary schools. The mismanagement is so stark that Delhi’s municipal schools are considered the worst in the country. This is tarnishing the image of the national capital. BJP, with its poor governance and incompetence in the corporations, has put the future of lakhs of children at risk,” said the education minister. Claiming that the corporations hadn’t been able to provide teachers to their students, Sisodia said, “While the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government is building world-class infrastructure, providing all basic facilities in schools, recruiting teachers and sending them abroad for training, and launching new-age curriculum for holistic development of students, BJP hasn’t been able to provide teachers and basic facilities in primary schools. BJP functionaries need to look beyond WhatsApp University and feel ashamed of the deteriorating condition of their schools due to 20 years of mismanagement.” Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor countered that despite facing financial problems, municipal schools were performing better than Delhi government schools. “The corporations cater to the poor, and with each passing year the number of students in municipal schools has been rising. Contrary to this, the number of students in Delhi government schools has been going down every year. This clearly shows which schools are performing better. About 75% of Delhi government schools don’t teach science and 65% don’t teach commerce in classes XI-XII. However, computer education is being given in municipal schools. The recruitment of teachers is suffering because Delhi government is withholding funds of the corporations,” claimed Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpn-schools-have-dragged-down-citys-showing-sisodia/articleshow/84125601.cms||---

Following the death of a boy at the Bowenpally open nala, officials of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) are now fixing chain fence on open nalas in Secunderabad Cantonment to ensure no such incidents take place again. Moreover, following complaints that such open nalas are unsafe and are posing danger to lives also flooded to the Cantonment Board from the residential welfare associations (RWAs). Former SCB ward members too mounted pressure on Board officials. Officials have first chosen open nalas in Annanagar, Indirammanagar, BHEL Colony, and CBN Nagar in Rasoolpura and fixed the chain fence. These four areas have thickly populated slums in Rasoolpura (ward no-II) and at least four kilometres of open nalas are unfenced. Iron mesh of 10 meters height have been fixed on open nalas walls and culverts too. Officials also decided to fix chain fences in remaining wards no-I, II, V, and VI, in the Cantonment. In ward No-VI, retaining walls on open nalas were washed away in 2020 October floods and are yet to be rebuilt. Similarly, in certain areas, chain fences were washed away due to the flood water. RWAs also represented several pleas to the Board officials to rebuild the retaining walls and arrange chain fences. “But officials did not respond,” a few RWA members alleged. Apart from building the retaining walls, chain fences are also being fixed at certain hot spots. The fixing of the chain fence, apart from safety, will also discourage locals from dumping garage in the nalas. “Despite placing bins, locals throw debris in the nalas, which causes a block in the drain. To discourage this, we have put up a chain fence too,” SCB additional engineer B Balakrishna told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chain-fence-to-bolster-safety-and-discourage-dumping-of-garbage/articleshow/84129022.cms||Sunil Mungara

But the cops are yet to find out the accused in the case. Not only that, cases of two other senior police officers in whose name fake FB accounts were created last month, are yet to be detected. It was reported on February 15 by TOI that Bisht’s Twitter account had been hacked and an URL promoting a cryptocurrency was shared through it. A senior IPS officer probing into the case claimed that it was not hacked, but someone might have obtained its password and shared the link. Using this modus operandi, the crooks may commit frauds in lakhs, said a cyber cell officer of CID (crime). The message by the hacker promises that if the website gets due promotion, people would get chance of doubling their income and they may also win bitcoins. Bisht’s three other Twitter accounts created in 2016 are lying dormant and one account which he created in February after his original account was hacked, is not active. In other cases, IPS officer Ajay Chaudhary, deputy commissioner of police, found on June 10 that someone has created his fake Facebook account and begun asking for money. Similarly, Ajay Dudhat, superintendent of police and deputy director of the Gujarat police academy at Karai in Gandhinagar, also found that a fake Facebook account had been created his name and money was being demanded from others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/police-are-still-looking-for-hackers-of-officers-accounts/articleshow/84125608.cms||---

The cops on Saturday night barged into a house in Prernateerth Bungalows society in the area and found eight liquor bottles in possession of a 53-year-old man who had the liquor permit. According to officials of Anandnagar police, they got an input that a 53-year-old man has stored imported liquor bottles in his house in Prernateerth Bungalows society. A team of four cops rushed to the house, barged into it and found the man in the house. Acting on the input, the cops went to the first floor of the house where they found an in-house bar in a room. Police checked a glass cupboard and found eight liquor bottles worth Rs 31,000. When the cops questioned him about the liquor bottles, he told the police that he has the permit to keep them. The police did not accept the permit and charged the person under the prohibition act. A cop of Anandnagar police said, “The accused thought he could keep any liquor as he has the permit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/permit-holder-booked-for-keeping-imported-liquor/articleshow/84125652.cms||---

This is the ninth such clinic in Patparganj and 497th in Delhi, the government said in a statement. Sisodia said the government’s vision is to ensure that every citizen in Delhi receives the best healthcare facilities. He added that through this clinic, the people of Patparganj and, in particular, Vinod Nagar will be provided for free facilities of health checkups, medicines and over 200 different kinds of tests. According to the statement, the government is establishing mohalla clinics in every ward to revamp the primary healthcare system of Delhi and continually make it better. Delhi’s mohalla clinic model, the deputy chief minister said, is a world-class model in primary healthcare services. The government is constantly trying to make it better by enhancing its facilities so that every citizen in Delhi receives the best healthcare, he added. The model has received appreciation and recognition across India and the world, which, Sisodia said, is not merely the result of providing effective healthcare facilities in these clinics but also due to quality patient care along with compassionate behaviour from doctors and assistants. He alleged that the primary healthcare system of Delhi had been completely dismantled and made unfit in the last 15 years of the BJP-led governance of the three municipal corporations of Delhi. He further alleged that there wasn’t even one municipal health centre that could be called a model health centre. Reacting to Sisodia’s comments, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed that it was the primary healthcare system of civic dispensaries, maternity centres and basic hospitals, which were providing basic services to common people unlike Delhi government’s mohalla clinics. Kapoor alleged that all mohalla clinics had failed in Delhi during the pandemic even as municipal facilities kept on working.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-opens-mohalla-clinic-in-e-delhi-number-closes-in-on-500-mark/articleshow/84125690.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Reasons for not masking up score big on creativity||PUNE: The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police are worried about the evolving and diverse excuses people present for not wearing masks close to 18 months since the pandemic struck. “On an average, we are still catching around 1,500 people every day in the city for not wearing masks or not wearing them properly. Until last year, the figure stood at around 4,500 each day so the numbers have reduced,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI. Sources from Pimpri Chinchwad police said that, on an average, they were taking action against around 250 people each day without masks. Last year, the figure stood at an average of around 300 people, per day. “Between March 2020 and July 3 this year, the police caught around 5.20 lakh people and collected a fine of around Rs25.02 crore from people for not wearing masks in Pune. Many people are taking Covid-19 very lightly even now. Those who have seen the effect of Covid-19 firsthand are taking precautions. People tend to argue with cops unnecessarily when stopped on roads for not wearing a mask,” said a senior police officer. “The excuses many of them give is humorous, even irritating. After the first wave last year, many people were found not wearing masks and most of them would claim to have forgotten to carry the masks as it was a new concept. Now, the weather is the most frequent excuse. Either it is too hot or humid to wear the mask or they don’t want the masks to get wet in the rain. A number of people also say that since they have taken a single or both doses of the vaccine, they don’t need to wear a mask anymore,” said another officer. According to experts, among the main reasons for the recent rise in cases has been the lack of Covid-19 appropriate behavior. “The defiance, to an extent, comes from the frustration and burnout people are experiencing as they are fed up. After cases dropped last year, people had developed a false sense of security and thought that the second wave will not hit. However, after the second wave caused havoc, the same doesn’t stand anymore. People need to be more patient and family members must talk to each other frequently,” said Binda Singh, a clinical psychologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/reasons-for-not-masking-up-continue-to-get-creative/articleshow/84125676.cms||Joy Sengupta

People were taking in the breeze and enjoying a sunny day out during the monsoon. While the locals were either sitting on the beach watching their children play or youths playing football or were taking a stroll on the beach, there were tourists taking selfies and posing for photographs. While some families preferred to sit in their cars, some others chose to dip their feet in the cool waters of the Arabian Sea. One person said that two months of lockdown or curfew or whatever the government calls it has brought in fatigue of staying indoors and hence he decided to come and sit on the beach to enjoy the cool breeze. At Sernabatim, the situation was no different, visitors were standing on the edge of eroded land or sitting on stones of a collapsed retaining wall and gazing at the rough waves. The scene at Colva beach was different. There were hardly any visitors, and probably due to the presence of police personnel, who dissuaded the people from venturing on the beach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tired-of-being-stuck-indoors-for-nearly-2-months-salcete-people-head-to-beaches/articleshow/84127838.cms||---

---||Kochi||MVD survey identifies 134 obstructions on district roads||Kochi: Motor vehicles department (MVD) has identified as many as 134 obstructions which affect the view of motorists on 12 roads in Ernakulam RTO limit. The obstructions were identified after an audit by six squads. Each squad of motor vehicle inspectors studied two main roads in their limits. The audit was conducted based on a Kerala high court order in 2018 directing authorities concerned to remove all obstructions causing threat to road safety. Of the total obstructions, 85 are thick vegetation on roadsides. Other obstructions identified are medians at eight locations, electric transformers at 18 locations, electric poles at 22 points, concrete debris at eight points. Besides these, five locations require signal lights and sign boards, and road surface and median need to be rectified at 15 locations. Vegetation have been noticed mostly on highways. Though local bodies are entrusted with the task of clearing the vegetation on roadsides, MVD officials feel that LSGDs are not taking the matter seriously. “The survey to identify the obstructions was conducted along 12 road stretches, including Varapuzha Junction-Vyttila flyover, Kalamassery-Vyttila Metro station, Thoppumpady BOT Road and Palluruthy Road towards Fort Kochi. There is no footpath along Palluruthy Road. There is no space for constructing one along the stretch. Four locations on the 300m stretch between Palluruthy police station and Veli ground are accident prone. As both sides of the road are crowded with shops, land acquisition is not possible to widen the road. We can only propose construction of footpath along the stretch as no immediate measure is possible,” said Ernakulam RTO Shabeer. Varapuzha Junction has many issues, including thick vegetation. Transformers are jutted out into the road at Palarivattom and Alinchuvadu junctions. Pookkattupady Junction and Metro pillars 369 and 383 are some of the locations where electric poles pose threat to smooth movement of vehicles. Motor vehicle inspectors say in the survey report that two intersections along the road between Paravur and Varapuzha bridge is highly dangerous due to thick vegetation and it is difficult to drive even during day. Motorists are unable to see vehicles entering the main road from the two intersections. MVD will place a detailed proposal before road safety authority for taking decision on measures to be taken to undertake road safety measures. Respective departments will also be intimated on removing the obstructions. The survey on remaining roads will also be conducted later. It has been noted that the obstructions will be much severe on interior roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mvd-survey-identifies-134-obstructions-on-district-roads/articleshow/84125696.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Bone death’, a new condition among Covid survivors, worrying doctors||MUMBAI: Avascular necrosis (AVN), or death of bone tissues, could be the next debilitating condition among post-Covid patients after the outbreak of mucormycosis or black fungus two months back. At least three confirmed cases of avascular necrosis after Covid-19 have been scientifically reported from Mumbai, and doctors fear more are likely in the next few months. The common factor between mucormycosis and avascular necrosis is the use of steroids, the only drug proven to help Covid-19 patients. Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, treated the three young (under 40) patients who developed necrosis two months after they were treated for Covid. “These patients developed pain in their femur bone (the highest part of the thigh bone) and, since they were doctors, they recognised the symptoms and rushed for treatment,’’ said Dr Sanjay Agarwala, medical director of Hinduja Hospital, Mahim. Dr Agarwala’s research paper, ‘Avascular necrosis as a part of long Covid-19’, was published on Saturday in prestigious medical journal ‘BMJ Case Studies’. He said the “large-scale use of life-saving corticosteroids” in Covid-19 cases will result in a “resurgence of AVN cases”. Other orthopedic specialists told TOI they too had seen one or two cases among post-Covid patients. “In patients who have suffered from long Covid-19 and needed steroids, this is a worry,” said a civic hospital doctor. Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensivist who is a member of the state government’s Covid-19 task force, said he is on the “lookout” for avascular necrosis. “I expect cases within a month or two as AVN usually occurs five to six months after steroid use. Our second Covid wave’s peak was in April when steroids were liberally used to treat patients, so we may see it soon,” Dr Pandit added. But Dr Agarwala, who is known as an avascular necrosis specialist having pioneered a medical treatment (called the bisphosphonate regime) for it 20 years back that was used across the world, has started seeing the trickle. His study underlines two worrying trends: post-Covid patients had lower threshold dose of steroid and earlier onset of presentation. They were given a mean dose of 758mg of corticosteroid prednisolone that is less than the 2,000mg dosage known to trigger AVN. Secondly, it usually takes six months to a year to develop AVN after post-steroid use. “But our set of patients developed early AVN at a mean of 58 days after their diagnosis,” said Dr Agarwala. Since these patients sought help early, they didn’t need surgery, a common intervention for avascular necrosis. “Covid-19 survivors, who have been on steroids, and then develop hip or thigh pain, need confirmatory MRI to establish a diagnosis of AVN of the hip. If they are started on early bisphosphonate therapy, they can have amazing reversal of the disease,” said Dr Agarwala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bone-death-a-new-condition-among-covid-survivors-worrying-doctors/articleshow/84125722.cms||Malathy Iyer

Like all other tourist activities, white water rafting could not take off last year after the pandemic emerged. This year’s circumstances aren’t any different. Organisers are keen to restart activities, however, the monsoon may be over by the time the pandemic’s effect peters out and the state opens for tourists. “We are looking forward to attempt restarting white water rafting,” said John Pollard, managing director at Southern River Adventure and Sports Pvt Ltd, that commenced water rafting in Goa in association with Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC). In Goa, white water rafting is operational only during the monsoon, and usually takes off by the end of June or in July depending on the rainfall activity. But due to the pandemic, it is yet to restart despite a good monsoon last year as well as adequate precipitation so far. “Two seasons have been washed out by the pandemic. A year before that, flooding disrupted the season. It’s been three years that we are without a favourable season. If the next season is no different, I don’t know what we will do,” he said. White water rafting was started in the Mhadei river basin about six years ago and gained popularity in a short span of time. A GTDC official said though this is the right time to kick-start white water rafting as the rain activity has been satisfactory, but with no tourists, it will be difficult to sustain operations. By the time restrictions are lifted, it will be too late, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-waves-may-sink-white-water-rafting-in-state-this-yr/articleshow/84125724.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation shuts CoEP jumbo unit; decision to restart it to be taken after July 15||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation shut down the jumbo Covid hospital at CoEP at the beginning of this month because of less demand for beds. “All the patients, who were being treated at the hospital have been discharged now. The hospital is empty and has been shut down,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official. He said that the facility was still there, but no new admissions were given. The PMC had reduced 300 normal hospital beds from the jumbo facility at CoEP because of poor demand in June. The PMC officials said that the discussion about whether to continue or restart the jumbo hospital would be taken after July 15. The contract with the current firm was valid till then. As per the civic staff, the occupancy of the oxygen beds and ventilators was high in the jumbo hospital in June. As many as 45 patients were using these facilities. In July, the demand for even oxygen beds and ventilators had gone down. As per the PMC’s data, the hospital at CeEP has 800 beds. Of them, 700 beds were occupied when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak. Now, all 800 beds were empty. The old facility at Baner had 450 beds. A new Covid facility in Baner had around 300 beds. The PMC in January had planned to dismantle the jumbo hospitals after the first wave ended. A committee of experts was formed for the same, who gave suggestions to share the infrastructure of jumbo hospitals with the local civic hospitals. Even the government hospitals in rural areas were to get some equipment and other materials to strengthen the government health facilities. But, the hospital was kept open in the wake of second wave of the pandemic. “Though there are talks of a third wave, an in-depth analysis of the jumbo hospital’s need would have to be done. Other infrastructure is now ready for mitigation of the new wave. Looking at the large expense of the jumbo hospital, the authorities may have to rethink on keeping the hospital running,” a PMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-shuts-jumbo-hospital-at-coep-decision-to-restart-it-to-be-taken-after-july-15/articleshow/84125728.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

According to Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, the region has only one dedicated Covaxin site at District Hospital Aundh at present. “We need more dedicated Covaxin sites to avoid any confusion among beneficiaries and speed up the vaccination process. Generally, depending on the stocks, vaccination centres are changed across the civic limits. Dedicated sites would be helpful for beneficiaries to get vaccinated,” he said. Sanjay Patil, chairman, IMA’s hospital board of India, too said that the number of vaccination centres offering Covaxin changes from just two to twenty. If civic bodies could provide centres across the prominent points of PMR, it could really prove helpful for the vaccination drive as well as to beneficiaries, said Patil. A PMC official said that they are trying to keep the current six vaccination sites steady. Meanwhile, on Sunday, as per data from the CoWIN platform, around 28,708 beneficiaries were vaccinated across 75 government-run and 70 private sites in the district. Covishield out of stock for PMC, PCMC, only Covaxin drive to be held on Monday PMC and PCMC have run out of Covishield doses so only Covaxin shots will be administered on Monday across the civic-run vaccination centres. PMC has allotted six vaccination sites, while PCMC has assigned around 16 centres for the doses. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), said that the administration is expecting fresh stock on Monday or Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-dedicated-covaxin-sites-needed-across-pmr/articleshow/84125777.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The corporation’s Ignite innovation hub has been virtually transformed into an office for Goa Electronics Ltd, and startups and entrepreneurs are being asked to vacate the premises, sources informed TOI. GEL officials have begun to take over the cubicles and cabins that were meant for startups, while applications from tech entrepreneurs for working space are being rejected, a source said. Even EDC officials told TOI that GEL occupies 75-80% of the desks at Ignite that were meant for startups. TOI has also learnt that EDC has issued directions that whenever co-working seats at EDC Ignite are vacant, “first give preference to GEL” before offering them to startups. Former chief minister Manohar Parrikar inaugurated the incubation centre in 2018, which was set up at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore. Parrikar and then EDC chairman Sidharth Kuncalienker had announced that the incubation centre would encourage young entrepreneurs to set up their own startup companies in Goa. EDC Ignite has 90 desks, which are offered at a nominal rate of Rs 2,000 per month to tech companies along with plug-n-play facilities. At present, there are four startups incubated with EDC Ignite, and three firms that have sought co-working space. Vasant Salgaoncar, the founder of Mechgiri, one of the startups presently incubated with EDC Ignite, applied for an extension after a year, but even though more than a month has passed, he has not received any response. “The pandemic has sent all early-stage startups to square one. At this point, where revenues have gone down, an incubation-cum-co-working hub like EDC is exceptionally helpful,” said Salgaoncar. Another startup functioning out of EDC Ignite was asked to “release” the desks that it was using so that they could be offered to GEL. TOI attempted to reach out to EDC chairman Sadanand Shet Tanavade on multiple occasions but Tanavade was unavailable for comment. EDC managing director K V Ballikar said that GEL has been recruiting more staff and was looking for office space. “Ignite wasn’t doing too well and because of the pandemic, IT companies want to work from home. GEL, which is our subsidiary, will pay EDC Rs 5 lakh per month as rent so EDC will earn Rs 60 lakh a year,” Ballikar said. Records show that EDC asked one of the startups which “badly needed two desks” to “release” the work space as GEL was interested in taking them up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/edc-dims-lights-on-startups-offers-co-working-space-to-gel/articleshow/84125784.cms||Newton Sequeira

With the onset of every monsoon the residents of over 30 families living here suffer, as the houses, including bathrooms and toilets, get submerged in rainwater. There used to be a wide canal called Panackal Thodu, surrounding this area and this ancient canal was linked with the main Andhakra canal, but over the years the canal got reclaimed. TOI had reported the plight of the residents in the area in its edition dated June 21, 2021. On Friday, municipal authorities headed by chairperson Rema Santhosh and secretary Abhilash Kumar reached Paandi Parambu area, which was submerged in stagnant water contaminated with septic waste, to take stock of the situation. “A writ petition was filed regarding a canal that was reclaimed in the area. However, we could not find any revenue records regarding the existence of a canal there. So we have decided to execute the court order in an amicable way by laying a 32m-long pipeline underneath the walkway here,” said municipal secretary Abhilash Kumar H. He said this will enable rainwater to flow towards the main canal and thus become a permanent solution for the severe waterlogging in the area. After laying the pipeline, the land can again be used as a common walkway. “We have been leading a nightmarish life all these years as the onset of monsoon brings fatal epidemics due to the illegal filling of Panackal Thodu surrounding the area,” said Balachandran, a resident. He said all the rooms in their houses, including the kitchen, get filled with highly toxic stagnant water every monsoon. “Fearing the spread of fatal epidemics most of the families prefer to stay in their relatives’ houses during monsoon,” he said. The move by the municipal authorities turned out to be a great relief for the families. “I consider it as a fruitful moment as I have been fighting a legal battle for 30 years,” M Ramachandran, a retired BSNL officer said. The high court had in its order in March, 2021 directed the authorities to take measures to solve the issue. Residents said that the laying of pipes will also help save lakhs of rupees for the municipality as they have been pumping out rainwater during each monsoon using high-power motors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/paandi-parambu-to-get-relief-from-waterlogging/articleshow/84125799.cms||Sivadas Varma
---||Goa||After second wave, rejuvenation sessions for South Goa nurses||PANAJI: After the second wave and prior to a possible third wave, nurses in South Goa are receiving weekly virtual selfcare/rejuvenation sessions to help build up their resilience to deal with any eventuality. The second wave of the pandemic, which claimed over 2,000 lives in Goa, was such that nurses had more than one patient under their care dying. “The numbers were crazy, and it was not that patients in their care were dying peacefully. They were struggling to breathe, suffocating and dying of asphyxiation. Imagine the effect this has on the mental health of healthcare providers,” said Canada-based licenced meditation teacher Lisa Pinto, who has been conducting the sessions for the “super heroes” since June 6. While many healthcare providers prioritised the health and well-being of patients, they neglected their own mental health and well-being, she said. “We are all safer because of the healthcare providers and we need to take a moment to acknowledge this,” said Pinto, who hails from Margao. In May, when she heard how badly the second wave was hitting Goa, Pinto decided she wanted to do something for her people. She volunteered to equip these frontline workers with techniques to use on the job to help them take control and maintain their balance in difficult situations. The fifth session for around 40 nursing staff from Hospicio and South Goa district hospital was held via Zoom on Sunday evening. Senior nurse at South Goa district hospital, Lisma Barneto, who attended the sessions, said the second wave was a horrendous and stressful experience. “Apart from physical stress there was a lot of mental stress, which drained us. It has left us emotionally and psychologically stressed. Some have lost their bread winner and loved ones. We did our best to reach out to our patients despite being in uncomfortable PPEs. It was not easy, but we kept going,” she said. Pinto’s sessions on self compassion, equanimity phrases and gratitude are teaching nurses to take ownership of their mental health and wellbeing. “We want them to understand that they have to stop for self-care and compassion. If they don’t, their mental health will be ruined. If they’re not rested and coming from a good place they will find it difficult to care for others,” Pinto said. The sessions through meditation teaches them to be aware of unpleasant emotions and how to cope with them with deep breathing and other techniques. “By doing all of this regularly, every Sunday, they’re preparing themselves for the next time they’re hit by something huge,” she said. Poonam Naik, an ITU and ICU nurse, said she felt like she was able to help patients during the first wave. “This second wave went beyond our imagination. Many things were out of our control. It was a nightmare and mentally taxing for us. The ICU nurses were overburdened with stressors that were affecting us from inside. This session has made us feel enthusiastic and stronger and ready to tackle future Covid waves if they happen,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-second-wave-rejuvenation-sessions-for-south-goa-nurses/articleshow/84127921.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Among the many who turned up at the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital on Sunday, but found the gates of the centre shut was the family of lawyer Devanand Galani. Galani said he reached the Mumbai Central hospital around 10.30am, a slot which the family had booked through the CoWin app on July 3. “We have been waiting for the second shot of Covaxin and the appointments were available for Sunday. But when we got here, we were told it was a holiday,” said Galani. He said the CoWin app showed that slots were available at several centres but when he called a few of them, including Breach Candy, he was told they don’t hold drives on Sunday. Nair authorities confirmed that many were given appointments, but they didn’t know how the sessions were created for Sunday. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that no drives are planned at the public centres on Sunday, so it was surprising how people could book appointments. “It has been more than a month that public centres don’t vaccinate on Sundays,” he said. Maharashtra administered less than 2 lakh doses on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-public-centres-shut-on-sunday-but-vax-slots-open-on-cowin/articleshow/84125806.cms||---

The disabled child was found in front of the outside patient department (OPD) of the GMCH at 3 pm on July 3. After a futile search for his parents, the security personnel M D Sarfaraz and M S Khan alerted the GMCH administration and the city police. GMCH Dean Dr Suresh Harbade said the boy, aged between three and four years, cannot speak. “Both his legs are paralyzed and he has some vision defect too. The buy must have had these disabilities since birth. We are offering care to the child,” he said, adding that the child’s parents or other family members could not be traced till Sunday evening. Local officials of the women and child development department said they would take possession of the child after necessary formalities completed by the GMCH. “The boy would be produced before the child welfare committee in case his family members are not traced in the next two-three days. The panel would then send him to the government-run shelter,” district women and child development officer Ganesh Pungale said. Begampura police said no offense was registered in connection with the incident as such cases are dealt with by the women and child development department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/disabled-child-abandoned-at-gmch-family-untraceable/articleshow/84119478.cms||---

The victim was identified as Mitrajsinh Jadeja, a resident of Khirsara village. According to Kothara police of Kutch, the deceased’s father Hatheesinh Jadeja has lodged a complaint against Digvijaysinh Jadeja (25) and his two farm labourers — Divansinh Ravsikh and Anil Rajput — for murdering his son. “On Saturday my son left home saying that he is going to Digivijaysinh’s farm and did not return till late. We searched for him in the village but were not able to find him. Digvijaysinh told us that Mitrajsinh met him and left the farm soon afterwards,” Hatheesinh stated in his police complaint. Later, Hatheesinh lodged a missing complaint at the Kothara police station. Within hours the cops were informed about the dead body found in the open sewer line on the banks of Nyara River near Kothara village. Police, along with Hatheesinh, rushed to the spot where the body was identified as that of Mitrajsinh. Hatheesinh later lodged a complaint against Digvijaysinh and two others for killing his son. The complainant told the police that the accused had threatened to kill his son if he didn’t stop talking to a woman. Police booked the accused under various sections of Indian Penal Code including murder, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidences and detained the three on Saturday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/3-held-for-killing-19-yr-old-youth/articleshow/84123747.cms||---
---||Pune||5.4 lakh doses available with private hospitals in Pune Metropolitan Region||PUNE: District immunization officer Sachin Edke said that at least 5.40 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses were lying unused with private hospitals across Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). This includes Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation areas, rural Pune and the three cantonment limits in the district. He said top health department officials, during an online meeting, cited this figure based on a consolidated report — from vaccine makers — on the number of doses supplied to private hospitals and the actual vaccination at these centres over the past few weeks. “Ideally, these hospitals should prepare a plan to streamline vaccination in a timebound manner. The health department is in the process of introducing guidelines to private hospitals in this regard,” Edke told TOI Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the Pune zilla parishad, said keeping such huge stocks of vaccine doses does not serve any purpose. “We have asked private hospitals to utilise these doses by carrying out vaccination drives in nearby housing societies and private companies. If they do this, the rush at vaccination centres would reduce significantly,” Prasad said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, suggested along the same lines, adding, “Private hospitals should make sure that they exhaust their vaccine stock in a stipulated period.” Sanjay Patil, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s hospital board of India, defended the hospitals’ holding onto so many doses. “It is necessary given the current situation. Hospitals depending on daily footfalls must keep stock of at least 2-3 weeks on hand. Another reason for ‘hoarding’ is the erratic vaccine supply,” Patil said. He added that unequal vaccine distribution without no consideration for geographic location has affected footfalls at private hospitals. “For instance, a private hospital doesn’t get the desired footfalls if there is a government vaccination site nearby,” he said. Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said they experienced a brief drop in footfall two weeks ago. Now, the hospital is vaccinating 3,000-4,000 beneficiaries per day. “We might have around 40,000 doses of Covishield in stock. Once it halves, we will place an order for another 50,000,” he said. Jehangir Hospital’s public relations officer Aarti Irani said that their footfalls have reduced by at least 30%. Snehal Porwal, founder of Healing Hands clinic, said that they have around 10,000 Covishield doses on hand and will place soon order 50,000 more. “Corporate tie-ups are the main beneficiaries,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-4l-doses-available-with-private-hospitals-in-pmr/articleshow/84125830.cms||Sandip Dighe

The government has also permitted events, including marriages, for up to 100 people or 50% of hall capacity, whichever is less, with the approval of the district magistrate or sub-district magistrate. The new relaxations come into force on Monday. It has also said that shops may remain open from 7am to 6pm, as opposed to the earlier timing of 3pm. An announcement to this regard was made by CM Pramod Sawant last week. The state government has also permitted the holding of the public consultation for the draft coastal zone management plan scheduled on July 8 till completion of hearing at the venue, subject to compliance with Covid-appropriate behaviours. The state government said that for cremations or funerals, up to 20 persons will be permitted without the need for permission. What remains closed are casinos, indoor sports complex, auditoriums, community halls or similar places, river cruises, waterparks, entertainment parks, gyms, spas, massage parlours, cinema halls, theatres, multiplexes, entertainment zones within shopping malls, and swimming pools. On June 20, the state government had allowed the opening of shops in shopping malls, except cinema halls, theatres, multiplexes, entertainment zones, and fish markets. On June 12, the state allowed panchayat and municipal markets to open. From June 14, the state government has started slowly relaxing the curfew and allowing economic activities in the state. The first curfew was imposed on May 9 after a lot of reluctance even as the state grappled with an unprecedented surge of Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bars-restaurants-can-open-till-9pm-with-50-capacity/articleshow/84125846.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Five lakh gained from Maharashtra’s health cover in 1 year: RTI||MUMBAI: Less than 8% of Covid patients in Mumbai availed treatment under the Maharashtra government's flagship health insurance scheme. This is despite hospitalisation costs being high in the city. A possible reason could be the fact that there are not enough hospitals that are part of the scheme in the metropolis and also free treatment was available in regular and field hospitals operated by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). As of March 31, 2021, Maharashtra reported more than 28 lakh Covid cases and 54,649 deaths as against this a little over five lakh patients received treatment under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, according to information obtained under the RTI Act by activist Jeetendra Ghadge. The scheme covered over 2.2 crore families across Maharashtra. The United India Insurance Company was appointed as the insurer for the scheme on April 1, 2020, co-incidentally when the coronavirus-induced lockdown had just been imposed. Though Mumbai reported over four lakh cases and 11,708 deaths till April 1, 2021, only 29,664 claims were paid, while 34,867 claims were settled in Ahmednagar which reported 95,000 infections and 1,221 fatalities in the same period. In Kolhapur, 34,574 claims were paid and in Pune, 34,045. When patients have paid lakhs of rupees through medical bills, such a small number of beneficiaries shows the scheme is not as effective as it should be in safeguarding the economy of the common man, claim activists. There is a need for detailed scrutiny of the scheme, they demanded. After the second wave, the total cases in the state touched 61 lakh with over 1.2 lakh deaths, but, activists said, they doubt if the number of beneficiaries has increased too.  However, Dr Sudhakar Shinde, CEO for Ayushman Bharat, Maharashtra and incharge for MJPJAY scheme, said the highest beneficiaries of the insurance scheme in the country were in Maharashtra. He said over and above the Covid patients treated in government-allied hospitals, even private patients have been offered benefits under the scheme. He said of the total number of Covid-infected in the state, 80% were asymptomatic and only remaining 20 % needed hospitalisation. "Even among 20% hospitalised, only 10-12% needed oxygen and ventilators. So if we considered around 30 lakh patients during one year, only 6 lakh were hospitalized. And if as per RTI info, more than 5 lakh people are getting the benefit, means state has an impressive strike rate in terms of insurance claims paid," he said. Under the scheme, Rs 1,031 crore was disbursed to hospitals across Maharashtra, but the insurer refused to give the total of the premiums paid by the Maharashtra government, said Ghadge. The only positive is that of the total 6,16,927 applications submitted, only 4.4% were rejected, he added. Ghadge, founder of The Young Whistleblowers Foundation, said, “The state government had declared that all types of ration cards will be eligible under this scheme, but many families in Mumbai spent lakhs on Covid treatment. Hospitals that have forced citizens to pay hefty bills and avoided implementing the scheme should be brought to justice. A third-party audit should be made compulsory to check if hospitals have passed on the benefits of the scheme to patients.” He added: “Private hospitals are reluctant to enrol in the scheme, but it should be made legally binding for them to implement it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-5l-gained-from-states-health-cover-in-1-yr-rti/articleshow/84125837.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Dehradun||Bringing tourism on track, resuming Char Dham Yatra my priority: Uttarakhand Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami||DEHRADUN: Pushkar Singh Dhami, 45, who took oath at Raj Bhawan on Sunday evening as the youngest chief minister of Uttarakhand, spoke about his priorities after taking over. With tourism being the backbone of the state’s economy and Char Dham Yatra playing a key role in the livelihood of lakhs of people, Dhami said that resuming the two were on his priority list. The new CM said he was well aware of the difficulties and challenges being faced by people in the wake of the second wave of Covid-19 and he would try to resolve them. He added that his focus would be on the youth and providing jobs to locals by filling up vacant posts. “Right since my start in politics, I have been involved in a lot of campaigns related to the youth, and therefore I understand their situation. We will work for them and try to appoint youth in vacant posts.” The CM started his day by visiting his predecessors Tirath Singh Rawat and Trivendra Singh Rawat and later in the afternoon met senior leader Satpal Maharaj at his residence. On being asked about the reservations shown by some senior leaders over his appointment as CM, Dhami said he was counting on the support of experienced members in his cabinet team. “It will definitely help me and it is my duty to keep all the young and senior members together and take forward the works done by our party in the past four years,” he said. He added that his government would reach out to the remotest of villages. "There are tough geographical locations in Uttarakhand and it will be a sincere effort on our part to reach out to the remote and far-flung areas. We will soon come up with a plan.” On whether the change of guard would hurt the party's prospects in next year's assembly polls, the two-time MLA from Khatima said, "It will have no impact. In the past four years, a number of development projects have been completed or started by our party and we will showcase our achievements to people."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bringing-tourism-on-track-resuming-char-dham-yatra-my-priority-cm-dhami/articleshow/84121838.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Dehradun||BJP pacifies ‘upset’ senior leaders, Dhami takes oath as 11th Uttarakhand CM||DEHRADUN: A day after Khatima legislator Pushkar Singh Dhami was named as the CM choice by BJP to replace Tirath Rawat, hectic day-long parleys were done throughout the day on Sunday by the party’s trouble-shooters to pacify senior leaders who were reportedly upset at the choice. Dhami, 45, a two-time MLA, has no previous experience of being a minister and his surprise elevation to the top post allegedly rankled several senior ministers like Satpal Maharaj, Yashpal Arya, Bishan Singh Chuphal, Subodh Uniyal and Harak Singh Rawat. Many of them have a Congress background and had joined BJP in 2016 after rebelling from the Congress. Although none of the ministers or MLAs openly voiced their dissent and the party officially denied any discontent, the indication that all was not well was evident as several leaders were closeted at Satpal Maharaj’s residence in the morning to chalk out their strategy. The BJP quickly swung into damage control to manage the situation. Highly-placed sources told TOI that Union home minister Amit Shah spoke to a few of the disgruntled leaders. The party’s trouble-shooters were also deputed to visit the leaders and talk to them. Accordingly, Dhan Singh Rawat, who was higher education minister in the Trivendra and Tirath governments, met Yashpal Arya while Lok Sabha MP from Nainital Ajay Bhatt was given the task to pacify Chuphal. Meanwhile, Dhami himself drove down to Maharaj’s residence in the afternoon and had a brief discussion with him. Subsequently, at around 3.30 pm, barely one and a half hours before the swearing-in was scheduled, it was indicated that all the senior leaders would attend the ceremony at Raj Bhawan. Dhami retained all 11 ministers of the Tirath government in his cabinet and also elevated the three ministers of state in the previous government– Rekha Arya, Dhan Singh Rawat and Swami Yatishwaranand – to cabinet minister rank.

While sources said that no major changes are expected in the portfolios that were previously held by the ministers, the official intimation regarding this is to be announced soon. After the swearing-in, the cabinet members met for a formal meeting late in the evening at the state secretariat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-pacifies-upset-senior-leaders-dhami-takes-oath-as-11th-ukhand-cm/articleshow/84121833.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||He missed a crucial stop but a doc was there at the next||Thiruvananthapuram: As Ratheesh Kumar, the fire and rescue officer at Vizhinjam station makes a slow and steady recovery after decompression sickness nearly paralysed him, his colleagues are thankful to the doctor who saved him. “Dr Ajith Kumar was the best person to save our man and thankfully he was available. Dr Ajith would liaise with specialists from the Navy throughout the therapy. He kept us updated on his progress. We are now sure of his full recovery,” says Rajesh MG, regional fire officer, Institute of Advanced Training in Water Rescue, Fort Kochi. The incident involving Ratheesh happened on the 6th day of a scuba diving camp organised at a 15-metre-deep quarry pond at Pothencode. Ratheesh was taken to the SP Fort Hospital in a semi-coma state with weakness in upper and lower right limb and an inability to speak after a minor miscalculation proved nearly fatal. He had missed the safety stop (a brief stop mandated before the final ascent of a dive to release the absorbed Nitrogen from the body) during the ascent after the dive. During ascent, he had seen a flicker of light and thought he was near the surface and he shot up rapidly. When he surfaced, his colleagues knew something was amiss. His head was sliding over and he couldn’t lift his left eyelid. At the hospital, Dr Ajith was quick to arrive at the diagnosis: Decompression sickness, a known danger in scuba diving when inert gases in the body form bubbles in the tissues due to sudden variation in pressure. The treatment began in 10 minutes because time was precious. The bubbles formed could be dangerous and nobody knew it better than Dr Ajith who was trained at the IAF’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine at Bengaluru. Dr Ajith and his team started subjecting Ratheesh to sessions of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in a chamber where Oxygen is used to reduce the size of the bubbles and to eliminate them and the excess dissolved gases. “On the first day of therapy, he moved his legs, the next day he stood on his feet and after 48 hours he started to speak slowly. The diagnosis was crucial. MRI was normal and there was no evidence of stroke. Given his diving background, it had to be DC,” says Dr Ajith. Dr Ajith said Ratheesh will be ready for scuba diving in another three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/he-missed-a-crucial-stop-but-a-doc-was-there-at-the-next/articleshow/84125842.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The candidates said that no job in hands despite cracking the examination has left them heartbroken. They said that they were facing huge pressure on family and social front due to unemployment. “It is mental agony to remain jobless despite passing MPSC examinations. While many of us are facing issues in getting married, several others are not able to fulfil responsibilities towards their families,” said Manoj Chavan, one of the affected candidates. Chavan, who has qualified for the post of deputy education officer, said that the affected candidates have decided to seek permission for mass-suicide. “The suicide of Lonkar is highly unfortunate but the government perceive this is an indication of unrest and frustration brewing among MPSC candidates who are either waiting for final interviews or waiting for job letter,” said another affected candidate, adding that the pandemic situation has badly affected the search for other jobs as well. On June 22, TOI carried a report on how a total of 413 candidates qualified for plump posts such as deputy collector and deputy superintendent of police, among other posts of Class I rank, have not received posting in the last one year. Although the state government has kept in abeyance the necessary appointments citing legal issues over Maratha reservation, affected candidates maintain that the Supreme Court has recently delivered a final verdict on such quota. Local BJP MLA Atul Save said that the ruling MVA government has handled the issue of Maratha reservation in casual manner since beginning, which he said, has its cascading effect on many others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/were-facing-mental-agony-mpsc-candidates-awaiting-posting/articleshow/84119574.cms||Prasad Joshi

Were you sweating in anxiety after a glass of milk fell from you hands? If yes, the signs are ominous. You are diagnosed of suffering from serious superstitions. A survey conducted by Saurashtra university’s psychology department on 1,260 people in both urban and rural areas to gauge people’s belief in superstitious beliefs came up with predictable results — science and superstition are two faces of the same coin, especially for people of Saurashtra. They seem to have deep-rooted beliefs about everything being auspicious and inauspicious. The survey headed by HOD Yogesh Jogsan and associate professor, Dimpal Ramani found that people based their beliefs on a plethora of things including birds, animals, fruits, or flowers to classify anything under auspicious or inauspicious categories. Of the total people who were surveyed, 71 percent of rural people and 54 percent of urbanites were found to have strong beliefs about auspicious and inauspicious things. According to the survey, 89 percent people believe that if a cat crosses the road it’s inauspicious, while 87 percent would not cross a road if it had been earlier crossed by a snake! If 92 percent think birds’ incessant chatter could usher in something ominous and may create fight among family members, 95 percent wouldn’t let milk to spill as it would be a sign that some accident may happen in the near future. The list is endless. “This is blind faith, which is strongly adopted by the subconscious mind,” Ramani said, adding that there are several reasons for people to harbour such beliefs. These include unfortunate event in childhood, adverse situations, being unrealistic, or even not understanding the difference between expectation and ambition. “If something has happened to somebody it doesn’t mean it will happen to everybody,” Jogsan said. He added that modern science and psychology has proved these to be a kind of mental illness and can be cured after proper treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/superstitions-rule-the-roost-even-in-this-tech-age/articleshow/84123803.cms||---
---||Goa||Will not have any structures depicted on coastal plan: Govt||Panaji: In the run-up to the public hearing on July 8 on the draft coastal zone management plan (CZMP), the state environment department has said that no structures would be depicted on the final CZMP map at all. Any structures that have presently been depicted on the maps will be removed from the plan maps, the department has said. “As per decisions taken at the 254th meeting of the GCZMA, all the port limits that are shown in the CZMP shall be removed. No houses or structures will be shown. The hazard line that is shown in the draft management plan shall only be used as a tool to protect our coastal areas from natural and man-made disasters,” said GCZMA expert member Sujeet Kumar Dongre. Many opponents of the draft CZMP for Goa had alleged that only some structures along the state’s coast are on the maps prepared. The citizens had sought to know why some structures have been depicted in the plans, while others are not seen. Many owners of structures along the coast and traditional communities feared that their houses may face removal as they are not depicted on the CZMP. To eliminate confusion, the environment department has now said that no structures will be depicted. The CZMP will only depict the regulation lines like high, low tide and hazard lines and the CRZ-I, II, III and IV areas, and no-development zones. “The CZMP aims at safeguarding these fragile ecosystems that lie between marine and territorial zones,” the environment department has clarified. The GCZMA has taken the decision to remove port limits from the CZMP since the draft plan had many citizens express fears that it appeared that Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) could be expanding its activities to other coastal areas of Goa. The GCZMA has said that as MPT as well as other ports like those existing in Panaji are marked in a single colour code in the CZMP, this gave the wrong impression that MPT is taking over minor port areas as well. Therefore, to avoid confusion, all port limits depicted on the maps are being removed. “We have also taken a decision that the mangroves which have come up in the khazan areas shall not have any buffer areas,” Dongre said. Locals had feared that in khazan areas where the bunds have been breached by saline water causing mangrove overgrowth, many activities could be restricted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-not-have-any-structures-depicted-on-coastal-plan-govt/articleshow/84125875.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

This 35-year-old man who has been a hairdresser for the last 15 years was in a dilemma on how to survive when the lockdown was imposed. He tapped his bank of regular customers and now visits their houses for hair grooming.“I already had 10 to 15 permanent customers. But after I started providing home grooming, that rose to 100 customers. And I am quite content with my present life. As the customers feel that visiting parlours are not safe now, they call me home for services like hair cutting, facial, pedicure and head massaging. Mostly ladies above 50 seek my services,” said Deepu.Much to his satisfaction, he gets a better income too. Also, he can spend more time with his family. “While I was in a salon, I had to work from 9.00am to 9.00pm. Now, work time is flexible and I managed to earn an average of Rs 1,000 daily which is much better than my previous salary. Being the sole breadwinner of my family, I have to take care of them and also pay off my loans,” he added.The owner of a well-established beauty salon in the city has turned a room at her home into a bridal studio. Though a very popular name in the city, they too find it difficult to make the ends meet. Now, for survival, they totally rely on bridal customers. All other enquiries are avoided to ensure the safety of the bridal customers and staff. “We have to retain at least some of our employees and also pay the rent. Since it is not safe to visit homes, I thought of using a room in my house,” she added.Suhaz, a parlour owner and hairdresser, also visits homes near his house for haircutting. But his services are mostly restricted to men. Considering the safety issues, he focuses only on hair cutting.

With many of these patients under home isolation, the beds in most hospitals are vacant. Covid Care Centres started at public places are lying vacant even in rural areas. Total 22,590 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours in the region. This number is less than daily average of 30,000. But as markets close at 4 pm, the number of on-the-spot tests across the region has also dipped. As the number of new patients is going down, contact tracing too has limited scope. Gondia: Sunday saw no new Covid case or death, for the first time since the onset of the second wave in the district. Four patients recovered in the day. Now, the district has total 41,152 cases, 40,409 recoveries and 43 patients under treatment with 26 of them in home isolation. Gondia’s recovery rate is above 98%.

---||Dehradun||Twitter users dig up inaccurate map of ‘Undivided India’ shared by Dhami in 2015||DEHRADUN: On the day of Pushkar Singh Dhami’s swearing-in as the new CM of Uttarakhand on Sunday, netizens dug up an old tweet of his in which he had posted the image of a map of “akhand bharat” (undivided India), captioning it “every nation lover’s dream.” The tweet was done on August 14, 2015, a day before Independence Day. Several netizens pointed out that the map included parts of several of India’s neighbouring countries to the East, while PoK, Aksai Chin and even Ladakh were missing. “It is not showing Aksai Chin & PoK in Indian boundaries,” tweeted @TruthPrevail3, tagging @MumbaiPolice. A twitter handle named ‘Neerajn’ posted, “Why describe sovereign parts of J&K to Pak/China?” Only recently, several FIRs had been filed against Twitter as a map of India on its website showed Ladakh and J&K to be separate countries. In November last year, the Centre had warned Twitter India for showing Ladakh as part of China. In January this year, BBC had omitted Ladakh and J&K from India’s map in a report about the Delta variant of the coronavirus. It later removed the map and issued an apology. In February, India called out the World Health Organisation (WHO) for depicting a wrong map of India on its website, depicting J&K and Ladakh in a different shade than the rest of the country. Twitter users claimed that the map shared by Dhami, drawn in saffron, borders demarcated in white and a photo of ‘Bharat Mata’ in the centre, had no regard for international borders and for sharing it, the new CM should face action. Dhami took charge on Sunday, replacing Tirath Singh Rawat, who resigned, citing impending constitutional crisis since he would not be able to get elected to the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/twitter-users-dig-up-inaccurate-map-of-undivided-india-shared-by-dhami-in-2015/articleshow/84121866.cms||Gaurav Talwar

On January 19, during a video conference with ministers from 20 states, Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari had said that it is compulsory for all states to implement the amended M V Act, which came into force across the country on September 1, 2019. “Giving any relaxation to implement the act does not arise because the whole idea behind enacting the act is to bring new culture among Indians and to cultivate good driving habits,” Gadkari had said and added that the PM Narendra Modi-led government had enacted the act very consciously. However, the proposal to implement it was kept in abeyance in January as BJP politicians and functionaries felt that most roads in the state are in a bad shape. This time, the implementation has been kept pending because the state BJP unit felt that it would put additional burden on the people in the state during the pandemic. Sources said that there is apprehension in BJP that the implementation of the stiff hikes might go against the party for the upcoming assembly polls as the road condition is bad. The transport department had moved a proposal to the chief minister’s office to bring it before the cabinet for approval to implement the amended M V Act with “bare minimum” fines for traffic violators. As the proposal was moved, BJP requested chief minister Pramod Sawant to keep the proposal on hold. In April, the state government had notified penalties for violations under the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, which was to come into force in Goa from May 1. However, after BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade demanded that its implementation be kept in abeyance, the state government put it in cold storage. Some states, including Gujarat and Uttarakhand, had raised concerns about some of the hiked fines and had lowered penalties for certain traffic violations. Later, the Centre had announced that no state government could lower the traffic penalties below the prescribed level, as the Act was a parliamentary legislation and state governments could not pass any law or take executive action unless the President’s assent was obtained to the related state law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wont-implement-amended-mv-act-till-polls-over-govt/articleshow/84125917.cms||Murari Shetye

Prakhar Gupta, a final year BTech student who will pass out in 2021, has been hired by Goldman Sachs. “Till now, our students’ highest package was Rs 15.9 lakh per annuam, as our placement cell records. This is the highest package offered to our student till date. Many other tech institutes may see its students bagging higher pay packages, but the package bagged by Prakhar is a big amount for a new and growing NIT like ours,” said director Gopal Mugeraya. He said that it also came as a pleasant surprise at a time when the world has been hit by a pandemic. “We believe in preparing our students for the profession and not the job. But this is encouraging. Even in Covid conditions, students appeared for campus interviews virtually and got jobs. Such packages are often seen for placements abroad, but this offer is significant as it is for an Indian placement for a core job,” Mugeraya said. More than 45 companies participated in the placement drives during the 2020-21 academic year at NIT Goa. The companies included names like Samsung, Siemens, JSW, Mphasis, L&T, Tata Power, Reliance, Nokia and Infosys, among others. Companies who held their drives virtually included Goldman Sachs, Wipro, TCS, Sapient, and Knowlarity communication. “More than 90% of our BTech 2021 batch has received placement offers, and placement drives are still going on. The highest package offered to an MTech student was Rs 14.3 lakh per annum. Also, two PhD scholars have been selected by C-DAC Pune with a CTC of Rs 9.1 lakh per annum,” said Mugeraya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/student-at-nit-goa-bags-rs-20l/yr-offer/articleshow/84125938.cms||---

The residents of Tuem had alleged that a compound wall constructed by IDC in February 2017 blocked a motorable public access through the property connecting their locality to the main road from Tuem to Mapusa. They had filed the complaint under Section 2(d) of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, stating that their rights had been violated. “The remedy for the complainants is by way of approaching the civil court and not the human rights commission,” the commission held. Tuem locals knocked on the doors of the commission to have the compound wall removed or the gate be kept open for the public in interest of justice. The Industrial Development Corporation submitted to the commission that after acquiring the property, it constructed the compound wall and gates to safeguard and protect the interests of the parties who are running their industries. It submitted that it closed the gate at the insistence of Mandrem MLA Dayanand Sopte to protect the area. The commission held that the complainants didn’t produce any public documents such as survey plans to show the existence of an access through the properties of the industrial estate.

Also, far fewer health workers got infected during the second wave compared to the first one.  KEM Hospital that has catered to nearly 7,000 Covid patients recorded 1,110 infections among its staffers since last year. Of them, 744 were April to December last year, the other 366 were detected till June this year. Of 744 cases last year, 30% were among resident doctors and interns, 24% in nursing staff and 17% among class IV staffers. There were two deaths last year, but neither of people directly dealing with patients. Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said that vaccination played a crucial role in minimizing hospitalisation and deaths in the second wave, while in the first, clear communication and swift implementation of infection control practices helped curb infection in frontline warriors.  The hospital’s community medicine department that reviewed the 744 cases of 2020 found that though the first healthcare worker tested positive in KEM on April 9, most cases were reported in May (179) and June (178) 2020. Infections fell by August to less than 100.  Initially, ratio of people quarantined behind every positive case in the hospital was 1:15. “But things began to improve as we understood the methods of transmission better,” said Dr Gajanan Velhal, head of community medicine. It was found that high-risk contacts of positive health staff were sharing rooms, having food together, talking without masks on. “As infection control practices were firmed up and quarantine norms better understood, infections started to fall...,” Dr Velhal said. Other medical colleges saw similar decline. Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion Hospital, said they had few hospitalisations of healthcare staff in the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fewer-health-workers-hit-in-second-wave-kem-study/articleshow/84125923.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In the weeks earlier, daily deaths had dropped to an average of 14-16 in the city. Among other districts, Kolhapur recorded the highest cases (1,850) and deaths (40) on Sunday. However, on a positive note, not a single case or death was reported from Malegaon city and Gondia district on Sunday. Mumbai added 24 deaths and 553 cases on Sunday. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said he has asked the medical colleges and major Covid hospitals to analyse the deaths. “We have noticed a marginal rise in deaths. In several cases, we found that critical patients were referred from private hospitals at the last stage,” he added. Nine of those who died were between 40-60 years and 14 patients were above the age of 60. On Sunday, 123 new deaths and 183 reconciled mortalities were added to push the state’s overall toll to 1,23,030. However, there was a marginal drop in new detections as the state added 9,336 new cases. Of the total 123 deaths across the state, Kolhapur circle contributed 59 deaths in the last 24 hours. Kolhapur is now the only district with a weekly positivity rate of more than 10%. The situation seems to be improving in MMR as apart from Mumbai and Raigad (3), 10 other cities did not report a single death. Nagpur circle reported only two deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daily-toll-remains-above-20-in-city-kolhapur-sees-max-cases-deaths/articleshow/84125977.cms||---

Soon, one can get a taste of food that was popular three to four generations ago but faded out of the daily menu as industrialisation of agriculture took centrestage. City agricultural scientists are helping revive the foods that provided nutritional support to our forefathers. Scientists at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (Icrisat) at Patancheru have helped prepared a manifesto based on the lists of foodgrains, vegetables, fruits and oil seeds that were widely cultivated about 100 to 150 years ago and needed revival. Some were popular as recent as four to five decades ago. The list also includes leafy vegetables, fruits and vegetables that are fast disappearing from the farmers’ priority crops. According to scientists, tuber crops like sweet potato and yam and pulses like red gram and masoor dal (lentils) are losing popularity and grains like sorghum has already made it to the “forgotten foods” list. It may sound strange but even popular potato, jackfruit, tamarind and custard apple are losing their sheen as preferred foodstuff. Some of the foods popular during great grandpa’s time were grain amaranth, buckwheat, chenopods, finger millet, foxtail millet, proso millet, kodo millet, barnyard millet, rice bean, moth bean, adzuki bean, faba bean, horse gram, taro, cassava, sweet potato, yams, Jewish plum, sea buckthorn, Job’s tears, paradise tree, spine gourd, sweet hibiscus, amaranth, grass pea, wood apple, star fruit, Indian jujube, rai, lafa, water lily, lotus and bamboo. The Icrisat team, among scientists from other research bodies, have prepared the regional manifesto as part of the global manifesto for submission at the UN Food Systems Summit later this year. These foods are not only nutritious but also solve food shortage. Last month, Icrisat scientists participated in an international seminar on grandpa’s foods in the run-up to the UN summit. Joanna Kane-Potaka, assistant director-general, Icrisat, said: “Forgotten foods have the potential to fix several problems that our food systems face today and will face in the future as the world’s population grows, climate uncertainty becomes more common and diet-related diseases rise. It is time that we rid them of their ‘forgotten’ tag and embrace them to realize the change we wish to see, with farmers at the centre of change for bringing back biodiversity.” Dr Ravi Khetrapal, executive secretary, Asia Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions, said the manifesto developed by collective action will soon lead to a global plan of action to mainstream these foods. “The key now is to have a good communication strategy to ensure awareness of forgotten foods and to make policy interventions to transform agri-food research and innovation systems,” he said. Historical data shows that people in the past had cultivated and consumed a wide variety of food crops, which had high nutrition value. However, because of modern, industrialized agriculture and consequent changes in policies and food habits, many have moved away from traditional foods. These have now almost become forgotten food.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-experts-reviving-grandpas-healthy-food/articleshow/84129086.cms||Syed Akbar

After the state government lifted the lockdown, it was the second Sunday mass attended by residents of the thickly-populated Secunderabad area. During the mass, the preacher, Reverand K James Cecil Victor, spoke about continuing to follow Covid-19 appropriate behavior even as the second wave has receded. “Ever since the pandemic erupted, it has been taking different shapes and forms and it has come in different waves. Already, there are reports about a possible third wave. So, we need to be aware of these developments in order to protect ourselves and others,” informed Reverand K James Cecil Victor. The Times of India’s (TOI) initiative— Preparing Hyderabad for a New Normal— aimed at educating people on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, received a positive response from participants. Devotees agreed that even those vaccinated need to be careful in public places — wear masks, follow social distancing norms and sanitise regularly. A quiz conducted by the TOI enlightened devotees about additional information on Covid-19. “I was certainly not aware about a couple of questions that were asked during the quiz. I am very happy that TOI has taken the initiative of spreading awareness among people. I believe such drives should be taken up across the city,” said Sulochona J, retired professor of Osmania University B Ed College. During the quiz, some residents unanimously responded to a few questions and reiterated that Covid-19 protocols such as wearing mask, social distancing and regular sanitisation must be followed by people. “Within the church premises, the Covid-19 protocols are followed well. We have to continue to keep our guard up to keep everyone around us safe,” said Rose Mary, principal of St John’s High School. The church authorities also organised a vaccination drive after the campaign for the residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-let-guard-down-cautions-church/articleshow/84126072.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||National lockdown not best option: Ex-health secretary K Sujatha Rao||HYDERABAD: The concept of a lockdown, which was a unique contribution of the Chinese to contain the public health emergency, was a drastic decision taken without considering data or other successful models available in the world, according to former secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, K Sujatha Rao. Speaking at the public discourse forum Manthan on the topic ‘India’s Public Policy Response to the Pandemic’ on Sunday, the former bureaucrat explained in detail the two different models — implemented in China, Taiwan and South Korea — and their impact on the social, economic and other social aspects on people. “Although we can have lockdowns in areas where cases are emerging in small clusters, a national-level lockdown, announced in March last year, was a big mistake. It had huge consequences, both economically, socially in terms of relationships, psychological stress that people have been put to, education has been completely disrupted and the worst is the humanitarian crisis that came as a consequence of the migrants,” Rao added. With her extensive experience in the public health space, the ex-health secretary said in the Chinese model, they first imposed a lockdown in Wuhan in January, 2020, and then subsequently in other parts of the country wherever they saw clusters emerging. “This concept of lockdown, where you bring the social, economic and every other aspect of living to a complete halt was adopted by India and almost every other country without thinking of the consequences, while the other model, which was contributed by Taiwan and South Korea, was not considered despite being successful in containing the disease,” she said. Right in the first phase of January 2020, Taiwan and South Korea closed international borders and adopted a strategy of massive testing. Overall, they have been successful in containing the incidence, prevalence levels and mortality rates. “The decision of nationwide lockdown was taken when there were only about 500-odd cases and about 10 deaths on March 23. Nobody knows what was the evidence that was provided to take such a drastic decision except one modelling study, which according to a friend who was involved in it, showed alarming statistics and I think that’s what put the PM in panic mode and therefore the drastic action of imposing a lockdown was taken,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/natl-lockdown-not-best-option-ex-health-secy/articleshow/84126061.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay to relax norms on campus, post-vaccine||MUMBAI: Two weeks after it conducted a campus vaccination drive, IIT-Bombay has decided to relax a few lockdown norms. From Monday, mess in larger hostels and canteens, some of which were only distributing meals, will allow dine-in options. A soft quarantine period of seven days will be allowed, instead of 14, for partially-vaccinated students who are travelling back to the campus or for those who stay outside the campus for more than a day. A negative RT-PCR test report will also be sought from such students. Final-year students are likely to be called to the campus this month, though it will be voluntary.  “With most students partially vaccinated by now, the campus is planning to take gradual and cautious steps to relax some of the norms. Students’ safety will remain top priority. For the campus residents, the government norms will be applicable, but we are lifting some restrictions in the hostel area,” said Tapanendu Kundu, dean, students’ affairs, adding dine-in options in a few larger hostels will be available with some conditions.  With strict lockdown rules, several students have undergone over three to four full quarantine of 14 days each. This has also added to their mental stress, said a professor. Some rules are being relaxed by taking all precautions. Students who go outside the campus but return on the same day will not be quarantined. From their experience in the last few months, the authorities have found a seven-day quarantine could be helpful too. It is only for students returning to campus, he added. In an article in the campus magazine, Insight, the students have mentioned that labs are expected to open too. “Final-year students will remain top priority like before (for the campus reboot committee). Other students will be called only when the cases continue to fall and a significant percentage of campus residents and incoming students have been fully vaccinated,” the article states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-to-relax-norms-on-campus-post-vaccine/articleshow/84126075.cms||Yogita Rao

The incident has been recorded as adverse event following immunization (AEFI) on the Co-Win system, though Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) hasn’t shown this in its vaccination data as yet. The civic body has informed the government, and is so far considering it only as a ‘suspected AEFI death’ on the grounds that it took place 30 minutes after inoculation. One AEFI each has been recorded on June 28 and July 1 in the district, which has been flitting between record vaccination numbers and no doses. Details of the other two AEFIs are not available. Saturdays case is the first death to be reported and recorded as AEFI in Nagpur since the start of vaccination drive in January this year. The deceased had allegedly hidden history of chest pain before taking the second dose, claim officials. The deceased was rushed to IGGMCH by relatives, who were initially reluctant to give consent for post mortem. Relatives were explained the guidelines for deaths taking place within 72 hours of vaccination and then they agreed. As per central government guidelines, post mortem (PM) is mandatory in case a beneficiary dies after vaccination. As per the guidelines, IGGMCH performed the PM in the presence of two forensic experts and one pathologist beside video recording it. The histopathology report would also be prepared, which may take some time, said IGGMCH forensic medicine department officials. Deputy medical superintendent (corona patient care) Dr Sagar Pandey said, “The death has been reported under the AEFI column on Co-Win App. He was brought dead around two hours after receiving his second dose. He had history of chest pain for last some days. The community medicine department will send a detailed AEFI report to NMC.” Public health department officials said it was probably a case of myocardial infarction (MI), also known as heart attack. Given the history of chest pain for last three-four days, they said the mortality is unlikely to be related to vaccination as such. “He had allegedly hidden his history of chest pain. If he had informed the UPHC centre, they would have asked him to avoid vaccination. In such cases, expert opinion is necessary. In this case, the opinion of a cardiologist was important,” they said.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad Cricket Association ombudsman disqualifies five apex council members||HYDERABAD: Ombudsman Justice (retd) Deepak Verma on Sunday ‘temporarily disqualified’ five apex council members of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) — vice-president K John Manoj, secretary R Vijayanand, joint secretary Naresh Sharma, treasurer Surender Agarwal and councillor P Anuradha. He also quashed the suspension of Mohammed Azharuddin and directed him to continue as president of the cricket body. “I would like to make it clear that, just because these five members believe on their own accord that I am not ombudsman does not take away my powers which have now been confirmed by the HC judgment and the minutes of the 85th AGM as well. These members cannot evade the due process of law just by stating that they don’t agree to my appointment. It is clear from the above, that these members have malafide intentions and do not want smooth functioning of HCA. It for this reason and reasons mentioned above, I hereby direct that these members are temporarily disqualified from performing their duties as office bearers of the apex council till the time these complaints attain finality. These complaints will finally be decided after conducting an online hearing within three weeks from now. The exact date and details of the online hearing shall be provided in due course,” Justice Verma wrote in his 16-page order. Justice Verma also defended his appointment as ombudsman. “The high court order and the minutes of 85th AGM make it clear that I am ombudsman of HCA and will remain the same till the time any superior court of law stays the same or passes an adverse order to that effect. Therefore, the plea taken by the five members that I am not to assume the powers of ombudsman is untenable and is incorrect,” he said. The suspension of Azharuddin, Justice Verma said, has no legal validity. “As mentioned in Section 41 (1) (a) and Section 41 (1) (b) of the Constitution of HCA, any grievance, complaint or dispute has to be decided by referring the same to ombudsman. Since the said complaint against Azharuddin was not forwarded to ombudsman and in effect not decided by the ombudsman, the same has no legal validity. Apex council on its own accord cannot take such a decision. “Therefore, I deem it appropriate to set aside the resolution (if any) passed by these five members in suspending the duly elected president, issuing a showcause notice and direct them to refrain from any subsequent actions against president of HCA Mohd Azharuddin. Therefore, I direct that Mohd Azharuddin shall continue as president and all complaints against the office-bearers shall only be decided by the ombudsman. He also rapped the officials for indulging in ‘political games’. “From the aforesaid facts and features, it is clearly reflected that instead of encouraging the game of cricket, each one is playing their own politics for the reasons best known to them. Thus, it defeats the very purpose for which HCA has been formed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-ombudsman-disqualifies-five-apex-council-members/articleshow/84128158.cms||Solomon S Kumar

Nazareth said that dengue cases were far less this year compared with previous years when 15-20 cases would be reported every week. “The less number of cases is due to good surveillance and robust measures undertaken by our staff along with panchayat members. There has been no spill-over of cases unlike last year,” the health officer said. Anti-container drives and anti-larval measures have helped reduce breeding of the aedes mosquitoes. “The aedes mosquito is a day biter and an infected mosquito can bite 15-20 people and thus infect them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-dengue-cases-reported-in-calangute/articleshow/84128203.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Pandemic or not, vehicle sales robust in Hyderabad, districts||HYDERABAD: Even as the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a nationwide lockdown and hit livelihood of lakhs of people in Hyderabad and elsewhere, data from the transport department shows it had very minimal impact on vehicle sales in the state. Despite the economic slowdown, the vehicle sales graph in the state shows that people preferred personal transport over public transport. An analysis of sales from the pre-Covid 2019-20 period and when Covid was at its peak shows that Hyderabadis did not stop buying their fancy cars and two-wheelers, which some experts say is a sign that people are now opting for more personalised vehicles and shunning public transport. Indicating robust scenario in sales in the month of June this year, when the lockdown was in place for 20 days, about 50,432 two-wheelers and 11,561 four-wheelers, including the latest sedans and hatchbacks, were sold. In September 2019-20, Telangana sold some 40,000 two-wheelers and 9,179 four-wheelers. During June 2020-21, vehicle registration of 8,372 vehicles took place. The graph of other vehicles also reflects the same scenario. In the month of June, during last three years (2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22), a total of 11,941, 11,195 and 11,670 vehicles were sold, respectively. The lowest vehicle sales were observed in the month of April 2020- 21 where only 213 two-wheelers and only three four-wheelers were sold due to strict lockdown. In the following month of May, with lockdown still on, the numbers quickly jumped to 30,359 (two-wheelers) and 2,547 four-wheelers. K Narsimha Murty, director of national stock exchange and finance expert, says that vehicle sale figures during different scenarios of Covid-19 are clear reflection of both natural vehicle demand and increasing awareness to personal transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-or-not-vehicle-sales-robust-in-hyd-districts/articleshow/84126112.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

They also advised vaccination of all eligible people and participation of the public in controlling the pandemic through Covid Appropriate Behaviour. Disaster risk governance specialist Amit Tandon, and public health expert Dr Shailaja Gaikwad from Unicef and RedR submitted Covid-19 Third Wave Management Plan to Nagpur Municipal Corporation recently. Tandon told TOI, “Some global best practices suggest testing 200-300 (unique) tests per day per 1 lakh population, depending on the caseload.” Tandon added that testing of transient populations will also be very beneficial. “Testing of people running shops, vendors, home delivery boys etc who meet multiple people daily should be done once in a fortnight. Owners of these establishments along with private and government offices should take responsibility of their own people. If they manage to test and isolate symptomatic or infected person, it will help contain the spread,” he said. Tandon also said “Slum Task Force should be appointed in association with NGOs.” As per data of district civil surgeon, average daily testing of the district was 9,150 in June and 6,821 in city. As per experts, there should be 10,546-15,819 tests per day in district and 5,800-8,700 per day in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-15k-tests-daily-per-district-is-ideal-say-experts-to-keep-3rd-wave-low/articleshow/84126110.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Hyderabad||Local companies cash in on cold chain equipment||Hyderabad: Cold chain system for Covid-19 vaccine has spurred local businesses to cash in on equipment maintaining low temperatures due to dependence on import of these gadgets. A few local companies are now venturing into making commercial refrigeration appliances (CRAs), which include vaccine freezers, coolers, and medical freezers needed in the cold chain. Vaccine freezers maintain sub zero temperatures to store vaccine vials. For CRA, World Health Organization (WHO) approval is must. “Labs to test these equipment are in countries like Denmark. Once the lab approves the product, WHO permission is granted,” city-based Rockwell Industries managing director Ashok Kumar Gupta said. “Using the internet of things, we build CRA, we had to spend about Rs 60 lakh and a year time for obtaining approvals. We have supplied to more than 200 hospitals,” he added. Currently, CRA equipment is being imported from countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, China, the US, Japan, Canada and South Korea. The cost of these freezers and other essential equipment needed would range between Rs 45,000 and Rs 3 lakh for private centres running vaccine drives, including Covid-19. “Vaccine drives will go up in districts too soon as a large proportion of population are yet to get vaccinated. We had purchased a Hyderabad-based company’s vaccine freezer as we want to provide vaccines of foreign companies as well,” Dr T Narsinga Reddy of Jaya Hospitals, Warangal, said. “Looking at the demand, big companies are tying up with foreign companies to manufacture equipment locally, but by obtaining proper certification native companies can offer cost-effective solutions,” Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, director, Centre for Health Care Management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), said. Some companies in Hyderabad were still initiating research, while a few in Chennai have begun manufacturing CRAs, he added. In the post-Covid-19 scenario, support for micro enterprises might diminish. They should scale themselves up to medium and small level. They need to invest on research and development and obtain special permissions, former director of Telangana Industrial Health Clinic Limited Yerram Raju Behara said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/local-companies-cash-in-on-cold-chain-equipment/articleshow/84126136.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Tigers try to reclaim lost habitat in Telangana forests||HYDERABAD: In what seems like a scene straight out of the latest Bollywood potboiler ‘Sherni’ that deals with man-animal conflict in India, tigers in Telangana’s Kumuram Bheem Asifabad district are trying hard to reclaim their territory, even as villagers continue to encroach the wild cats’ habitat. Villagers confirmed multiple sightings in the deeply forested area, which is now fast being devoured by humans. The latest photograph of one such sighting shows the tiger, suspected to be A2, sitting in the forest, which has seen increasing migration of tigers from neighbouring Maharashtra, but the land is being encroached by the day. Sightings have been reported in Kondapalli, Digida and Lodpalli villages of the district, triggering panic among locals and farmers who say two tribal youths were killed by the tiger last year and cattle kills have been reported every week. “The villagers see the tiger almost every alternate day. There are several instances where agricultural labourers have spotted the tiger, while they were grazing cattle,” said Nimma Mallanna, a resident of Kondapalli village. Forest officials TOI spoke to confirmed that the big cat was moving in the forest fringes and have urged the locals to be cautious. “We have requested farmers not to venture deep inside the forest and stop encroaching forest land for agriculture, which is the main cause of increasing man-animal conflicts in the region. The tiger is just trying to save its dwindling habitat,” said a top forest department official. “In one village out of the 40, at least 2,000 acres of forest land has been encroached. So you know the extent in other places,” he added. Forest officials say nearly 40 villages that fall in the tiger corridor of the district are currently affected by man-animal conflicts. “We are witnessing incidents where people who are not aware of the wild animal conflicts are entering forest areas for agricultural activities. Our staff has been constantly working towards conducting awareness campaigns and counselling people who are entering forest areas, to avoid any untoward incidents,” district forest official S Shantharam told TOI. Local villagers claim that the problem of forest land encroachment is mainly due to authorities not conducting a survey to demarcate forest area from the revenue land. “Podu (agriculture) lands have been there in the forest for over 40 years, but from 2010, there are some new encroachments inside the forest area. There is about 1,600 acres of revenue land and 2,000 acres of forest land in this area. The encroachment is happening because the authorities have not conducted any survey to mark a boundary to separate these lands,” said Kondapalli sarpanch Sanjeev Upasi. Wildlife experts working in the region say the situation in this forest area depicts heart-wrenching scenes of the tiger struggling to reclaim its territory that is now under dispute due to the politics, history and geography of the land. “The pressure of politics, forest land encroachment, construction of rail line and a national highway in the tiger corridor and its path in between Asifabad and Kawal tiger reserve, all fall on the tiger which ultimately made a villain in such scenarios. We need to come up with amicable solutions that benefit the tigers as well as villagers who depend on each other to safeguard the forests for our future generations,” said one source close to the forest department. Tigers come to Asifabad mostly from Tadoba and Tippeshwar tiger reserves in Maharashtra and from Indravati tiger reserve from Chhattisgarh. To avoid man-animal conflicts and road kills, the forest department had proposed eight underpasses for the four-lane national highway that passes through the tiger corridor, but not even one underpass has been taken up yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tigers-try-to-reclaim-lost-habitat-in-t-forests/articleshow/84129092.cms||Moulika.KV

Cops booked the aunt for hiding the crime and aborting her pregnancy. The girl’s maternal aunt lodged a complaint at Puna police station when she learnt about the crime. Police said that the 17-year-old girl, who lived with her paternal aunt, Priya (name changed) and her husband Soheb (name changed), was raped two days before Diwali last year by Soheb’s brother Rajak (name changed). Rajak, a native of Jharkhand, had come to Surat during Diwali in search of a job. The minor had told her aunt about the crime, but instead of acting on it, the woman tried to hide it. Things turned worse for the girl during Holi this year when Rajak again raped her and later Soheb too committed the heinous crime. Despite being informed, the aunt once again did not do anything. However, this time the girl became pregnant due to the rape. Noticing the physical changes, the minor’s maternal aunt became suspicious and asked her about it recently. According to the police, after the girl revealed her ordeal, the maternal aunt confronted Priya about it. “The accused woman brushed it off saying that she will take the girl to a doctor and get her examined,” said a police official. However, Priya later gave the girl a tablet which led her to suffer miscarriage. When the girl’s aunt got to know about the miscarriage, she took the girl to Puna police station to lodge a complaint. “We have detained two main accused and have kept them under quarantine for Covid-19 test. We will interrogate them after their report arrives and unearth more details from them,” said assistant commissioner of police R K Zala. The duo works as casual labourers.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: No shoulder to cry on, more parents ending up at old age homes||HYDERABAD: An increasing number of aged parents in the city are being abandoned by their children, ever since the pandemic began. This was disclosed at a programme organised on Sunday by Caring Hands Charitable Trust at Falaknuma to create awareness among people with regard to the importance of caring for the elderly. Experts said that an increasing number of old parents in the Old City are being shifted to old age homes. Taking strong exception to children’s attitude towards their aged parents, Mir Mohtesham Ali Khan, Mr World silver medallist, said that parents must be respected and taken good care of especially when they reach an old age, but the attitude towards them is contrary in today’s society. He urged people not to leave their parents alone or shift them to old age homes. “Many elderly parents are forced to leave home by their own children. Such children feel that their parents become a burden when they get old or fall ill. Keeping parents away from home in their difficult time is a matter of concern which needs to be dealt with seriously,” said Khan, who had lunch with the elderly at Fatima Old Age Home. He added that a few parents at the old age home were even dropped there by their children who had told them that they will pick them up later, but were abandoned. Mubeen Fatima, director, Fatima Old Age Home and Mohammed Wasif, general secretary of the home, told reporters that they have started an awareness programme to educate people about the value of parents. They said many parents had been shifted to the home during the lockdown and since then the number of calls for new admissions has only increased. “Many elderly parents were moved to the home during the pandemic. We fail to understand the mind-set of people who keep insisting us to allow their old parents shelter at the home,” said Mubeen Fatima. Parents at the home said that their children’s negligence drove them to take shelter at the home. “I have a son and a daughter-in-law but their negligence and lack of care drove me here,” said an upset Zulekha Banu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-shoulder-to-cry-on-more-parents-ending-up-at-old-age-homes/articleshow/84126162.cms||---

District forest officer of Coimbatore division D Venkatesh said that the study, ‘Identification of Native Fodder Grasses and Developing Mass Multiplication techniques’, aims to prevent elephant-human conflict. The scientists aim to document native fodder grasses and fodder trees in the Coimbatore division. They will also assess the nutritive value of grasses and trees, and standardize mass-multiplication technology for such plants. As many as 29 native fodder grass species, including summer grass, broom grass and signal grass were documented in Sirumugai forest. Slips of the grasses were collected and raised in a nursery for mass multiplication studies. As many as 14 native fodder tree species were documented. Seeds of giant thorny bamboo (Bambusa bambos) and sacred fig (Ficus religiosa) were collected and were sown in the nursery. Seedlings of Malabar plum (Syzygium cumini), portia tree (Thespesia populnea), white teak (Gmelina arborea), anjan (Hardwickia binata) and mahuwa (Madhuca latifolia) were planted in the mother garden as fodder bank and also for mass multiplication studies. Leaf samples and plant parts from 29 grass species and 14 tree species were shade-dried and powdered for characterizing nutritional and anti-nutritional values.

Harmara police have filed an FIR under Section 420 (cheating), 379 (theft), and 12B (criminal conspiracy). Police said that the FIR was registered on Saturday in which the man claimed that he had married the woman, identified as Rekha on April 30. Four days later, he returned home and found that her 14-year-old daughter from the first marriage was beaten up by her new wife. She later allegedly threatened to file false cases against him too. “The man alleged that she fled with money and mobile phones. All the persons she introduced as her relatives are not responding. We received the FIR on Saturday and the case is currently under investigation,” said the investigation officer (IO) in the case, Ganesh. Jaipur police, however, said that they are also investigating if the case is related solely to criminal cheating or borne out of domestic dispute. According to police, the man claimed in his complaint that his first wife had died last year, following which a lot of relatives had advised him to get married again so that his two kids could be taken care of. Around the same time, he came into contact with one Shyam Sundar while traveling on a bus.

Police said MP based Bunty Patidar had targeted jeweller Shailendra Pandey’s store in Dahisar due to its proximity to the Western Express Highway as that would facilitate a quick escape. Patidar and Pramod Atriya, 24, were arrested from Pithampur, 30 kms from Indore. On July 30, three assailants-- Ayush SP, Nikhil Chandal and Uday Bali-- had barged into Pandey’s Om Sai Raj Jewellers and fired two rounds at close range, killing him. They fled with 30 tolas of gold jewellery. Police said Patidar had arranged for the assailants, who are all MP based, provided them with weapons and got them to practice shooting in MP jungles for weeks before the robbery. "Four months ago, the assailants had tried to loot a store in Gujarat but their plan did not take off. Eventually, they had to make do with stealing two cars, one of which ran out of fuel while they were driving the vehicles down to MP. The gang was keen to strike again and this time, make it a success," said a police officer. Patidar came down to Mumbai a month ago where he and the other mastermind of the case, Chirag Rawal, went to look for a target for the heist. It was decided that Rawal and his associate, Ankit Mahadik, who are both Mumbai based, would keep 40% of the loot while Patidar and the assailants would get a 60% share. The assailants arrived in Mumbai two days prior to the robbery and stole a scooter to reach the jewellery store. But just the night before, Patidar called them up and instructed that Pandey was to be shot first and the store robbed later, else the jeweller could activate an electronic lock and bolt the store. After the murder and robbery, the assailants abandoned the scooter in Kashimira and hired a car to travel to Surat where they hid at a relative’s house. Police picked up the three assailants, besides Rawal and Mahadik, within a day of the incident on July 1. While one of the weapons was found dumped in a marshland near Surat, the police are hunting for the other. “We will question Patidar further to establish if he had any other motive for getting Pandey killed besides the robbery,” said senior inspector Pravin Patil. Police said Rawal who lives in an apartment at Dahisar assisted his father at their switch-making factory in Vasai while Mahadik is a delivery boy with a food app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/jeweller-killing-mastermind-aide-traced-to-mp-arrested/articleshow/84126244.cms||Nitasha Natu

Admission for the 6,000 seats in the undergraduate courses will be based on merit, while for the BTech courses, the JEE Main scores will be considered. The undergraduate students will also have to take an interest-profiling test. Entry to the diploma programmes will be on the basis of a common entrance test. With the integration of the existing World Skill Centre, GB Pant Engineering College and the various polytechnics, DSEU will have 13 campuses in the city. Speaking at a press conference, Neharika Vohra, vice-chancellor of the university, said, “The university has been formed with the express aim of changing the entire paradigm of skilling. The whole idea is about how we make skilling aspirational and how we become a partner in upskilling and reskilling our nation and helping industry in that process.” The admission process will be fully online through DSEU’s centralised admission portal. The university will support the candidates throughout the application process via helpline numbers (18003093209) for admission-related queries and another helpline, 011-41169950, for technical assistance in filling the forms and for admission counselling via institutes, social media platforms and on virtual walk-in and helpdesk. Describing the newly launched flagship courses, Vohra said, “The university aspires to support entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship directly. Our courses are industry embedded and there are partnerships and linkages in diploma and undergraduate degree programmes through which we will prepare each student to face the world and assist them in gaining employable skills for industry.” The Personality, Entrepreneurial Mindset and General Ability Test (PEGTM) for undergraduate students will help aspirants choose the course they are most suited for. The test will, however, not have any implications for the selection process. Apart from Class XII marks, a certain weightage will also be given for extra-curricular activities and vocational subjects in the school. “We want the student to go and make a career in industry,” said Vohra. “For this, we would like the student to ascertain his or her interest before taking admission so that later they do not feel stuck in a vocation.” Industry experts are also part of the university and will collaborate with it. The university hopes to begin the academic year by September 6 if there are no disruptions caused by Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/6000-seats-up-for-grabs-as-entry-process-for-skills-varsity-kicks-off/articleshow/84156318.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: VNIT student patents machine to take drudgery out of all frying||NAGPUR: In case you are often worried about overcooking snacks, getting burns or stains while deep frying your food, here is a cool solution from VNIT’s mechanical engineering students. Keeping in mind the drudgery and hazards of frying food items, the researchers have designed and developed a multipurpose frying machine to deep fry any kind of snack, like poori, samosa, alubonda, sabudana wada etc, beside performing other tasks. The machine can also turn over all the items being fried in one go to maintain uniformity in cooking as well as texture. It can remove all the fried items from the frying section at one go. It has an arrangement to filter oil to get rid of debris. This maintains the quality of oil and fried products remain clean. The heating is hybrid in nature. Oil can be heated using electric coils or conventional burners of LPG cylinder. Side turning of items during frying is manual and the oil pumping is automatic. This machine can be upgraded to make it fully automatic as per the requirements. This product recently received a patent and is now available for order, said a press release by VNIT. Rashmi Uddanwadiker, associate professor at VNIT Nagpur, had submitted a proposal to Khadi and Industrial Village Commission (KVIC) to design and develop semi-automatic frying machine. Jitesh Deshmukh worked under Uddanwadiker as part of his MTech project. The work began with the identification of issues at a traditional frying station. Handling hot frying skimmers, handling oil with various pots, oil filtration, maintaining oil temperature for some fried items, and continuously turning over fried items with the help of frying skimmers or spoons one by one are some of the issues. All of these issues eventually lead to exhaustion of the cook when they have to operate non-stop. VC Bhujade, technical assistant, mechanical engineering department, assisted in the fabrication of the machine and was actively involved in testing the machine. Experiments showed that this new frying machine will be a milestone in Indian frying methods because of its advanced technique, said the press release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vnit-student-patents-machine-to-take-drudgery-out-of-all-frying/articleshow/84126237.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Nandkumar Kharat, 58, a retired assistant sub-inspector, is yet to be arrested. Kharat used to work at the Nirmal Nagar police station in Khar east as a ‘muddemaal karkoon’ (clerk). His job was to keep items recovered in various cases under lock and key and maintain a database. “Kharat was the custodian of recovered property between 2015 and 2020. After his retirement last year, another constable was appointed in his position. While taking stock, the new appointee could not find cash and gold worth Rs 21.6 lakh in the vault. He then reported the matter to superiors,” a senior police official said. The police station got in touch with Kharat, who stays in Kalyan, and asked him to appear before officials with the recovered property. “He was called on two occasions but failed to turn up. The property in his custody pertains to recoveries made in 133 different cases,” said the official. Eventually, an FIR was registered under section 409 of IPC (criminal breach of trust by public servant) against Kharat on Friday. Officers said a preliminary probe will be carried out before making an arrest. Police will investigate if Kharat has spent the money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-retd-cop-booked-for-stealing-muddemaal/articleshow/84126325.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: As Covid-19 warrior fights for his life, family starts crowdfunding for expensive treatment||NEW DELHI: Amit Gupta, a 39-year-old doctor with a Delhi government-run hospital who was at the forefront fighting the pandemic, has been battling the deadly disease himself since April. His family is in dire need of financial assistance and Delhi government has said that it will provide all the required help. Gupta was on Covid-19 duty at Satyawadi Raja Harish Chandra Hospital before he tested positive on April 22, a close aide of the family told TOI. He added that since no extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support was available in the capital, he had to be airlifted to Secunderabad as doctors advised a lung transplant. “The family has spent their entire savings on his treatment. So far, they have spent more than Rs 1 crore. They have also borrowed money from friends, relatives and other people. They have not received any support from the government, but we are keeping our fingers crossed,” said the aide. Desperate for financial assistance, the family has started a crowdfunding campaign. Gupta’s family has moved to Secunderabad to be with him and support him. “We had to pay Rs 35 lakh to get him there, which included Rs 10 lakh for ECMO and Rs 25 lakh for the airlift,” said the family aide. “He is still on ECMO and his condition is somewhat critical. We may do a lung transplant if his fever stabilises a bit. We will have a better update by tomorrow after doctors check on him,” said a spokesman of the hospital where Gupta is admitted. On May 18, health minister Satyendar Jain extended support to the family. “Spoke to the family of Dr Amit Gupta. Delhi government will bear the entire cost of his treatment. Our Corona Warriors are our strength,” he had said. A government spokesperson told TOI on Sunday, “Delhi government is standing beside Dr Amit Gupta and his family. We are with them in this difficult time. The process of providing financial assistance to the family is under way.” Sources said while the government gives compensation if a doctor or Corona Warrior dies in the line of duty, there are no provisions for providing financial assistance for treatment. That’s why it has been taking time to provide assistance to Gupta’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-covid-19-warrior-fights-for-his-life-family-starts-crowdfunding-for-expensive-treatment/articleshow/84126365.cms||---

The remaining work is expected to be completed soon. The 3.15km-long flyover would connect stock exchange building with Rainbow Colony on Trichy Road. To travel from Singanallur to Ukkadam, there would be a down ramp along Sungam bypass road. The work on the Rs 250 crore project had commenced in March 2019. A highways department official said, “The flyover has 119 slabs, of which only one is left to be completed. The slab which connects the main bridge with the down ramp at Sungam Junction is pending. It is different from the rest of the slabs. We have already designed it and staging work is going on.” As far as the main bridge was considered, he said, they had completed all the work near the stock exchange building side and bitumen laying work was going on. “Near Rainbow Colony, work to construct approach road is going on. The city corporation is moving its underground utilities from the centre of the road to the coroner, where approach road is coming up. The civic body has put the work on fast-track now.” Referring to the down ramp, the official said encroachments had to be cleared to continue the work. He said the eviction of encroachments was delayed because of the pandemic situation and the subsequent lockdown. “We can remove encroachments only after the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board allocates alternative accommodation to the encroachers. While 39 families have already vacated their houses and moved to the housing units of slum clearance board at Ukkadam and Keeranatham, the remaining 52 families have demanded allocation of flats at the upcoming housing unit at Pullu Kadu at Ukkadam. Encroachments could be removed only after they move to the housing unit when that is ready,” the official said. The flyover work would be completed within three months from the date of demolishing the remaining encroachments, he said. When ready, the flyover is expected to reduce both the travelling time and traffic congestion on the stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/trichy-road-flyover-work-on-fast-track/articleshow/84126282.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: No vaccination drive in several districts today||JAIPUR: Along with several other districts, Jaipur too will not see any Covid vaccination drive on Monday because of unavailability of doses. Vaccine unavailability has become a cause of concern for lakhs of beneficiaries who have become eligible for receiving the second dose in July. Since the first dose has been administered to more than 40% of the eligible 5.14 crore beneficiaries in the state, almost 75 lakh have become eligible for second dose this month. On the other hand, the state is expected to receive only 65 lakh doses this month from the Centre. For scaling up the second dose, the state government requires vaccines. Currently, several districts do not have vaccines to keep the drive moving. “In several districts, we do not have doses,” said Siddharth Mahajan, health secretary. In Jaipur too, more than 15 lakh beneficiaries have become eligible for second dose in July. “In the past five days, we have received only 64,000 doses. We have to keep the vaccination centres closed on Monday as we have not received any supply on Sunday,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer, Jaipur. On Sunday (till 6pm), 63,890 shots were administered out of which 3,318 were first doses and 20,572 second. The state government had already informed the Centre about doses required by the state in July. In a letter by health minister Raghu Sharma to his Union counterpart Harsh Vardhan, he demanded the Centre to increase the allocation of doses from 65 lakh to 1.5 crore this month as they require 75 lakh jabs for second dose. According to the health department official, they will not be able to vaccinate second dose to all eligible beneficiaries in July if the Centre does not increase the allocation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-vax-drive-in-several-districts-today/articleshow/84126294.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Project named after ex-Maharashtra CM fails to take off even after a decade||NAGPUR: Maharashtra celebrated the birth anniversary of former chief minister Vasantrao Naik on Thursday. However, a mega project announced by former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan in 2011 to celebrate Naik’s birth centenary is still on paper. Due to apathy by successive governments, the project never took off despite Rs 20 crore being sanctioned for it. The project is also referred to as a jinxed one by officials from the collectorate after it never saw the light of day as its location was changed from one place to another by political masters. After Chavan’s announcement, an auditorium was planned, but later, an amphitheater was added, and even impressive designs were prepared by former collector Ashwin Mudgal. However, the government again changed its area and the project remained on the paper till date. TOI had been regularly tracking the project’s journey by reporting on how it was skittled out after being finalized at Nagpur University’s land adjacent to its new administrative block. While paying homage to the former CM on Thursday, also celebrated as ‘Maharashtra Agriculture Day’, minister of state for public works Dattatraya Bharne directed the Nagpur Municipal Commissioner (NMC) Radhakrishnan B and collector Ravindra Thakare to provide land for the construction of an amphitheater as soon as possible. The minister held a online review meeting from Mumbai that was attended by former MLA Haribhau Rathore, divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare, collector, general administration department (GAD) deputy secretary JG Valvi, Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA) superintendent engineer Lila Upadhye and secretary Sankri Bhosle. “The ex-CM has made a great contribution in Maharashtra’s formation. Long time has passed for the construction of the amphitheater proposed to be built on his birth centenary. The NMC chief and collector should personally pay attention and make efforts for land availability,” Bharne said. When the project was initially announced by Chavan, it was actually an auditorium to be built in Naik’s memory in the city in 2011. Later, it was planned at Raj Bhavan, but locals moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court alleging loss of open space, after which it was dropped. The district administration then approached Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV) for land behind Mor Bhavan, but its executive council strongly opposed the proposal that further delayed the project. Former CM Devendra Fadnavis had proposed it at NU’s land behind its campus in 2015 and also promised release of Rs 20 crore. After the opening of the Suresh Bhatt Hall, the city’s political masters decided to build an amphitheatre, which the city was lacking. NU was not even consulted while changing the plans and even the dates of groundbreaking ceremony was finalized on July 5, 2018. It was only after TOI highlighted the issue on June 15, 2018, edition that the government was forced to defer the ceremony and alter the design to accommodate the auditorium. Since then, the project is in limbo, as per the officials.

Nasar inspected the ‘Aavin’ milk distribution across the district on Sunday around 4.30 am. He also interacted with the milk agents and the buyers at a few spots in the city. The minister further said that 1.5 lakh litres of milk sales increased every day in the state after the DMK government reduced the milk price ?3 per litre. “Thought the state government would face ?270 crore loss, CM Stalin fulfilled his poll assurance,” he said. When asked about the scams that took place during the AIADMK period, the minister stated that as many as 236 people had been appointed in the Aavin through middlemen. “Inquiry is going on and strict action would be initiated against the errant people,” he assured. The state is also planning to dismiss these 236 people. The minister warned the milk agents who sell the milk for higher rates than the prescribed rates. “We had sealed 22 milk parlours for selling higher than the stipulated rates in Chennai,” he added. The minister assured that steps would be taken to set up an ice cream factory in the Aavin premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-aavin-delivered-1-5-tonne-sweets-free-to-former-dairy-minister/articleshow/84126320.cms||---
---||Patna||Woman cancer patient arrested despite getting bail in similar case||PATNA: In what seems to be a blatant case of misuse of law, Patna police arrested a woman suffering from cancer the day she was granted anticipatory bail in almost a similar case of fraud lodged by the same retired IPS officer with the same police station against the accused and her husband. Pradeep Kumar Srivastava lodged the first FIR on January 19 and the second one on June 6 this year against Ajeet Kumar and his wife Sangeeta Srivastava with the Gardanibagh police station in the city, alleging that he had given altogether Rs97.8 lakh as loan to the couple between February and June, 2019 for Sangeeta’s treatment of cancer. The complainant alleged that when asked for repayment, Ajeet gave him altogether seven separate cheques and all bounced. The only substantial differences between the two FIRs were that the second one mentioned five additional cheques issued in March and April this year while the two earlier cheques of Rs10 lakh and Rs3 lakh were signed by Ajeet on September 17, 2020. Significantly, Ajeet died of Covid at a private hospital on May 4, before the second FIR was lodged against him. He was a truck and bus dealer and also owned a petrol pump. The court of district and sessions judge of Patna granted anticipatory bail to Sangeeta on June 30 in the first case with an observation that criminal liability for dishonoured cheques issued by dead husband can’t be shifted upon the petitioner, who is suffering from cancer. Most importantly, the court also observed that any offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act can’t be investigated by the police because it comes under the ambit of special Act. However, Sangeeta was arrested from her Patel Nagar residence on June 30 itself and was forwarded to judicial custody the next day after production before the court of ACJM Amlesh Kumar Singh. When asked, Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said its the discretion of the court that whom it forwards to jail and whom not in a case. “However, I will look into the FIRs and see what evidence is there against the woman,” he added. Pradeep had first alleged that the couple took a loan of Rs77.8 lakh from him between February and June in 2019. He alleged that cheques for Rs10 lakh and Rs3 lakh dated September 17, 2020 were issued by Ajeet but these were dishonoured due to insufficient balance in the bank account. This FIR was registered under Sections 406 and 420 of IPC and Section 138 of the NI Act. In the second FIR, Pradeep alleged that Ajeet issued him three cheques for Rs5 lakh, Rs9.8 lakh and Rs10 lakh dated April 9, one cheque of Rs11.22 lakh dated April 13 in his name and another cheque for Rs20 lakh dated March 28 in his wife Kiran Srivastava’s name, but all these were also dishonoured for insufficient balance. An additional Section 34 of IPC was invoked in the second FIR. In both the FIRs, a copy of which is with TOI, Pradeep alleged that the couple were his relatives and they came to his house in January 2019 and asked for Rs1 crore as loan for the treatment of Sangeeta and other financial issues. Pradeep alleged that he gave Rs77.8 lakh and Rs20 lakh on separate occasions from his savings and taking loan from friends and relatives. When asked, Gardanibagh police station SHO Arun Kumar said it’s a matter of forgery and duping. “The couple is accused of taking loan, not repaying and dishonouring post-dated cheques,” he said. However, he failed to reply how Sangeeta was arrested for dishonoured cheques issued by her dead husband. “It’s a matter of investigation. This issue is before the court which has to decide,” he said. Sangeeta’s counsels Shama Sinha and Rashid Zafar alleged that she was arrested at night and was manhandled.“The time of arrest mentioned in the memo is 10.30pm. Women constables didn’t wear nameplates,” they said. The SHO said it’s a lie that she was arrested at night. “We arrested her at 4pm,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-cancer-patient-arrested-despite-getting-bail-in-similar-case/articleshow/84124239.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Meerut||Man denied bail for 3 months was ‘booked’ under Gangsters Act in Uttar Pradesh thana that doesn't exist||MEERUT: The Allahabad high court has issued a showcause notice to a police officer in UP after it emerged that he had falsely claimed that a Muslim man from Roorkee was a “dreaded criminal” who had previously been booked under the stringent Gangsters Act in a police station in Amroha district, resulting in him being denied bail for three months. The court found that the thana — Akbarabad police station — mentioned by the Bijnor police officer did not exist. Manavvar (who only uses his first name) was arrested from his home in Roorkee by Bijnor police on the evening of March 31 when he was busy playing with his seven-month-old son. The 30-year-old car mechanic was accused of being part of an interstate auto-lifter gang. “During his bail hearing in a Bijnor court in April, police told the court that Manavvar was a dreaded criminal,” his lawyer Umair Mahmood told TOI. Manavvar was denied bail following which he approached the Allahabad high court. On June 25, the additional government advocate (AGA) on the basis of instructions received by the Bijnor police officer told the court that the accused had a case against him lodged in 2015 under the Gangsters Act in Akbarabad police station in Amroha. In its hearing on July 2, the court said that it had found upon verification of facts that the police station where Manavvar was supposed to have been booked under Gangsters Act, in fact, did not exist. The single bench of Justice JJ Munir said in its order: “The counsel of Manavvar in his affidavit told the court that there is no case of crime no. 371 of 2015, under Section 3 (1) of the U.P. Gangsters Act in police station Akbarabad in district Amroha registered against the applicant as said by the AGA. It has been stated by the learned counsel for the applicant that, in fact, there is no police station going by the name of police station Akbarabad in Amroha.” The court also noted that the AGA had received the information from Amit Kumar, a sub inspector in Bijnor police. The court has issued a notice to Amit Kumar to show cause why appropriate action may not be initiated against him for misleading the court by supplying false and incorrect instructions. Superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh admitted that the court order in this regard had been received but added that the SI had denied that he had submitted false information. “According to the SI, he never said that Manavvar had a case against him under the Gangsters' Act. There is some miscommunication in this case. We will reply to the court accordingly,” he added. The next hearing in the case is on July 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-denied-bail-for-3-months-was-booked-under-gangsters-act-in-up-thana-that-doesnt-exist/articleshow/84122209.cms||Ishita Mishra

The rivalry shows Nagpur has become a hub for the trade, connecting cattle smugglers in rest of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana. Gangster Irfan is heard in the over 9 minute leaked audio clip having a verbal spat with Jameel, revolving around their cattle smuggling rivalry. The clip, which TOI shared with commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar, also contains mention of an incident of firing on Jameel, for which he is heard holding Irfan responsible. Irfan, who is known to help cattle smugglers against ‘protection money’, was heard threatening Jameel for having leaked to the police the movement of his gang member’s trucks ferrying cattle to an illegal slaughterhouse. Jameel, who was once a close friend of Irfan, also accuses Irfan of leaking his information to the police. According to an insider, close aides of Irfan had fired into the ground at Jameel’s feet to threaten him. Jameel was also once kidnapped and taken to Gadchiroli. Cattle is usually smuggled from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to Hyderabad via Nagpur, which has is considered a hub for racketeers. Sources claimed Irfan, who has several offences from the past, is known as a gunrunner with a base in Maoist-affected Gadchiroli. He had been collecting Rs4,000 for every truck trip by racketeers carrying cattle to slaughterhouses in and around Nagpur and other places in Vidarbha. He assures to manage the police, RTO and other agencies. Irfan’s rate for assisting racketeers to make safe deliveries to Hyderabad is Rs5,000. While Irfan had been the unchallenged kingpin in the cattle smuggling racket, another dreaded gangster from Nagpur, Abu, is learnt to have started taking interest in the trade. Abu, who had got a controversial bail in a narcotics case, too has several offences against him. Sources said Abu had started tapping Irfan’s resources and network, leading to stiff rivalry between them. It’s learnt Abu had even offered shelter to anyone miffed with Irfan. The smuggled cattle are mostly sent to different parts of Vidarbha from Nagpur, and also some parts of western Maharashtra. Cattle from different parts of Vidarbha, where poor farmers are known to be affected by agrarian crisis, are also sold to these racketeers. These cattle are sent to different places in Maharashtra and also places like Hyderabad via Nagpur. Irfan is learnt to have a vast network in eastern Vidarbha, including Gadchiroli, Gondia and Chandrapur. He is helped by seasoned racketeers like Javed, Tahir, Mobin, Pappu, Lala and Faizul. Abu too has dreaded racketeer Rafiq by his side, said a source. CP Kumar said he would look into the matter after TOI shared the audio clip with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leaked-audio-clip-reveals-rivalry-to-control-lucrative-inter-state-cattle-smuggling-rackets/articleshow/84126323.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra Bamboo board’s Rs 1.12 crore machines lying unused, rusting||NAGPUR: In a colossal waste of government money, Maharashtra Bamboo Development Board (MBDB) procured eight bamboo chemical treatment plants for over Rs1.12 crore, but none of these are operational. Information sought by social worker Manoj Wahane under the RTI Act reveals neither these chemical treatment plants are operational, nor they conform to ISI specifications issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Wahane said, “No consent was obtained from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) for establishing and operating these plants. Thus, the pollution control laws have been violated.” Further, the plants are a safety hazard as they do not meet the quality norms laid down under the Maharashtra Factories Rules, 1963, and BIS. One plant was also procured by the Bamboo Research & Training Centre (BRTC), Chichpalli, which is claimed to be one of the biggest training institutes in the country. When asked under RTI to provide MPCB consent and factory license, the BRTC has responded by saying the relevant permissions and licenses are not available in its office. “The machinery procured under the National Bamboo Mission (NBM) funding has been done directly by MBDB as government procurement. However, there is no provision for the building of factory sheds to accommodate the machinery, for recruitment of manpower, working capital, and sale and marketing of the bamboo products. The entire machinery procured by MBDB is lying idle and rusting,” says Wahane. Reply to another RTI query revealed that the MBDB, which is the nodal agency in the state to implement the National Bamboo Mission (NBM), was sanctioned Rs33.12 crore in 2018-19, but it received over Rs16 crore, which was distributed for implementation of various schemes to promote bamboo cultivation under the guidance of experts. However, one of the bamboo experts Anand Fiskey, whose name is on the list of experts, said, “I have no information or idea about the schemes and money distributed. I learned about it from the RTI document.” The RTI reply also reveals that the MBDB has diverted funds and not utilized them in accordance with the sanctioned annual action plans in the last three financial years. Bamboo consultant and district sanghatan mantri of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Pratap Goswami alleged that as per RTI information, not a single private bamboo unit has been provided financial assistance in spite of provision to assist more than 60 private bamboo units in the last three years. “Of the Rs8 crore sanctioned for the financial year 2020-21, no amount has been spent so far without attributing any valid reason for not implementing the annual action plan,” said Goswami. He said there is also a mismatch about RTI information. In response to an RTI query in the same bunch of documents, the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) has acknowledged receipt of over Rs16 crore from MBDB in 2018-19. However, in response from MBDB, it has been stated that Rs2.48 crore was released to FDCM in 2018-19. “Upon seeking the purpose for diversion of funds, MBDB has stated that it had asked for relevant details to FDCM. However, FDCM has issued a letter to MBDB stating that the sought information is confidential and therefore cannot be shared with the RTI applicant,” said Goswami. The contradiction in the RTI replies of MBDB and FDCM points out serious financial irregularities which require probe by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW). A forensic audit should be conducted at the earliest to unearth the wrongdoings, he demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bamboo-boards-rs1-12-crore-machines-lying-unused-rusting/articleshow/84126500.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Work on Yamuna riverfront without panel’s nod raises eyebrows||NEW DELHI: An activist on Sunday shared a video of an earthmover clearing out land and breaking down a wall on the Yamuna floodplain adjacent to Commonwealth Games (CWG) Village, where an open-air school also operates. It has been alleged that riverfront development work is being carried out despite no clearances given to Delhi Development Authority (DDA) by the principal committee formed on the matter. Manoj Mishra, the Yamuna activist, said while inspections by a sub-committee formed by the principal committee were still ongoing, work on the floodplain without any clearance was a clear violation and damaging to the ecology. “Not only have encroachments not been removed, but now we are seeing work to build roads by clearing the area. This is a gross violation of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order and it needs to be addressed immediately,” Mishra told TOI, adding that the violations were flagged to him by a teacher, Raman Khanna, who runs an open-air school for children from Yamuna Khadar. A visit to the spot by TOI showed an earthmover parked on the floodplain, but it was not operational at the time. A part of the floodplain had been dug up, while other sections had been levelled. When TOI reached out to Khanna, he said earthmovers and bulldozers were plying in the area for over a week, with a semi-permanent road now made for these vehicles to move deeper into the floodplain. “We used to reach the spot where the video was shot on Sunday on foot, but now a kuccha road has been made instead, which allows easier access to the area. A wall, for ranny well number 3, was broken down and it seems activity is picking up,” he added. Professor CR Babu, head of Centre for Management of Degraded Ecosystems, who is a part of the sub-committee and participated in the meeting held by the principal committee in April, said he was shown the video on Sunday, but he was unaware of any riverfront development work taking place without clearance. “To my knowledge, no permission has been given for any project so far. The sub-committee will first submit its findings to the principal committee and work can only commence after they clear it,” he added. Professor AK Gosain from IIT-Delhi, an expert and part of the sub-committee, said inspections were carried out by them along the Yamuna floodplain on Friday, but this particular area near CWG Village was not checked as it was not a part of the principal committee’s agenda. “If it is flagged to the principal committee, we will take a look at it. So far, we have inspected areas where problems were flagged in the previous meeting. NGT’s order is clear and no construction or development work is allowed, barring minor work for rejuvenation and restoration of the biodiversity park. If any work is taking place, it is a clear violation of the NGT order,” added Gosain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/work-on-riverfront-without-panels-nod-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/84124254.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Delhi||Delhi: 2 held for snatching woman’s bag in Chittaranjan Park||NEW DELHI: Two teenagers have been arrested for snatching a woman’s handbag in south Delhi’s Chittaranjan Park on Saturday. The accused have been identified as Karan (19) from Ambedkar Nagar and Surjeet (19) from Madangir village. Police have also arrested a third suspect who allegedly bought the stolen goods from the accused duo. He has been identified as Shuaib, a resident of south Delhi’s Madangir village. Recoveries include the woman’s purse, Rs 500 in cash, her mobile phone, scarf and an ID card. The scooter used in crime by teenagers has also been seized. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said the accused teenagers were nabbed by a team led by inspector Satyabir. Police officers had to analyse footage from the CCTV cameras in the area and also used technical leads and human intelligence to zero in on the suspects. The woman was returning home around 9.45pm. No sooner had she reached her house, and opened her bag to get the keys, a boy came from behind and snatched her bag. She tried chasing the snatcher but fell down. An FIR was filed and the suspects were arrested in less than 24 hours.  “Prima facie, the accused seem to be first-timers but their antecedents are being scanned from the databases,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-held-for-snatching-womans-bag-in-cr-park/articleshow/84124246.cms||---

He added that corridor-wise master construction schedule has been prepared and uploaded on the IPMS. The indigenously developed IPMS, Dayal claimed, has features of integration of other construction-related software for Project Planning and 3D BIM (Three-Dimensional Building Information Modelling), apart from a mobile app through which the actual progress at site on real-time basis can be uploaded on the IPMS. The software will monitor the progress of work of all disciplines — civil, electrical and mechanical, signaling and telecommunication — and the project progress can be viewed in dashboards as well as in the 3D models. “The software was launched in April this year and is being used for monitoring the progress of contract packages, which are awarded and in progress,” Dayal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/digital-stride-delhi-metro-to-monitor-phase-iv-work-online/articleshow/84124258.cms||---

---||Patna||‘Only 14% of school students in Bihar have access to computers’||PATNA: At a time when online study has been the only option available for students owing to the Covid pandemic, only 14% of the school students in Bihar have access to computers. According to the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) report released recently, less than one in five schools had working computers and only a limited number of them had internet connection. It is even more surprising to know that 73% students in neighbouring Jharkhand have had access to computers, the report said. Right since the imposition of nationwide lockdown in March last year owing to the rise in Covid-19 cases, schoolchildren had to adopt the digital technology for pursuing education. The availability of digital education via live, synchronous teaching on apps like Zoom or through recorded lectures, emails, WhatsApp or educational apps were entirely dependent on whether schools, teachers and parents had access to the necessary infrastructure required. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary admitted that the state did not have the desired application of digital technology in schools. In an economically backward state, especially in rural areas, the children did not possess digital device for continuing with their online studies during the pandemic. The minister said the government is already seized of this problem and had, some time back, requested the central government to sanction necessary funds under Samagra Shiksha Yojana for providing necessary digital devices like smartphones and laptops to the students and install good number of computers with internet connectivity in all the schools so that our children do not suffer. Bihar Public Service Commission’s former member Shiv Jatan Thakur said it is really disgraceful for the state that 86% of its schoolchildren were deprived of the online education facility due to lack of digital technology. Consequently, a major percentage of the state’s human capital won’t be able to contribute their worth to the economic development of the state, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/only-14-of-school-students-in-state-have-access-to-computers/articleshow/84124308.cms||B K Mishra

By filing a Fast Detailed Accident Report (FDAR), the family of the deceased received Rs 32 lakh as compensation. The accident, which was dealt with as a pilot project, took place on May 2, in which a 57-year-old Delhi Police personnel was killed by a speeding Honda CRV in Vasant Vihar.

Police said that the accused was returning home after visiting his wife who was admitted in the Covid ward of a hospital. He allegedly fell asleep while driving and mowed down Lal. Police arrested him from the spot. The Fast Detailed Accident Report scheme was re-launched this year in May. As per the rules, the investigating officers in fatal accidents file a report within five days of such incidents and send the details to the district commissioner of police. To be eligible, the accident must be a result of rash driving, the driver of the offending vehicle must be an adult and shouldn't be found drunk or without a license and the car must also be insured. In Lal’s case, sub-inspector Pankaj informed Insurance Claims Cell. After verification, a hearing was set up where the insurance company offered to pay Rs 32 lakhs, which Lal’s family accepted. Sanjay Singh, special commissioner (western Zone) tweeted, “While on night picket duty, Ct. Munshi Lal lost his life when a car rammed into the police barricade. For the 1st time in history a #RoadAccident compensation case was resolved within 10 days & Munshi Lal’s family received a compensation of Rs 32 lacs through the #FastDAR scheme (sic).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-resolve-fatal-accident-case-in-10-days-get-kin-rs-32l/articleshow/84124290.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Anil Deshmukh moves SC in money-laundering case||Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday moved Supreme Court, seeking protection from any coercive action in a money-laundering case. The Enforcement Directorate had, on Saturday, issued fresh summons to the 71-year-old NCP leader, seeking his appearance on July 5 in the case. The ED has, so far, issued three notices to Deshmukh, who has been asked to record his statement at the central agency’s office in south Mumbai on Monday. Deshmukh has moved the top court, seeking protection from any coercive action, Mumbai-based advocate Inderpal B Singh said in a video message released for media. The former minister had skipped the two earlier summons, citing his “vulnerability” to Covid as the reason for non-compliance in his last communication to the agency. He instead offered the ED to record his statement through video-conferencing. The fresh summons by ED was issued in connection with a criminal case registered under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, relating to an alleged Rs 100 crore bribery-cum-extortion racket that led to Deshmukh’s resignation in April. The first summons followed raids conducted by the ED at his premises in Mumbai and Nagpur besides that of his aides and others last month. The agency subsequently arrested two of his aides in this case, personal secretary Sanjeev Palande (51) and personal assistant Kundan Shinde (45). They are in ED custody till Tuesday. The agency, sources said, apart from the present case wants to question Deshmukh about his and his family members’ alleged links with certain shell companies that were used to launder funds much before the present allegations of bribery in the Mumbai police setup came to light.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-deshmukh-moves-sc-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/84126497.cms||---

Police said, so far, at least two girls, aged 13 and 9, had complaint against the man, who lived in outer Delhi and gave tuitions to at least a dozen students. When TOI contacted Rajiv Ranjan, DCP (Outer North), he did not respond to calls or queries. The first complaint was given by the man’s 13-year-old niece, who also attended his tuition. “One day she was not willing to go. When her parents asked her, she told them that the teacher molested her,” police said. The parents then alerted the cops and the girl was taken for a medical examination, following which a case was registered under POCSO Act and IPC section 354 for molestation. On July 2, a police team raided the house and arrested the accused, said a cop. During further probe, parents of another student filed a similar complaint. “A 9-year-old claimed that the man used to make her watch obscene videos, and when she resisted, he forced and threaten her not to reveal this to anyone.

One of the units of TSPL has been closed for the last over three months. With two units having stopped generation, only one unit is operational now. TSPL, situated at Banawali village in Mansa district, has three units of 660 MW each, producing 1,980 MW power. Before the snag hit unit number 1 in the early hours of Sunday, the power plant was producing 1,178 MW power, 142 MW less than the generation capacity of 1,320 MW from two units. It may take over 48 hours to make this unit operational, sources said. Punjab is already reeling under severe power crisis, with demand exceeding power supply capacity. Although the situation eased to some extent in the last 24 hours, tripping of one of the 660 MW units of TSPL exacerbated problems of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), a senior official said. Now, PSPCL has issued a penalty notice to TSPL for not ensuring timely availability of its unit no 3. PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said the power discom had been repeatedly directing TSPL to ensure full availability of its three units in paddy season, including unit no. 3, but it failed to do so. The situation would not have been as bad if the third unit would have been functioning. Meeting power demand has been a challenge for PSPCL. Two days ago, power demand rose to 14,300 MW while state resources were limited to 12,800 MW, leaving a shortfall of 1,500 MW. PSPCL attributed spike in demand to late monsoon. In view of this, power supply to the farm sector was being curtailed and unscheduled power cuts were being enforced in domestic supply. On Saturday, supply was restored to some extent. Prasad said the TSPL’s second unit was expected to be made operational by Monday evening or Tuesday morning, “To compensate the loss, PSPCL has been allowed to make more purchases of electricity from the national pool by enhancing the limit from 7,300 MW to 7,800 MW for the time being. On Sunday, PSPCL met demand by supplying 12,800 MW. We are hopeful of fulfilling demand in days to come.” He said due to failure of unit no. 3, PSPCL faced tremendous difficulty in providing eight hours of uninterrupted power supply to agriculture and domestic consumers of the state. There was also a sudden failure of a unit of Ropar thermal plant and low level of power generation at Bhakra hydro project. “We have directed TSPL to make allout efforts to make unit no. 3 available at the earliest. PSPCL has issued the notice to TSPL, asking them to explain why capacity charges should not be deducted for the entire contract year 2021-22, considering non-availability of its unit under breakdown and be penalised on account of hardship faced by the people of Punjab,” said Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/tspl-unit-develops-snag-thermal-plant-gets-notice-for-1-shut-earlier/articleshow/84131267.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaisalmer: Solar power ‘surge’ in desert threatening lives of camels||JAISALMER/JAIPUR: Solar companies in the windswept desert of Jaisalmer are allegedly laying a death trap for camels, which have been accorded the status of state animal. In an incident on Saturday night, a camel bled to death after it was cut by sharp edged angles installed to erect solar panels in the desert while it was searching for food in Lala village. Accusing the company staff, Khushal Raika, owner of the camel, said, “Careless company workers did not erect a fence after installing sharp edged angles. When the camel entered the plot, the workers chased it away. While running, it received several cuts on its body and ‘bled to death’.” The region is purportedly home to the largest number of camels in the country. As per an estimate from the four villages of Sawata, Bhopa, Lala and Karda, there is a population of about 5,000. Cattle breeders fear more such incidents could occur as, during this season, animals are usually left to graze. A senior staff member of the solar power company, who did not wish to be named, refuted the allegation and claimed the death did not occur at their site. “The carcass was found at least 60 metres away from the project site. We have deployed staff to prevent animals from entering the site.” Camels, which survive in the harshest of conditions and sweltering temperatures for ages, are now struggling for food after companies started cutting down trees in the desert on which they feed. Environmentalist Sumer Singh Bhati alleged that the solar power companies are disturbing the ecology of the desert. Many desert trees, including 'kumut', 'khejari', 'rohida', 'kair', 'jal' and 'bordi', are fast disappearing from the desert as companies are cutting them down. “The government should act on the issue at the earliest as solar power companies are setting up infrastructure at the cost of desert ecology. As acres of solar panels have sprung up across the desert, the change would result in extinction of many animals, birds and trees,” Bhati said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/solar-power-surge-in-desert-threatening-lives-of-camels/articleshow/84126539.cms||---

The civic body has put up a notice at the gate of an open plot in Section 25 area, where the building was razed a few years ago. The notice issued to building secretary Ramesh Vehrani read, “On visible inspection, prima facie your building appears to be structurally unstable and unsafe. So you are hereby directed to do the structural audit of the building from a qualified structural engineer within 14 days and do the necessary compliances if any.” Local corporator Sherry Lund has asked the civic chief to look into the matter. Dr Yuvraj Bhadane, UMC public relations officer, said, “The civic chief has ordered an inquiry into the same and those civic staffers who issued the notice without physically visiting the spot will face action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-4-yrs-after-bldg-razed-umc-marks-open-plot-as-unsafe/articleshow/84126555.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Surat||Gujarat: Bribe whistle-blower in dock for perjury||SURAT: Twelve years ago, he set an example of being an honest citizen by not greasing the palm of the head clerk of a grant-in-aid trust-run school with Rs 500 for an admission form and informing the anti-corruption bureau (ACB). However, tables turned last week for Pravin Mahajan when the head clerk, Bhavsaheb Patil, got acquitted but the complainant himself ended up in the dock as his ‘honest’ image got tarnished. It so happened that even when all witnesses including material witnesses, investigating officers stood firm on their testimonies, Mahajan turned hostile during the case trial. As the star witness contradicted his own statement together with some technical lapses in the probe, the case took a new twist and Patil got acquitted. The court, however, held Mahajan responsible for perjury and issued a show-cause notice to him asking him to explain why he should not be punished. The court of additional sessions judge V N Mapara came down heavily on the complainant and stated that the whole case of the prosecution has failed because the complainant himself has turned hostile. The court also observed that “complainant turning hostile in criminal proceedings has become a menace”. “There is a lot of public time, money and resources which get consumed with each single complaint being filed, until it reaches to its logical conclusion by the courts, all because the complainant has chosen to set the criminal machinery into motion. After all these the complainants turn hostile at their sweet will. This not only affects the course of justice but also causes tremendous waste of public time, money and resources ... One day they file a complaint and the next day they turn hostile. Whole legal system is made a joke by such people. (sic),” the court stated in its judgment. In May 2009, the ACB had laid a trap to nab Patil as Mahajan had complained about him demanding bribe. Mahajan had alleged that Patil had initially demanded a bribe of Rs 1,000 to give an admission form for his cousin. After initial negotiation, the bribe amount was fixed at Rs 500 and Mahajan approached the ACB as he did not want to pay the bribe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bribe-whistle-blower-in-dock-for-perjury/articleshow/84124339.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Though the number of Covid-19 cases in the district is low at moment, but such violation will make many vulnerable to infection, health officials said. In the two days of the drive, the district health department said 21,960 were inoculated, district civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said. Dr Pathak also said the health department officials had sought the help of police to control the rush and ensure that Covid appropriate behaviour is followed. However, many were complacent and are seen without wearing their masks properly. During the drive, the vaccination centre at the library ground saw the maximum rush. The ground virtually turned in to a fair-like venue with roadside vendors, ice-cream sellers and others doing brisk business. Meanwhile, many of those who turned up for vaccination expressed concern that the department also conducted Covid-19 testing at the same site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cov-safety-norms-flouted-during-2-day-mega-vax-drive-in-bokaro-cops-called/articleshow/84124128.cms||Divy Khare
---||Ranchi||We are ready for possible third Covid wave, says Jharkhand health minister Banna Gupta||RANCHI: State health minister Banna Gupta on Sunday said Jharkhand is ready to fight a third wave of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. He said, “Experts have been predicting a third wave and is expected to affect the children in particular. To ensure that our doctors and hospitals are ready to provide the necessary treatment, we are doing everything possible and the international training cum symposium held on Sunday is an example.” While inaugurating the international webinar cum training session organised by state health, medical education family welfare department in collaboration with the women doctors’ wing of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Jharkhand, Gupta said, “We have been working on strengthening the medical infrastructure across the state and work on more than a dozen of Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) and Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) have been completed.” He further said, “However, we need to make our workforce familiar with specialised treatment on critical care, preparation of PICUs and treatment protocols to combat a possible third wave and outbreak of the virus among children.” Over four dozen paediatricians from across the state, who will be tasked to handle the upcoming 28 new PICUs, joined the online training programme. Moreover, paediatricians, physicians and critical care experts from various American medical schools conducted three sessions for the state’s doctors on tackling the third wave apart from ways to immediately identify early warning symptoms and setting up of child ICUs equipped with monitoring devices and supported by advanced diagnostic tools and pathological testing facilities. Addressing a session, Dr Pooja Kashyap, a paediatric cardiologist and director of adult congenital program at the University of Texas, said, “Children can develop complications during treatment or even before they are hospitalised and to ensure that they are properly managed, we need to be ready with manpower which can understand cardiac as well as child care. So, we will be training you on managing all monitoring devices and interpreting pathological and diagnostic test results in the shortest possible time to ensure prompt care to Covid-affected children.” Chairperson of women doctors’ wing of IMA, Jharkhand, Dr Bharti Kashyap, requested that respiratory ailments and heart problems in children caused by Covid infection be also brought under the Ayushman Bharat scheme to provide relief to low-income groups. She said, “It is necessary to set up state-of-the-art pathological labs, capable of delivering diagnostic test results in the shortest possible time, for each cluster of three to four paediatric ICUs. It would ensure speedy diagnosis, prompt treatment and care for all Covid-affected children.” According to the state health department’s estimate, around seven lakh children in Jharkhand might develop infections in case of a third wave and Gupta requested people to follow appropriate Covid behaviour to contain the spread. “The total population of children below the 18 age is around 1.44 crore in the state and if 5% of them are infected, it would mean at least seven lakh children would contract the virus. Experts also believe that a few might develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in later stages. So, we need to be more vigilant and follow appropriate Covid behaviour at all times,” Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/we-are-ready-for-possible-3rd-covid-wave-says-banna/articleshow/84124419.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand woman battles black fungus for weeks, son writes to CM Hemant for financial help||RANCHI: A Giridh-based resident has written to chief minister Hemant Soren, seeking financial help for treating his mother Usha Devi (45), who is suffering from mucormycosis (black fungus) and is currently admitted at the state-run Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) in Ranchi. According to Gaurav Gupta’s letter, a copy of which is with TOI, he has pleaded with the CM to save him from becoming an orphan as “his mother’s condition is critical and the doctors at Rims have referred her to an advanced healthcare centre for a more specialised treatment”. In his letter, Gaurav said that they cannot afford the medical cost at another centre. “If she isn’t provided the specialized medical care at a higher centre, she will die,” his letter read. He said that he had to purchase medicines worth Rs 46,000 and he doesn’t have any money left for her treatment. “Initially, the doctors provided Amphotericin B to my mother from the hospital’s side. However, I had to purchase Posaconazole and now I don’t have any money left.” Upon contact, the public relations officer at Rims, Dr D K Sinha said, “If the patient had to purchase the medicine from outside he will be refunded if he produces the bill as mucormycosis has been notified as a pandemic in Jharkhand.” Besides requesting for monetary help, Gaurav’s letter brought to the CM’s attention the ‘lackadaisical attitude of the doctors at Rims’ which led to the worsening condition of his mother. He claimed that his mother has been admitted at the hospital for more than one and a half months and the doctors’ negligence made her condition critical. “My mother was admitted at Rims on May 17 after she started bleeding from the nose. An initial examination confirmed that she was suffering from mucormycosis and as a result, she was administered the required medicines for the next 14 days and by May 27, her condition had improved. However, she developed a would under her left eye which the doctors ignored for more than a week by assuring us that it will subside. However, it spread to her entire face but the doctors refused to operate on her. It’s been more than three weeks now and she hasn’t had surgery yet,” Gaurav told TOI. Asked why the doctors refused to perform the surgery, he said, “After repeated requests they decided to operate on my mother on June 16. Her name was even included in the list but they removed it saying that her blood sugar levels have shot up and they will not perform the surgery.” Upon contact, Dr Sinha, said, “I do not know why the surgery was not performed and I will have to get this information from the nodal officer at the ENT department.” When TOI contacted the doctors at the hospital, a senior doctor in the ENT department preferring anonymity said a lack of coordination among the doctors from various departments is to be blamed for this. He claimed that some of the doctors aren’t even attending to the black fungus patients daily. “I have performed surgeries on two patients and I know about Usha Devi’s case but the team of doctors formed to look after mucormycosis patients aren’t co-ordinating with others which is required for a debridement surgery,” he said. When asked about the number of surgeries performed on black fungus patients, Dr Sinha failed to provide the data. A press release by Rims said that currently, 22 patients of mucormycosis are admitted at the hospital and they are being treated as per protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/woman-battles-black-fungus-for-weeks-son-writes-to-hemant-for-financial-help/articleshow/84124241.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Congress plans meeting to pacify ‘disgruntled’ MLAs||RANCHI: Ruling alliance party, Congress, which is currently battling infighting and complaints from several MLAs against the alleged high-handedness of the state police and administrative officials, is set to hold an emergency meeting of its legislative party unit next week in a bid to pacify the disgruntled legislators and chalk out modalities to minimise the alleged rift with the lead ruling partner — JMM. On Sunday, four women MLAs of the party — Deepika Pandey Singh (Mahagama), Mamta Devi (Ramgarh), Amba Prasad (Barkagaon) and Purnima Singh (Jharia) — who have been raising concerns about the “inappropriate” behaviour of government officials, including policemen, with elected representatives, went to the house of Congress legislative party leader Alamgir Alam in Ranchi to raise their concerns. As Alamgir was in his constituency (Pakur), the four MLAs held a virtual meeting with him and other lawmakers to air their grievances and demanded that he takes up the matter with chief minister Hemant Soren. After the virtual meeting, Deepika said, “Since the leader of the legislative party is the captain of all of our MLAs, we are now asking him (Alamgir) to take up the matter at the appropriate forum for early resolution. Tentatively, it has been decided to convene an emergency meeting of the legislative party on July 10. We will put up our concerns there.” Purnima said while they are not questioning the government, in which her party is also a part, but seeking proper coordination among all alliance partners and MLAs in the interest of the state. Notably, infighting and resentment within the Congress fold have been there for long owing to a host of issues. However, it is for the first time that MLAs have now begun questioning the coalition government and its works openly. Most of the Congress MLAs, mainly the female brigade, are now up against the alleged police “high-handedness” and the “partisan” role in dealing with law keepers vis-à-vis JMM lawmakers. The issue deepened further in the recent months after the police filed FIRs against Deepika and Amba in different cases, which the duo dubbed as arbitrary and filed on flimsy grounds. Mamta, on the other hand, directly accused police of hand-in-gloves with coal mafias on social media and rued how the police did not take cognizance of her tip-off about coal smuggling in Ramgarh two days ago. This had prompted Deepika to question the CM through a tweet on Saturday and asked if any special directives were issued to the police not to listen to the Congress MLAs. Meanwhile, Jharkhand DGP is learnt to have issued a letter to all IGs, DIGs and SPs, directing them to be cordial with the public representatives and take note of their genuine issues and concerns related to the welfare of the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/congress-plans-meeting-to-pacify-disgruntled-mlas/articleshow/84124280.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Nagpur||We will voluntarily ask for de-recognition: School association in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: An association representing English medium ‘budget’ schools in Maharashtra says they want to voluntarily seek derecognition of their institutes, as a mark of protest against “threats by the education department” over the fee issue. Independent English Schools Association (IESA) has firmed up plans to seek an appointment with school education minister Varsha Gaikwad to surrender their recognition certificates. Rajendra Singh, president of IESA said, “The most common threat made by the state education department is that they will derecognize our school. All issues related to fees are being seen as if schools are guilty and immediately talk of punishment starts.” Singh claimed that financially his member schools have now reached a breaking point. “This issue has been dragging on for long and we have cooperated with both parents and the education department. But if the school is unable to financially sustain itself then there’s no other option left. Our members have braved the situation so far but they won’t be able to keep on going without fee receipts coming in,” said Singh. He said whenever a complaint is made by parents to the education department, officials do not try to resolve it. “There is no effort made to find a resolution to the problem. Fact is, schools are facing financial losses and many of our members have helped needy students over the years. We all came into the field to contribute to the state’s growth by increasing academic quality. But it seems that our efforts are not being appreciated by the authorities,” said Singh. Various other school associations too have taken up aggressive posturing against the education department over the fee issue, with some even going to court. A school trustee said, “Till last year, the balance of power was tilted completely towards the education department, as in, no school would aggressively engage with them. But if institutions realize that they are going to crumble financially, then they are not going to go down without a fight. Earlier a notice from the education department would create havoc among trustees, now it’s handled by their lawyers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/we-will-voluntarily-ask-for-de-recognition-school-association/articleshow/84126580.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Experts suggest 15,000 tests per day, self-testing to keep third wave low||NAGPUR: The experts appointed by the state government through Unicef (United Nations Children’s Fund) and NGO RedR India have suggested 200-300 tests per day per lakh population, self-testing by citizens, and organizations taking ownership of their own people to mitigate third wave of Covid-19 pandemic. They also advised vaccination of all eligible people and participation of the public in controlling the pandemic through Covid Appropriate Behaviour (CAB). Disaster risk governance specialist Amit Tandon, and public health expert Dr Shailaja Gaikwad from Unicef and RedR have submitted Covid-19 Third Wave Management Plan to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) recently. During the second wave, on April 26, the State Disaster Management Authority through Unicef and RedR had deployed disaster risk governance specialist and public health expert in four districts — Mumbai, Nagpur, Nashik and Pune, which were witnessing huge spike in cases and deaths. They have been given responsibility to plan and help authorities contain the spread, control deaths and effectively respond to vaccine hesitancy. Accordingly, Tandon and Gaikwad completed their analysis and prepared the plan. Tandon told TOI, “Some global best practices suggest testing 200-300 (unique) tests per day per 1 lakh population, depending on the caseload. In the city, NMC has facilitated testing centres in sufficient numbers and in all parts. Awareness is required among people about importance of testing, and early detection and treatment. If all those with symptoms or in contact with positive patient are tested, it will help find any cluster of patients, or sudden surge in a particular area, behaviour of the virus, and allow containment measures to be taken by NMC.” Tandon added that testing of transient populations will also be very beneficial. “Testing of people running shops, vendors, home delivery boys etc who meet multiple people daily should be done once in a fortnight. Owners of these establishments along with private and government offices should take responsibility of their own people. If they manage to test and isolate symptomatic or infected person, it will help contain the spread to a great extent. NMC has facilitated testing at your premises campaign for citizens and businessmen, who can get tests free of cost in their areas,” he said. Tandon also said testing of ILI, SARI, comorbid and people residing in slums in case of any symptoms is must to contain spread and control deaths. “Slum Task Force should be appointed in association with NGOs,” he said. As per data of district civil surgeon, average daily testing of the district was 9,150 in June and 6,821 in city. As per experts, there should be 10,546-15,819 tests per day in district and 5,800-8,700 per day in the city. The experts worked out key assumptions, risk management cycle, mitigation measures, preparedness and role of stakeholders in the plan. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “Plan is very good and helpful, so it has been implemented. We have already benefitted from suggestions and help of these experts. They are daily in touch tests with the team working at state-level in Covid-19 so we get all types of help and information easily. They have expertise in pandemics and health sector, which is another advantage. They are very sound in technology and helped us plan vaccination of foreign students, launch testing at your premises campaign etc. They conduct survey and analysis in any subject which we assign them on day to day basis. They have been very helpful in planning daily vaccination and removing hesitancy in people and societies.” For preparing the plan, Tandon and Dr Gaikwad have taken the guidance of senior advisor of National Rural Health Mission Dr Mridula Phadke and founder member of National Disaster Management Authority professor Vinod Menon. SUGGESTIONS IN THIRD WAVE MANAGEMENT PLAN * Assess current capacity of beds, oxygen supply etc as Covid-19 impacts routine immunization activities and institutional care for pregnant women. Augmenting capacities will ensure routine public health care is not hampered * In second wave, approximately 56% of deceased were in age group of 25-65, out of which 63% were male. This indicates cascading impact on women and children, and they need to be at core of recovery interventions * Covid-19 impacted financial status of people and it has cascading impact on nutrition, maternal health, child protection issues etc. Close scrutiny required for additional impact on people * In case of third wave, coordinated response needed. NMC has functional Central Control Room with potential to scale into incident response system. NDMA recommends a GO-NGO coordination system for recovery and response * NMC doing extremely well in immunization, but there are some barriers. Need is to build on motivating factors with constructive conversation with people who show hesitancy||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/experts-suggest-15k-tests-per-day-self-testing-to-keep-3rd-wave-low/articleshow/84126622.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

GSUDA’s search for project management consultants has raised eyebrows in certain quarters of the government with officials pointing out that the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) is already executing similar projects. “GSUDA proposes to empanel reputed consulting firms or agencies which would render consultancy services, including project management consultancy work and assist GSUDA,” member secretary, GSUDA, Gurudas Pilarnekar, said. It has identified eight categories of projects that it wants to take up — market complexes, multilevel parking facilities, administrative buildings, multi-utility complexes, development of open spaces, beautification of cities, commercial complexes and truck terminals. The consultant will have to prepare feasibility reports, detailed engineering surveys and plans, conduct environment impact assessment studies, obtain environmental clearances and estimates for projects that GSUDA or municipal bodies take up. “The projects or activities to be undertaken would be in key strategic areas, multidisciplinary in nature and need to have high impact. The quality of the services is extremely critical,” Pilarnekar said. He stressed that the consultants would need to be competent and be able to ensure quality, timely execution of projects. Among the many projects that GSUDA has in the pipeline are the Power House complex at Baina, a new fish market, and renovation work of the existing Mormugao municipality building among others. The state government usually asks GSIDC to build market complexes, bus stands, administrative buildings and develop open spaces. GSUDA aims to have the consultants on board for an initial period of three years, but could extend the contracts for an additional two years if required. International agencies, which have been operating in India for at least three years, can also assist GSUDA as long as an office is setup in Goa, Pilarnekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/urban-devpt-body-eyes-municipal-mkt-bus-stand-projects/articleshow/84126711.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Courts should run schools now: Bacchu Kadu||NAGPUR: Even as parents organisations blamed state education department for inaction against erring schools which arm-twist parents for fee recovery, minister of state for school education Bacchu Kadu said the department had acted against several leading schools, but every time the high court had played “a spoilsport”. Countering calls for shutting down education department, Kadu said, “After I asked officials to conduct audit of private schools, it was detected that about Rs 20 crore excess fee was collected by them. While asking the school managements to refund the fees, the department had also lodged police complaints against some of them. However, the HC stayed all our actions. I think, the courts should run the schools now.” The minister added that parents can’t blame the department for inaction as it had acted against over 20 schools in the city, which is the highest in state. After the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court had warned two leading schools in Nagpur against discontinuing online classes of two students over unpaid fees, parents organisations in city have claimed many private ones are still indulging in such “arm-twisting tactics” to recover dues. Stressing that there should be some ceiling on fee charged by schools, the minister said the current Act regulating the fee was highly inadequate to handle this menace and, therefore, a stringent law is needed which grants more power to the government. “While some schools are doing commendable work, a majority are indulging in profiteering. Schools affiliated to the central boards argue that they do not come under state control. Even Parent-Teacher Associations (PTA) aren’t constituted in a legal way in most of them, so that they can increase the fees as per their whims and fancies. Unfortunately, even the parents aren’t coming out in the open to lodge complaints against the schools,” said Kadu. Refuting the minister’s claims, Yogesh Pathare of Rashtriya Shikshak Palak Sanghatan (RPS) demanded that the department should be closed as it has failed to provide justice to thousands of parents, who had approached it with the complaints. “Since last one-and-a-half years, the department hardly did anything to provide succour to the aggrieved parents, neither it had taken any concrete action against the schools charging exorbitant fees,” Pathare said speaking to TOI. Another activist, who didn’t wish to be named, said despite Covid-19 pandemic and Supreme Court’s clear directives, many schools have hiked fees. “Parents are simply demanding concession and nothing else due to the pandemic. All these years, they regularly paid the fees, without questioning the school authorities. Maharashtra state should take a lesson from Delhi government that had reduced fees considering the financial impact of the pandemic on the parents,” he told TOI. While hearing Gandhi Sewa Sadan Vs Rajasthan government case, the Supreme Court had on February 8 ruled that schools can’t prohibit pupils from attending online/physical classes or appearing in examinations, nor they can withhold the results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/courts-should-run-schools-now-kadu/articleshow/84126667.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Dhavalikar had alleged that the funds meant for the welfare of scheduled tribes was being misused, including for the Banastarim market complex. The alliance has termed the MGP leader’s statement as an attempt to misguide ST community for personal political mileage.  UTAA general secretary Durgadas Gaude said the market complex is being constructed through central tribal funds and could be used for ST and other Bahujan communities. He said Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar had used tribal funds when he was the social welfare minister for procuring Balarath buses. The fund was used for transport needs of students of all communities. He added that Gaude has launched several schemes for uplift of the ST community. “Tribal fund has provided a lot of help to ST community and the students. Under it, scholarships have been provided to students besides financial assistance to repair houses under the Atal Ashray scheme,” Durgadas said. Durgadas dared Dhavalikars to secure Priol, Sanguem, Canacona and Nuvem for ST community candidates if they believe MGP is of Bahujans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tribals-back-gaude-hit-out-at-dhavalikars/articleshow/84126729.cms||---

The inquiry has been initiated following orders of the city police chief Amitesh Kumar. Merguwar was on sick leave since March this year. After recovering from Covid-19, he had developed a rare fungal disease endogenous endophthalmitis, which led to complete loss of vision in the right eye and partially in the left. After undergoing five surgeries, including one in Hyderabad, Merguwar had received indication from his treating ophthalmologist at Alexis Hospital on June 28 that he may require yet another surgery as some more spots had developed in the left eye. On the same day, Merguwar had gone to the armoury at the police headquarters to procure his service weapon. He had told a friend to take him to the armoury saying a fine has to be deposited by him urgently. Sources in the police department said Merguwar had submitted a letter from the SPU to release him the weapon. It was not clear as to how the head constable was issued the letter when he had been fighting to save his eyesight. The head constable was taken to the hospital by his nephew as he had been struggling to even make and receive calls by operating the mobile. In such a situation, it’s not clear how the firearm was handed over to him. CP Kumar said it was not easy for one to realize Merguwar was visually challenged only by looking at him. “We are probing under what circumstances he was issued the firearm,” said the CP. City police being custodian of the firearms belonging to the SPU releases them only after official communication. “We have called for the records from SPU to see how the weapon was released and also checking relevant entries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cp-orders-probe-how-cop-on-sl-was-issued-pistol/articleshow/84126717.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Ancient historical sculpture lies neglected in Maneri||KERI: In Maneri, Dodamarg taluka, situated on the Goa-Maharashtra border, there is a stone sculpture of Umasahita Shiva, lying in neglect. Few are aware of the rich history behind this sculpture that stands today as a silent reminder of the connect Goa once shared with the rest of the Konkan region. Maneri along with Pernem, Sattari and Bicholim were under the rule of Shivaji and rulers of Sawantwadi. After the conquest of the fort of Alorna in 1746 by the Portuguese, Pernem, Sattari and Bicholim were included in Goa, whereas Maneri was retained by rulers of Sawantwadi and then came under the British empire. Inspite of this, even today Maneri has maintained socio-cultural relationship with Pernem and Bicholim. Presently, Dodamarg has gained the status of taluka. But in the past Maneri, situated on the left bank of the river Colval, was a busy centre which connected to the route linking then states of Bijapur and Kolhapur. The Chalukyas of Badami were ruling over Goa-Konkan region from 578 to 700 AD with Revatidvipa (modern-day Redi) as the capital. The stone sculpture of Umasahita Shiva today is lying in the most neglected condition. Sanket Naik, a teacher from Sal of Bicholim, said, “Umasahita sculpture is lying in the open at Badamewadi in Maneri from where the remnants of the fort of Pathankot is located just 250 mts away. Hamlets of Khalcha Bazar and Varcha Bazar indicate the trade and commerce potentiality of the village. This sculpture throws light on the rich history and heritage of the Goa-Konkan region.” According to archaeologist and historian, V R Mitragotri, worship of Umasahita sculpture was prevalent in Goa from the beginning of 700AD till 1300AD. Six Umasahita Shiva sculptures have been documented from Goa. The stone sculpture of Maneri has Shiva and Parvati both in standing and tribhanga postures. As the sculpture is lying in open, it has considerably worn out due to the impact of sunlight and rain. The right hand of Shiva is broken while the left hand is shown embracing Parvati. Shiva and Parvati have been shown with ear rings, bracelets, armlets and anklets. Shiva has a crown on the head. Sanjay Natekar, heritage lover from Dodamarg said, “There is urgent need to protect this historic sculpture showcasing history of Pre-Portuguese Goa.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ancient-historical-sculpture-lies-neglected-in-maneri/articleshow/84126825.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Firdos Mirza, having expertise in the Constitutional matters, on Friday had said that President of India Ramnath Kovind didn’t extend boards’ tenure after it lapsed on April 30 last year. Therefore, neither the state government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray nor governor BS Koshyari could do anything to reconstitute them, as per Mirza. Senior counsel Shreehari Aney, who is representing the two petitioners, told TOI that they would be moving an amendment application praying for directives to the Government of India to take steps for extending the development boards’ tenure by making a request to the President in this regard. “This important aspect somehow escaped from the studies done by the petitioners. However, we had already made the Union of India as one of our respondents in the PIL. Someone had to point out to the governor to write a letter to the President to bring this aspect to the fore. Previously, I had written to Koshyari for an appointment on this issue, but neither there was a reply nor acknowledgement from his side,” he said. The BJP leaders are blaming the MVA government over this issue. “But the ball is in court of the party’s government at the centre,” said energy minister Nitin Raut asking the saffron party to do self-introspection. “In their tenure, the BJP had also dropped the word “statutory” from the development board, thus violating the Constitution. At least now its leaders in Maharashtra should take a lead and request their seniors in Delhi to approach the President at the earliest, so that the boards could be reconstituted without further delay,” he told TOI. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadanvis, however, told TOI that the state cabinet needs to move the proposal with the President through governor and not the Central cabinet. Fadnavis said the last time when extension was granted by the President during his tenure as CM, his cabinet had recommended it through the governor. “The President can delegate this responsibility to the governor. Both houses had already discussed this issue in detail during the budget session,” said Fadnavis. * The case - The tenure of statutory development boards lapsed on April 30, 2020 - Pro-Vidarbha activists Nitin Ronghe and Kapil Chandrayan (former VSDB member) accuses Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of failing to make new appointments on these boards - They knocked the judiciary’s doors for reconstitution of these boards for Vidarbha, Marathwada and rest of India - Blaming the state and governor for inaction, they prayed for directives to the Centre for imposition of President’s rule under Article 356 of Constitution - HC issued notices to chief secretaries of central and state governments while criticising the latter for discriminating with the backward regions like Vidarbha||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pil-in-hc-over-statutory-boards-reconstitution-to-be-amended/articleshow/84126775.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Police were alerted by a socially active group after they had come across the video posted on social media. It’s learnt that Khan, miffed with his 17-year-old girlfriend for being friendly with another youngster, had forcibly whisked her away on a scooter driven by Shah from Kamal chowk on June 18. She was released at Itabhatti Chowk after some onlookers rushed to rescue her. The girl had fainted at the Itabhatti Chowk from where she was rushed to a hospital but did not lodged a complaint fearing more humiliation and torture. Crime branch had earlier rounded up Khan in the past for posting rumours about Covid on social media last year. While the scooter was being driven by Shah, Khan was seated behind with the girl in between. Khan, while recording the video in selfie mode, was also seen narrating the reason behind his dramatic revenge action on his girlfriend whom he abuses too for allegedly two-timing him. As he was speaking on camera, Khan was also seen manhandling the girl who was finally released at Itabhatti chowk. He was also heard mentioning about having physically exploited the girl in the past. It had later came to fore that he was repeatedly forcing himself upon her by promising marriage at different lodges in Kamptee and Kanhan. The crime branch, assisted by the cyber cell, had first managed to trace the girl in north Nagpur and later zeroed in on Khan and Shah following her assistance. The crime branch team of senior PI Sandipan Pawar and assistant PI Pawan More under addl CP Sunil Phulari and DCP Gajanan Rajmane managed to crack the case within a short time. Khan and Shah were later handed over to Pachpaoli police station where they were slapped with various offences, including rape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-arrest-tik-tok-star-after-posting-torture-video-of-girlfriend-on-scooter/articleshow/84126856.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Mastermind behind attack on RTI activist at Sancoale held||Vasco: Moving swiftly, Verna police on Sunday arrested the mastermind behind the attack on RTI activist Narayan Naik. The accused Ram Prasad Yadav, alias Kariya, is allegedly linked to politicians in Sancoale, sources said. Naik was attacked at the Sancoale panchayat building on Saturday noon. The RTI activist had come under target for raising his voice against illegalities happening in Sancoale panchayat and nearby areas. Interestingly, police said that Kariya was present during the assault and even helped lift Naik after he was injured and took him to his car. Police sources revealed that Verna police, during the panchnama, recovered a mobile phone from the site of the assault. The phone was traced to a history sheeter from Baina, Vasco Kabbu. The call details on the phone gave police an insight into the conspiracy. Kariya allegedly paid Kabbu and one other to attack Naik. While Kariya has been arrested, Kabbu and his partner are missing. Kariya had contested the last panchayat elections and had given his opponent a tough fight. He is said to be close to politicians in Sancoale, as per sources. Police are, however, yet to establish whether the politicians Kariya is linked to are also involved in the assault. The Verna police have arrested Kriya under Section 120 (B) of IPC. It may be recalled that two men wearing grey colour raincoats and masks attacked Naik with an iron road in the Sancoale panchayat building. Naik had sustained grievous injuries to his head and leg. The assailants even threatened him and his accomplice with firearms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mastermind-behind-attack-on-rti-activist-at-sancoale-held/articleshow/84126818.cms||---

Apart from stringently following Covid-appropriate behaviour, including proper use of quality mask, experts also suggest patients with existing lung diseases to get vaccine protection before the onset of the projected third wave of Covid pandemic. Pulmonologist Dr Manoj Pethe said studies have showed Delta Plus to be quite infectious, more communicable and virulent than its predecessors. “Definitely, we are learning that Delta Plus’s affinity towards mucosal lining is more. There are receptors in the lining to which this mutant variant gets attached and binds itself,” he said. Dr Pethe, who is associated with Alexis Hospital, said, “Covid-19 second wave was more unpredictable than the first. Hence, we can see how infectivity and predictability factors had changed in the past. Going by that pattern, we can expect surprises now too.” Patients with lung fibrosis, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases), lung cancer, old TB and so on are at higher risk even if they are vaccinated, he said. Pulmonologist Dr Vikram Rathi, associated with Kingsway Hospital, said research papers suggest that the Delta Plus variant replicates faster and also can evade body’s immunity. “The studies have highlighted that Delta Plus is 50% more transmissible than the earlier variants. It definitely has a greater affinity to the lungs’ mucosal lining, but the extent of damage it can cause is yet not clear,” he said. “Patients with pre-existing chronic lung conditions are more susceptible to suffer moderate to severe form of this diseases,” said Dr Rathi. Another pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat said World Health Organization (WHO) has already cautioned about Delta Plus to be the fastest and fittest variant to have emerged so far. “With 50%-60% more transmission rate, the WHO studies have suggested that more variants can be expected,” said Dr Arbat. He too stated that the Delta Plus can be effectively countered with vaccination. “Current vaccines have potency to reduce death rate and hence all must go for the jabs,” he said. “People with compromised lungs are the ones who have bigger risk from this variant. Such patients may suffer a serious fall in lungs functioning and the outcome may be more severe,” he said. Pulmonologist Dr Vivek Gupta said people with existing lung diseases or with co-morbidities must go for the vaccination as a priority to guard against the Delta Plus variant and the third wave. “My experience of two waves suggested that patients with lung fibrosis were more severely affected than the ones with asthma and on inhaler treatment,” he said. Pulmonologist Dr Shashank Kharwade too underlined the fact highlighted by global virologists saying Delta Plus has stronger binding capability to lung mucosal receptors and potential reduction in responses to monoclonal antibody treatments. “Obviously, patients with pre-morbid conditions are in the risk zone,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/get-the-jab-to-fight-delta-plus-experts-advise-lung-patients/articleshow/84126927.cms||Soumitra Bose

All India Trade Union Congress representative Christopher Fonseca, on behalf of mining company workers, met Sawant at Ravindra Bhavan, Sakhali, and requested him to restart mining activities at the earliest. Fonseca also requested him to direct mining companies to give at least 50% salary to mining workers who are not at work. “Once everything is completed, all legal mines will restart at the earliest through the mining corporation,” the CM said after listening to their grievances. He said he will hold talks with mining companies regarding payment of half salary to the workers. About 100 workers of mining companies were present. Earlier, Akhil Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh’s Binaykumar Sinha said the government should establish a mining corporation urgently to solve problems of mining workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-mining-corp-process-hastened/articleshow/84127000.cms||---

The fire broke at around 10.30pm in the shop selling gift items. The fire was the result of an electrical short circuit. The adjacent garment shop too was gutted. Residents in the building immediately evacuated their flats after hearing continuous blast. The blast, they said, occurred due to the storage of items such as body spray cans, sanitizer bottles and other inflammable liquid. “When I heard the continuous blasts below my flat, I came down to see what was wrong. That’s when I noticed smoke emitting out of the shops. We immediately alerted the residents and told them to evacuate their flats and informed the fire service,” a resident, Pratisha Naik, said. Another resident, Onita Goes, said, “I noticed that the floor of the flat had become very hot. Then we were informed about the fire.” Fire tender from Curchorem fire station reached the incident site with two water tankers and succeeded in extinguishing the fire. The electricity department temporarily shut down both transformers in the vicinity as a safety precaution. Quepem police have conducted panchanama of both shops. According to the shop owners, the estimated loss is worth nearly Rs 30 lakh. Neither of the shops were insured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/2-shops-gutted-in-quepem-mkt-loss-estimated-at-rs-30l/articleshow/84127284.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: O Panneerselvam wades into DMK’s ‘Ondriya Arasu’ battle||CHENNAI: AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam rose to the BJP-led government’s defence on Sunday, slamming the DMK government’s ‘Ondriya Arasu’ (Union government) rhetoric and questioned the direction in which the state was headed. Instead of focusing its attention in establishing an amicable relationship with the Centre and getting the much-needed benefits for the welfare of Tamil Nadu and its people, the DMK government’s move to belittle the Centre by stirring a controversy was not appreciated by the people of the state, said Panneerselvam. Recalling the speech made by M K Stalin, the then leader of the opposition and now Tamil Nadu chief minister, in the state assembly on July 19, 2019 that when DMK comes to power it will not only implement what it promised, but also things it did not promise, Panneerselvam wondered whether the CM meant the party’s ‘Ondriya Arasu’ barb and the absence of ‘Jai Hind’ in the governor’s address. “Ever since the DMK came to power, addressing the Centre as the ‘Ondriya Arasu’ (Union government) has become customary. In fact, chief minister Stalin even sought to explain it away as routine by citing the Indian Constitution, whose first line mentions India as a ‘Union of States’, and it is not against law. But Stalin will do well to remember that B R Ambedkar had explained the ‘Union of States’ as an ‘Union comprising the states’,” Panneerselvam said. The Indian Constitution, when referring to the Centre, has termed it always as the government of India. Hence, whichever party is in power in the Centre, the government will be known only as the Indian government. “Even former chief minister and DMK leader M Karunanidhi had mentioned the Centre as Indian Union government in several resolutions passed in the state assembly,” Panneerselvam said. Panneerselvam, who is also the deputy leader of the AIADMK legislature party, urged chief minister Stalin to take steps to remove the remarks made by MLA E R Easwaran, a DMK ally, that the absence of ‘Jai Hind’ in the governor’s address to the assembly recently, had “enabled Tamil Nadu to hold its head high”. “Jai Hind is a slogan coined by Shenbagaraman Pillai and used by several freedom fighters, including V O Chidambaram Pillai, Tirupur Kumaran, Dheeran Chinnamalai and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Casting aspersions on such a slogan is not right and hence should be removed from the assembly records,” Panneerselvam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ops-wades-into-dmks-ondriya-arasu-battle/articleshow/84129986.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi stadiums to open, but without spectators||NEW DELHI: From Monday, stadiums and sports complexes in the capital will reopen, but without spectators. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), however, has not removed the restrictions on opening of educational institutions, cinema halls and swimming pools, and on any kind of public gathering etc. in its order. The Delhi Metro and buses would also have to keep operating with only 50% seating capacity and no standing passengers. All existing restrictions remain in place. No further relaxations for public transport yetWhile all existing restrictions remain in place, the DDMA, in its order, has permitted stadia and sports complexes to open without spectators, subject to strict compliance of standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the central government on January 29, 2021, which include strict adherence of Covid appropriate behaviour like wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing, regular hand washing, etc. Although stadiums and sports complexes have now been allowed to reopen by DDMA, these were already permitted to be used for training of sports persons for participation in national or international sports events as well as for organising sports events. While spectators have not been allowed by DDMA, the SOP issued earlier this year by the Centre mandated thermal screening of all athletes and support staff and considering their RT-PCR test 72 hours prior to the sporting event depending on the scale of the event. The SOP also said that support staff not physically required at the event should work through video conferencing. It also directs that a Covid-19 task force should be constituted for each sporting competition by the organising committee to guide and monitor all athletes and support personnel. A complete lockdown was imposed on April 19 due to the exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 cases and positivity rate. Since May 31, as both the figures have been coming down, the gradual unlock process was initiated and last week, gyms and yoga institutes were allowed to reopen with 50% capacity and weddings were allowed to take place in banquet halls, marriage halls and hotels with a ceiling of 50 persons. Banquet halls, however, have yet not been allowed to operate for any other purpose. Despite the gradual relaxation in economic activities, the prohibition remains on all educational institutions, cinemas and theatres, spas, auditoriums and assembly halls, business to business exhibitions, swimming pools, all social, political, religious, festival, amusement parks, sports, entertainment, cultural & academic gatherings. The stringent curbs on the number of passengers allowed in public transport has led to hapless commuters being compelled to wait for nearly an hour on average to enter busy metro stations during peak hours and bus stops also remain crowded at rush hour. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had written to the divisional commissioner of Delhi, who is also secretary, DDMA, to allow standing passengers in its trains but the request had not been considered for two weeks in a row. “It’s really unfortunate that we have to run our trains almost empty, with just about 10-12% passengers. We are running full number of trains with hardly any occupancy while passengers outside the station are facing huge inconvenience,” DMRC managing director Mangu Singh told TOI on Thursday. If standing passengers are allowed, the capacity would double, he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-stadiums-to-open-but-without-spectators/articleshow/84130063.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||Give proper compensation to Smart city PAPs: Nitin Gadkari||NAGPUR: Union transport minister and city MP Nitin Gadkari on Saturday asked the Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) to give proper compensation to project-affected people (PAPs) under the Smart City area in east Nagpur. Gadkari on Saturday evening convened a review meeting of NSSCDCL, which was attended by mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, Smart City CEO Buvneshwari S, MLAs Krishna Khopde, Mohan Mate, MLC Pravin Datke and collector Ravindra Thakare among others. The Union minister expressed concern over slow progress of works. NSSCDCL is implementing several projects under the Smart City Mission, which included Rs 650 crore tenderSure and Rs 220 crore Home Sweet Home. The meeting discussed that NSSCDCL work is going on at a snail’s pace in various proposed projects. “On ground zero, there is only 20% work progress in the last so many years,” Khopde told Gadkari. NSSCDCL officials informed the Union minister that residents are citing inadequate compensation for not parting with their land for Smart City projects. They also claimed not having enough funds for granting compensation to the PAPs. Gadkari said if people are unhappy with the compensation amount, then the NSSCDCL and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) should give transfer of development rights (TDR) to such PAPs. The minister directed Nagpur Improvement Trust chairman Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi to hand over its land in east Nagpur to the NSSCDCL so that rehabilitation of PAPs can be started. He asked NSSCDCL to include construction of internal roads under area-based development of 1,730 acre land in Punapur, Pardi and Bharatwada in east Nagpur. Over NSSDCL citing shortage of funds, Gadkari asked officials to decrease the thickness of existing road projects there and to utilize the amount saved for constructing internal roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/give-proper-compensation-to-smart-city-paps-gadkari/articleshow/84103134.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hospital's lack of funds to buy shots led to fake vax scam||MUMBAI: How was the plan to pass off saline water as Covid-19 vaccine hatched? More than a fortnight after the fake vaccine scam broke out, impacting over 4000 citizens across Mumbai Metropolitan Region, details have begun to trickle in. The brazen racket involved a hospital owner, a doctor, a former medical association member, an ex hospital employee and an event manager. At the centre of the case has been Charkop’s Shivam Hospital, which was recently sealed by the BMC. Between March 5 and April 28, Shivam Hospital was a Private Covid Vaccination Centre (PCVC) and administered more than 16000 jabs in an official capacity. Investigators said that the hospital management intended to procure 1 lakh additional doses directly from the manufacturer. The hospital began taking bookings for vaccination camps with the help of Mahendra Singh, a former member of the Malad Medical Association and adept in organising medical conferences. However, the hospital was unable to gather funds required for purchasing 1 lakh doses. “Even after the hospital ceased to be a PCVC, they were keen to honour the bookings they had taken. At this point, Dr Manish Tripathi, who runs a training and placement institute inside Shivam Hospital, and Neeta Pataria, whose family owns the hospital, came up with the idea of injecting saline water,” said a senior police officer associated with the probe. They had to check if their idea would cause any side-effects though. So Tripathi’s student, Kareem Ali, became the guinea pig. Ali, presently in police custody along with Tripathi and Neeta, faced no trouble on being injected with saline water. The group then organised their first camp where saline water shots were given to people. “Some rules were laid down: vials had to be carried in ice-boxes to prevent suspicion. Sometimes, the fridge at the establishment where the camp was conducted was used for storing vials. The other rule was to not allow any photos to be clicked on site,” said another investigator. Singh roped in more people—one of them being Kokilaben Ambani Hospital’s ex employee Rajesh Pandey—to scout for targets. An event manager, Sanjay Gupta, was also roped in to organise camps. Singh, Neeta and Dr Tripathi had meetings at a Malad resort to discuss finances and firms to target next. Things ran smoothly until residents of Kandivali’s Hiranandani Heritage raised a stink about vaccine certificates not being generated and called the cops on June 15. “The accused misused logins of two private hospitals and BMC’s Nesco Jumbo Covid centre to generate a few certificates. But these had incorrect venues and dates on them which was unhelpful for the gang,” said the officer. Police admit they initially thought the vaccination camps had only violated technical guidelines, such as not informing the BMC. A thorough probe showed that at least 9 of the 12 camps so far definitely used saline water instead of vaccines. “Neeta and Shivraj Pataria have been in police custody since June 24, but apart from collecting documents related to Shivam Hospital, the police have found nothing. Their arrests have been made only on the basis of statements of co-accused, which has no evidentiary value in court,” said Kshitij Mehta, the couple’s lawyer. Tripathi’s lawyer refused to comment on the probe. On Sunday, he told a magistrate court at Borivali that Tripathi was “tortured in police custody.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hospitals-lack-of-funds-to-buy-shots-led-to-fake-vax-scam/articleshow/84130071.cms||Nitasha Natu

Up against the might of Mohun Bagan at the packed Bangalore Football Association ground, Dempo found themselves with an opportunity, even before their opponents – and the spectators – had settled down. Praveen Fernandes got hold of the ball about 30 yards away from the Bagan goal and lobbed it over the defenders. His strike partner, Marcus Carvalho, darted from nowhere, but with only goalkeeper Tanumoy Bose at his mercy, shot wide. Carvalho couldn’t believe his eyes. The fans either. Dempo had won the inaugural Scissors Cup, a prestigious all-India invitational tournament started by the All India Football Federation in 1992. Having lost to East Bengal the next year, they were now keen to make amends. Dempo didn’t have the most encouraging of runs, ahead of the final. After scripting a 2-1 win against ITI, the Goans drew both their remaining league games, including one against Bagan. Against Mahindra & Mahindra in the semifinals, they managed a solitary goal victory. Bagan were the defending champions and overwhelming favourites. Packed with an all-star squad that had the likes of IM Vijayan, Jo Paul Ancheri, Aloke Mukherjee, Aloke Das, Gunabir Singh, besides Nigerians Bernard Oparanozie and Chibuzor Nwakanma, they were expected to pocket this title. Bagan had the credentials and form too, never mind the absence of midfielder Satyajit Chatterjee, who remained suspended for the final. Having defeated fierce rivals East Bengal, despite being reduced to 10 men in the semis, the Kolkata giants were on a high. After winning the Federation Cup in Goa and Durand Cup in Delhi, a hat-trick looked a mere formality. “We knew that we had a chance against a star-studded team like Mohun Bagan only if all of us were at our best,” says Dempo midfielder Orlando Viegas. So it all started with the number one name on the team list, Casmiro Palha. The Dempo goalkeeper was in terrific form and probably played the match of his life. With spectacular first-half saves to deny Vijayan and Ancheri, he kept Dempo in the hunt. After the change of ends, Palha did even better, nullifying the opposition’s three-pronged attack. “The story of the match was pretty simple,” recalls Viegas. “We had an all-Goan team, a great group of players. In the final, every time Mohun Bagan attacked, Casmiro made a save. Every time we attacked, Marcus mostly scored.” Dempo’s first came in the 42nd minute. True to style, it was an opportunistic strike from Carvalho. Camilo Gonsalves had done well to leave Aloke Das behind with sheer speed. When the striker clashed with the goalkeeper, the ball fell at the feet of the onrushing Carvalho, who, unlike the first minute, made no mistake. Bagan’s response was understandably fierce. They played their best immediately after resumption of play in the second session and dominated. A team with all internationals, they attacked in numbers. But Dempo’s defence of Jerry Fernandes (captain), Xavier Colaco, Hercules Gomes and Mathew Rodrigues stood tall. Once Dempo survived that onslaught, the midfield took control. Mario Soares, Francis Silveira (Pocket) and Viegas dictated terms. Soon enough, the Goans had their second goal, thanks to another opportunistic strike from Carvalho. The Dempo striker saved his best for the last. Substitute Pascoal Pereira latched on to a diagonal ball from Gonsalves and played it forward to Carvalho, who outpaced the entire defence and then drove a fierce right-footer to make it 3-0. “That was my best show,” says Carvalho. “Mohun Bagan were the most-feared team in Indian football. To score a hat-trick against them, that too in the final being played away from home, will always remain special.” Everyone watched those goals and the final result in amazement. Not since losing 0-4 against Orkay Mills in the 1978 Rovers Cup quarterfinals – Rosario Antao, who later joined Dempo, scoring a hat-trick -- had Bagan tasted such a heavy defeat. “Today, contrary to expectations, Dempo played like a champion club. The match was a fitting finale to the 13-day highest prize money tournament. Football enthusiasts feel this was the match of the decade,” a news agency noted in its match report. A year later, the finalists met again, this time in the opening match of the group stage. Dempo, again, got the better of their Kolkata rivals 2-1 with Gonsalves scoring both goals. However, losses against eventual champions JCT Mills (0-2) and finalists Malaysian club Perlis FA (0-1), signalled an early exit. There was no end, though, to Dempo’s love affair with Scissors Cup. In 1996, the Goan champions triumphed for a record third time, putting it across heavyweights like Al Baniyas (UAE) 2-0 and East Bengal 3-1, before Silveira scored the all-important goal against Indian Bank in the title clash. Of the three trophies, 1994 remains special. After all, a big win and hat-trick in the final are the stuff of dreams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-hat-trick-to-remember/articleshow/84126527.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The Yogi Adityanath government had fixed the target of planting 30 crore saplings in 2021-22 out of which 25 crore were to be planted on Sunday. Surpassing the target, over 25.5 crore trees were planted during the day. The remaining five crore trees will also be planted this month. Governor Anandiben Patel during a Van Mahotsav programme near Jhansi, where she planted a banyan and peepal tree on Sunday.While Governor Anandiben Patel participated in the plantation of ‘Smriti Vatika’, which has 5,000 saplings, in Jhansi, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath attended a programme in Sultanpur along the Purvanchal Expressway (at Package-3 of the expressway in Baldirai tehsil). Purvanchal Expressway is set to be inaugurated next month. Speaking on the occasion, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the state was about to create many new records in plantation this year. Purvanchal e-way to be green model & industrial corridorIn the last five years (including the number of trees planted in the last four years and 30cr in 2021-22), UP will complete plantation of over 100 crore trees,” Yogi said, appreciating the people’s enthusiasm towards the campaign. In 2017-18, total 5.71crore trees were planted which went up to 11.77 crore in 2018-19. About 22.59 crore trees were planted in 2019-20 followed by 25.87crore in 2020-21. The plantation drive, which started on July 1 to mark Vriksharopan Janaandolan, will continue in all districts till July 7. The record of plantation of 25 crore saplings was achieved at 5.49pm on Sunday, and by late evening, 25,51,04,004 (25.5crore) saplings had been planted. Over five crore trees were planted by citizens, farmers, organizations and institutes on occasions like the World Environment Day and others which was over and above the departmental plantation. Addressing the programme in Sultanpur, the CM said: “Two-three years ago, we had agricultural fields and ordinary land here. Today, we have Purvanchal Expressway which will be the backbone of east UP’s economy.” “Keeping the Purvanchal Expressway in mind, our government will develop five industrial clusters at five different locations. This will help the youth find jobs in UP itself. The youth will realize the PM’s dream of making UP a one-billion dollar economy,” Yogi said. He said plantation along the Purvanchal Expressway by his government would set an example. The Expressway would not only be an industrial corridor but also a model of environment conservation, CM said. “The state government is working towards the creation of employment opportunities in eastern UP and boosting industrialization in the region,” he added. Yogi said he wished that the plantation drive was organised under a 100-year-old tree in Sultanpur which was declared a heritage tree by the state government. “I performed puja at the site before I came here to address you all. I wish this programme was organised under the banyan tree. It would have added to the beauty of the event.” The CM said during previous campaigns he had participated in the plantation of Navgrah Vatika, Nakshatra Vatika and Panchvati. “I am fortunate that I got the opportunity to plant trees which are considered to be pious in our ‘Rishi Parampara’.” Among the new initiatives of forest department was raising of a ‘Smriti Vatika’. “I appreciate the forest department for laying these gardens in the memory of those who died during Covid-19 pandemic. I wish their memories stay alive through these vatikas,” he said. The CM also appealed to the people to adhere to Covid-19 protocol religiously. “The pandemic is not yet over though we have successfully controlled it to a large extent. We are providing all facilities from testing to vaccination and sanitization. People should listen to surveillance committees and follow their advice on vaccination. Vaccine is the only protective shield against coronavirus.” To encourage people to plant more saplings, the government has also started a competition and winners will be awarded. People will have to upload photographs of plantation on forest department’s website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-achieves-new-green-feat-plants-25-5-crore-saplings-in-a-day/articleshow/84130093.cms||Neha Shukla

On Saturday, the India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji recorded a 3% deficit, that may keep growing. The total seasonal rainfall till June 30 was 953.7mm, as compared to the normal of 898.5mm. Rainfall in June this year was boosted by heavy precipitation from June 15 to 17, as three rainy days added nearly 300mm to the total. “The monsoon rainfall in Goa has been subdued during June this year due to the weakening of cross equatorial flow and lack of convective systems over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. The low-level jet that brings in moisture from the Arabian Sea into the subcontinent has weakened,” meteorologist and National Institute of Oceanography’s former chief scientist M R Ramesh Kumar said. The quantum of rainfall increased slightly during the last 24 hours till Sunday morning, as Canacona recorded almost heavy rainfall of 64mm, Panaji 40mm, Quepem 29.2mm, Mormugao 24.2mm, Pernem20.8mm and other centres less. The total rainfall has touched 1,010.8mm on Sunday, as compared to a normal of 1050.8mm, the surplus being 4%. Rainfall is likely to be light to moderate in intensity till July 7, IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-activity-slows-down-drops-june-surplus-to-just-6/articleshow/84126394.cms||---

Pacheco told reporters his intention of joining Congress “very soon” and of contesting the 2022 assembly elections. “I will very soon join Congress along with 3,000 youth. I will help revive the Congress. I am in touch with central Congress leaders,” he said. He, however, said that he was against the idea of Congress forming an alliance with any other party for the 2022 polls. He said that other parties should merge into Congress instead of fighting the elections in alliance. Pacheco said he was against any change of guard within Congress at this juncture. “This is not the time for changing party leadership and levelling charges against the state Congress president. The Congress leaders in Delhi should place their trust in Girish Chodankar. Change of leadership will only lead to infighting,” he said. He said he was undecided about the choice of constituency from where he would contest. “I can contest from anywhere, Benaulim or Nuvem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-join-cong-help-revive-party-mickky/articleshow/84126445.cms||---

BJP’s national general secretary in charge of Goa affairs C T Ravi, state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade, general secretary Narendra Sawaikar, organisational generational secretary Satish Dhond, and other senior party functionaries addressed the meeting. Tanavade lauded the karyakartas for the “tremendous work” they did during the pandemic by reaching out to those in need. He expressed his appreciation for the karyakartas for “overcoming all challenges and moving towards victory”. Party sources said that the speakers impressed upon the karyakartas the need to work towards victory by strengthening the organisation at the grassroots level, particularly as BJP has decided to go it alone in the polls. Sources said that the mood among party workers in constituencies represented by MLAs who had hopped over from Congress had undergone a significant change over the last few months. “The resentment that was quite palpable a few months back is now significantly subdued, as witnessed in the series of programmes organised by the party recently in all constituencies. The party leaders have largely succeeded in bringing about reconciliation among the two factions over the defection issue,” a senior party functionary said.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: TMC-BJP war of words over petrol price hike||KOLKATA: Four months after Bengal slashed petrol and diesel sales tax by one rupee and chief minister Mamata Banerjee took an e-scooter to work, fuel price hike took political centre stage on Sunday with Trinamool Congress dubbing it to be a “brazen loot of public money” and Bengal BJP questioning why the state wasn’t reducing its tax component again. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee put the blame on the PM, quipping, “Modi babu petrol bekabu.” Banerjee posted on Twitter, “As fuel prices hit a HISTORIC HIGH, @BJP4India govt (government) seems to be working very hard towards adding to the woes of the public. Not much has changed from 2020. The same old blame game continues while the demands of the people of India are conveniently ignored!” The Bengal BJP said, “Forty-two per cent of all taxes collected go to the state government. Besides why hasn’t Mamata Banerjee reduced the state levy, which is among the highest across the states. Just because you need it to fund your syndicates? What have the people of Bengal elected TMC for?” TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray responded, “The BJP has got its facts muddled. There are three additional components to a fuel price, a tax by the Centre, an educational cess also charged by the Centre and a state VAT component. It is a brazen loot of public money.” Bengal had, in February, reduced its tax component in fuel sales, daring the Modi government to follow suit. Taking to Twitter, senior state minister Partha Chatterjee said, “Mr @narendramodi has a penchant for drama every time the people of India are in distress! Now with the skyrocketing petrol prices, why has he gone into hiding? Preparing for a big lie-laden speech Mr Prime Minister?” “Around June 2020, I remember petrol prices were being hiked for nearly 17 days at a stretch! Within a year, we’ve crossed Rs 100 in several cities across India. Shri @narendramodi kindly get off your high horse & take cognizance of the woes of your people!” Bengal transport minister Firhad Hakim said on the micro-blogging site. TMC youth president Saayoni Ghosh tweeted, "Even if @BJP4India couldn’t attain their desired #IssBar200Paar in WB elections, they sure achieved #IssBar100Paar in petrol price hike nationwide. #56inchTrouble for ‘mere pyaare deshvasio’”. BJP leader Samik Bhattacharya said criticism will not solve the problem. “Why isn’t the state government reducing its levies? Everyone knows how the Centre is managing the current crisis. A joint effort from the central government and states is required to address the issue,” he said. He called for inclusion of petro products under the GST regime. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the (state) government should first answer why vegetable prices were increasing every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-bjp-war-of-words-over-petrol-price-hike/articleshow/84126548.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Covid, two cyclones pushed trafficking survivors into debt traps, says study||KOLKATA: Fifteen-year-old Laxmi Naskar (name changed), from Joynagar in South 24 Parganas, was trafficked in September 2019, just before Durga puja. She was rescued five months later from a brothel in Maharashtra. Her family — all of them fishermen — was pushed into dire straits by the Covid-19 pandemic. Then two cyclones, Amphan and Yaas, struck deadly blows. The dams in her area broke and saline water overflowed into ponds, killing all the fish. To make ends meet, Laxmi had to borrow Rs 32,000, after already having borrowed Rs 20,000 last year. A year-long study by Tafteesh — a coalition of anti-trafficking stakeholders including lawyers, researchers, psychologists, social workers and survivors — has found 47% of trafficking victims from Bengal had to resort to borrowing for survival since Covid-19 struck. The cyclones made matters worse. These women have borrowed amounts between Rs 10,000-Rs 1.3 lakh, 10% of them engaging in non-banking and high-risk borrowing. The NGOs have now sought financial packages from the state government to help them. “It appears that people belonging to this vulnerable section have far more been hit economically during the second wave, believed to have started in India around March, than in the first wave when they have at least accessed free ration and cash support provided by the state and central governments. However, this time around, the government’s focus was mostly to strengthen the healthcare system, this section was left out “ the report stated. Rukshana Khatun (name changed), 36, from Basanti area was trafficked in May 2018 to Maharashtra before being rescued six months later. Covid snatched her regular income after the small shop she owned had to shut down. “Her house was broken after Amphan and Yaas destroyed the roof. Even her shop was damaged. She had taken a loan of Rs 60,000 last year and this year, she had to borrow Rs 45,000,” said Shaswati Mallick, one of the main surveyors of the project. “There are areas of serious concern. The loan rate is very high,” said Subhasree Raptan of Goranbose Gram Bikash Kendra, one of the partners of Tafteesh. “Out of 53 survivors we interviewed, 25 said they took a loan. The amount borrowed in South 24 Parganas varies between Rs 5,000 and Rs 1,30,000 and annual interest rate goes up to even above 200%. Out of these 25 survivors, 24 said ‘no work was going on’. Of these 24 women, 23 do not have any land. Of the 23, 18 have household income less than Rs 3,000. In fact, 16 of them have zero household income. Among these 16 survivors with no work, no land and no household income, the amount they have to repay per month goes up to Rs 10,530.” It was also found that a significant proportion of the survivors took new loans to repay existing ones. These debt traps again increased their risk of becoming indentured labourers and victims of trafficking, the study concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-2-cyclones-pushed-trafficking-survivors-into-debt-traps-says-study/articleshow/84126645.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Two more arrested in Kolkata BJP leader Abhijit Sarkar's murder case||KOLKATA: Police on Saturday night arrested two key accused in the murder of BJP trade union leader Abhijit Sarkar on May 2 after poll results were declared. Earlier on Saturday, state DGP Virendra chaired a high-level meeting in which FIRs on complaints of post-poll violence and probe were discussed with senior officers. The detective department’s late night arrests were based on a tipoff that the duo — Sufal Das alias Ruidas and Sanjay Das alias Rana — had been holed up in Hooghly’s Hindmotor. Both are residents of Maniktala Main Road. Earlier, cops had arrested Sanjat Samanta and Samir Samanta in the case. The 30-year-old victim was allegedly lynched and then strangled at Narkeldanga’s Sitalatala before his mother and brother. On July 2, Calcutta High Court had asked for a second autopsy on Sarkar, also a Bhartiya Mazdoor Trade Union Council office-bearer, at Command Hospital. The family had questioned the findings of the first post-mortem. The body has been preserved at a city morgue. The five-judge HC bench, comprising acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar, asked the state government to “register” and “record with magistrates” all post-poll violence complaints lodged with it or the NHRC, adding that the NHRC report had “established prima facie” the “stand taken by the petitioners... that there had been post-poll violence”. The HC also told the state government to provide free ration to the victims if they had lost their ration cards. The bench will hear the matter again on July 13. Regarding DGP Virendra’s Saturday meeting, an officer said: “It was an internal review meeting. Nothing more should be read into it.” A petition seeking a CBI probe into Sarkar’s death has also been filed in Supreme Court. The apex court has sought the state’s response to it. On the night of May 2, when Abhijit, a trader, responded to knocking on their door, it was allegedly vandalised and his brother Biswajit and mother were targeted. The attackers dragged the brothers outside, but abandoned Biswajit a little distance from their home. Abhijit’s body was found later. The HC in its order regarding the second autopsy on Sarkar said: “The report shall specifically mention about the condition of the body as to whether it was properly preserved in the hospital where it was.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-bjp-leaders-murder-case-2-more-arrested/articleshow/84126289.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A notice was also issued to the nodal medical officer of the camp, Apurba Pan, and two nursing staffers, Monali Bhattacharjee and Sahnaj Parveen. Nitin Singhania, commissioner of AMC, said: “We have deployed a medical officer for observation for 3 days at the house of the person who received the vaccine and her condition is stable.” The show-cause notice against the four for medical negligence reached board of administrator chairperson Amar Nath on Sunday. Ara on Saturday had taken the syringe from a health worker and vaccinated a woman in the presence of government nodal medical officers and nursing staff at Sitarampur Chabka camp. The photograph went viral on social media. BJP MP Babul Supriyo took to Twitter to slam the incident. “It seems like TMC govt has no control over its administrators. TMC’s Tabassum Ara, a member of the administrative body of AMC, has vaccinated people... Will her political colour shield her from stern punishment?” he wrote. BJP MLA Agnimitra Paul said Ara had chosen to vaccinate people herself, in spite of doctors and nurses being present. Zishan Quraishi, vice-president of Bharatiya Janta Maniority Morcha, lodged a complaint at Kulti Police Station on the matter. West Burdwan Trinamool leader V Sivadasan said: “As per instruction of Swasthya Bhavan CMHO, West Burdwan district has already taken action regarding the issue.

BJP sources said, the party would soon be sprucing itself up for the kshetra panchayat elections to scale up its rural footprint and offset resurgence of an aggressive opposition. Santhosh’s affirmation of BJP’s victory in rural local bodies polls is another instance of Sangh backing Yogi, while relaying signals to party detractors — who stoked speculation about a possible change of guard — to fall in line. ‘PM & CM popularity neutralised opposition false narrative on pandemic mgmt’The zila panchayat elections assumed political significance even as an unrelenting opposition accused BJP of mishandling the pandemic. The ongoing farmers’ stir against new farm laws had lent traction to the opposition’s charge. BJP, however, managed to secure its position in all districts of the agriculturally rich west UP region, except Baghpat which was won by RLD. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh maintained that committed workers of the party and popularity of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi neutralised the false narrative pedalled by the Opposition on pandemic management and farm unrest. “The party would emerge even stronger,” he said, while speaking to TOI. RSS sources said, the Sangh has already asked its functionaries to form committees at panchayat level to help the state government in the eventuality of a third Covid wave, which is expected to affect children. Importantly, the issue of rural local bodies polls and combating the pandemic figured prominently at the recent high-level meetings presided over by Santhosh and party vice-president Radha Mohan Singh during their recent visit to Lucknow. The duo had subsequently conveyed the findings of the stock-taking exercise to the top BJP brass, including PM Modi, home minister Amit Shah and party national president JP Nadda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fresh-sangh-backing-for-uttar-pradesh-cm-yogi-adityanath-in-bl-santhoshs-tweet-on-bjp-sweep/articleshow/84130146.cms||Pankaj Shah

Refuting charges of any slowdown in their probe, he told TOI in an exclusive interview on the anniversary of the racket getting busted in July 2020 that the agency had accomplished its first target of issuing show cause notices. The investigation is progressing in the other duty evasion cases, he said. "The duty evasion cases of dates and Quran imports will be taken up subsequently. The currency case is also under probe... These cases have separate investigating officers and the probes are ongoing," he said. The agency will be issuing supplementary show cause notices in the gold case to at least 12 more persons. "People including Faisal Fareed, who is expected to be brought back soon, will be arrested and questioned... Certain people are at large and they will also be brought to justice soon," he said. Kumar said the agency was successful in identifying the destination and source of the smuggling syndicate. "The buyers and investors are among those who have been issued show cause notices... Many of the senders from the UAE are yet to be brought back, their names will come in supplementary show causes," he said. On probe by various agencies, Kumar said the laws under which each of them function are different. "The ED basically follows money laundering. NIA probes terror funding... Only Customs or DRI can investigate smuggling under the Customs Act. Everybody involved in smuggling need not be involved in other offences," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/karipur-could-have-same-ramifications-as-thiruvananthapuram/articleshow/84130037.cms||Disney Tom

---||Chandigarh||Cannot interfere with medical standards set by Army: Armed forces tribunal||CHANDIGARH: The armed forces tribunal (AFT) has made it clear that the Indian Army is a fighting force and if it has laid out a medical standard for entry as a matter of policy, then the tribunal cannot interfere with it. A division bench comprising Justice Sunita Gupta, judicial member and Air Marshal B B P Sinha, administrative member of principal bench of AFT, has passed these orders while deciding an issue where a soldier serving in the Army was rejected in the medical examination upon the recommendations of Services Selection Board (SSB) for officer’s post under the scheme of entry into Army Cadet College (ACC). Under the ACC, serving jawans are considered for commission into the Army. The matter had reached before the tribunal in the wake of an application filed by Naik Gurukul Lama, a soldier serving in the Army seeking directions to set aside medical communication dated September 26, 2019 and a letter dated December 5, 2019 issued by the Army. Not impressed by applicant’s logic, says AFT benchHe also sought directions to be allowed to undergo scheduled training for the ACC course at Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun. The applicant was enrolled into the Army and passed out a combatant soldier on August 21, 2011 after completion of training. After clearing a written examination for selection as an officer in the ACC course, he was recommended by SSB on September 24, 2019 for the officer’s rank. However, he was declared medically unfit in the associated medical examination by a special medical board on account of post-refractive surgery in both eyes. On his appeal, he was re-examined by another medical board and on November 1, 2019 was again declared unfit by the appeal medical board. However, another plea for reexamination was rejected after which he had approached the principal bench of AFT. The applicant had argued that he is a serving Naik in the Indian Army and was enrolled in the Army after an extensive examination and found fit as a combatant member of the Indian Army and has been serving with his utmost competency and guarding the nation successfully, which includes the performance of arms firing, including pistol shooting. The applicant had undergone laser-assisted refractive surgery (LASIK) and after surgery, his eyesight was within normal limits, therefore, it is not clear as to how the applicant has been declared unfit for LASIK refractive surgery when he was found fit in all other aspects of fitness standards. Responding to the petition, the military authorities informed the tribunal that the applicant was examined by qualified eye specialists in both the medical boards and after extensive investigation, he was found unfit by both the boards for the medical condition, as the same does not conform to the medical standards stipulated for the entry of officers in the armed forces. The authorities also contended that the reason for declaring the applicant unfit by the medical boards is post-LASIK refractive surgery the axial length of the applicant was found to be 26.28 mm for the right eye and 26.23 mm for the left eye which is higher than the prescribed limit of 26mm. In this regard, the military authorities referred to a policy dated July 16, 2019. They submitted that there was no bias or mala fide on the part of the authorities because the medical standards required for a combat force like the Army are decided after a lot of deliberations and actual field experience and the two medical boards have only conformed to the policy. Military authorities also made it clear that merely undergoing LASIK refractive surgery is not a disqualification in itself but after the surgery, the minimum acceptable standards for eyes, as set by the Army as policy, must be met. The applicant, however, stressed before the AFT that “if he is fit as jawan, why he could not be declared fit as an officer.” After hearing both the parties, the division bench observed that it is not for the tribunal to decide the medical standards of entry into the Army. “If the Army has decided on a set of medical standards for selection as an officer, the medical boards are bound to implement them and hence prima facie, we see no reason to interfere with the findings of the medical board. Additionally, we are not impressed by the logic tha t because the applicant was declared fit during his enrolment as a jawan, therefore, he should be declared fit for entry as an officer also,” observed the AFT bench while dismissing the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cannot-interfere-with-medical-standards-set-by-army-armed-forces-tribunal/articleshow/84130260.cms||Ajay Sura

The action came following objection from the Archaeological Survey of India as the apartment was being built near the ASI protected monument — The Residency. In March, LDA had razed the fifth floor of the apartment on the grounds that it had approved the building only upto four floors. The building was coming up on 3,600 square feet area. On June 24, the ASI had served notice to former MP after he failed to demolish the building. Later, ASI moved the court which ordered demolition of the building. ‘Daud was given enough time to demolish structure’Daud Ahmad was given sufficient time to raze the structure but he didn’t, therefore, LDA demolished it,” said an ASI official. “Complying with order, the structure was demolished on Sunday,” said DM Abishek Prakash.

They recommend parents and teachers to engage children in a playful manner and encourage them to wear masks to prevent the third wave. However, this is not to advise that the third wave would hit children more as compared to the adults. “There is no evidence in medical literature till date to establish that Covid would be severe during the third wave in children. It has been seen that in 90% of the children with Covid, symptoms have been mild to moderate. However, one must take necessary precautions,” said Prof Sanjay Verma, paediatrician at the PGI. Enumerating the ways to allow children to wear masks, Prof Prabhjot Malhi from the department of paediatrics, PGI, said, “Teachers can start the morning online classes by asking children to bring masks and colour them. They can also ask them to guess ‘who is who’ while the masks are worn. Such playful ways can help.” The doctors advise all children above the age of five to wear masks while outdoors. However, they feel as parents are the role model for the kids and they should also wear masks whenever they go out. “It is also an opportunity to teach the lessons of life, that is, if they are safe, we are keeping others safe, thus, actually fulfilling a societal role, community feeling can start at this level,” said Prof Malhi. There is medical literature that supports that masking is as protective as vaccines. “Vaccines for children are undergoing clinical trials. Until then, masking must be encouraged,” said Prof Meenu Singh, also from the bdepartment of pediatrics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/making-kids-friends-with-mask/articleshow/84130314.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The decision to hold the exams was taken after a meeting of PU authorities with municipal commissioner K K Yadav and other officers. The university explained about plans they have made for the exams and the strict rules and regulations. “As per the commitment PU has made with the civic body, they will start the process of taking the exams for all posts by the last month of July and will complete it by the end of August. Based on the results, eligible candidates will be selected. Information regarding the date of exams and other details will be sent to applicants soon,” a senior MC officer said. The MC has received 48,631 applications against 170 posts in 20 different categories. Since the civic body is going to recruit employees on most of these posts after a gap of almost eight to 10 years, the authority had hired Panjab University (PU) for the complete process, right from the beginning through written examination till declaration of results. As per MC records, the authority has received 18,377 applications for 41 posts of clerk, while 16,508 applications have come against 81 posts of firemen. For the post of sub-inspector of enforcement department, a total of 4,663 applications have been received against six posts and for the single post of law officer, 323 applicants have expressed interest. Even though almost all MC departments are struggling with manpower issues, the fire and emergency services is the worst affected. Since there was no recruitment of regular firemen to tackle fire cases and look into the related aspects since 2010, the department had to hire people on outsourcing basis against vacant posts. Besides, there is a huge dearth of clerks in majority of the wings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panjab-university-to-hold-exams-for-187-mc-posts-from-july-end/articleshow/84130350.cms||Deepak Yadav

The estate office has sent the matter to the sub-divisional magistrates of all three divisions to start the proceedings of the eviction. The issue of depositing the ground rent is going on for last over one year. Earlier, this year, the estate office had issue notices to 37 petrol pumps — 19 of IOCL, 10 of HPCL and eight of BPCL — to deposit their rent. Only 14 of them had responded. The reluctant behaviour of the others left the UT with no option but to issue the notices. The total rent of 37 petrol pumps was around Rs 25 crore. Out of these, 14 had paid Rs 14 crore. The remaining 23 petrol pumps have to pay around Rs 11 crore to the administration although the calculation is still going on in some of the cases. “The oil companies had to pay the amount by the end of March last year, but they failed to do so.

---||Ludhiana||‘Taksali Cong leader argument is hollow’||Jalandhar: Former Indian hockey captain and Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh has been vocal on issues with which Congress government and party are grappling in Punjab. As a lot is happening within the Congress and new issues and narratives are coming up, he spoke on the latest happenings in the party. You took the lead in raising issues about performance of Punjab government but crisis is not yet over. Where do you think things have reached? Party high command is very keen on working out a solution and has already given 18 tasks to CM with deadlines. This is the actual solution: to fulfil our poll promises. Other solutions can work only if party’s poll promises are fulfilled and culprits of looting the state are taken to task. There are talks and even meetings to maintain communal and caste balances when reshuffling is being talked about. These are attempts to side-track real issues which are about performance of the state government. All what is happening in the party now started with questions on the issues Punjab is facing and what we had promised before polls, but some quarters want people to believe that the real issues are communal and caste balances. Punjabis across communities follow Guru Nanak’s philosophy of universal humanism. For instance, PPCC president Sunil Jakhar, a Hindu, was most vociferous and consistent in seeking justice for sacrilege and police-firing victims. He never gave up the issue and was more vocal even than our Sikh leaders. This is what real Punjab is. We need competent persons from which ever community they are coming. Being a sportsperson, we only pick good players and not on the basis of communities. Good people would work for all, while bad can ditch even their own. Some leaders are openly advocating that only Taksali Congress leaders should be given prime positions by the party high command when Navjot Sidhu is expected to get an important role? This Taksali argument has been started only after talks about reshuffling in party leadership started. Those furthering this argument actually have their own interests. We need Taksali Punjabis, for whom Punjab is first and foremost. Parties and governments need fresh though processes and talent. How else a party can grow? Those who call themselves Taksali Congress leaders had brought the party to just 14 seats in state assembly in 1997. In parliamentary elections, party had dipped to two seats in 1996 and then to zero in 1998 when Taksali Congress leaders were at the helm in Punjab. Finally, party got Captain Amarinder Singh in its fold and its fortunes were revived. He became PPCC president in just three months of his joining the party. Then after 2012 elections, Manpreet Badal was brought in. They should check with party strategist Prashant Kishor about how much efforts he made to get Navjot Sidhu in the party in 2016. Leading countries in the world tend to bring in domain experts in crucial ministries. We have example of Dr Manmohan Singh, who was not even a member of the party when he was made finance minister and he ultimately remained Prime Minister for 10 years and led country to glory in both roles. Will now these Punjab leaders object to Dr Manmohan Singh’s elevation to the top? Go back in history, even Partap Singh Kairon was originally an Akali and was brought into Congress by Jawahar Lal Nehru, so was India’s most successful foreign affairs minister late Swaran Singh. Lok Sabha speaker late Sardar Hukam Singh and former Punjab minister and MP late Umrao Singh were also originally Akalis. Will now they erase this part of history and role of these stalwarts? This Taksali argument is hollow. Punjab is facing severe power crisis and now CM has said power purchase agreements (PPAs) are being examined. You raised this issue earlier and now your party is facing backlash from people? People understand that Akalis are bigger culprits who signed the lopsided PPAs, but of course we are also facing the heat. Examining their PPAs and action should have been done earlier as we had promised it before polls. Anyway, now the process should be fast and firm. Internal audits will bring these companies to their knees. However, real things are not being done. People are questioning your timing of raising questions as you openly started questioning the CM at the fag end of the government? I have been consistent in raising issues, but internally in meetings or through two letters over a year and half back. In internal meetings, I raised even those issues which probably no other leader raised. For instance, in my meeting with CM, I had objected to his uncharitable comments about Canadian defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan, when he visited India. I pointed it out that it did not send right message in our diaspora. After 1984, Sikhs did not vote for Congress, but now they have sided with Congress, but CM’s comments had not gone down well in the community. It seems the BJP-led Union government manipulated things in a way that two BJP CMs held meetings with Sajjan, but they made Punjab CM make adverse remarks. Union government apparently manipulated to push Sikhs away from Congress once again. I have been raising all other issues which I have raised recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/taksali-cong-leader-argument-is-hollow/articleshow/84126700.cms||IP Singh

The bus was going from Dighora village of Tikamgarh to Jhansi in UP when it came up against a road blockade over water crisis in the region. The driver took another route to bypass the protest and ended up in a small village, about 20km from Tikamgarh town. While passing through a narrow lane, the bus hit an electricity pole, and the high-tension cable fell on the vehicle. The dead woman was identified as Munni Bai, a resident of Jhansi. Maina Patel, SHO of Dighora, said they are looking for the driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-high-tension-wire-falls-on-bus-one-killed-six-injured-in-tikamgarh/articleshow/84130506.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Punjab: SAD (Sanyukat) has its sights on AAP||AMRITSAR: While SAD has forged a political alliance with BSP and agreed to give 20 assembly seats to their new political partner, it’s being rumoured that SAD (Sanyukta), a breakaway faction of SAD led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and Ranjit Singh Brahampura, is also looking for an alliance to emerge as a major third front in Punjab politics ahead of 2022 assembly elections. If sources are to be believed, senior leaders of SAD (S) and AAP had held a couple of meetings to discuss a possible alliance. It, however, couldn’t be announced during AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal’s June 21 Amritsar visit, when he had come to induct former inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Partap in the party fold. Former MLA and SAD (S) senior leader Ravinder Singh Brahampura told TOI on Friday: “It is clear that we can’t go with Congress, BJP or SAD (B), the only options left with us to form an alliance are AAP CPI, and CPM, which we are exploring.” Quoting a survey conducted by the party, he said people wanted to see AAP running the state as they were doing in Delhi. Sources instrumental in forging an alliance between AAP and SAD (S) have had two rounds of meetings with Kejriwal, but both sides had not reached any conclusion over few ‘differences. “An alliance has become even more necessary after SAD (B) made their alliance with BSP, no doubt. AAP has acceptance in Punjab, especially in Malwa, yet they lack a serious and mature Sikh face,” said sources. When contacted, leader of opposition and AAP leader Harpal Singh Cheema denied any ongoing effort of making an alliance with SAD (S). “These are rumours and nothing else, AAP will contest all 117 assembly seats of Punjab on its own,” he said. He said since AAP was new in Punjab elections, so they had made a few mistakes in the 2017 assembly elections but not this time. “People called us Khalsitanis, Naxalites and what not, but now they know very well that it is AAP only that can bring the state on path of development and come up to people’s expectations,” said Cheema.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sad-sanyukat-interested-in-aap-tie-up-but-feeling-not-mutual/articleshow/84126766.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chandigarh||Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar’s meeting with Birender Singh sets rumour mills rolling||CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s meeting with former Union minister Birender Singh over dinner at the latter’s residence in New Delhi has left everyone guessing. Khattar left for Gurgaon after attending a few functions in Karnal. After that, he went to New Delhi. Sources close to Khattar said the meeting was scheduled but expressed inability to divulge details. Khattar had called on Singh on Saturday evening. This meeting is seen as a crucial one as Birender Singh and his former MLA wife met the CM this way only when Khattar took oath for the second time. “He is CM of the state and Ch Birender Singh is among senior BJP leaders of the state as well as the Centre. Hence it could be formal as well as a courtesy call on the part of the CM. Rest, both leaders must have discussed the current political scenario of the state,’’ said a senior official in the CMO and one of the associates of CM Khattar. Birender as well as his son Hisar MP Brijendra Singh remained inaccessible. Birender, who is known for his plain speak, had been maintaining distance and Brijendera, who was elected as the Hisar MP in 2019, had been in active politics and had been dealing with CMO in the official capacity. Brijendra had defeated Dushyant from Hisar parliamentary constituency in a direct contest. Later, Dushyant defeated Birender Singh’s wife Prem Lata Singh from Uchana Kalan constituency in a direct fight in the 2019 assembly elections. The dinner is said to have been crucial as Birender Singh had been repeatedly pressing the case for the state as well as Central government in favour of agitating farmers. Besides asking Union government to consider demands of farmers, during initial days of protest, Singh even announced that he would stage a dharna in support of farmers in Rohtak. On Sunday, CM khattar had been visited by certain intellectuals as well dignitaries of other states at Haryana Bhawan in New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khattars-meeting-with-birender-sets-rumour-mills-rolling/articleshow/84126861.cms||Manvir Saini

This comes a day after AICC in-charge Vivek Bansal claimed that all was well in the party and MLAs who had called on him on Thursday were satisfied with the meeting. Congress MLAs from the former CM Bhupinder Hooda camp met Bansal seeking a change of guard in the state organisation. Besides, MLAs alleged that they were ignored by the organisation as well as by HPCC chief Selja in taking key decisions and that there was delay in expansion of the party in the state. While Bansal claimed that the issues had been resolved, a few MLAs confirmed the scheduled meeting with Venugopal. “We elected representatives are the backbone of the party. How can the state leadership ignore us? This is happening in Haryana. This is the time we need to strengthen the party, but the leadership has something else in mind,’’ a senior MLA from NCR said. In a related development, HPCC president Kumari Selja also reached New Delhi and called on senior Congress leaders to apprise them about the current political scenerio in the state. Former Congress minister and senior Congress leader Ajay Singh Yadav also called on the party high command and expressed solidarity with Selja. Ongoing issues in Haryana Congress have started at a time when the Congress high command is caught up with infighting in Punjab Congress involving the group led by Capt Amarinder Singh and their rivals, especially cricketer-turned politician Navjot Singh Sidhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-cong-mlas-to-meet-aicc-in-charge-venugopal/articleshow/84126967.cms||Manvir Saini

A video of the assault has gone viral, prompting police to take action. Dhar SP Aditya Pratap Singh told mediapersons that the incident took place in Peepalwa village in Tanda of Dhar district, about 130km from Indore. In the video that was shot by bystanders, the women, aged 19 and 20, are seen begging for mercy as a group of men and women drags them around by the hair, kicks them and beats them with sticks and stones. “Initially, the girls were reluctant to complain against their family members and we registered a case. They, however, gave their statements at the police station later, based on which further action was initiated. Seven persons have been booked in the case,” said Tanda police station in-charge Vijay Vaskale. One of the women told police that their paternal cousins and other family members stopped them near a school in the village and began assaulting them. Vaskale said that the family members were angry with the sisters for speaking with their maternal cousins over phone though they were engaged to two men in Jobat of Alirajpur. “The FIR was registered on June 26, and seven persons have been arrested,” Vaskale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/madhya-pradesh-horror-sisters-beaten-brutally-by-kin-for-talking-to-cousins/articleshow/84130552.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Will Congress lose its best chance in Punjab?||Jalandhar: Of the seven states going to polls in 2022, Congress is only in power in Punjab, where it perhaps also has the best chance of returning to power. After a drastic shrinking of its footprint across the country and having been reduced to power in just three states, the grand old party is looking to revive itself and Punjab provides that chance, even as once it was the most hated party in the state. Politics is about turning adversity into opportunity. But what is happening in Punjab Congress and its wrong handling by the central leadership, read the Gandhi family, can turn this opportunity into adversity. Its prospects appeared bright not because the state government has done very well and has delivered a lot in the last over four years but due to the reasons that opposition was fractured and also unpopular. Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) and BJP parted ways and AAP after missing the bus in 2017, mainly due to the follies of its central leadership, has shrunk in every election since then. Against this backdrop, many thought it would just be a cakewalk for the Congress in 2022. However, just eight months left for the elections, the brewing discontentment has spilled over. Now even that comfort of fractured opposition is also over with SAD and Bahujan Samaj Party stitching their alliance. Perception about Congress has been plummeting in the last few weeks. Amarinder, in 2015 with popular support from MLAs and party cadres made the high command to concede him state president’s post and also project him as the CM candidate in 2017, but now around half of the ministers and majority of the MLAs have not spoken up for him in public. Congress was almost untouchable for large parts of the Sikh electorate after Operation Bluestar and massacre of Sikhs in November 1984 but incidents of sacrilege and police firing during the Badal regime became a game-changer for Congress as SAD (Badal)’s popularity and perception touched a new low. These incidents helped Congress in a major way to ride to power in 2017. Out of 77 assembly constituencies Congress won in 2017, 40 were rural and had a predominantly Sikh population. The party had highest success rate in traditional “Panthic belt” in Majha region. However, this has now become a liability for Congress as delivery of justice has not yet reached even midway even as a new SIT in Kotkapura firing case is carrying out the probe at a fast pace. Meanwhile there are more questions than answers on state government’s performance on other issues like drugs, mining mafia, corruption, lopsided power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed during the SAD-BJP regime to extend the benefit to private players, unemployment. Questions on these issues are getting louder by the day. The Congess high command giving deadlines to the CM on different poll promises is an acknowledgment of these questions about the government’s performance. Amid questions about performance of the government on all these issues, solutions being talked about are changing Punjab Congress president or how to adjusting different leaders or to how to maintain caste and communal balance. Talk around these balancing acts started only after questions about the govsernment’s performance got very loud. In the given situation need for top party brass is not just to make decisions quickly but also to work out the right solution. It will be walking a tight rope. If Congress loses Punjab in 2022, this will not be a case of a defeat handed by another party but an act of suicide. Can the party high command stop or deviate its march straight towards the deep, dark well?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/will-congress-lose-its-best-chance-in-punjab/articleshow/84127010.cms||IP Singh
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration: Forget wires, power department not even buying screws||CHANDIGARH: Call it an effect of the delay in privatisation, or the tug of war going over it, the electricity department of the UT administration has refrained from purchasing items for regular maintenance to address complaints for almost one year. Wires, vehicles and other basic electrical equipment needed to carry out repairs are missing, the absence of which is hurting residents enduring long power cuts in the sweltering heat. Here is an example of the indecision. The department had planned to purchase 72 transformers. The number was reduced to 35 earlier this year. So far, not even a single transformer has been purchased. That is not all. “If we need to take a cable, a wire or even a small screw and other device for repair work, there nothing is available in the store. The financial process of procurement had remained slow earlier too, but the situation has turned from bad to worse now. Basic things required for maintenance are not available,” sources said. Another area of concern is manpower. Sources confirmed that main employees who work in the field like lineman are a few and people are not being hired against the vacant posts. “It is creating a major problem, mainly in redressing complaints of power cuts of people in this hot and humid weather,” sources said. Sources in the electricity department said financial estimates that divisional and sub-divisional level offices had prepared to purchase the necessary items were being ignored at the higher level. The senior officers have been either sent back all such financial estimates or kept them away in presumption that the department is going to be privatised soon. Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary, UT Powermen Union, said, “There are 1,780 sanctioned posts in the department, but only 900 employees are working. Besides, out of these, around 250 to 300 employees have been outsourced. Renewal if their contract is still a major issue. There is scarcity of vehicles and material in the department, but nobody is bothered.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-forget-wires-power-department-not-even-buying-screws/articleshow/84130537.cms||Deepak Yadav

The KRMB is taking up the visit in the wake of NGT directive. In a communication to the state government, KRMB member Hrishkesh Meena said that the team would take up field visit to inspect whether the project work was taken up in against the instructions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). He said that member-secretary of the KRMB, DM Raipure, member (legal) LM Muanthang, CWC member KM Ravindra Rao would be part of the inspection team. He requested the irrigation department to depute a delegation from the state government to assist the KRMB team in the field inspection. He had also asked the state government to submit the project maps, designs and detailed project report (DPR) to the team. He explained that the team would submit its inspection report to the NGT after inspection. The inspection of KRMB was earlier postponed following the state government’s objection citing that all the officials in the Srisailam zone were infected with Covid-19. The state government asked the KRMB to postpone the visit in May when it was first planned, keeping in view the high number of Covid-19 positive cases reported in the state. Subsequently, a resident of Telangana filed a contempt petition in NGT saying that AP is continuing the RLIP works without in violation of NGT directive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/krmb-officials-to-inspect-rlip-site-on-july-6-7/articleshow/84130558.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||Govt issues draft norms to regulate direct selling cos||NEW DELHI: Direct selling companies such as Amway, Oriflame, Tupperware and similar entities in India will now have to comply with regulatory norms. The consumer affairs ministry has issued draft rules for their mandatory registration and has also proposed mechanisms to protect the direct sellers or agents and make the companies accountable to their consumers. This is for the first time such draft rules have been framed, which specify that these entities will be barred from charging any entry or registration fee from agents. They can’t charge for the cost of equipment and materials for sales demonstrations from their agents as well. Earlier in 2016, the ministry had come out with a set of guidelines for the sector, which were advisory in nature. But now the proposed rules under the Consumer Protection Act will have legal backing and violation will attract penalties. According to the draft rules, every direct selling entity carrying out business in India will have to be registered with the industries department (DPIIT) and must have at least one office in India. The registration number has to be displayed prominently on its website and all invoices. They will need to have dedicated executives to address grievances and to comply with the government directives. Such entities will also need to have a 24x7 customer care number to resolve all issues. The proposed rules specify that no direct selling entity will be allowed to promote ‘Pyramid Scheme’ and participate in ‘Money Circulation Scheme’ in the garb of a direct selling business. Pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members via promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, instead of sale of products or services. The draft rules said all firms operating across the country will have to comply with the norms within 90 days. According to the proposed rules, a direct selling entity would have to take back spurious goods or deficient services and will have to refund the consideration paid for goods and services provided by it. It also proposes that the agent or seller will have a “cooling off period” during which he/she can change mind about an agreement made. This won’t result in a breach of contract and or levy of penalty. The draft rules also have a provision for a buyback or repurchase policy for “currently marketable” goods, which are not unpacked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-issues-draft-norms-to-regulate-direct-selling-cos/articleshow/84130653.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Waste burning resumes in open, residents protest||GURUGRAM: The instances of rampant dumping and burning of waste, including horticulture and mixed garbage, in various localities has been increasing in the city, raising a grave concern among the residents. One such incident was witnessed on Sunday in Sikhopur village near NH-8 where mixed hazardous waste was set on fire emanating black smoke. At another spot in Sector 66, horticulture waste along with garbage and animal carcass were burnt in a vacant plot which was later put off by fire brigade after the residents alerted the forest department. Rao Dharamveer Singh, RWA president of Mapsko Casa Bella who spotted the fire near Sikhopur village and highlighted the issue on social media said, “I noticed the waste being set on fire. Upon enquiring, I got to know that most of it was hazardous waste containing rubber, plastic, metal among others,” Singh said. Sonali Venkatesh, a resident of Emaar Palm Drive in Sector 66, said that the vacant plot adjacent to their society has become a prominent spot where such illegal acts are regularly observed. “In the last one month, over four times we have spotted burning of horticulture waste along with mixed waste. Every other week, a trolley of horticulture waste and mixed waste is being dumped openly,” she said. “Earlier, such practices were observed at night but now in broad daylight we have been witnessing incidents of open dumping and burning of waste. While MCG had issued a circular in 2015 on disposal of horticulture waste, it was never implemented,” said Ruchika Sethi, founder of Citizen for Clean Air. Meanwhile, Kuldeep Singh, regional officer of HSPCB said, “If we receive an official complaint, through any medium, it will be submitted to the authorities for further action. I will ask the concerned civic authorities to increase their vigilance where such illegal activities are noticed and strict action will be taken against the violators.” When contacted, an MCG official said, “We act promptly whenever we receive any complaint and try to educate people to not indulge in wrong practices but sometimes it is tough to catch the culprit. However, I will depute the official on the site to monitor the situation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/waste-burning-resumes-in-open-residents-protest/articleshow/84127005.cms||Akanksha Gupta

The killers had brazenly announced 10 days in advance that they would kill him but the cops did nothing. On July 1, the killers used a JCB to ram ex-sarpanch Manoharlal Gutti Sharma’s car off the road and then shot him dead. The murder sent shockwaves in the region. “We learnt about some irregularities in policing and the SHO was removed,” Damoh SP D R Teniwar told local media on Sunday. Hata SHO Manish Mishra and another officer, Pradeep Choudhary, have been attached to the police lines. Sources said that both of them did not take the threat by the accused to kill Sharma seriously. Also, police were not deployed in the village although trouble was on for a long time. A feud over property and an old election dispute was on for a long time between two influential families of the village, said the SP. On July 1, Sharma was going to attend a wedding, along with around half a dozen family members, when the assailants struck in a small village named Kumihar, around 40km from Damoh and 300km from Bhopal. Former sarpanch was killed in front of familyThey used a JCB to ram Sharma’s Bolero, which “rolled like a ball” from the impact, said an eyewitness. The assailants didn’t bother with the rest of Sharma’s family and went after him. “Uncle started running and they fired at him. Half a dozen people hit him with lathis till he fell down. With one foot on his chest, a man fired a bullet at his head. It all happened before our eyes even as we pleaded with them not to kill him,” said the victim’s nephew. A police team set up to investigate the murder has arrested three suspects -- Madhu Sharma, Dayaram Sharma and Saroj Sharma, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/sho-removed-for-taking-murder-threat-to-ex-sarpanch-lightly-in-madhya-pradeshs-damoh/articleshow/84130646.cms||---
---||Business||Khadi moves to protect brand in Mexico, globally||NEW DELHI: Soon after Khadi & Village Industries Commission (KVIC) filed an application to register its brand Khadi and logo in Mexico, it discovered that a local entity had also sought a registration. KVIC’s objections have meant that the Mexican entity has not been able to register so far. Faced with similar attempts, KVIC has decided to aggressively pursue registrations across the world with 41 applications already filed, and the UAE and Mexico being among the latest countries to recognise its logo and brand. From Japan and Nepal to Myanmar and Brazil, KVIC is seeking to protect its brand. “In view of Khadi’s evergrowing popularity in India and globally, it has become very important for KVIC to protect the brand. For the first time in the last five years, KVIC has made aggressive bids to safeguard Khadi from any misuse. These efforts have yielded significant results and helped Khadi’s sales grow by a big margin in last few years. Khadi’s trademark registrations are essentially to prevent khadi from duplication and safeguard the interest of our artisans,” KVIC chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena told TOI. A few years ago, KVIC found itself in a peculiar situation when it discovered that a German entity Natural Products (BNP) has got rights on Khadi and related marks in the European Union and other countries. A source said BNP has now expressed its willingness to settle the trademark disputes amicably.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/khadi-moves-to-protect-brand-in-mexico-globally/articleshow/84130682.cms||Sidhartha

This is because the tower in question is yet to get an occupation certificate. Launched in 2006, the project is spread on 10 acres along Golf Course road (extension) and has eight towers with 400 units. The developer had promised possession in 2010 but it was given in two phases between 2010 and 2018. As on date, the project is around 90% complete and only seven towers have the mandatory occupation certificate. “We were given possession of our flat in 2018 by Unitech. It’s been more than three years, but the builder has not yet provided us with the mandatory occupancy certificate,” said a resident of tower number 8. “The builder has been delaying the process despite our repeated reminders. We want the authorities to ensure that OC is given to the tower, which will secure our investment,” he added. Not just this, the condition of the towers is deteriorating due to poor construction quality and with no support from the developer, the residents have now pooled in money to repair the structures and internal roads of the housing society. RWA secretary Nidhi Chawla said all the 400 families were in for a rude shock when they got the possession of their homes. “The complex is still incomplete with extremely poor quality of workmanship. The façade is in a bad shape and the residents have been forced to pool in funds to carry out repairs. And this is despite the fact that a separate fund was given to the builder for the maintenance of the façade,” she said. “Our basic facilities do not work properly, for example the sewage treatment plant (STP) which works intermittently, poses a health hazard to the residents amid the pandemic while a compost plant was never set up,” Chawla said. RWA President Rear Admiral Kapil Gupta (retd) said, “With no support from the developers, neither in terms of making up for the lack of infrastructure nor for routine maintenance, the residents have authorised the RWA to take over the operational control of the society.” “We started our first project of relaying a badly potholed road with a tiled pathway. Poorly constructed expansion joints, leading to flooded basement during the monsoon, were taken up next. Another project undertaken by the RWA was to reconstruct the swimming pool, which was left incomplete by the builder,” he said. “The flagship project taken up by the RWA is the repair and painting of the dilapidated towers.” Despite repeated attempts, the developer could not be contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/flats-handed-but-escape-residents-say-no-sign-of-oc-even-after-3-years/articleshow/84126952.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

---||Noida||At 1.5 lakh each, Noida & Ghaziabad gave most number of jabs in June 3rd week||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Before the shortage of doses hit the state, Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad had inoculated the maximum number of people in the month of June. The week between June 19 and June 25 saw the peak as 1.5 lakh doses each were given to recipients in both districts. Over 70% of Noida’s entire vaccination had been carried out between the second week of May and June-end, though the drive has been going on since January. In June itself, about 40% of all doses were given. Throughout the month, the district has vaccinated over one lakh people every week. Noida is also leading among all districts of Uttar Pradesh, with 12.3 lakh doses administered till now. Similarly, of the 10.5 lakh doses administered in Ghaziabad so far, over 67% were administered in the May-June period. However, after that, the district could not sustain the surge in the vaccination drive due to shortage of vaccines as it dropped to around 68,000 doses. The pace of the vaccination drive was quite slow in the initial three months as only healthcare workers and frontline workers were eligible for inoculation. In Ghaziabad, about 12,000 doses were given in January, followed by around 30,000 in February. In Noida, about 10,000 shots were given in January and 28,000 in February. The figure saw a three-time jump in March after citizens above 60 years and over 45 years with comorbidities could take the jabs. About 96,000 people were vaccinated in March in Ghaziabad and over 1.1 lakh in Noida. In April and May, over 2.08 lakh and 2.39 lakh people were vaccinated, respectively, in Ghaziabad, and about 4.6 lakh in June. Noida, meanwhile, inoculated around 2 lakh in April and 2.5 lakh in May. This increased about three times in June when the district administered doses to 6.2 lakh people. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, GB Nagar immunisation officer, said, “We followed an incremental approach. If we were giving one vaccine in May, we gave two in June and had planned for three doses in July. Once we have adequate doses, we will resume that plan. As of now, we have enough Covaxin doses and all Covaxin centres in the district are operating.” The 12 lakh doses given in Noida include 10.7 lakh first doses and the rest are second doses. While the state is facing a shortage of Covishield, 90% of all doses given in Noida were Covishield. So far, 11.1 lakh Covishield and 1.1 lakh Covaxin doses have been given. About 89% of jabs given were Covishield, while the remaining 10% were Covaxin in Ghaziabad. In Ghaziabad, 50% of the recipients are between 18-44 years, while 3.19 lakh are aged between 45 and 60 years. The remaining 2 lakh people are senior citizen. Despite the 18+ category opening recently for vaccination, the percentage of this group is higher in Noida as well. Around 7.3 lakh recipients are in the 18-44 age group. The rest include 2.7 lakh aged between 45 and 60 years and two lakh seniors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/at-1-5l-each-noida-gzb-gave-most-no-of-jabs-in-june-3rd-wk/articleshow/84125886.cms||Snehil Sinha

---||Noida||Cases of mucormycosis in jaws on the rise in Ghaziabad||GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: While mucormycosis (black fungus) generally targets eyes and the brain, of late a large number of patients are coming to hospitals in Ghaziabad with their jaws affected. Senior ENT surgeon Dr BP Tyagi, who has treated about 60 black fungus patients at Harsh ENT Hospital in Raj Nagar, said that so far, 12 such patients have come to his hospital and in all the cases, their jaws had to be removed. Black fungus spreads rapidly in post-Covid patients with high blood sugar (more than 700) and affects the nose, eyes and brain. However, in patients who have a sugar level of around 300, the infection spreads slowly and engulfs the jaw bone and teeth. Dr Tyagi said, “One thing which has been common in all these patients is that they have high blood sugar (below 300), but not uncontrolled levels (700-800). Of the 12 patients, 10 are men and two are women. While one of these patients is still in hospital, the others are being treated through OPDs.” Contrary to the fast spread of the fungal disease in eyes and brain, it is a slow process when the jaw gets affected. “It generally affects the upper jaw, but I am treating a patient whose lower jaw is affected. The first indication of this infection is loosening of teeth. The incubation period of the fungal infection in the jaw is about two weeks. In most of the cases, a patient does not take it seriously and starts home remedies,” Dr Tyagi said, adding that the disease is detected through CT scan. Dr Tyagi said that black fungus not only rots teeth and affects the jaw bone but it makes it necessary to remove the jaw. If not removed, the disease will spread to all bones of the patient's face. “It is like cancer, even if a single particle remains, it will start spreading again. Therefore, the entire area infected with the black fungus has to be removed, he added. Other reasons are the use of unsterilised buds in the nose while conducting Covid tests and a high intake of zinc and iron tablets. If the bud is unsterilised and it peels off the lining of the nose, then black fungus infection can start there and subsequently spread to other parts. Apart from having high sugar, the ferritin level was also very high in the patients. A patient with black fungus of the jaw must be given 90 injections of amphotericin-B in 45 days. Whereas in the case of eyes and nose, injections have to be given for 20 to 22 days. After removal of the infected jaw, the chances of survival of the patient are 70%, whereas it is 50% in the case of the eye and only 5% in the case of the brain. Meanwhile, doctors in Noida said that several patients are coming with complaints related to eyes, cheeks and jaws after recovery, but dental extraction has not been done yet in the district. Dr Amitabh Malik, chief ENT specialist at Paras Hospitals in Gurgaon, said, “Of the 50 patients that I have seen in my OPD, jaws were found to be affected in about 10% to 15% cases. Patients did not have the jaw infection when they came to the hospital but developed it later. In most cases, doctors try to remove the affected area through surgeries to prevent any further spread. An obturator is fixed in the place of the jaw to fill the gap.” Corroborating this fact, GIMS director Brigadier (retired) Dr Rakesh Gupta said, “Eye infection, pain, ENT inflammation and problems related to pharynx are common problems that persist during recovery. These are also early symptoms for most patients.” Watch Ghaziabad: Cases of mucormycosis in jaws on the rise||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/cases-of-mucor-in-jaws-on-the-rise-in-gzb/articleshow/84135262.cms||Snehil Sinha

For this, the authority has tied up with National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), where training in IT and electronics, hospitality, textiles and gadgets will be given to over 1,100 youths in the first phase. “We are working on setting up a big regional level skill development sector, which was passed in our 122nd board meeting held last month. For this, we have a tripartite agreement with NSDC, National Industrial Development Corporation of India (NIDC) and Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor-Integrated Industrial Township Greater Noida Limited (DMIC-IITGNL) where Greater Noida is a 50% partner. GNIDA will be funding everything where the first agreement is of about Rs 1 crore with NSDC as our knowledge partner,” Narendra Bhooshan, CEO GNIDA, told TOI. Under this, NSDC will work on every aspect of setting up a regional level SDC. They will prepare the DPR after studying the viability, requirement, skill sets, including supply and demand situation and how much people can be absorbed in Greater Noida with a focus on rural areas. “It will be the first SDC in GB Nagar district where skills in the field of IT and electronics, consumer white goods, textiles, ready-made garments, mobile parts and manufacturing and automobiles will be developed. NSDC will initially operate from GNIDA authority building. However, later they will be given a plot in the IITGNL area,” Bhooshan added. “For the time being we have agreed to provide one floor in GNIDA office building to NSDC to start work within 100 days from the date of signing the contract. Their own plot and building will take about 1-3 years depending on the scale and manpower they may require,” Bhooshan said, adding that talks with NSDC were held earlier this year in April but could not be pursued due to the second wave of Covid pandemic. “We had talks with NSDC which has sanctioned a special project for Greater Noida. This process was started in April, but then a second wave of Covid came and the process got delayed. I have lined up the next review meeting with them on it this week to expedite the process,” said Bhooshan||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/greater-noida-to-set-up-its-first-skill-development-centre/articleshow/84126021.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

---||Gurgaon||In 3 months, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram collected less than 1% of trade licence fee||GURUGRAM: The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), which is already reeling from a lack of revenue in the pandemic, has managed to collect trade licence fee from less than 1% of commercial properties in the last three months. According to the property tax records of MCG, there are around 50,000 commercial establishments in four zones of the city that either need to renew their licences or get fresh ones issued. Since April this year, only 330 establishments have deposited their licence fee, which translated to less than 1%. In zone 1, there are 7,488 commercial establishments, but only 15 trade licences have been issued so far, which amounts to a collection of Rs 19.8 lakh. In zone 2, the civic body has collected Rs 47.7 lakh from 65 of 13,288 establishments. The highest collection was from zone 3, which has 17,298 commercial properties. Here, Rs 98 lakh was collected from renewal of 196 licences. In zone 4, 54 licences were issued and Rs 55 lakh was recovered. The total number of commercial properties here is 9,345. In total, the corporation has been able to recover Rs 2.2 crore from trade licences in the past three months. This is despite MCG’s drive to encourage property owners running different types of businesses to apply for trade licences. A senior official said trade licences were mandatory for all commercial properties within the jurisdiction of a particular civic body, such as small shops, malls, cinemas, jewellers and others. “The fee for application and renewal of trade licences varies from Rs 500 to Rs 1 lakh, depending on the scale and nature of business,” he added. The official further said that while some commercial establishments had never applied for a licence, other businesses haven’t renewed the documents in keeping with provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994. This, officials said, was one of the main reasons for MCG’s declining coffers. Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, the new MCG chief, has now issued directions to the zonal taxation officers to gear up collection from commercial properties and serve recovery notices to defaulters. A senior MCG official said 331 notices had been issued to defaulters so far but more letters would be served soon. Another problem that had hit trade licence revenue, officials pointed out, was that many of the commercial establishments operate out of residential areas, which is in violation of norms. In a recent meeting, Ahuja had asked officials to expedite the recovery of pending dues under various heads. He had asked taxation officers to conduct a survey in their zones and calculate the dues. He had also directed his team to prepare a report on illegal mobile phone towers in the city and those that are within MCG’s limits but with pending dues. TOI had recently reported that the corporation is struggling to recover property tax arrears worth Rs 932 crore, coupled with the current year’s demand of Rs 235 crore. MCG has been able to mop up only Rs 18 crore this year so far — which is less than 10% of the demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/in-3-months-mcg-collected-less-than-1-of-trade-licence-fee/articleshow/84126224.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

Doctors in several hospitals across Gurugram said they are witnessing a rise in the number of patients with complaints of symptoms similar to those of heatstroke. According to doctors, patients are suffering from high body temperature, higher than usual heart rate, cramps, headaches, loss of consciousness, diarrhoea, and dehydration. According to the health department, there is an upsurge of 40-50% of summer-related complications in the OPDs. The doctors have advised senior citizens and children to avoid going out in the heat. Because of humidity and hot climatic conditions in the past few days, they suggest precautions from bacterial infections as well. “In OPDs, cases of diarrhoea, heatstroke and dehydration because of extreme heat conditions are increasing every day. We are getting over 30 cases related to extreme heat waves daily. Exposure to heat conditions increases the vulnerability of persons with cardiovascular, respiratory and cerebrovascular diseases. People should hydrate themselves,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. Experts said heatstroke has become a regular phenomenon in this sultry summer. “Heat exhaustion starts instantaneously, followed by vomiting, feeling of thirst, rapid breathing, altered mental state/ behaviour, flushed skin, increased heart rate, high body temperature, muscle cramps and pounding headaches. It is suggested that people should be moved to a cool environment or shaded location and drink loads of fluids,” said Dr. Rajesh Kumar, internal medicine, Paras hospital. “People are advised to reduce clothing layers and a cool/ wet cloth or ice should be applied to the head, face, neck, armpits and groin area of the affected person. The person should also seek immediate medical attention. The delay can cause damage to the brain and other vital organs.” The doctors explained that heatstroke is closely associated with prolonged exposure to heat. Under normal conditions, the body loses water through sweat, tears, breathing, urine and stool. This water is replaced by external fluids and food that contain water. “The body may run out of water if an individual is overexposed to the sun and the water level is not restored. A dehydrated body can lose essential salts, such as sodium and potassium, further leading to a heat stroke,” said Dr Manjeeta Nath Das, internal medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/summer-takes-a-toll-heatstroke-cases-rise/articleshow/84126258.cms||Ipsita Pati

As of July 3, the number of active cases in Karnataka stood at 48,116. The last time the state reported less than 50,000 was on April 7 (49,254), after which a consistent increase in fresh cases had pushed the state to the top of the table as far as active cases go. From being the state with the most active cases for the most part of the second wave — Maharashtra was on top in the initial weeks — Karnataka has now slipped to third place. Maharashtra and Kerala, the only two states with more than one lakh active cases as on date, are on top. In Fact, Kerala has more total infections than Karnataka, which had jumped to second place in May. With 29.6 lakh cases, the southern neighbour has at least one lakh more total cases than Karnataka, while Maharashtra, with more than 60 lakh cases is well in front. Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh occupy the fourth and fifth position respectively. Just two days ago, India’s total active cases dipped below five lakh and stood at 4.7 lakh as on July 3. Active cases in the country are under five lakhs for the first time since March 27, when there were more than 4.8 lakh such cases. The top five states with the most active cases are also the ones with the most infections. However, while these states — Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh — account for 53% of the total cases in the country, they account for 71% of all active cases.

Just five districts — Bengaluru Urban, Mysuru, Dakshina Kannada, Hassan and Belagavi (1,765) — accounted for two-thirds of active cases in the state.

In a recently held meeting with auto dealers, the RTA decided to allow private dealers to issue fitness certificates to vehicle owners. “After the recent announcement of the transport policy by the government, we have begun the work on making paperwork less tedious for vehicle owners. At a time when physical distancing is the need of the hour, it is best to do away with daily long queues for fitness certificates. The private dealers can now start their own centres and issue fitness certificates that are approved by the department,” said RTA secretary Dharna Yadav. The department has asked the auto dealers to set up special centres to begin the process of issuing fitness certificates. Also, dealers can explore the possibilities of home delivery of fitness certificates. “Commercial vehicle owners will have to deposit the fixed fee with dealers for the fitness of the vehicle. From there, they will also be given a receipt. Apart from that, they do not have to make any kind of payment. All dealers have been instructed to prepare fitness points. Dealers will have to make preparations for all the facilities. This will save both time and money for the vehicle owner and the transporters. Soon, dealers will be allowed to fit the vehicles at the points,” Yadav added. Besides, the department has announced to make the vehicle registration process easier. It claims that the move is a step towards their aim to promote ‘ease of living'. The vehicle dealers will no longer be required to submit hard copies of the documents or visit the office for approvals and verification. The entire process will be online via a dedicated transport portal, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/now-you-can-get-vehicle-fitness-certificates-at-doorstep/articleshow/84126298.cms||---

After all, it was Rajkumar’s 16th birthday. As his family waited, Rajkumar and his neighbour Lalit Gupta (25) rushed towards home on a bike. They were just 40 minutes away when a truck hurtling down NH-9 hit their two-wheeler from behind in Dasna. Both fell off the bike and were crushed under its wheels. Police said Rajkumar and Lalit had gone to attend a wedding in Moradabad on Saturday morning. They had to return to their Bhangel home the next morning as Rajkumar’s parents had planned a party on his birthday. The accident took place when the two had reached Dasna. A truck believed to be speeding at 100kmph hit the tail end of the bike and the duo skidded on the road. As they fell, the truck mowed them down. Shailendra Singh, the SHO of Masuri police station, said it was around 12.30pm when some commuters informed them about the accident. A police team rushed to the accident spot and took a profusely bleeding Rajkumar and Lalit to a nearby private hospital. They were declared dead on arrival. Though both the riders were wearing helmets, they were broken like “pieces of glass”. Rajkumar’s face was completely crushed. “Rajkumar studied in Class 11 of a private school. Lalit worked at a private firm in Noida,” the officer said. Rajkumar’s family members said they had specifically asked him to return from the Moradabad wedding on Sunday morning. “We had ordered a 1 pound cake for his birthday. Rajkumar’s mother had prepared all his favourite dishes and invited his close friends in the evening,” said Sonu, a relative. “Rajkumar had wanted a bike as his birthday gift. His family had assured they would buy him one on Diwali. His mother had bought a new shirt and a pair of trousers,” he added. Lalit, who was the only earning member of the family, left behind a six-month pregnant wife. The SHO said since both families were busy with the last rites, the police were yet to receive a complaint from them. “The police have seized the truck but the driver is untraceable. We hope to get him soon,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/16-yr-old-on-way-home-for-his-bday-crushed-by-truck/articleshow/84126371.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
