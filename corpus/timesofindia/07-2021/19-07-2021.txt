One and a half years after the woman approached a consumer court with a negligence complaint against the manager, she’s won a compensation of Rs 7,000. Prathima Pingalay, 44, of Kempegowda Layout held a savings account at the bank’s Gandhi Bazaar branch in Basavanagudi. On June 29, 2016, she lost her purse containing various documents, including passbook and seven bank-signed blank cheque leaves. She immediately lodged a police complaint and approached the branch manager with a letter requesting the official not to clear the cheques in case a fraudster who may be possessing them approaches the bank. She further asked the bank to close her account, which the manager acknowledged. Over three years after the incident, Prathima received an SMS on her cellphone on September 17, 2019 from the bank, saying her cheque for Rs 5,31,800 had bounced due to insufficient funds in her account. The shocked Bengalurean rushed to the bank branch and questioned the authorities how they could attempt to clear a cheque which she had reported stolen three years ago.  Irked over her credit rating taking a beating due to the authorities’ negligence, Prathima approached Bangalore Rural and Urban 1st additional district consumer disputes redressal forum in Shantinagar on December 12, 2019. Prathima’s lawyer presented the case with supporting documents, while the bank’s attorney claimed the customer had only requested to close her account but failed to provide documentation and was using it till 2018. However, it was acknowledged that she had submitted a written request not to clear the cheques as they were stolen in 2016. Following court proceedings lasting over 18 months, the judges examined the evidence provided by Prathima — two letters written in June 2016 and October 2017 asking the bank to close her account — which had been stamped by officials. They noted that despite the requests, the bank staffers failed to close her account or record the cheque leaves as stolen. Instead, they tried to clear one of the cheques when a fraudster attempted to pass it off as genuine (with a sum of Rs 5,31,800) and labelled Prathima a defaulter due to insufficient funds. Failure to perform dutyThe judges observed the bank claimed the account was closed on September 21, 2019 as per the customer’s request, but the proof produced was a photocopy and the signature didn’t appear to be Prathima’s. This raises strong suspicion about actions of the bank authorities, who had clearly failed to do their duty and had caused trouble and mental agony to the woman, they added. In a verdict pronounced on June 30, 2021, the court ruled that the branch manager must pay a sum of Rs 5,000 towards damages and Rs 2,000 towards litigation expenses to the woman within 30 days of the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bank-tries-to-clear-cheque-reported-stolen-woman-wins-7000-relief/articleshow/84532938.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 2 hospitals went without phone link for 2 days disrupting patient care||BENGALURU: Nimhans and Sanjay Gandhi Institute Trauma & Orthopaedics (SGITO) were left without a telephone connection for two days from July 16, hindering patient care and routine communication. The connection was restored only around noon on Sunday, according to officials from both hospitals. The communication crash happened as Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology (KMIO), where the BSNL telephone exchange that caters to the two hospitals is located, on Friday cut power supply to the utility for allegedly failing to pay power bills running up to Rs 6 lakh. However, BSNL blamed the power outage on a lizard. “The existing situation is due to a short circuit occurring at the power plant system as a lizard fell on power busbars. The power failure/ tripping occurred at Kidwai hospital and the Kidwai engineer concerned segregated the point and switched off power connection to the BSNL exchange,” said Pardhasaradhi Kathi Reddy, general manager, east, Bengaluru, BSNL. “For three months — November 2020 to January 2021 — we faced network issues with the connection and kept calling BSNL to look into the problem. Nobody bothered. This despite having the junction body of BSNL at our hospital. We have moved from BSNL to a private network connection. Only four of our numbers are with BSNL now,” KMIO director Dr C Ramachandra told TOI. He said the telephone exchange, located next to the microbiology lab on the campus, had zero maintenance and that BSNL had not been paying the electricity bill to the hospital despite repeated reminders. “Our engineers switched off power supply to the BSNL exchange,” Dr Ramachandra said, adding that they will restore it. Directors of Nimhans and SGITO spoke to both BSNL and Kidwai authorities, seeking early resolution of the problem as their work had been hindered due to lack of landline phone network. Dr HS Chandrashekar, director, SGITO said it is a major problem that needs to be addressed immediately by BSNL. “We have 100 lines and pay Rs 18,000 per month to the network provider. We survived as the staffers used their own mobile phones and managed,” he said. Late Saturday evening, Dr Pratima Murthy, director, Nimhans confirmed that the hospital had no BSNL connection functioning. Officials at Nimhans though said the Covid-19 helpline number was unaffected as it was a private telecom connection. However, staffers from both hospitals told TOI that mobile connectivity is pathetic inside OTs, ICU and wards, especially on Nimhans campus. According to Reddy, around 10.30am on Sunday, the power supply to the exchange was restored and all telecom services were restored except fibre-to-the-home (FTTH). “It was found that a control card in Kidwai OLT (optical line terminal) is faulty and needs replacement. The same will be restored on Monday before 11.30am. The inconvenience caused to BSNL customers is deeply regretted,” said Reddy. Asked about the alleged non-payment of electricity bills, Reddy said the matter will be looked into. According to BSNL, the exchange caters to nearly 300 numbers. BSNL authorities said KMIO’s claim of uncleared electricity bills totalling up to Rs 6 lakh from 2017 to 2021 will be checked and action initiated to pay the dues in stipulated time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2-hosps-went-without-phone-link-for-2-days-disrupting-patient-care/articleshow/84532954.cms||Sunitha Rao R

They are scheduled to meet AICC president Sonia Gandhi and former president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday. Congress sources said party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra may also be present. Having won seven of ten urban local bodies in the recent polls, the party hopes to carry the momentum into local bodies and MLC (25 seats from panchayats) elections over the next 18 months before the 2023 assembly elections. The one-upmanship between Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah with camp followers projecting them as the next chief minister is a problem. A third group is pitching for a Dalit chief minister with Mallikarjun Kharge and G Parameswara as leading contenders. “The fight to be projected as chief ministerial candidate when elections are two years away is not just ridiculous but also hurts the party’s image. Some of us sought the high command’s intervention,” said senior Congress functionary and MLC BK Hariprasad. The leadership may direct the two leaders to fight elections under one leader and restrain their supporters from making public statements. However, both downplayed the issue, stating that the meeting is about organisational restructuring and appointment of office-bearers. “There’s no question of fighting for the chief minister’s post when we’re yet to get it. The meeting will discuss organisational issues,” said Shivakumar. Siddaramaiah said: “Don’t read much into this. It’s a routine meeting where party affairs and political issues will be discussed.” Shivakumar said AICC general Randeep Surjewala will visit Karnataka next week to hold meetings in Mysuru, Tumakuru, Mangaluru and Hubballi-Dharwad divisions. Surjewala is reportedly seeking a change from being Karnataka in-charge due to hectic travel and other party responsibilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/siddaramaiah-dks-to-meet-sonia-over-leadership-row/articleshow/84532956.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

The clip is purportedly of a phone conversation between BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel and a confidant. This leaked clip comes a day after Yediyurappa returned to Bengaluru following a visit to Delhi meeting party brass and said CM change didn’t figure in their talks. Though the clip doesn’t mention Yediyurappa directly, the reference to “removal of the entire team” hints at leadership change.  Kateel, whose voice could not be authenticated by TOI, says: “Don’t tell anybody. The entire team of (Jagadish) Shettar and Eshwarappa will be removed. We are making a new team. For the time being, I will tell not to give (it to) anybody right now (probably responding to the other person’s question about change of leadership). Don’t be afraid, now it’s our time. Three names are there, but they won’t be considered. They’ll put (appoint) from Delhi itself.”  Kateel in Delhi said he had no connection with the clip. He said he would come to Bengaluru on Monday, meet the chief minister and seek a probe into the clip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/audio-clip-hints-at-bsyexit-kateel-denies-link/articleshow/84532971.cms||---

Mohammed Basheer, Anas Attimannil, both from Malappuram in Kerala, and Jaiganesh Tanaraj and his elder brother Suresh Thangavel Thanaraj from Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu were granted bail on July 13. Jaiganesh and Suresh were charged with supplying thousands of sims illegally to main accused Ibrahim M Pullatti from Malappuram. BG Pramoda, judge of 52nd Additional City Civil and Session Court, however, pointed out that the brothers’ act of selling sims to Pullatti which could have affected national security and amounted to obtaining confidential military information, has to be proved after a trial. In the case of Basheer and Attimannil, the judge said the two have been accused of cheating but the remand application and FIR does not explain who and how they had cheated. They were among nine persons arrested in a joint operation by the military intelligence and Bengaluru police in June. The main accused are Pullatti and his associate V Gautam from Tirupur, Tamil Nadu. Police recovered over 3,000 sim cards, 109 sim box devices, 23 laptops, 17 routers and other valuables from the gang. According to police, Pullatti and Gautam ran the illegal telephone exchange with the help of other accused in Bengaluru. The gang allegedly tried to collect confidential defence information by making calls to official helplines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/4-get-bail-in-telephone-exchange-case/articleshow/84533029.cms||Santosh kumar.B
---||India||Over 67k projects registered under RERA, homebuyers say just tracking registration not enough||NEW DELHI: Since the enactment of real estate regulation law, RERA, and establishment of regulatory authorities across states, a total of 67,313 projects have been registered in the country, 46% of them in Maharashtra alone. The western state also leads the list so far as registration of property agents is concerned while Uttar Pradesh tops among states in several complaints disposed of by regulators. Official data till July 10 show that 31,221 projects have been registered with the RERA in Maharashtra, followed by 8,685 in Gujarat. Karnataka has the third maximum number of projects registered with RERA at 4,151. The UP RERA has registered 3,033 projects and the tally in Madhya Pradesh is 3,659. So far as the registration of real estate agents or property dealers is concerned, out of the total 51,895 registrations across states, Maharashtra alone has registered 29,995 of them. In UP, 4,579 such agents have been registered while Delhi has registered barely 389 agents. The data also shows that so far 70,001 complaints have been resolved by the regulators with two benches of UP RERA leading the list having disposed of 27,825 complaints. Haryana, which has also set up two benches, has reported disposal of 14,591 complaints, followed by Maharashtra where 10,043 complaints have been resolved. Abhay Upadhyay, who heads the Forum for People’s Collective Efforts (FPCE), a group that campaigned for the enactment of the RERA, said, “Merely tracking the number of projects registered under RERA is not of much significance especially after five years. We need to seek data like the number of projects completed within the scheduled date as per registration, number of projects granted an extension and completed within an extended period, number of projects delayed beyond one year from original scheduled completion and number of projects for which registration expired and extension also not sought by the promoter to assess the real success and effectiveness of RERA.” He added similarly, the number of complaints disposed of by RERA authorities is of not much importance. To gauge the effectiveness of RERA, there is a need to know how many promoters have obeyed the orders of RERA, Upadhyay said. “The RERA Authorities must disclose the number of refund orders passed by them and an actual number of refunds received by the complainants. On the same lines, they also must disclose how many promoters have obeyed their orders about handover, completion of facilities and amenities and lastly how many have paid penalty if any levied. Till such details are made available by the authorities, the actual impact of RERA cannot be gauged,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-67k-projects-registered-under-rera-homebuyers-say-just-tracking-registration-not-enough/articleshow/84532767.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Goa||Odisha’s new project convinces Angulo, likely to join this week||Panaji: Odisha FC are close to securing the prized signature of Igor Angulo, Golden Boot winner from last season’s Indian Super League (ISL). Odisha finished at the bottom last-season, winning just two of their 20 league matches. But this season, their approach has been different, particularly with Spanish World Cup winner David Villa being appointed as head of global football operations. Angulo, who helped FC Goa qualify for the playoffs with 14 goals, was contacted last month by the club and they now appear to have convinced the Spanish sharpshooter. “Angulo likes the Odisha FC project and is keen to join,” a source who has tracked the transfer told TOI on Sunday. “The deal is expected to be completed this week. Terms have been agreed in principle, it’s just a matter of ironing out a few details.” According to sources, the striker will sign once the club provides clarity on a few tax issues. He will be the club’s best-paid player this season. The capture of Angulo will be a statement signing for Odisha, who have struggled to break into the top four. Last season, the team was found wanting as they lost 12 of their 20 games, the most by any team. Brazilian striker Diego Mauricio was their top scorer with 12 goals in 20 matches. He has since opted to ply his trade in Qatar. Angulo, 37, arrived in India last season after being included in the Best XI of Ekstraklasa, the premier league in Poland, for three successive seasons. He began his career with Athletic Bilbao in 2003 and has since then had stints in France (AS Cannes), Cyprus (Enossis Neon Paralimniou), Greece (Apollon Smirnys and FC Platanias) and Poland (Gornik Zabrze). In Poland, Angulo made a big name for himself, winning the best player and Golden Boot awards with 24 goals, one more than the previous season, in 2018-19. He was a major draw for Goa, who were rebuilding after the departure of several foreign names, including star striker Ferran Corominas. Angulo impressed in his first season but was upset when he was not included in the squad for the AFC Champions League.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/odishas-new-project-convinces-angulo-likely-to-join-this-week/articleshow/84533533.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||Pakistan vows to quickly find abductors of Afghan envoy's daughter||ISLAMABAD: Vowing to solve the conspiracy behind the abduction and torture of Afghan ambassador Najibullah Alikhil's daughter "maybe tomorrow or the day after", Pakistan's interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed said on Sunday that investigators were on the trail of the culprits after interrogating three taxi drivers who drove the victim to different places on Friday before she was briefly taken captive and assaulted. "I want to inform the international media that the police are investigating the case pertaining to the Afghan ambassador's daughter. The government registered an FIR on the kidnapping at 2am, as per PM Imran Khan’s directives," Ahmed said at a presser in Islamabad. He said the Afghan envoy's daughter Selsela Alikhil had left home on foot and arrived at a market, from where she hailed a taxi to another destination. "From the market, she took a taxi to Khadda Market (G-7 Markaz, Islamabad) for shopping." According to the minister, security officials confirmed the route by examining footage from "safe-city cameras" installed in Islamabad. From Khadda Market, the minister said, the ambassador’s daughter took another taxi to Rawalpindi, a garrison city next to Islamabad. "We also have footage of her getting out of a taxi at a Rawalpindi shopping mall," he said, adding that a third driver drove her from Daman-e-Koh (a hilltop garden in Islamabad) to a park in Islamabad’s sector F-9 (Fatima Jinnah Park). Ahmed said CCTV footage of her trip from Rawalpindi to Daman-e-Koh was missing and the matter was under investigation. He assured the media that the "puzzle" would soon be solved and all aspects of the case would be unearthed. "Statements of the three taxi drivers whose cars the ambassador’s daughter had used have been recorded," the minister said. He said the Afghan embassy was in touch with the government and cooperating in the investigation. In a written statement submitted to the Pakistani authorities, Selsela said she was returning home in the afternoon by taxi after visiting Islamabad’s Blue Area when the driver picked up another man. The latter allegedly hurled abuses and then assaulted her. She was dumped unconscious by the roadside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-vows-to-quickly-find-abductors-of-afghan-envoys-daughter/articleshow/84533580.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

What has shocked the local residents the most is the incident took place in broad day light right in front of the couple’s house near New Town School in an upscale neighbourhood with multiple surveillance cameras. The couple, residents of DC block in New Town, had resumed their morning walk on Saturday after a gap of over three months as a precautionary measure for Covid. At least one neighbour of the couple had spotted the bikers lurking around in the neighbourhood minutes before the incident took place as “if they were waiting for somebody”. “My parents are traumatised after the morning’s incident. They resumed their morning walk only on Saturday due to the pandemic and on Sunday they were a victim of such a horrific snatching,” said their daughter. “They were returning home after finishing their walk and were almost home when the incident happened. Though my mother has not received any serious injury this could have turned bad as she had a major surgery in her spine six months ago,” said the daughter. Local residents said there has been a rise in the number of such incidents in the area. “Few days ago, a girl’s mobile phone was snatched this way. Few weeks ago, a woman was injured when she tried to resist an attempt of snatching. Such incidents have been on the rise in the last couple of years,” said a resident of new Town. Officers of Techno City police station visited the spot after the incident. “We went to the spot after being alerted about the incident by local sources. However, we are yet to receive an official complaint about the incident. We are also checking the CCTV footage and speaking to the residents to locate the criminals and their possible entry and exit points from the area,” said a senior officer of the Techno City police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-on-bike-snatch-chain-from-new-town-couple/articleshow/84532709.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||India||Congress snubs objections by Captain Amarinder Singh & netas, appoints Navjot Singh Sidhu Punjab Congress chief||NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday evening appointed Navjot Sidhu as the head of Punjab Congress, ignoring the strenuous objections raised by party leaders, led by chief minister Amarinder Singh, and settling the issue that has been the source of much squabbling and instability over the last two months. Sidhu’s appointment attests to the niche that the cricketer-turned-politician has carved for himself since he left BJP and joined Congress in 2017 assembly elections and the way he positioned himself as the anti-Amarinder Singh voice in the Punjab Congress apparatus as well as an anti-Badal campaigner. It also indicated a decisive say of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in party affairs. Many believe that the way he held the AAP threat over the party, with speculation that he could defect if he was ignored, also played a role in his elevation. Election strategist Prashant Kishor’s input to the Gandhis during their recent meeting is also being speculated about. Incidentally, Kishor is an advisor to CM Singh. The announcement came on the day the entire Punjab Congress representation in Parliament in terms of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs held a meeting and conveyed to the party brass that Sidhu was not acceptable to them. The decision to go for a late evening announcement instead of Monday as planned is being seen as a reaction to the flurry of meetings, and a deliberate snub by the Gandhi siblings to the CM and the party MPs for raising the red flag to their plans. All eyes are now on if, and how, the party manages a convincing show of unity between CM Singh and Sidhu who has virtually emptied his Twitter and TV guns on the satrap over last two months. Some believe it could trigger a further phase of instability and possibly more dissension. For Congress which has been a dominant force in Punjab, overruling Amarinder Singh‘s choice in state politics suggests that the party under the Gandhi siblings is eager to consider new options. Earlier attempts by the party to create an alternative state leadership were quashed by the dominant leader “captain” who has a special constituency in both the party and the state. Now, questions are bound to arise if CM Singh would be the automatic choice if Congress returns to power in March 2022 or if Sidhu could be the favoured one with the Gandhis. Besides putting Sidhu at the PCC helm, Congress also appointed four “working presidents” - a Sikh OBC, a Dalit Sikh and a Hindu besides a Jat, all Rahul loyalists - for social balancing which has been dubbed as indispensable in a state with diversity. With Sidhu as Congress chief, the ruling party now has two Jat Sikhs at the top, in contrast to how Congress has shared posts of CM and PCC chief between the dominant Sikh caste and the Hindu community as also Dalits. CM Amarinder Singh made this argument while demanding that a Hindu leader be appointed as the party president in Punjab, his choice being Manish Tewari. Sidhu’s appointment sets to rest the speculations that have roiled the Punjab Congress for over two months, resulting in the AICC constituting a three-member panel headed by Mallikarjun Kharge to end the dissidence. CM Amarinder Singh made a last-ditch effort against Sidhu by writing a letter two days ago to the Congress chief against the move. However, a visit by AICC general secretary Harish Rawat to Chandigarh and discussions with Singh ended with the latter declaring that he would accept the decision of the leadership. While Sidhu is seen as a new face and often portrayed as erratic and a solo player, the leadership believes he has the public sentiment behind him given the way he has positioned himself as focused on issues and against the Akali Dal led by the Badal family. Training his guns at the CM, Sidhu has in recent weeks repeatedly alleged that Amarinder was soft on the Badals for political convenience, citing alleged soft peddling of the sacrilege case and drugs trade prosecutions. The challenge for Congress will be if there is a negative reaction among the Hindu community given that the party itself has made it an issue. Besides, Sidhu’s detractors have repeatedly underlined that his meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his controversial hug to the Pakistan Army chief remain a red rag with many people in the state, specially Hindus. Watch Sidhu beats back Captain's ploy, can he now unite Punjab Congress?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-snubs-objections-by-captain-amarinder-singh-netas-appoints-navjot-singh-sidhu-punjab-congress-chief/articleshow/84536750.cms||---

---||India||Government ready for a ‘constructive’ debate in Parliament on all issues: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Sunday assured political parties ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament that the government is ready to discuss all issues even as the opposition objected to a proposal that the PM would address all MPs on the Covid pandemic at the Parliament Annexe on Tuesday, insisting that he should speak in the two Houses or the Central Hall. Opposition parties said it will be “highly irregular” for the PM to speak to MPs at the Annexe at a time when Parliament is in session. At the all-party meeting on Sunday, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said Modi will address MPs of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha on July 20 on the pandemic. “What is the need to go outside Parliament? Any address should be on the floor of the House. This is another idea to bypass Parliament. Stop making a mockery of Parliament,” Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien said. After the meeting of parties, the PM tweeted, “Took part in the all-party meeting before the start of Parliament’s monsoon session. We look forward to a productive session where all issues can be debated as well as discussed in a constructive manner.” Joshi said that at the meeting, attended by 40 representatives from 33 political parties, Modi said suggestions made by the MPs are invaluable as they are directly linked to the people. At a separate meeting, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla assured that parties will be given adequate opportunities for discussion on issues of public interest and appealed to leaders to cooperate with smooth conduct of the House. He said he had requested leaders of parties in Lok Sabha to respect the sanctity and dignity of the House. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the party's position has always been that when Parliament is in session, whatever the government has to say, it can do so on the floor of the House. “It is highly irregular for the government to do this (PM’s proposed address to MPs). When the Parliament is in session, any address or presentation the government wants to make, it has to be done from inside Parliament,” he said. Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also attended the meeting. Floor leaders like O’' Brien from TMC, Tiruchi Siva from DMK, SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav and BSP’s Satish Mishra were also present. The Speaker informed the leaders that extensive arrangements have been made for safety of MPs, officials and the media, as per the Covid protocol. “The House represents the collective will and aspirations of the country and it is the responsibility of the members to voice the concerns of the people they represent amid the decorum and rules of the House,” Om Birla said. Opposition parties supported the demand of Congress and TMC for restoration of MPLAD funds, suspended in view of the pandemic. TMC, TRS, YSRCP and BSP sought discussions on Schedule 10 of the Constitution which deals with disqualification of lawmakers. On day one of the session, the PM will introduce the newly inducted ministers to both Houses. Two bills will be presented, including one by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to amend the Factoring Regulations (amendment) Bill 2020. LJP leader Pashupati Kumar Paras, who was inducted into the Cabinet recently, will present the first bill of his tenure — The National Institutes of Food Technology, Entrepreneur and Management Bill 2021. When the monsoon session commences on Monday, there will be a record number of 40 obituary references in Lok Sabha on the first day to pay homage to MPs who passed away in the intervening period since the Budget session, which concluded on April 8. The last reference will be of Sharad Tripathi, who was an MP from Sant Kabir Nagar in 16th Lok Sabha. Tripathi’s father Ramapati Tripathi, is the current Lok Sabha MP from Deoria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-ready-for-a-constructive-debate-in-parliament-on-all-issues-pm-modi/articleshow/84537674.cms||---

Speaking to Congress MPs in Lok Sabha, Sonia said floor coordination with like-minded parties was a priority inside the House and in Parliament complex where protests are held to highlight matters in focus. The party decided to raise fuel hike and farmers agitation in the initial days. As the controversial disclosure of the alleged phone-tapping by the central government of activists, journalists, politicians and judges is being reported in media, party members felt it should be brought up with gusto. However, it was felt that the issue was still unfolding and the party would decide on the future course of action once a full picture was available. Meanwhile, Sonia reconstituted the subgroups to fine-tune the floor strategy in the two Houses of Parliament, bringing in two G23 letter-writers in the Lok Sabha panel and three veterans in Rajya Sabha grouping. Reconstituting the LS subgroup, she included Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor to the existing members that are led by party leader in the House, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. Both are members of G23 and were also seen as contenders to replace Chowdhury in case of a change in the leadership in LS. In Rajya Sabha, Congress has included Digvijaya Singh, P Chidambaram and Ambika Soni to the group headed by leader of opposition, Mallukarjun Kharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonia-gandhi-rejigs-house-panels-brings-in-g23-members/articleshow/84537859.cms||---
---||India||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh underground, ED searches his ‘hideouts’||NEW DELHI: Hours after attachment of assets worth over Rs 4 crore, the Enforcement Directorate set out its teams in search of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukhwho had been evading questioning in a money laundering case against him and has not been contactable on his phones. ED officials on Sunday searched multiple locations in and around Nagpur, believed to be likely hideouts of the senior NCP leader. Deshmukh is accused by ED of influencing an extortion racket involving senior police officers of the Mumbai crime branch while he was holding the office of the state home minister. In April, Deshmukh was forced to resign after the Bombay High Court ordered a CBI inquiry against him on a petition of former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh alleging he had given targets to senior cops to extort Rs 100 crore from dance bars in Mumbai. Sunday’s searches included Deshmukh’s ancestral village near Katol and some other suspected places he was believed to be at in a bid to avert likely arrest by ED. The senior NCP leader has skipped three summonses issued by the agency in the last couple of weeks and has been untraceable since then. His son and wife have also been summoned in the same case. The agency has recorded confessions of his personal secretary and assistant Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde respectively, corroborating statements made by arrested police sub inspector Sachin Waze. The ED initiated an investigation against Deshmukh and other senior officials of the Mumbai police based on the CBI FIR that had alleged the existence of a serious extortion racket in Mumbai involving the former Maharashtra home minister. The agency is also likely to question former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/former-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-underground-ed-searches-his-hideouts/articleshow/84537888.cms||---

The conclaves would kick off from Ayodhya under the supervision of Mayawati’s trusted aide and party’s Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra. The BSP chief said that the decision to organise Brahmin conventions followed atrocities inflicted on the community by the BJP dispensation in UP. “The community got swayed by tall promises and voted for BJP in 2017 assembly elections. Now, Brahmins are worried and looking for an alternative,” Mayawati said, citing the 2007 assembly polls, which witnessed a successful amalgamation of Brahmins with Dalits to put Mayawati in power. The BSP supremo also made a strong bid to consolidate her core Dalit vote-bank, saying she was “proud” of the SC community which voted en bloc for her party in the 2017 polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mayawati-shuffles-caste-cards-plans-mega-brahmin-outreach/articleshow/84537930.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Patna||Bihar: Probe into disproportionate assets of 42 officers begins||PATNA: The Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police has started preliminary inquiry to gather details of disproportionate assets allegedly amassed by the 42 officers, including the two IPS officers, with the connivance of illegal sand mining mafias in six districts of the state. The government recently removed IPS officers Sudheer Kumar Porika and Rakesh Kumar Dubey as SPs of Aurangabad and Bhojpur respectively and several SHOs, SDPs and circle officers among the 42 officers following a detailed administrative inquiry into their alleged nexus with the sand mining mafias. “It’s only after this inquiry that an investigating agency arrives at a conclusion if the employee is possessing any disproportionate assets or not. Once they have strong evidence against an employee, an FIR will be lodged against the officer,” a senior IPS officer privy to the investigation of such cases said. He, however, apprehended that some of of them may dispose of such properties as the officers know about the preliminary inquiry against them. “Had it been ordered quietly, the outcome might have been quite different. Now all the 42 officers know that an inquiry has been initiated against them for amassing disproportionate assets. If anyone of them is even possesses such property, he will dispose it of,” he said. Meanwhile, DGP SK Singhal on Sunday posted Faiz Ahmed Khan as DSP (law and order), Santosh Kumar as Danapur SDPO, Manoj Kumar as Barh SDPO, Ajay Kumar as Paliganj SDPO, Vinod Kumar Raut as Dehri-on-Sone SDPO, Vinod Kumar as Bhojpur Sadar SDPO, Manish Kumar as Aurangabad Sadar SDPO and Santosh Kumar as Areraj SDPO. The positions at Paliganj, Dehri, Bhojpur and Aurangabad had fallen vacant after the officers posted there were removed with immediate effect on July 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/probe-into-disproportionate-assets-of-42-officers-begins/articleshow/84531726.cms||Debashish Karmakar

A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the PU education faculty held here on Sunday under the presidentship of faculty dean Lalit Kumar. Addressing the meeting, Patna Training College principal Ashutosh Kumar said that all the schools of the state are closed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and under the existing circumstances, it is not possible for BEd students to do their school internship of four months’ duration in face-to-face mode. But, as per the provisions of the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), no student can take the BEd examination without completing the mandatory school internship. He further pointed out that BEd students of PU have already done internships in face-to-face mode for one month just before the closure of colleges following the imposition of statewide lockdown. It was unanimously decided in the meeting that the internship for the remaining period of three months should be done through a simulated teaching medium from their own institutions so that they may be able to appear at the university examination. The meeting expressed its concern over the recent action of BRA Bihar University (BRABU) in allowing its 12,000 students to fill up their BEd examination forms without completing their mandatory school internship. The fate of all these students hangs in a balance, the faculty observed. Prominent among those who attended the meeting included BRABU’s education department head A R Khan, Darbhanga-based GB Teachers’ Training College principal Sanjeev Kumar, Biharsharif-based Nalanda College education department head Dhruv Kumar and Ranchi Women’s College teacher Sachin Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bed-students-to-do-school-internship-in-virtual-mode/articleshow/84530493.cms||B K Mishra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata records a single Covid death; active cases dip to 923 but new cases climb to 92||Kolkata: The city recorded a single Covid death on Sunday, a day after Kolkata had recorded zero death after a gap of 112 days. The number of fresh cases, though, spiralled to 92 on Sunday from 62 a day ago. There has been a sharp drop in active cases in the city as well, from 1,612 on July 1 to 923 on Sunday. Fresh cases had slid below the 1,000-mark on July 4, after 53 days, and have since remained in the three digits. Experts believe it is the drop in the number of deaths, more than the slide in fresh cases, that indicates an improving scenario. They pointed out that this showed that vaccines have started having an impact. While just over a month ago, on June 15, Kolkata had recorded 21 deaths, it was just two on July 16 before finally sliding to zero on Saturday. “We have seen a steady decline in the number of deaths and cases. The death figure had dropped to single-digit figures more than two weeks ago, which was the first good sign. Vaccines are responsible for this, apart from the Covid restrictions,” said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research professor Diptendra Sarkar. But experts said a slowdown in vaccination — like the one that hit Kolkata last month and again last week with several hospitals and KMC centres yet to receive their supplies — could be dangerous with a third wave looming large. “It has to be hastened and a steady supply of vaccines ensured so we can inoculate the maximum possible number of people before the next wave,” said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. This month started with just four deaths recorded on July 1. Active cases recorded in Kolkata on that day was 1,612. While both active cases and deaths went up marginally on July 10, touching 1,118 and three respectively, they dropped significantly six days later on July 16, when Kolkata had 953 active cases and two deaths. “The trend is encouraging and indicates that the second wave is coming to an end. But that also means we could be approaching a third wave. We need to step up vaccination and get as many inoculated as possible over the next one-and-a-half months so that by the time it strikes, many more would have immunity against the virus,” said internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas. Fresh cases have dropped appreciably in Bengal. While the state had recorded the highest single-day spike in fresh cases on April 27 — 16,403 — it slid to 1,501 on July 1, to 997 on July 10 and to 899 on July 17. “These are good times and the numbers are assuring. But some states still have a substantial number of cases and deaths are happening there. It can spread to our state in a month or two, igniting a third wave. Caution is the need of the hour,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-records-a-single-covid-death-active-cases-dip-to-923-but-new-cases-climb-to-92/articleshow/84532892.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Varanasi||'Rudraksh' bone of contention between corporators and Smart City Varanasi Limited||VARANASI: Just a few days after its formal inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Rudraksh - International Convention Centre has become a bone of contention between corporators of the Varanasi Municipal Corporation (VMC) and officials of the Smart City Varanasi Limited (SCVL) as the former want to use it for holding House sessions, while the latter are awaiting government guidelines. The VMC house along with Tilak auditorium was demolished for the construction of the Rudraksh - International Convention Centre after which its foundation stone was laid by the PM on July 14, 2018. Since then the VMC house sessions are being conducted at Gandhi Bhawan of Town Hall or Girija Devi cultural complex with temporary arrangements. The ICC has been handed over to the SCVL. After the Rs 186 crore Rudraksh ICC was inaugurated by the PM on July 15, the corporators want it to be allotted for conducting house sessions. The issue was discussed by the VMC corporators, led by the deputy speaker Narsingh Das of Bhartiya Janata Party with the municipal commissioner and chief executive officer of SCVL Gaurang Rathi and other officials in a meeting held on Saturday evening.. Interestingly, the BJP corporators and corporators of opposition parties, including the Samajwadi Party and the Congress, have similar views on the issue. The SP tried to politicise the issue by staging a sit-in in front of the ICC on Sunday. Talking to TOI, Das said, “It’s an emotional demand of the elected public representatives. The VMC had a proper setup before it was demolished along with Tilak auditorium for Rudraksh ICC. We had been assured for a permanent set-up. However, no work has been initiated in this direction so far. The corporators want that the meeting hall with 150-seats in Rudraksh ICC should be allotted for holding VMC sessions till a permanent arrangement is made.” On this demand, Rathi said, “As a permanent arrangement a house has been proposed on a vacant land of the VMC premises and bidding process for its construction is in the pipeline. Till this house is constructed Town Hall’s Gandhi Bhawan is available for holding the House sessions. Once the government guidelines on Rudraksh come, the SCVL will find out ways for allotment of ICC facilities on concessional rates to VMC for holding any special event.” For construction of Rudraksh the VMC had demolished its Tilak Prekshagrih (auditorium) which also comprised the house of the elected mayor and corporators on the eastern side of its main building in 2017. A huge campus behind the same auditorium, which was used as parking zone for the fleet of 250 garbage carriers, had also been pulled down. The Rudraksh ICC is a part of Kashi-Kyoto partnership agreement for conserving the city’s ancient heritage, signed by the PM and his then counterpart Shinzo Abe in Kyoto in August 2014. The ICC has been constructed with joint efforts of the Union ministry for urban development and the urban development department of the state government with the funding by the Japan government through the Japan International Cooperation Agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/rudraksh-a-bone-of-contention-between-corporators-scvl/articleshow/84532444.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Patna||Bihar: AES toll touches 10 as 5-year-old girl dies||PATNA: A five-year-old girl, who was admitted to the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) symptoms on July 16, died during treatment on Sunday. So far, 10 people have died due to AES at the SKMCH since January this year. SKMCH superintendent Dr B S Jha said the girl, Saloni Kumari, was a resident of Pakridayal sub-division in East Champaran district. “Salomi was suspected to be suffering from AES. Earlier on July 15, a two-and-a-half-year-old girl, identified as Ishika Kumari of Bajpatti block in Sitamarhi district, had succumbed to the AES,” Dr Jha added. He said Ishika was brought to the hospital in critical condition on July 14. “Though the doctors had tried their best, she couldn’t survive. She was referred to the SKMCH from a private hospital after her health deteriorated,” the superintendent said. Dr Jha said the hospital has five confirmed and four suspected cases of AES. “Three patients have been admitted to the PICU ward,” he added. Dr Jha said high temperature, humidity and malnutrition have led to sudden rise in AES cases in the region. “Thanks to heavy rainfall on Sunday, we hope the cases will substantially decrease,” he added. According to the hospital authorities, 41 cases of AES have been reported to the SKMCH since January this year. Of them, 10 died during treatment at the hospital. The victims belonged to Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sheohar, East Champaran and Wast Champaran districts. A health bulletin released by the Muzaffarpur district administration said 41 cases of AES were registered at the SKMCH so far this year and three at the Kejriwal Hospital in the town, which has been allowed to admit such patients for treatment. Muzaffarpur has accounted for 21 cases, East Champaran and Sitamarhi six cases each, Vaishali five cases, Sheohar three cases, West Champaran two cases and Madhepura one case. In Muzaffarpur, Paroo block has been identified as the worst hit with six cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aes-toll-touches-10-as-5-year-old-girl-dies/articleshow/84530270.cms||Ramashankar

---||Business||2nd wave: HDFC Bank cautious on retail biz||Mumbai: The second wave of the pandemic has turned HDFC Bank cautious with respect to retail loans. The bank’s overall retail loan book shrank from Rs 5.27 lakh crore in end-March 2021 to Rs 5.23 lakh crore in end-June. Retail loans fell with a drop in credit card outstandings, auto loans, two-wheeler loans and loans against securities. According to HDFC Bank’s chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, credit card outstanding shrank to Rs 60,429 crore in end-June from Rs 64,674 crore in end-March because of a drop in revolving credit. He said that the focus was on quality of credit and around three-fourths of the bank’s credit card customers have deposits that are on average five times the credit card outstanding. He was addressing analysts in a conference call after the bank’s results for the first quarter of the current fiscal. Speaking in the same call, head (retail assets) Arvind Kapil said that the bank was now seeing buoyancy returning to the personal loan segment and expects good growth in future. The bank, which is facing a freeze on issuing new cards, has completed an audit of its IT systems as required by the RBI and is now waiting to hear from the central bank. Even as it awaits the RBI’s nod for resuming card issuance, the bank is rapidly growing its card-acceptance business. Vaidyanathan said that the bank already has 2.3 million merchant-acceptance points and it has a 50% market share of merchants being on-boarded for card-acceptance as against 40% last year. HDFC Bank’s chief credit officer Jimmy Tata said that, during the quarter, things had not been the most orderly because of the second wave. “We were pretty much back to pre-Covid level until March, till the second wave hit us in April. We found our staff getting infected rapidly and we stopped going out on recovery calls. Most of the work was work-from-home. It is only in the month of June that we had the ability to start going out,” he said. In the second quarter, there has been a high level of vaccinations in the bank and staff have returned to office for calling on borrowers. According to Tata, the one product segment that has seen a non-Covid impact was diesel commercial vehicles (CVs), because they have not been able to pass on the sharp hike in fuel costs. He said that the bank was watching the portfolio as it would take two quarters for the price hike to be passed on. “We expect that by the festival season, things would have been brought back on an even keel, with cost increases passed on.” On the cards business, Srinivasan said that HDFC Bank’s debit card issuance would not be hit because of the ban on Mastercard except for a couple of co-branded cards. He said that cards contribute between one-fourth to a third of the bank’s fee income in any quarter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/2nd-wave-hdfc-bank-cautious-on-retail-biz/articleshow/84536332.cms||Mayur Shetty

The recent rains have added to the woes of motorists as there are several large potholes on the road. Motorists have complained that the major road has not been repaired for the past year. Travelling on the eight to 10 kilometre stretch on the Parvathipuram to Odisha road via the Komarada stretch poses a concern as the speed of the vehicles has drastically come down. One can find potholes on the stretch at various locations between Komarada-Bangarampeta, Kotipam- Gumada, Chollapadam-Kuneru and Sivini-Vikrampuram. Officials had repaired the road at a cost of over Rs 1.6 crore a few months ago but the effort went in vain as most potholes were not filled with concrete. Deploring the delay in repair of the major stretch, an activist, K Samba Murthy, said they will launch massive agitations on the road from July 26 if officials failed to take steps by July 25. Motorists also complained that due to potholes on the stretch, emergency vehicles were struggling to ply on the road. The speed limit of the vehicles decreased to between 10 to 20 kmph. Some vehicles recently got stuck in the potholes, leading to traffic congestion. Fatal and non-fatal accidents have also been reported on the stretch, said activists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/fix-road-by-jul-25-or-face-agitation-warn-motorists-activists-in-vzm/articleshow/84532422.cms||---

The meeting was attended by all office bearers of CICU including president Upkar Singh Ahuja, general secretary Pankaj Sharma along with representatives of associations related to knitwear, shawl, blanket, plywood, dyeing, processing and furnace industries. While addressing the industrialists, Bindra said it was due to chief minister Amarinder Singh’s vision that special emphasis has been given to industry like single window Invest Punjab and providing electricity at Rs 5 per unit. Bindra also assured the industrialists that this atmosphere would continue. He said that Punjab is only state that has always provided congenial atmosphere for industry and that is why several units that had already closed down earlier restarted their operations. He said the units not just started their operations, but even increased their capacities because electricity is being provided at Rs 5 per unit. Bindra also urged the industrialists to provide maximum employment to the local youth, to which the industrialists assured that more than 20,000 local youth would be hired in the coming few months. He also directed the officials of District Bureau of Employment & Enterprises (DBEE) to prepare a database of all eligible youth who can be provided employment at the earliest.

Addressing a meeting of the state office-bearers of JD(U) here, Nitish congratulated the party’s state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha for giving more than 33% organizational posts to women. Nitish said his government has empowered women in all fields. “Today, Bihar has the highest number of women in the police force. Not only women, our government worked to ensure development and overall progress of all sections of the society, including backwards, extremely backwards, Dalits, Mahadalits and members of the minority community,” he said. “We did not discriminate any section while executing the development works. We did equal work for all areas, all regions, all castes, all communities and all sections of the society,” the CM said while recounting the development works executed by his successive governments in the last 16 years. The CM further congratulated the JD(U) president and Rajya Sabha member RCP Singh for being included as cabinet minister in the Narendra Modi government. “Singh has vast administrative experience and I hope he, as the Union minister, will perform effectively,” the CM said. Speaking on the occasion, Singh said the way Nitish empowered women by providing them reservation on different posts, the JD(U) followed the suit and provided more than 33% organizational posts to women in the party. “In future, we will try to provide 50% posts to women in the party,” the JD(U) boss said. While Nitish, RCP and party’s national general secretary Sanjay Kumar Jha addressed the meeting virtually, other senior leaders like Upendra Kushwaha, Bashishtha Narain Singh, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and building construction minister Ashok Choudhary were physically present at the JD(U) office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-recalls-govts-steps-for-women-takes-a-dig-at-lalu/articleshow/84531614.cms||Madan Kumar

The gross storage level at the Pulichintala project is 45.77 thousand million cubic feet (TMC). The project has reached the 44.03 TMC mark. With heavy rainfall in Telangana, Munneru, Tammileru and other rivulets upstream of the Prakasam Barrage are receiving large inflows of water. Officials have alerted revenue authorities of mandals on the banks of the Krishna as floods are expected in the next three days.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh may seek changes to river board notification||AMARAVATI: The state government is studying the notification issued by the Centre to fix the jurisdiction of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB). The government will seek a few corrections, particularly, the declaration of Veligonda project as unapproved, though it has got all the permissions. The government will also seek removal of the projects and canals that are not common to the two states. The state will also object to the inclusion of Sileru power project in the notification. Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, advisor to the state government, had said they would approach the Centre seeking amendments to certain references in the notification. “We welcomed the notification for river boards’ jurisdiction as it will bring unauthorised usage of water from the common projects to an end. However, certain changes are required in the notification as there were some errors which were not in tune with the AP Reorganisation Act,” said Saajjala Ramakrishna Reddy. He said that all projects mentioned in the APRA, 2014 should get place in the notification. Syamala Rao, secretary, water resources, had also hinted at seeking changes in the notification issued by the Centre. The state government is also contemplating requesting the Centre to remove the canal and distributory network of the projects from the purview of the river boards for their maintenance and operation. “We will be required to take permission from the river boards even to attend to small repairs to the distributory network which might get delayed. In fact, the river boards will not have such a vast field level network to inspect the requirements of the states to grant the permissions. This will result in delay in giving the clearances,” said a senior official. He said that the Centre would also reduce its burden by removing all the works that were not connected to the inter-state releases or sharing of waters from the purview of the river boards. Meanwhile, TDP has stepped up its offence against the state government for accepting the gazette without being informed of its consequences. Former water resources minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao said the TDP government had agreed to bring only the Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects under KRMB’s purview when Naidu was at the helm. He said the government had taken a foolish decision by agreeing to transfer all 107 projects in the state to the river boards, which would render injustice to farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-may-seek-changes-to-river-board-notification/articleshow/84532225.cms||Samdani MN

With a sharp drop in Covid cases, gradual lifting of travel restrictions and hospitals switching focus on non-Covid treatment, many cancer patients have started to throng hospitals across the city. But many have been forced to return at an advanced, inoperative stage, and doctors have had to offer palliative care instead of curative therapy. “We are seeing many patients who are at an inoperative stage, which will compromise treatment outcome and push up expenses,” said senior radiation oncologist Subir Ganguly of Apollo Multispeciality Hospital. Ganguly cited the example of a patient from Singur who was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer a few days ago. The middle-aged woman had noticed a lump almost a year ago, but avoided going to a hospital because of the pandemic. “We have lost many potentially curable cases due to the delay. It can take just three months for cancer of the tongue to progress from stage 2 to stage 4, when treatment outcome will be very poor,” said onco-surgeon Gautam Mukhopadhyay, clinical director, surgical oncology, at Peerless Hospital. Mukhopadhyay said many cancer patients avoided hospitals partly due to the fear of contracting Covid and partly due to logistical issues. “As far as head-and-neck cancer is concerned, about 70% patients would come seeking diagnosis and treatment at an advanced stage. But the pandemic has aggravated the situation, leaving us unable to offer curative treatment in an increasing number of cases,” said IPGMER senior head-and-neck surgery consultant Saurav Datta. The state has kept IPGMER out of its Covid care network so the government could continue catering to non-Covid patients. Despite that, patient footfall had dropped drastically. “While many patients detected with cancer after the pandemic did not turn up for treatment, another set of patients who had undergone surgery did not show up for chemotherapy. Now, some have developed metastasis,” said IPGMER’s professor of surgery Diptendra Sarkar, who conducts breast cancer surgeries. Organisations like Bengal Oncology Foundation campaigned not to delay cancer treatment. Most hospitals had deferred surgeries during the first wave, taking in only emergency operations. And when they started opening all elective surgeries, the second wave came in. “We have been treating conditions like acute chest pain and respiratory distress as emergencies. Because cancer does not throw up symptoms or pain in the early stage, we think we can delay treatment. But it can progress rapidly towards a point of no return,” said Ganguly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cancer-ops-delayed-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/84532857.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Fake-vax victims double-check info before real jab||KOLKATA: Around 320 people — duped by conman Debanjan Deb into taking fake shots — who have received the first dose of Covishield since Friday said they were very careful this time and checked all relevant documents needed before and after vaccination. Some even verified the vials before being injected and demanded ID cards of the vaccinators. In a drive organised by the state health department, 740 citizens who had received fake vaccines at multiple camps organised by Deb in Kasba, Sonarpur and City College last month are receiving text messages asking them to head to MR Bangur Hospital, Sonarpur Rural Hospital or a private hospital off Bypass by July 25 to get the “original” vaccine, free of cost. “My wife and son had received a message last Thursday from the state health department asking them to head to the Sonarpur hospital on Friday and take the jab. I was skeptical and accompanied them. I checked the list and found even my name there. Everything looked fine but I double-checked the names, the vaccinator’s ID and ensured the vials were actually Covishield,” said Sunil Ghosh, a businessman from Sonarpur who had received the fake vaccine at Deb’s Kasba office on June 12. City College professor Subhadip Roy had similar inhibitions as he walked into the vaccination centre at MR Bangur Hospital with his wife after getting a text message from the health department on Friday. “What happened last time still gives us shivers. We were more alert this time. But the arrangement was fine and we were provided with the vaccination certificate at the spot,” said Roy, who inoculated with the fake vaccine on June 18. Actor and parliamentarian Mimi Chakraborty, who had also received the fake jab, said she is preparing to take the real vaccine. “ I will take the first dose very soon,” she told TOI. While 109 people took the vaccine on Friday, 210 got it on Saturday. Of them, 250 were inoculated at Sonarpur Rural Hospital and 69 received the jab at MR Bangur Hospital. “We are maintaining a separate list for these persons who need to show the text message from the state health department and other ID at the dedicated centres,” said Somnath Mukherjee, CMOH, South 24 Parganas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-vax-victims-double-check-info-before-real-jab/articleshow/84532931.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Former city Mayor Captain Jagatveer Singh Drona, national general secretary of Kinnar Mahasabha Kajal Kiran, Pandit Ramji Tripathi, Red Cross president Dr Umesh Paliwal, Pandit Vijay Pandey, corporator Mahendra Pandey participated in the ‘pooja’ and other rituals of the ‘ash urns’ the ground burial. Programme organiser Manoj and Madhavi Sengar, while talking to TOI said that 14 ‘asthi kalash’ were lying unclaimed at the ‘Asthi Kalash’ bank at Bhairav Ghat for past one year and nobody had turned up to claim them. They said that these ‘Asthi Kalash’ were of those who died due to Covid in 2020 and their relatives did not turn up for their lat rites. Manoj said that it was after such a long wait the last rites of these asthi kalash were completed respectfully. “We urge people to give ash urns ground burial instead of depositing them in Maa Ganga, thereby saving it from pollution”, Sengar said. Sengars said that may be out of fear of contracting Covid, people did not turn up to claim these asthi kalash but final rites of a person should be always completed for their ‘Moksh’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/14-unclaimed-asthi-kalash-get-ground-burial/articleshow/84532348.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

She was staying alone in her house. A couple, who had recently moved into the house of the deceased as tenant are the prime suspect in the murder as they have been absconding for the past couple of days. According to reports, the deceased, Durga Devi (70) has been living alone in the house after the death of her husband while her married daughter lived in a nearby Pratappura Colony. On Sunday, one of the neighbours of the deceased informed her daughter that there has been no movement in the house for the past couple of days and the channel gate is also closed, which is quite unusual. When her daughter arrived, she was stunned to see her mother lying dead on the floor. Police were informed who sent the body for the post-mortem examination. Her daughter and the neighbours suspect the involvement of her tenants in the murder who are missing. Her daughter also alleged that some expensive items were also missing from the house. According to police, preliminary investigations revealed that the woman had been strangulated. It was rather astonishing that none, including her daughter and the previous landlords of the missing tenants knew their names and their whereabouts. Police have lodged a case against the unknown couple tenant under section 302 of the IPC. SSP Jhansi Shivhari Meena said, “Police are investigating the case, and have found some important clues which will help in nabbing the accused”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/elderly-woman-found-murdered-needle-of-suspicion-is-on-tenants-who-are-absconding/articleshow/84535238.cms||---

The government said economic activities were disrupted due to Covid-19 induced containment and mitigation measures. These circumstances necessitated the state government to take appropriate and timely measures to review existing systems of public service delivery, optimise expenditure and augment the state revenues, said the government. The government felt that it was increasingly apparent that the pandemic would have a severe and continual impact on the state’s economy and, therefore, on the realisation of tax revenues. The government directed the committee to identify steps to be taken for the improvement of public service delivery, enhance operational efficiency through better design and implementation of government programmes. Based on the assessment of available revenues and finance, the committee was asked to suggest measures to optimise government expenditure so that government money was spent most productively. “The committee should also consider and suggest comprehensive list of measures to augment state revenues. Policy measures and relevant changes needed in the law, improved compliance monitoring and anti-evasion measures using better administrative coordination,” the government has directed. The committee was also tasked with formulation of measures to identify and eliminate avoidable expenditure, optimise public spending as to realise better outputs and outcomes, and greater value for money from public spending in general. The government had also observed that the committee should also look into restructuring of departments to realise functional synergies and also limit wastage and duplication of resources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-sets-up-panel-to-suggest-ways-to-boost-revenue/articleshow/84542375.cms||Samdani MN
---||Visakhapatnam||Vizag: Woman, lover nabbed for husband’s murder||VISAKHAPATNAM: PM Palem police have solved the mystery behind the death of Koney Satish, who was found dead under suspicious circumstances near NGO Colony in Vizag city on July 13. Satish’s wife, Koney Ramya, and her paramour Shaik Basha have been arrested for the murder. Ramya, a native of Vizag, had married Satish, a resident of Eluru, in 2015. After the wedding, Ramya left for Dubai, where Satish worked. There, the two had a daughter, Sanwitha. In August 2019, Ramya, who was pregnant, returned to Vizag with her daughter, where she gave birth to a boy. In February 2021, Satish returned to Vizag. Ramya claimed that all four family members were out on a walk on the evening of July 13, when Satish suddenly collapsed. On his head were injury marks and an unidentified person hurriedly left the spot, she said. One Sudhakar Reddy, Ramya suspected, may have murdered Satish as the two had financial disputes. However, investigation has revealed that Ramya and Shaik Basha had been classmates at school and had previously been in a relationship. In 2019, the two reacquainted through a classmates’ WhatsApp group. They started meeting each other when Ramya returned to Vizag. But unable to meet each other when Satish returned, Basha suggested they run away but Ramya refused. The two then sent messages and photos to Ramya’s husband to raise suspicion over her fidelity, but Satish did not leave her. Finally, they planned the murder and implicated Sudhakar Reddy. As part of the plan, Basha beat Satish over the head with an iron rod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/woman-lover-nabbed-for-husbands-murder/articleshow/84532355.cms||---

The record collection was boosted by a strong stock market with the benchmark indices at record highs. I-Pru MF’s process oriented approach and also its robust performance track record across asset classes helped it to garner record mobilisation through this fund, top executives said. I-Pru MF believes that since the equity market is at an elevated level, a prudent approach to investing is to opt for a scheme without any allocation limitation in terms of market capitalisation, which is where flexicap comes in. According to the fund house, over four lakh retail investors applied in the NFO. This is the second equity fund from I-Pru MF launched in 2021. At the beginning of the year, the fund house had launched a scheme based on the theme of business cycles through which it had collected Rs 4,198 crore. According to AMFI’s June 2021 MF industry figures, with an average asset under management (AAUM) of Rs 4.17 lakh crore, I-Pru MF was the third largest fund house in India. SBI MF, the largest one, had an AAUM of Rs 5.23 lakh crore while the corresponding figure for HDFC MF was also Rs 4.17 lakh crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/i-pru-mf-garners-over-rs-10k-cr-in-flexicap-nfo/articleshow/84536902.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Bihar: RJD protests price rise, unemployment||PATNA: A large number of RJD workers on the call of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav took out processions, organised dharnas and burnt effigies of PM Narendra Modi and CM Nitish Kumar at the block headquarters across the state on Sunday on the first day of their two-day 'halla bol' agitation to protest against soaring prices and unemployment in the country. The agitation started early in the morning with the party workers taking out processions on bullock carts carrying LPG cylinders and household utensils. They also carried posters, banners and shouted slogans against the central government and the state government demanding remedial measures to check the rising prices. Later they sat on a dharna at the block headquarters, which subsequently turned into a meeting. The meeting was addressed by senior leaders of the party, who called upon the people to come out in the open to vent their ire against the government. “For how long will you continue to suffer due to the price rise?,” they asked. RJD state secretary Chandeshwar Prasad Singh said the workers burnt effigy of PM Narendra Modi at Kargil Chowk near Gandhi Maidan in the state capital under the banner of Patna Mahanagar and Sadar block unit of the party. RJD national general secretary Shyam Rajak led the protest march under the Phulwarisharif block in Patna district. RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari termed Sunday’s agitation as a historic one and claimed that it received massive support from the people. “The resentment over price rise, unemployment, corruption and poverty is palpable on the faces of the masses,” he added. Tiwari alleged that while the poor were becoming poorer, the corporate houses were becoming wealthier during the NDA rule both at the centre and the state. At some places, the activists of Left parties, which are allies of the RJD, also lent their support. Tiwari said that the protest would be held at district headquarters on Monday. On Saturday Lalu said that he was giving a matra to deal with the price rise and other ills plaguing the country during the NDA rule. Lalu tweeted, “NDA hatao, mahangai ghatao (remove NDA, reduce prices).” The RJD launched the agitation a day after a similar protest was organised by the Congress on the same issue. Congress leaders had taken out a cycle rally on Saturday to expose the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-protests-price-rise-unemployment/articleshow/84532342.cms||Ramashankar

---||Ahmedabad||NMC planning to increase UG medical seats from 82,500 to 1 lakh||AHMEDABAD: The National Medical Commission (NMC) under the ministry of health and family welfare is working out a plan to increase the total number of undergraduate medical seats to one lakh by next year, said sources aware of the development. This was discussed at a recent meeting of NMC chaired by the Union health secretary. “There are presently 82,500 MBBS seats across the country and the government plans to take it to one lakh in a year’s time,” said a government official close to the development. There are close to 540 medical colleges in the country offering MBBS courses of which 49% are government run and remaining are self-financed and on public-private-partnership basis. “The process for adding new medical colleges and increasing the MBBS seats is presently on,” said Dr Aruna Vanikar, president of the undergraduate medical education board, NMC. She did not divulge further information on the number of new applications for increase in number of seats. Sources in Gujarat medical education fraternity said that Gujarat has 5,500-odd UG medical seats and is likely to get three more colleges. “There are deliberations to start three new medical colleges in the state which would add 450 seats,” said an official. To add more seats, the government is exploring the option of running medical colleges in two shifts to increase the number of student intake. A similar plan is being worked out in different parts of the country too, sources added. Sources also said it is being considered to start medical colleges affiliated with government hospitals. "There are at least six districts which have government hospitals and it is being considered to apply for medical colleges here," said a senior medical education official. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an address in February said that around 30,000 MBBS seats and 24,000 postgraduate seats in medicine have been added since the present Central government came to power in 2014. Modi, while delivering a convocation address of a medical college in Tamil Nadu by way of video conferencing said that the number of MBBS seats have gone up by 50% and postgraduate seats by 80% since 2014. The Central government has taken various initiatives to transform the health sector and the National Medical Commission, the newly-formed regulatory body, was formed to bring in more transparency. As part of the Centre’s plans to increase the number of MBBS seats at a time when the country has faced shortage of doctors during Covid-19, the government aims to increase the number of seats by 50 students in government medical colleges. Currently inspection at medical colleges in the country is on and for undergraduate institutions there will be no physical inspection and the permission for increase in seats will be given based on the affidavit filed by the college, said sources. The Central government as part of its broad plans aims to have one government run medical college in every district of the country. This will solve the infrastructure issue as most of the districts today house one big government run medical hospital. While the government may have found ways to solve the infrastructure issues for raising the number of MBBS seats, staff crunch is an issue that they are still grappling with, according to a medical field expert. Government run medical colleges in Gujarat are already reeling under pressure due to 15% staff crunch, the situation is worse in self-financed colleges where there is 30% staff crunch, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nmc-planning-to-increase-ug-medical-seats-from-82k-to-1l/articleshow/84534900.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Business||India among countries most vulnerable, least prepared for automation in APAC: study||Chennai: India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan are the countries most at risk but least prepared for the coming wave of automation triggered by Covid. Indian businesses rank fifth among 12 Asia Pacific (APAC) nations for risk of automation and ninth for level of preparedness, a study by Deloitte and global software firm Autodesk showed. India has a greater likelihood of being impacted from automation due to larger employment shares in agriculture, manufacturing and construction, it added. At the same time, industries considered to be at lower risk of automation -namely education, public administration and finance- comprise only 7% of India’s total employment. India's preparedness score, which measures the ability of countries to capitalise on automation and help disadvantaged workers, stood at 44% compared to the APAC average of 55%. Australia received the highest score at 72%, while Pakistan received the lowest at 40%. India scored 47% in its ability to capitalise on automation compared to advanced tech adopters in APAC such as Singapore that scored 71%. As India’s construction sector goes through a wave of digitization post the pandemic, it is the fifth most vulnerable ahead of Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Myanmar and the Philippines. Similarly, in agriculture, India, Philippines and Indonesia have a higher likelihood of automation for the sector, even as Pakistan’s agri-sector was at the highest risk of impact from automation. India’s mining sector has the second-highest risk of impact from automation after Bangladesh. The sector's vulnerability to automation stems from its relatively low skill requirements, its high degree of routine and manual tasks, and use of direct physical activity to operate machinery, the study noted. As Covid-19 accelerates adoption of automation across the world, close to half of all businesses in APAC intend to increase their adoption of robotic process automation over the next year, the report finds. “Automation creates opportunities for new, more meaningful types of work as it replaces mundane or repetitive manual tasks, but the state of preparedness of countries and industries will determine whether they benefit from these advances. Improving digital literacy, supporting disadvantaged workers, and putting in place the right infrastructure and skills will help create new roles that workers can transition into,” Rajeev Mittal, Regional Director, India & SAARC, Autodesk, said. The study analysed labour markets across 12 APAC countries including Australia, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-among-countries-most-vulnerable-least-prepared-for-automation-in-apac-study/articleshow/84533057.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The project has been declared as an economic corridor under Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I. As per the detailed project report, the project starts from Abhanpur near Raipur (Chhattisgarh) and ends at Sabbavaram in Visakhapatnam district. The entire stretch is a greenfield alignment passing through Chhattisgarh (124 km), Odisha (240 km) and Andhra Pradesh (100 km). In Andhra Pradesh, most of the stretch will pass through Vizianagaram district. Vizianagaram district collector M Hari Jawaharlal said they have decided to complete at least 80% of the works, such as land acquisition, by August 15. The district administration has decided to acquire over 1,300 acres for the project. However, some people are opposing land acquisition.The project has got environment clearance and the acquisition of land and forest clearance are in different stages of approval. The district administration has also decided to review the progress of the project every month. The project is targeted for completion by the 2024-25 financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/land-acquisition-for-highway-on-fast-track/articleshow/84532478.cms||---

Under this, the fintechs provide an interface for customers, and the bank delivers the network effect by providing not just the banking platform but also access to other fintech services that it has partnered with. SBM earlier operated as an Indian branch of its parent doing wholesale banking and did not have any electronic interface like internet or mobile banking. In end-2018, the bank got a full-fledged bank licence. “This enabled us to leapfrog in terms of IT and provide a new technology stack to the customer,” said MD & CEO Sidharth Rath. According to him, the bank took a call to build a liability (deposit) franchise first. “Building a branch network is expensive and it costs as much as Rs 1-1.5 crore to set up a branch. For us, the lockdown was a blessing as it hastened the move to digital,” he added. The fintechs the bank has partnered with include Paisabazaar, through which it issues innovative products like a secured credit card. Young people and others who are otherwise ineligible for credit cards can instantly open a fixed deposit online and get a secured credit card. Once they build a track record of paying bills in time, they are eligible for a regular card. Similarly, through a partnership with PayNearby, the bank can get small recurring deposits through the ‘Bachat Khata’ offered by the fintech, which offers business correspondent services on the digital platform. The bank can offer customers immediate cross-border payments through its partnership with Nium. Other partners include RedCarpet, EnKash, Karbon, Finin, Open and Kodo. “While we are present in only eight cities with physical branches, we have opened accounts in 500 cities with these digital accounts. This will continue to grow because the relationships have just about started,” said Neeraj Sinha, head (consumer & retail banking).Another advantage that SBM is exploiting is that of its offshore parent, which enables the bank to facilitate remittances under the RBI’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme for purchasing shares or other assets through a foreign currency account.

The government said economic activities were disrupted due to Covid-19 induced containment and mitigation measures. These circumstances necessitated the state government to take appropriate and timely measures to review existing systems of public service delivery, optimise expenditure and augment the state revenues, said the government. The government felt that it was increasingly apparent that the pandemic would have a severe and continual impact on the state’s economy and, therefore, on the realisation of tax revenues. The government directed the committee to identify steps to be taken for the improvement of public service delivery, enhance operational efficiency through better design and implementation of government programmes. Based on the assessment of available revenues and finance, the committee was asked to suggest measures to optimise government expenditure so that government money was spent most productively. “The committee should also consider and suggest comprehensive list of measures to augment state revenues. Policy measures and relevant changes needed in the law, improved compliance monitoring and anti-evasion measures using better administrative coordination,” the government has directed. The committee was also tasked with formulation of measures to identify and eliminate avoidable expenditure, optimise public spending as to realise better outputs and outcomes, and greater value for money from public spending in general. The government had also observed that the committee should also look into restructuring of departments to realise functional synergies and also limit wastage and duplication of resources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-sets-up-panel-to-suggest-ways-to-boost-revenue/articleshow/84532189.cms||Samdani MN

The heavy downpour, however, brought some relief from the scorching heat as the temperature fell and weather remained mostly cloudy throughout the day. People were seen wading through ankle to knee-deep water in several localities, such as Ram Krishna Nagar, Indira Nagar, Dak Bungalow crossing, Jamal Road, pockets of Kankarbagh, Patliputra Colony, Station Road and S K Puri. People living in low-lying areas struggled with slush and puddles even as dug-up roads and open manholes complicated the situation. Some areas also experienced stinking smell due to mixing of rainwater with drain water. Arvind Kumar, a resident of Nehru Nagar, said water entered his house through a drain outlet. “The drains were completely clogged. I had complained about it to the authorities concerned several times, but to no avail,” he added. Vishal Raj Bhatt, a resident of Sachivalaya Colony in Kankarbagh, said roads were dug up and not repaired, causing inconvenience to people. “The drainage network in the area needs to be improved. A few more spells of rain would worsen the situation,” he said. Ankit Rana, a resident of Station Road, said they have to live with stinking feeling for couple of days. “Even though the accumulated rainwater will be drained out, we have to face the slush on dug-up roads,” he added. Late on Sunday evening, water had receded from many localities. Kanchan Kumari, executive officer of Patliputra circle of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), said water was drained out from major areas, except in a few localities at Rajbanshi Nagar and Old Patliputra Colony. “All the pumping stations are running to their full capacity. We are hopeful of draining out rainwater from all areas in the next few hours,” she added. Executive officer of PMC’s Kankarbagh circle, Shashi Bhushan Prasad, too said water was drained out water from most areas. “All the seven sump houses are running to pump out water from the affected areas. As more rain is expected, we are working round the clock,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/that-sinking-feeling-in-patna-again/articleshow/84530387.cms||Faryal Rumi

He said three cryogenic oxygen plants of 22 KL each are to be installed there, including one this month itself. The minister said the 500-bed block was already under construction there while the government planned to increase the number of beds from the existing 1,050 to about 3,000. Pandey said, “Altogether 122 oxygen generation plants are scheduled for installation in the government hospitals, including those in the districts and subdivisions, by August-end. The first one has ben installed at the IGIMS.” He said all efforts were on to strengthen the healthcare facilities so as to face any challenge like the speculated third wave of the Covid pandemic. Pandey said the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology at the IGIMS was also being developed with more beds. Former Union minister and Patna Sahib MP Ravi Shankar Prasad said the oxygen generation plant at IGIMS would produce 233 litres of oxygen per minute, sufficient to fill 50 D type cylinders in a day. He said single-day generation from this plant would be able to meet uninterrupted oxygen supply to 50 patients for 24 hours. IGIMS director Dr NR Biswas said the new resources would make this institute self-reliant for oxygen requirements. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said if the patients start getting oxygen completely from the internal oxygen plant, the doctors would save any patient requiring oxygen during the treatment. He said no patient would now return disappointed for want of bed or oxygen from the IGIMS, which is committed to serving people effectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/new-1200-bed-block-at-igims-soon-minister/articleshow/84530459.cms||VK Tripathi

Participating in a webinar, chief secretary Adityanath Das said during Covid-19 last year, the state government announced Rs 1,100 crore financial assistance to MSMEs as a restart package. The chief secretary has directed the energy department to furnish a report on department-wise initiatives and establishment and functioning of energy conservation cells in the next executive committee meeting. “Andhra Pradesh would fully focus on reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. It would support the government of India in mitigating ill effects of climate change by adopting both short-term and long-term strategies by involving all the stakeholders. Andhra Pradesh is determined to become a role model in the country in promoting green energy through energy efficiency and renewable energy sources,” said Adityanath Das. As per the estimates of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, Andhra Pradesh has a saving potential of 25%, i.e., 16,875 million units out of a total annual energy demand of around 67,500 MU. According to AP State Energy Conservation Mission, the state has so far saved an estimated 2,932 MU of energy worth Rs 2,014 crore per annum through various state government schemes. In order to achieve further energy savings of around 14,000 MU, the chief secretary suggested the energy department prepare a comprehensive roadmap to achieve the target. In the context of Covid-19 and its impact and forthcoming executive committee meeting of AP State Energy Conservation Mission (SECM), the chief secretary emphasised the need to continue cost effective measures in the power sector by availing innovative and global technologies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/state-plans-global-tech-in-energy-efficiency/articleshow/84532259.cms||---

In this zone, about 87% of the sampled population had Covid antibodies. The figure is reflected in the final results of the fifth round of Covid sero survey, conducted between May 28 and June 3 after the deadly second wave. The overall seropositivity of about 5,000 individuals sampled by the AMC is 81.63%. The TOI had reported in June that preliminary results of this sero survey had pegged 70% plus Amdavadis had antibodies against Covid-19. Along with southwest zone, 87% population of the south zone too had Covid antibodies. This zone encompasses areas such as Maninagar, Indrapuri, Kankaria, Vatva, Lambha, and Behrampura. The high seropositivity in these zones has been attributed to two factors: Delta variant infections and vaccinations. The latest seropositivity report tracks the rampage of the second wave in Ahmedabad from April to May. “In our fourth serosurveillance drive carried out in February, we had found that 27.92% of the sampled population had Covid antibodies,” a senior AMC official said. “By May-end, the Delta variant had infected big number of the population. The previous variants were not as infectious as the Delta variant.” In 2020, the AMC had completed three serosurveys — in June, August, and October. These surveys showed that just 17.6%, 23.2%, and 24.2% of the populations sampled had antibodies. The latest serosurvey discerned a higher seropositivity among men as compared to women. The survey found that 82% of the 1,900 sampled men had antibodies; the figure for 2,100 women was 81%. The seropositivity was 76.7% among those who had no history of Covid or were not vaccinated, the report says. The seropositivity was 97.4% among those who had contracted Covid and had taken two vaccine shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/81-in-abad-have-antibodies-amc-final-sero-survey-report/articleshow/84534838.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Pune||Merger effect: Citizens’ dependency on water tankers to rise in 23 villages||Pune: The dependency on water tankers for the citizens of 23 villages recently merged with the PMC is likely to go up in the days to come. Water supply in the 23 merged villages has become a major concern for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in the absence of a proper supply network. The civic body has undertaken the 24x7 water supply project in areas under its jurisdiction. The facility has to be extended to the 11 villages merged in 2017 as well as the 23 villages that recently became a part of the PMC. But until it happens, the civic body will have to arrange at least 500 trips by water tankers to serve these areas. Residents in these villages said the pending water supply work should be completed at the earliest. The villages merged with the PMC in 2017 were still waiting for water supply infrastructure. “Water supply projects have been carried out in many villages by the nagar panchayat and other local self governing bodies. They have met the residents’ needs to some extent. But most of the projects are half done in many areas and should be completed to ensure proper water distribution,” said Shrirang Chavan of Dhayari, which was merged with the PMC in 2017. Residents of Khadakwasla, which recently became a part of the civic limits, also want improved water supply. The Khadakwasla dam, which is the biggest water supply source for Pune, is located in this village. Ironically, nearly 30% residents of this village do not get adequate water supply. “New housing societies and residential complexes are coming up in these areas. But residents of these societies are finding it difficult to get water due to the inadequate supply infrastructure. The civic administration should look into it and augment the network,” said Saurabh Mate, a resident of Khadakwasla and former sarpanch. “The residents would get raw water from a pipeline and the gram panchayat used to filter it. The civic administration should set up a filtration plant for providing treated water in these areas,” he said. Elected members in the PMC have been raising the issue of water supply at the general body meetings. They said water for non-drinking purposes was also a major problem for the villagers. “The demand for water has gone up and the civic body has taken efforts to meet it. Major infrastructure projects are not going to be implemented immediately. The demand has to be met by additional water tankers,” said Ganesh Dhore, a corporator from the 11 villages that became a part of the PMC in 2017. “The PMC has planned to discuss various issues, including water supply, in the newly merged villages. The civic body wants to draft a development plan for these villages,” said Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in the PMC. Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the PMC’s water department, said review meetings were planned in the newly merged villages and visits by officials were scheduled to check the demand and supply at the ground level. “The civic administration has drafted a special plan for providing water to the newly merged areas. A project will soon be undertaken for augmentation of the water supply system in these localites,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/merger-effect-citizens-dependency-on-water-tankers-to-rise-in-23-villages/articleshow/84535329.cms||---

The two accused – Golu Chauhan (20) and Lalji Chauhan (19) – were forwarded to judicial custody by a Buxar court on Sunday. Police said the woman was raped in presence of her two minor children – a son and a daughter – around 1am. The cries of the two children alerted the neighbours after which the accused fled. They were later arrested by police. An FIR in connection with the incident was registered at the Women’s police station in Buxar. SHO of Women’s police station Nitu Priya said while Golu committed the crime, Lalji held the woman tight and gagged her so that she could not scream. “The main entrance of the woman’s house was open due to hot weather. Taking advantage of this, the two accused entered the house and raped the woman. Her medical examination was conducted at a local hospital and the report is awaited,” the SHO said. She added the woman lives alone at the village with her two children as her husband works in a private factory in another state. Sadar DSP Gorakh Ram said it’s still not known whether the accused had harassed the woman in the past or not. “Police have begun an investigation into the incident,” he added.

In 2020, Indian IT spending was almost flat, growing at just 1.5% due to the overall economic crisis, global research firm Gartner said in a report. However, the growth of the country’s IT spending in 2021 is likely to be lower than the 8.6% growth worldwide that Gartner projects, at a total of $4.2 trillion, in 2021. Globally, the IT services segment is among the top three highest growth areas for 2021, primarily due to a boost in infrastructure-as-a-service spending that supports critical workloads and avoids high on-premises costs. Boards and CEOs are more willing to invest in technology that has a clear link to business outcomes, and less so for everything else, Gartner said. All segments of IT spending are projected to grow in 2021 in India, and end users are forecasted to spend the highest on devices at $38 billion in 2021 after a steep fall in 2020 in this segment. Enterprise software is expected to clock the fastest growth at 16.9% followed by IT services at 10.7% and devices at 7.6%. “The second wave of the pandemic and associated lockdowns have brought a significant sluggishness during most of the second quarter of 2021. However, demand is witnessing a rapid recovery across the majority of the sectors,” Gartner senior research director Naveen Mishra said. “Pharma, healthcare, financial services, education, online retail and government continue to invest in their digital transformation journey,” he added. In 2021, Indian organisations, including SMEs, will be better positioned to invest more in IT, through the next two quarters, Gartner predicts. Similarly, another global industry tracker IDC estimates India’s overall software market to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.6% from 2020 to 2025. “India enterprises will continue to invest in technologies that will help them spur innovation to improve operational efficiency and employee productivity and, in turn, maintain business momentum,” IDC said in a note. IDC expects the contribution of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) markets to the overall software market to increase from 36.8% in 2020 to 57.1% in 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/it-spends-to-grow-8-in-21-study/articleshow/84533665.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The project is brimming with water with reserves touching almost full capacity of 44tmc. This is the third consecutive year the project has reached FRL. The project had met full capacity in 2019, almost a decade after the completion of its construction. AP authorities have advised Telangana to go for power generation at Pulichintala keeping in view heavy inflows from upstream. Power generation at Pulichintala by Telangana without seeking indent from AP had created controversy last month. As per the operational protocol, Telangana could go for hydel power generation only after receiving indent from AP as Pulichintala was designed only for stabilisation of Krishna delta irrigation needs. However, Telangana went ahead with operating the power station, prompting the AP government to lodge complaint with Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Union Jal Shakti ministry. Telangana started power generation when the project had about 18 tmc water in reserve and storage dipped to 14 tmc within a few days following wastage of water. Subsequently, heavy rains in the catchment area and floods in rivulets and streams helped the project reach FRL in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pulichintala-project-reaches-frl-25k-cusecs-released-downstream/articleshow/84532297.cms||Samdani MN

The bridge will serve as an additional protection for the wildlife. Three types of monkeys are spotted in the sanctuary area. The NHAI had earlier installed sound barriers stretching over a kilometre on both sides of the highway. The monkey bridge has been placed on two poles installed on both sides of the highway metres ahead of the Karnala bird sanctuary entrance. No pole is on the highway median. The bridge comprises steel rope, wire, etc. It is extended by five metres on both side margins of the highway. The box-type bridge fenced on either sides is open from top and is about 40-mt-long, two-foot-wide and is placed seven metres above the Mumbai-Goa highway. “Very often, the monkeys come on to the highway as they are fed by people. This results in their accidental deaths. The bridge placed by the NHAI will facilitate easy movement of the monkeys on the highway. It will protect them from mishaps,” said Pradeep Chavhan, range forest officer (wildlife), Karnala bird sanctuary. “The monkey bridge has been erected on the highway in accordance with the design finalised by the forest department. The cost of the bridge cannot be divulged as it is included in the project cost but not as an individual item,” said Prashant Fegade, project manager (Panvel-Indapur) section, NHAI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/highway-authorities-bridge-the-gap-for-monkeys-on-mumbai-goa-stretch/articleshow/84537745.cms||Umesh K Parida

---||Delhi||Rain eludes large parts of Delhi||NEW DELHI: While the capital had an “orange” alert in place for Sunday, with an India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast of moderate-to-heavy rainfall along with gusty winds, rain eluded large parts of Delhi altogether. Only light rain was recorded at some locations towards the evening. Met officials said while the monsoon trough passed through parts of Delhi-NCR on Sunday, it did not move north towards Delhi and light showers only impacted south, southwest and central parts of the city briefly. IMD has forecast light-to-moderate showers for Monday. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded “trace” rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm, with 7.2mm of rainfall recorded in the next three hours. Palam, meanwhile, recorded 0.8mm till 5.30pm and 3.3mm in the next three hours. IMD classifies rainfall as “light” when it is between 2.5mm and 15.5mm; as “moderate”, when it is between 15.6mm and 64.4mm; and as “heavy”, when it exceeds 64.5mm in a single day. “Conditions were favourable for rain, but the monsoon trough was southwest of the capital and remained there. This brought rain west and south of Delhi, but scattered spells in the capital. Conditions will, however, remain ideal for more rain in the next few days,” said a Met official. For Monday and Tuesday, IMD has a “yellow” alert in place, which means it is likely to rain, but will not cause any severe disruption. While light-to-moderate showers are forecast for Monday, light rain is forecast for Tuesday. While there are lesser chances of rain on Wednesday and Thursday, Met officials say drizzle activity is still expected in parts of Delhi. Delhi’s maximum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 36.4 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. However, high humidity levels — between 61% and 81% — made the day uncomfortable. While humidity is expected to remain high in the next 48 hours, mercury is forecast to drop to 32 degrees by Monday and is likely to be 34 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. According to Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi’s air quality remained in the “satisfactory” category, with an air quality index of 94 on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-eludes-large-parts-of-capital/articleshow/84533111.cms||---
---||Pune||Highest vaccination count in Pune is among 45-plus||PUNE: With over 20 lakh given the first jab, the 45-plus category is currently leading the vaccination charts in the district. According to a report by the district health office (DHO), a total of 20.06 lakh people from the category have been given their first dose; 9.29 lakh have received the second dose. In the 18-44 group, nearly 17 lakh beneficiaries have so far received their first dose. The drive for this group began from May 1. The DHO report said first-dose coverage of the 45-plus group is currently at 51%. Officials said if vaccine supply to the region stays steady, the rest of the 19 lakh beneficiaries can be given their first dose within the next few months. The report added that out of the district's total 96.77 lakh target population, 41.5 lakh have been given their first jab and 12.76 lakh have received their second shot as well. In the district, PMC areas are currently leading in vaccination figures, with 24.08 lakh doses (first and second) administered. Pune Rural has administered 20.45 lakh doses. The PCMC areas are third with 9.72 lakh doses given. Vikas Dhakane, the PCMC additional commissioner, said the civic body is set to introduce a biometric token system at select vaccination sites. He said, “The system will help us manage the crowd of beneficiaries at the sites. We're also considering kiosks to distribute the tokens. These will help avoid clashes during token distribution. We'll have more details ready in the next few days.” An official with the PMC said consistent vaccine supply is the need of the hour. Besides availability, officials also said vaccine hesitancy has been a problem among younger beneficiaries (18-44 group) and health and frontline workers. “We have sensed a bit of hesitancy towards the second dose among healthcare staff, frontline workers and those in the 18-44 group. Hesitancy towards the second shot has been relatively low in the 45-plus and 60-plus groups. A reluctance to get the second dose could be because of the falling Covid-19 cases, something that was seen in January and February as well,” Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), had said in an interview last week. On Sunday, 23,638 people were vaccinated across the district amid limited vaccine availability. For Monday, the PMC and the PCMC have scheduled only Covaxin drives across six and four designated sites, respectively. Officials, within the next few weeks, will also have to prepare for a big chunk of people who're nearing their Covishield second dose date. According to estimates, nearly 50,000 people are expected to complete their 12-week interval (after the first jab) by July 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/highest-vaccination-count-in-district-is-among-45-plus/articleshow/84535365.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Private hospitals’ entry into paid vaccination drive creates rural-urban divide in Pune||PUNE: The entry of private hospitals for paid vaccinations in the state inoculation programme as well as the shortage of doses may have created an urban-rural divide in the district. CoWIN data spanning the fortnight ending on July 14, revealed that the rural areas vaccinated more people than urban centres in Maharashtra for at least eight days. On the other hand, Pune district recorded more vaccinations in the urban areas than the rural during the last fortnight. Health and family welfare ministry data on the urban vs rural vaccination is available CoWIN from June and not since the beginning of the drive. CoWIN data showed that during most days during the fortnight ending July 14, almost 70% of the daily doses administered on an average in Pune were in the urban areas. Officials said while the number of private sites in rural areas was just 7% in comparison to the urban areas of Pune, the vaccine shortage that the government centres have to face every now and then has caused a further fall in doses administered in Pune rural. When the inoculation drive began, Pune rural was witnessing the maximum daily vaccinations per day in comparison to the inoculation in Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad. The situation is now just the opposite. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle told TOI, “Of the total vaccines Pune receives, 43% is allocated to rural areas and the rest to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. The allocation is done on the basis of target population, the number of vaccinations done per day and vaccine wastage. Vaccines provided to the rural areas are so far being utilized at 100%. With a higher number of private players involved in urban areas, more daily doses are administered here.” Dr Deshmukh said in comparison to the urban areas, Pune rural just has around 7% private vaccination sites. An official said the rural areas depended 99% on government vaccine supplies. “During days when government quota exhausts or falls short, people in the rural areas do not have many major private hospitals to fall back on for vaccination,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-hospitals-entry-into-paid-drive-creates-rural-urban-divide/articleshow/84535375.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ahmedabad||‘Noto ki barish’ tantric lure: Man loses Rs 1 crore in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: “If you would give me money, I will drench you in a rain of currency notes” — these words by a tantric from Naranpura mesmerized a man from Satellite, and he ended up losing Rs 1 crore to the crook. This has been stated in a complaint filed with Satellite police on Saturday.  Jignesh Mahorowala, 49, resident of Jay Ma Society near Mansi Circle in Satellite, is the son of a class-2 officer who got retired from the state government. Mahorowala was struggling to find a job or to set up a business, when he was introduced to the accused Hitesh Yagnik, by a common friend in 2010. Yagnik claimed to have supernatural powers. As Yagnik and Mahorowala continued to meet each other, they began discussing about godly powers and tantric rituals to gain money and to fulfil other desires. In 2016, Yagnik allegedly assured Mahorowala that he had the powers to arrange a shower of notes. Yagnik then, planted a small earthen pot at Mahorowala’s house and did some tantric rituals claiming that it will bring good fortune for him, states the FIR. Mahorowala claimed that Yagnik used to do some tantric rituals at his house on regular intervals, and every time he demanded something from him. “On his demand, I gave him three scooters worth around Rs 1.30 lakh and ornaments of my family members worth Rs 4 lakh,” he said. He further said that the accused told him that there was a 50,000-acre parcel of land in Rapar taluka of Kutch, and if he were to buy it, then the land would bring him good fortune. Convinced by the proposal, Mahorowala gave Yagnik around Rs 96 lakh in instalments. He arranged the money from his and his family’s entire savings and even broke his fixed deposits. Meanwhile, Yagnik continued to take money and other goods from Mahorowala in the name of bringing good fortune to him. In March 2021, when Mahorowala did not get possession of the Kutch land and also did not have any turn of luck for better days he asked Yagnik to return his money. After giving assurances, Yagnik went incommunicado. Mahorowala then approached Satellite police and filed a complaint of breach of trust and cheating against Yagnik. Cops said that Yagnik, who earlier stayed in the Naranpura, later shifted to a farmhouse in Pethapur in Gandhinagar. But he is on the run since the complaint was filed against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/noto-ki-barish-tantric-lure-man-loses-rs-1cr/articleshow/84533053.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘India must initiate research on mix & match of vaccines’||World Health Organisation (WHO) chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan on Friday said India could initiate research on heterologous administration (mix and match) of various Covid-19 vaccines to study the breadth and duration of immune responses as well as protection. “In the long term, if effective and safe, such a strategy could help countries manage supply constraints, while providing flexibility in vaccination programmes. It is also possible that combinations have an advantage in stimulating immune responses, but this can only be confirmed through research studies,” Swaminathan told TOI. Two studies recently showed that AstraZeneca vaccine followed by Biontech/Pfizer as the second dose resulted in high levels of neutralising antibodies. “There are studies going on. We need to wait for those, but at the moment, we only have data on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine followed by Biontech/Pfizer, which is encouraging. We need both safety and immunogenicity data on different combinations” she said. India is yet to start any such studies, officials from the Indian Council of Medical Research said. “As of now, we are not carrying any such studies. However, we may explore it in the near future,” senior epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda said. Virologist T Jacob John also agreed with Dr Swaminathan. “Studies have to be done to explore this option. If it helps in eliciting greater immune response, it can help in addressing shortage of vaccines too,” he said. On the Emergency Use Listing for Covaxin, the WHO chief scientist said the organisation was expected to take a decision in this regard in four to six weeks as an independent technical assessment panel was evaluating the proposal and the submitted data. With many countries discussing booster doses, she said there was a need to prioritise doses for countries where healthcare and frontline workers, as well as the elderly and the vulnerable, are yet to receive their first dose. “If countries start administering the booster shots, this would require a huge number of doses. Moreover, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that boosters are definitely needed. What we have observed is persistence of immune responses in the majority of vaccinated individuals for at least 8-9 months. Whether a certain group of people will eventually need boosters is something we need to understand through cohort follow up studies,” she said. She said the need for boosters may also differ by vaccine type since they are made using different technologies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-india-must-initiate-research-on-mix-match-of-vaccines/articleshow/84537215.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Dehradun||Reducing infant & maternal mortality rates, elimination of TB and fight against non-communicable diseases our priority: Dhan Singh Rawat||Earlier this month, Dhan Singh Rawat took charge as Uttarakhand's first dedicated health minister in four years. In a conversation with Shivani Azad, Rawat spoke extensively on his priorities, action plan for the likely third Covid-19 wave and more. Excerpts:- What are your priorities for the health sector in Uttarakhand? Uttarakhand is a state with a sparse population, difficult terrain and disaster-prone areas. Hence, taking primary, preventive and promotive health services in outreach regions is our priority. We will ensure that people get 24x7 treatment for small injuries and the facility for screening of non-critical diseases at their nearest health facility. To provide primary care, we are strengthening health & wellness centres. Last year, our government recruited a large number of doctors. Today, 2,235 positions are filled against the 2,735 sanctioned posts of doctors. Malnutrition and anemia also remain areas of concern. We are committed to reducing out-of-pocket health expenditure by making health services accessible and affordable to the people of Uttarakhand. What do you think are the top three illnesses prevailing in Uttarakhand. How do you plan to tackle them? Preventing fatalities of new mothers and newborns is a core issue for us. In Uttarakhand, 70% of institutional deliveries take place in government health facilities and 30% of deliveries are conducted at home by unskilled birth attendants (dai). We have found out that most of the fatalities occur due to the negligence and ignorance of pregnant women and their spouses. In a bid to reduce the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the maternal mortality rate (MMR), we will adhere to the strategy of increasing institutional deliveries. To this end, we are strengthening women hospitals, first referral units & delivery points in the state. Also, several local medical officers and additional ANMs will be recruited in the coming months. The elimination of tuberculosis is also our priority as it is a major public health issue in the rural and urban slums of Uttarakhand. Our third priority is to fight against non-communicable diseases like cancer, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular ailments. We are also in the process of establishing an advanced research centre and cancer institute in Uttarakhand. After this facility becomes functional, patients will not need to go outside the state to access treatment services. Similarly, we are planning to develop a dedicated institution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. What is the action plan for the likely third Covid-19 wave? At present, we are focussing on providing free Covid-19 vaccination to all adults. Considering the possibility of the third wave of Covid-19, we are making efforts to boost the immunity of our children by providing them with micronutrients. We are prepared for the likely third wave and all necessary arrangements have been made. In my very first meeting as the state health minister, the preparedness of the likely third wave was discussed with senior officers. Necessary guidelines, standard treatment methods and referral protocols have been finalised; doctors, paramedics and other staff have been trained, and beds, paediatric ICUs, NICUs, oxygen supply, oxygen beds and ambulances have been arranged. How do you plan to take health services to the remote and far-flung areas? We are in the process of re-organising our health infrastructure as per Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) norms. We will upgrade nearly 322 state allopathic dispensaries to Primary Health Centre Type-A. This exercise will facilitate the uniform posting of doctors, paramedical staff, ambulance services and help in uniform supply of drugs, equipment and other logistic arrangements. Additional funds and uniform resource allocation from central and state governments under IPHS will certainly improve the health services in far-flung hills. The helicopter ambulance services have not taken off very well in Uttarakhand. How do you plan to bring the service on track? There is no big hurdle in regard to helicopter ambulance services. The state government has twice initiated the procurement process for helicopter ambulances through the National Health Mission (NHM). However, there were certain technical issues raised by the prospective bidders regarding the utilisation of unused hours of flying. Certainly, no government can afford to pay for services of zero utility; thus, the tender deal could not be finalised. Anyway, we are again hiring the services of helicopter ambulances. NHM has already developed the proposal and the procurement process will start soon. Pregnant women are still taken to medical facilities in cots and chairs in the hills. This often leads to the death of the mother and the child. Is there a way out to overcome this challenge? It is upsetting that pregnant women are not going for early registration at their nearest health facilities to avail the benefits of our free delivery scheme. Ignorance of to-be parents is a big challenge. We plan to conduct a regular maternal death audit in each such case so that the factual reasons are flagged and a strategy can be framed. So far, the NHM has provided 2,983 doli/palki (palanquins) in the hill districts to ferry pregnant women from their homes to motorable roads or nearest health facilities. Besides, a lack of information about the expected delivery date and disconnect with ASHA and ANM during pregnancy are some of the overlooked reasons which need to be resolved in consultation with block-level health functionaries. Why has the state government not removed Haridwar district health officials to ensure a fair probe in the alleged Kumbh testing scam? The Kumbh testing scam was unearthed by CMO Haridwar and district officials themselves. They were the ones who complained against the labs/culprits in question. Meanwhile, the state government has constituted an SIT to probe the matter. In these circumstances, there is no point removing the district officials. Do you intend to revise the stipend of MBBS interns? They have been protesting for quite some time now. The stipend of the MBBS interns in state medical colleges has been increased from Rs 7,500 to Rs 17,000. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has approved the increase. We appreciate the contribution of medical practitioners in the fight against Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/reducing-infant-maternal-mortality-rates-elimination-of-tb-and-fight-against-non-communicable-diseases-our-priority-dhan-singh-rawat/articleshow/84531373.cms||---

Vaccine transportation was set to increase in the coming months. “With June witnessing the largest number of Covishield vaccines getting transported from the Pune airport, the same is expected to increase. While the airport is in a position to manage more transportation, we are still awaiting a nod for a change of the present cargo hold area,” an airport official said. India began its vaccination drive against Covid-19 from January and Covishield was manufactured by the Pune-based SII, which was transported to several states via air and by road. Sources said with SII set to manufacture the Russian Sputnik-V from September, the transportation would increase. “The airport will continue providing help for vaccine transportation,”another airport official said. “This month, till now, over 3 crore doses of the vaccine were transported from Pune airport. With almost a fortnight remaining for the month to end, we are looking at the highest vaccine transportation in July this year,”another airport source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-airport-dispatches-over-15-crore-covishield-jabs/articleshow/84535402.cms||Joy Sengupta

Ahmedabad Police have acquired 50 drones with high-definition cameras which will be deployed for keeping an eye on the narrowest lanes, aiding pursuits, and spotting gambling and liquor dens. Top sources in Gujarat Police said that the drones were used in a pilot project for the 144th Rath Yatra. The advantages afforded by the drones persuaded police to use the tech as a matter of routine. “The drones will be used for a range of purposes. For example, they can be employed in hot pursuits,” a Gujarat Police officer said. The drones will make it unnecessary for the cops to do the actual chasing in some cases. “Police will silently fly the drone and determine the hideout,” the officer said. He said as drones can’t be heard, criminals will not even know that they are being watched. It is difficult for the cops to patrol some Walled City areas. Such sites will be monitored by the drones. “These drones can surveil sensitive places and the feed will be examined by the cops in the control room,” the officer said. “So, crime can be prevented and criminals can be nabbed before they manage to flee.” On the question of privacy, a senior Gujarat Police officer said, “People who do not commit crimes should not worry about that.” 10,000 body cameras for copsAhmedabad: Gujarat Police have finally procured about 10,000 body cameras and will start using them in two months, said an officer. “The cameras will first be used by Ahmedabad traffic police and later by cops during patrolling and bandobusts,” the officer said. These body cameras will have the audio-visual feature so that any incident can be recorded and a fair evaluation carried out, said the officer. Police had decided to make the constabulary and traffic cops wear body cameras to assess incidents and assign blame in cases of friction between cops and citizens. Cases of quarrels between cops and the public have surged during the enforcement of Covid safety protocols, the lockdown, and curfews. The proposal to acquire body cameras was made two years ago, but the green signal was received only this March. The programme will be implemented in phases to cover the entire force. Of the 1 lakh Gujarat Police personnel, about 80,000 constables will eventually wear body cameras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/50-drones-unblinking-big-brother/articleshow/84533129.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The man alleged that he spent Rs 35 lakh to send his wife abroad with assurance that she would call him there on a spouse visa. However, she stopped answering his calls even. The FIR has been lodged on the complaint of Jaswinder Singh of Mundian Kalan against his wife Sukhvir Kaur of Malerkotla. Jaswinder Singh stated that he wanted to go abroad and had come in contact with Sukhvir Kaur and her family. The accused said if he would bear her travel expenses she would take him to Canada on a spouse Visa. Harpreet Singh said he had spent Rs 35 lakh on the accused for arranging visa, and air ticket. They had solemnised the marriage on August 23, 2017. One week after the marriage, Sukhvir Kaur had gone to Canada. In December 2017, she had visited her parent’s house for one month and gone back. After that, she stopped talking to him. According to their mutual agreement the accused had to arrange a spouse visa for him, but she did not. He had made a complaint to the police on August 28, 2020.

Raina’s uncle, Ashok Kumar, was killed and four people of his family injured during the robbery in Tharial village on August 19 last year. Robbers had barged into the house and beaten up the family with sticks before decamping with cash and valuables. While Kumar, a Border Security Force (BSF) contractor, had died on the spot, four others were injured. After the incident, Raina had withdrawn out of IPL 2020 and even implored Punjab CM Amarinder Singh to catch the accused. A Special Investigation Team was formed in Punjab and 11 accused have been arrested so far. According to police, the robbery was carried out by an inter-state gang of robbers belonging to the Chaimaar tribe from UP. “Chajju Chaimaar who planned the robbery hails from Bahedi in Bareilly. He had gone into hiding in Hyderabad after committing the crime,” STF in charge Ajay Pal Singh told TOI. Singh said the team acted on a tip-off that the accused was hiding in his native village of Pachpeda in Bahedi. “We alerted Punjab police and after confirming the man’s identity, a joint team raided the village on Sunday morning. The accused was handed over to Punjab police,” he said. Singh added that during questioning, the accused had revealed that women members of the gang had conducted a recce of the house before the robbery. “They had entered the house to sell plants and gathered information that helped the gang plan the robbery. The modus operandi of the gang is to beat up their victims mercilessly so they don’t shout for help. The gang members dispersed after the robbery to different areas in Punjab as well as other states.” Three members of the gang are still on the run. After the crime, an FIR was registered against unidentified people at Shahpur Kandi police station in Pathankot under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with weapons), 149 (offence committed in prosecution of common object), 458 (house breaking), 459 (grievous injury due to house breaking) and 460 (causing death due to house breaking). Two more sections — 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) — were later added to the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/mastermind-behind-robbery-at-suresh-rainas-uncles-house-in-punjab-held-in-up-after-yr-long-chase/articleshow/84531433.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Lucknow||From bamboo pole & sandy mat to nat’lgold, UP vaulter scales new heights||Lucknow: When pole vaulting caught the fancy of a 15-year-old boy during a school-level athletic meet in a village in Ghazipur district way back in 2015, the firm resolve to make a mark for himself was his only guiding force. As the availability of fibre poles and vault pit was a far cry, Shekhar Kumar Pandey, a poor farmer’s son, used bamboo sticks as poles and started practising on the banks of the Ganga where the sand served as vault pit and mat for him. To the surprise of many, Shekhar (now 21) bagged the gold medal in district-level championship after a week’s practice without any guidance. “When I first saw pole vaulting, I found it very easy as I was used to jumping over small rivulets using bamboo sticks. I won a medal at district-level without any proper training which boosted my confidence,” said Shekhar, who recently bagged a gold medal in the National Inter-State Athletics Championship in Patiala (Punjab) in June-end. “Though I lived in Mirzapur, I studied at Haridwar Rai College in Chandauli. My teachers supported me in my pursuit and my physical training instructor, Anand Singh, guided me well,” said Shekhar, who is currently pursuing BA (second year). On the insistence of a friend, Shekhar moved to Varanasi and joined Dr Sampoornanand Stadium. “It was in Varanasi that I got to know about the technical aspects of the sport and started practice. My senior, Rakshit Kumar, gave me his fibre pole for practice. This was the first time when I saw a fibre pole,” he recalled. At the stadium, his coach, Rajendra Singh, trained him only for 15 days but changed his life by introducing him to national coach Prabhash Chandra Tyagi, who helped Shekhar make a mark in the national arena. “Shekhar is extremely talented and he would have done much better had the coronavirus pandemic not affected his training. He comes from a poor family and did not have resources. I asked PC Tyagi to arrange for his stay and food at CISF camp,” said Singh. Speaking about Shekhar’s brilliant performance in the national event, his coach PC Tyagi said: “He is very talented. The way Shekhar performed despite the hindrance in training and practice due to the coronavirus pandemic is commendable. If he gets proper training and facilities, he will do well in international events too.” Asked about the impact of pandemic on his practice, Shekhar said though Covid restrictions came as a setback, his experience of training with bamboo sticks on the river banks again came in handy when all stadiums and sports activities came to a halt. “Though it is no match to proper training, I again took up bamboo sticks for practice during the first wave of the pandemic. Coach Rustam Khan in Prayagraj, now posted in Jaunpur, later arranged facilities for practice during lockdown,” he said. Shekhar’s achievements include silver medals in School National Games (2016-17), Youth National Championship (2018), Gujarat, and Junior National Championship (2018) in Ranchi. He also won a bronze medal in Under-20 Junior National Championship in Guntur (2019) and a silver medal in Khelo India in January 2020 in Guwahati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/from-bamboo-pole-sandy-mat-to-natlgold-up-vaulter-scales-new-heights/articleshow/84513249.cms||Fazal Khan

---||Goa||Local bodies drag feet on action against illegal buildings near Goa airport||PANAJI: Despite the high court of Bombay at Goa directing the Indian Navy and Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to initiate action against unauthorised constructions around the Goa International Airport within nine months, action against the illegal structures has been stalled. Taking serious cognisance of the delay, the high court has said that it will “consider whether any action under the Contempt of Courts Act is necessary”. A local resident has moved contempt proceedings against the Indian Navy and other officials for failure to act against the illegal structures. In February 2020, the high court asked the Indian Navy and the DGCA to act against the unauthorised structures within nine months and file a compliance report by March 2021. The court had also issued directions to DGCA, South Goa collector, Chicalim panchayat and MPDA to ensure that unauthorised constructions are not allowed in the proximity of the Goa International Airport. A joint survey conducted by the Mormugao Planning and Development Authority, Indian Navy and other government bodies in survey no. 60/2 identified at least 75 unauthorised homes, officials told TOI. The court had asked to initiate action against unauthorised buildings erected by Venture Building Dreams in survey No. 60/2 of Chicalim. Venture Building Dreams is owned by transport minister Mauvin Godinho’s close aide Kamla Prasad Yadav, who is also Chicalim deputy sarpanch. The Indian Navy had asked the MPDA and the Chicalim panchayat for details of the illegal structures, but the two bodies have ignored the request. There are unauthorised buildings in survey numbers 63/5 and 63/8 too. “The area has around 75 houses, but MPDA said that records of only two buildings are available with them,” a government official said.TOI has learnt that the panchayat and other state government authorities have failed to provide the necessary details of the residential buildings to the DGCA and the Navy. When TOI contacted the Indian Navy, the navy in a statement said a reply will be filed in the court by July 26. The Union civil aviation ministry’s rules, issued in 2015, restrict the height of buildings within a 20km radius of an aerodrome. The rules require builders and other to obtain an NOC from the Indian Navy for construction in close proximity of the runway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/action-against-illegal-bldgs-around-airport-stalled-as-local-authorities-drag-feet/articleshow/84535468.cms||Newton Sequeira

Harsh Raval, who works with an information technology firm in Pune, said in his FIR that he went to a private hospital in the Jivraj Park area to consult a doctor for his ailing mother. When he was returning from the hospital at around 2pm on Saturday and was moving from an underpass near Suvidha Crossroads in Paldi, a woman came from the wrong side and hit her car on the left side of Raval’s car. She did not stop there even after she saw Raval’s car got damaged and even if the complainant asked her to stop, she fled from there, mentioned the FIR. Raval said that she stopped at a traffic signal at Parimal Crossroads and he found her there, and asked her again why she drove so rashly and hit his car. As the signal showed green light, Raval began driving his car, and after few seconds, he found the woman was following him. He alleged that she again hit his car from behind and damaged his car. Raval got down from his car and tried to stop the woman and then called up police control room. Meanwhile, the woman called up her friends who arrived and allegedly misbehaved with Raval and his ailing mother. A team of police reached there and Raval went with them to N division traffic police and filed a complaint of causing damage by negligent driving against the woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-road-rage-woman-driver-hits-mans-car-twice/articleshow/84533172.cms||---

The accused have been identified as Shubham Khandelwal from Rohini and Pulkit from Sonipat. Khandelwal was found to be involved in another case lodged in Gurgaon. Police said the accused had created a firm with fake credentials and a non-existing entity in the name of Sanjay Garg to supply invoices and obtain GST credits from the purchases. The accused would allegedly approach purchasers through agents. A case was registered following a complaint from the department of trade and taxes, Delhi, which alleged that income tax credits of around Rs 42 crores had been claimed by a firm. The accused were held on the basis of technical surveillance. The cops have cautioned traders and businessmen to not deal with fraud firms working virtually without any existing proper office. “Obtaining vouchers without any actual delivery of goods may lead them in serious legal complications. Any complaint in this regard may be made online to cp.balajisrivastava@delhipolice.gov.in,” additional CP (EOW) RK Singh said.

---||India||India needs to study Covid vaccine mix & match: WHO expert||PUNE: World Health Organisation (WHO) chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan on Friday said India could initiate research on heterologous administration (mix and match) of various Covid-19 vaccines to study the breadth and duration of immune responses as well as protection. “In the long term, if effective and safe, such a strategy could help countries manage supply constraints, while providing flexibility in vaccination programmes. It is also possible that combinations have an advantage in stimulating immune responses, but this can only be confirmed through research studies,” Swaminathan told TOI. Two studies recently demonstrated that the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by the Biontech/Pfizer as the second dose resulted in high levels of neutralizing antibodies. “There are studies going on. We need to wait for those, but at the moment we only have data on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine followed by Biontech/Pfizer, which is encouraging. We need both safety and immunogenicity data on different combinations” she said. India is yet to start any studies in this regard, officials from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said. “As of now, we are not carrying any such studies. However, we may explore it in the near future,” senior epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda said. Eminent virologist T Jacob John also agreed with Dr Swaminathan. “Studies have to be done to explore this option. If it helps in eliciting greater immune response, it can help in addressing shortage of vaccines too,” he said. On the Emergency Use Listing for Covaxin, the WHO chief scientist said the organisation was expected to take a decision in this regard in four to six weeks as an independent technical assessment panel was evaluating the proposal and the submitted data. With many countries discussing booster doses, she said there was a need to prioritise doses for countries where healthcare and frontline workers, as well as the elderly and the vulnerable, are yet to receive their first dose. “If countries start administering the booster shots, this would require a huge number of doses. Moreover, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that boosters are definitely needed. What we have observed is persistence of immune responses in the majority of vaccinated individuals for at least 8-9 months. Whether a certain group of people will eventually need boosters is something we need to understand through cohort follow up studies,” she said. She said the need for boosters may also differ by vaccine type since they are made using different technologies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-needs-to-study-covid-vaccine-mix-match-who-expert/articleshow/84535472.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The attack took place near Belha village in Lakhimpur Kheri district near Dudhwa forest. In the past two months, four people have fallen prey to crocodiles in the region covered by the river and its canals. On June 26, a farmer was killed when he was grazing cattle in Kheri’s Singahi area. On May 22, a man was killed in the Palia area, while two men were killed by crocodiles in neighbouring Pilibhit district. The critically injured guard was rushed to a government hospital, where he was referred to a higher medical facility in Lucknow. According to the forest department sources, Eshwardeen, a marginal farmer who also works as a watchman, was caught by a giant crocodile lying in wait for prey in the Sharda river canal near Nighasan range of Dudhwa forest. The watchman shouted for help as the reptile caught him and began to drag him into the water. Some six-seven farmers rushed to rescue him. They pelted stones at the crocodile and a few struck it with batons. After a struggle of over 15 minutes, Eshwardeen was rescued but his left leg was almost ripped off. By that time, he had lost consciousness and suffered excessive blood loss. He was taken to hospital, the sources added. Harkesh, a resident of Belha village, said, “The sight was terrifying as a giant mugger over three metres long, had Eshardeen’s leg between its jaws and was trying to drag him into the water. The crocodile didn’t let go of our man till we battered it with batons.” Anil Patel, divisional forest officer, told TOI, “The victim is undergoing treatment at the hospital. It is a natural canal of river Sharda that passes through forest.. We are taking care of Eshwardeen’s treatment. He will be eligible for compensation of up to Rs 2 lakh in case of permanent disability. The locals have been warned to exercise extreme caution when near the river or the canals, especially during the monsoon when there is heavy flow of water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/giant-croc-rips-mans-leg-off-near-dudhwa-forest/articleshow/84531450.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||6-18 age group serosurvey suggests schools, colleges can reopen in Pune||PUNE: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 70% of surveyed children and teenagers in the 6-18 age group suggests that schools and colleges can safely reopen even in the urban areas of the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), experts have said. Offline lessons in “Covid-free villages”, for Classes 8 to 12, resumed from July 15. But authorities in urban areas continue to be cautious. Public health experts, however, said the 70% detection by the June PMR serosurvey proves shutting of schools doesn’t necessarily shield children from Covid-19. An earlier serosurvey, in September last year, had not included children aged below 12. But in the 12-18 age bracket, antibody detection rate was at nearly 36%. Ten months later, the June serosurvey (which had included children below 12) found the rate was 70% in the 6-18 age bracket. Experts said the rise actually supports reopening of educational institutions as it matches high seroprevalence trends seen in adults. “This indicates that closing educational institutions does not shelter children from infection. One cannot separate children and adults in crowded Indian homes,” said senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee, one of the key investigators of seroprevalence studies in the PMR. “Secondly, opening educational institutions will not drive community transmission as seropositivity levels are already high in the population,” he added. As for a third wave, experts have said that it’s extremely unlikely the surge will “exclusively” affect children. The Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) said in May this year that children are less affected due to “lesser expression of specific receptors to which this virus binds to enter the host”. The IAP, importantly, added that almost 90% of infections in children are mild or asymptomatic. "Incidence of severe disease is not high in children," it said. "We are not protecting young people by closing schools. The closures are causing education loss, besides affecting the physical and mental health of young people," Banerjee said. The June serosurvey - PMR's largest yet - found that 8,207 (81%) of 10,082 residents had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in their blood. It studied residents of slums, tenements and apartments across the eight zones of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) between June 16 and June 26. A growing body of evidence has shown that schools can be reopened safely. But that hasn’t quelled debate over whether they should be open and, if so, what steps should be taken to limit Covid transmission. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had also said schools could reopen safely without driving up community spread or putting teachers and students at risk, as long as steps were being taken to mitigate transmission. "Such advisories and seroprevalence studies should calm the anxiety among parents, wards and school staff," Banerjee said. In fact, experts have said that if schools and colleges reopen when the curve is stable (like it is now in Pune), there are high chances of achieving herd immunity. "Children and young adults have a fresh immunity, which makes them better at fighting infections. It has a multiplier effect - if we develop it, we can protect many people," said Delhi-based epidemiologist Sanjay Rai of All India Institute Of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-18-gp-serosurvey-suggests-schools-colleges-can-reopen/articleshow/84535508.cms||Umesh Isalkar

But due to inhibitions in discussing such offences with men, women previously avoided approaching the police. This is now set to change. For the first time, the cyber cell will have a ‘women only’ division. Soon, the city police will set up two police stations to handle cyber offences against women. One of the women cyber cells is expected to come up on the first floor at Madhupura Mahila police station. A budget for buying basic equipment and furniture has has been sanctioned. A senior police officer told TOI that it will take at least a year before the cyber cell’s women’s division becomes active. The initiative will be held under the Nirbhaya project. This has been so designed, because in many cases women do not come forward to lodge their complaints, especially in case of sexual offences and stalking. There will be two police stations for cyber offences against women, which include one in the eastern part and another in the western part of the city. “We had proposed for the cyber women police stations under the Nirbhaya project, for which buildings have been identified, and we have been training women cops to inquire into the cyber cases pertaining to women victims,” said a Gujarat police officer. He said that women are often targets of cyber stalking, snooping, pictures and video morphing where they are projected in a bad light. “There are ‘n’ number of cases were women’s obscene pictures and videos with vulgar remarks are posted by accused persons, who are either jilted lovers or men with whom the victims broke up in past,” said the officer. In such cases, the women hesitate interact with male police personnel. So, we have decided to deploy women cops, he said. “For such cases, we have decided to dedicate cyber women police stations where women can narrate their ordeals before women cops,” said the officer. The strength of the cyber women police stations are yet to be decided, but it will be done in the lines of two Mahila (women) police stations (east and west) in the city where each police station has one inspector monitored by an ACP of both the police stations, said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/special-womens-cyber-cell-for-female-victims-in-city/articleshow/84533262.cms||---

With 3,336 more people taking the second jab, the number of people who are now fully immunised against Covid reached 1,96,762 on Sunday. With 21 per cent of the targeted recipients taking the first dose, their number has surged to 8,39,101. Health officials have set a target of administering Covid vaccine to around 39.87 lakh people, including 27 lakh recipients aged between 18 and 44 and 12.87 lakh above 45 years. As per the latest statistics of the health department, 10,35,863 Covid shots have been given to beneficiaries of all age groups in the district till July 18. While 8,39,101 people have taken the first dose, 1,96,762 recipients have received the second shot. A total of 11,180 vaccine shots were administered to people of all age groups in the past 24 hours, which included 7,844 recipients of the first dose and 3,336 of the second shot. District immunisation officer (DIO) and additional chief medical officer Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, that “Department has chalked out a strategy to ramp up vaccination drive in the district and are making sincere efforts to increase the number of recipients in urban, semi urban and rural areas. We will be taking up vaccination at 44 sites from Monday including 21 sites in rural areas and 23 sites in urban areas.” He said vaccination exercise will be carried out at all the 20 community health centres and one urban CHC in the district.

Nilesh Mestri had taken an appointment via CoWin but couldn’t go to the hospital due to work commitments. He is now concerned that he will miss his vaccine shot altogether as the certificate has already been generated. The Charkop police have called the hospital management for an enquiry. Mestri, a Virar resident, found a slot on CoWin at Chavan Hospital in Dahanukarwadi, Kandivali West, for July 15. “I missed the appointment but a certificate had already been generated online,” Mestri told TOI. “If Mestri did not visit the hospital, how have details appeared on his vaccine certificate? There must be a thorough probe,” said MNS party worker Dinesh Salvi, who helped him lodge a written complaint. The police have not yet registered an FIR. “The hospital responded that they are busy with doorstep vaccinations and will appear thereafter,” said a senior cop. Attempts to contact the hospital proved futile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-approaches-charkop-cops-as-he-misses-covid-jab-but-gets-cert/articleshow/84537317.cms||---
---||Nagpur||42 overhead tanks planned, NMC fails to get land for 26||Nagpur: Despite planning to construct 42 elevated storage reservoirs (ESRs) or overhead water tanks, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will be able construct only 16. The reason: The civic body has failed to acquire land and hand it over for the construction. As a result, water woes of residents in many localities are likely to continue. Against its plan to construct 42 ESRs and one ground storage reservoir, Wapcos — the firm entrusted with the job of constructing overhead tanks — has agreed to construct only 17. Of these, the site selected for the construction of one ESR at Godhni has failed in the soil strata test. Public health engineering department said the NMC will construct only 16 ESRs through Wapcos. The NMC has received Rs272.02 crore from the central government under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme for strengthening water supply system in the city. The 16 ESRs include five under Nehru Nagar zone, two including twin type in Hanuman Nagar zone, one each under Mangalwari zone, Pratap Nagar, Khamla, Gayatri Nagar, Nara, Nari-2, Indora, Bharatwada and Wanjari Nagar. The areas which may face water crisis include Laxmi Nagar, Binaki, Chinchbhuvan, Bastarwari, Jaripatka, Dhantoli, Boriapura, Zingabai Takli and Ram Nagar. A senior official from the public health engineering department told TOI that due to opposition from the residents and some government agencies to spare land, the civic body had to drop the plan to construct more ESRs. Even Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) had refused to spare land on its premises for constructing one ESR, said the official. A residents’ group had also approached the high court against the civic body’s plan to construct ESRs in public spaces like gardens and playgrounds. With the growing population, water crisis is inevitable, and residents of these localities will definitely face problems, admitted the officer. The official pointed out that considering the city’s growing population, the NMC had prepared a detailed project report (DPR) for constructing the ESRs in 2015-16. The delay in awarding the work also escalated the construction cost of five ESRs. Even Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran’s schedule of rates clarified that the construction cost has increased significantly. Now, the NMC will have to spend an additional Rs75.90 crore from its pocket as the central government will not provide additional funds for the ESR construction. The department has submitted a proposal to be taken up in the general body meeting convened by mayor Dayashankar Tiwari on July 22. As per the proposal, construction of 11 ESRs is in progress and the department needs nod of the House for additional Rs75.90 crore funding. Already in place 75 | Overhead and ground storage reservoirs 30 | ESR command areas converted into 24x7 IN PIPELINE 11 | Work in progress 5 | Nod sought for additional funds||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/42-overhead-tanks-planned-nmc-fails-to-get-land-for-26/articleshow/84533270.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three families lose 10 members in their sleep in Vikhroli crash||MUMBAI: Ten people were killed in their sleep and one was injured after illegal slum hutments located at a height of 500 ft on a hill at LBS Marg, Vikhroli (West), crashed down in a landslide following extremely heavy rainfall on Sunday. Four of the deceased were women, and the males included two boys aged 11 and 19. The deaths occurred in three families. Data from the civic automatic weather station showed that 238 mm of rainfall was recorded in Vikhroli between 11 am on Saturday and 7 am on Sunday. Officials said that the entire Surya Nagar slum in Vikhroli (West) is home to around 35,000 people and is illegal as it is situated on collector’s land. The landslide occurred around 2.40 am on Sunday as the downpour refused to die down, three hours after it had begun in its latest episode. Rainwater started accumulating in the area and found no escape. While locals said that the hill’s retaining wall had given way, BMC officials said they found the retaining wall to be intact. A senior civic official at the site told TOI that his team found that the homes had been built illegally and even over nullahs that are meant to drain rainwater. Suresh Gupta, a local, said, “The retaining wall came crashing down but BMC is refusing to accept this. We locals had no place to go and hence chose to stay here. I saw that rescue operations were proving to be difficult at there was no space for moving the debris.” At the crash site, rescuers found it difficult to move bodies or even remove debris as the slum pocket was highly congested. Rescuers had to stand in a chain so that they could move bodies and debris from one to the other. Many locals pitched in to help with the rescue operations. The circumstances were extremely trying, said one. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office tweeted that Rs 2 lakh will be given to the next of kin of each person deceased (in wall collapses in Mumbai) from the PM’s National Relief Fund and Rs 50,000 will be given to each injured person. Following the Vikhroli incident, the BMC decided to shift around 40 locals to civic-run schools temporarily. Of them, 30 are from the Vikhroli landslide zone and the remaining 10 from Bhandup.  Deputy municipal commissioner Devidas Kshirsagar said, “In April, an inspection of the area was held and notices were issued informing locals that they were staying on landslide-prone areas. They were asked to vacate. We also stuck banners in the area.” State environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray, who visited the site, said, “We have been talking about climate change and we can see how since the past few years we have been witnessing extreme rainfall in brief periods, which makes it even more difficult for the administration to handle.” Ward officials said that municipal schools were identified and locals asked to shift, but no heed was paid to such directions. But some say that such civic efforts need to be better organised and in a more convincing way so that tragedies can be averted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-families-lose-10-members-in-their-sleep-in-vikhroli-crash/articleshow/84535546.cms||Richa Pinto

However, when Special Cell caught the suspect after shooting him in the leg at Chhatarpur, it turned out that he was from Langarpuria’s rival gang led by Kapil Sangwan, who is reportedly based out of India. DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha said the suspect, Pawan alias David (21), was a resident of Mahendergarh, Haryana. “He was nabbed after a brief exchange of fire with a team led by inspectors Sunil Rajain and Ravinder Joshi during which he sustained gunshot injury in his left leg,” he added. For the past few months, police were receiving information that Sangwan’s gang members had been demanding protection money from businessmen and grabbing land in the bordering areas of Delhi. The businessman got the extortion call on July 6 and an FIR was registered at Hauz Khas police station. The cell got a tip-off that the criminal who made the call would come to Chhatarpur to conduct a recce and fire at the businessman’s house to scare him into paying money. “The accused and his associate were spotted riding a bike on Satbari Road. Cops flagged them down and asked them to surrender. However, Pawan tried to flee by firing at the team,” Kushwaha said. The cops shot back and Pawan fell down. The other accused, Manjeet Singh, did not resist arrest and was taken into custody unharmed. Pawan was taken to Safdarjung Hospital for treatment. Loaded pistols were found on both suspects. An FIR of attacking policemen on duty and attempt to murder was registered against them. The bike was seized. During interrogation, Pawan said he was working on the instructions of Sangwan, who had planned to use his rival’s name in the extortion bid to implicate him and get him arrested. However, the call details led to the identification of the real culprit. Singh disclosed that he joined the gang as he was fascinated by the flashy videos of Sangwan and his associates posted on Facebook. The mobile phone used to make the call has been seized. Pawan was found involved in multiple cases of robbery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/criminal-out-to-extort-bizman-held-after-shootout/articleshow/84533295.cms||---

He said followers of the Hindutva ideology, who thought that Hindus should not adopt family planning and should give birth to four to five children to keep pace with an increasing Muslim population, are now proposing a bill on population control. Raut, a Rajya Sabha member and the executive editor of ‘Saamna’, said overpopulation has led to anarchy all around, with problems ranging from inflation to unemployment. He said the Uttar Pradesh government was unable to provide health and education to the people and was now making an attempt to control the population. At the same time, he said one should welcome Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s steps to control population. “If Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar opposes the draft bill for population control, the BJP should withdraw support to the Nitish government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-for-population-control-but-doubts-intent-of-up-bill/articleshow/84537774.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Narco at DFS proves accused innocent||Ahmedabad: Recently a 28-year-old youth was awarded life imprisonment for rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl near Shimla in Himachal Pradesh in 2017. The investigation by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) – probing the case after Himachal Pradesh high court’s order – got hold of the accused after six earlier suspects, rounded up by the local police, were not found involved in the heinous crime. Of these five – one of the suspects died in police custody. The suspects were brought to the Directorate of Forensic Sciences (DFS) in Gandhinagar by CBI officials for polygraph, brain mapping and narco analysis four years ago after none of the evidences collected from the crime scene could be tied to the suspects. Sources close to the development said that the five did not show any experiential knowledge of the crime or acquaintance with the victim. The exhibits showed to them did not evoke any response from the suspects, or any narrative during the narco analysis did not show their presence at the crime scene. Sources said that it was the last straw for the investigators to stop pursuing the suspects and look into another direction. The findings were cemented with central FSL report that indicated that the DNA samples found from the victim did not match any of the suspects. The investigators from CBI later linked a local woodcutter, identified as Anil Kumar alias Nilu, to the crime through forensic evidences. The case was challenging for the agency as there were no eyewitnesses at Kotkhali area where the crime took place, no traces whatsoever that can lead to the accused, and little help from the locals due to the high-profile case. The DNA profiling by CFSL played a major role that indicated a possible match to Kangra district, eventually leading to the accused. The girl was strangled to the death after rape and her body was left in a ditch, about 100 meters below the road. “We annually get over 10 cases of narco analysis and over 30 for other forensic psychology tests from other states. Often, it’s a last-ditch effort for the agencies as the results are not admissible in the court. But often it can provide a new direction for the investigators to pursue,” said a senior DFS official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/narco-at-dfs-proves-accused-innocent/articleshow/84533344.cms||Parth Shastri

The Punjab-based suspect has been identified as Ramandeep Singh (29), who is stated to be the deputy of one of the kingpins of the cartel based in Portugal. Singh was coordinating with the India-based members, including the two men arrested earlier by the cell. “The accused was nabbed from Amritsar on July 17 night. He was involved in supplying the contraband along with accused Gurpreet Singh, already in custody,” a senior officer said. The suspect brought on remand from Mumbai have been identified as Prabhjit Singh, Hardev Singh and Manjeet. They were arrested by DRI in a case of recovery of 293kg heroin. The trio are linked to the cartel busted by Delhi Police last week in which 354kg heroin worth Rs 2,500 crore was seized. Special Cell had earlier arrested four suspects, identified as Rizwan Kashmiri, Hazrat Ali, Gurpreet Singh and Gurjot Singh. Gurpreet and Gurjot were arrested from a rented accommodation at NSG Vihar in Faridabad’s Sector 65 and told the cops that they used to work for a Portugal-based handler named Navpreet Singh. Gurpreet had met him when the two were lodged in Kapurthala Jail in another drugs case. Navpreet coordinates with other kingpins in Afghanistan, Iran and Canada. The network is spread across several countries with multiple modules active in India to carry out narco-terrorism activities in the country, police said. “The drug money is wired to foreign countries from where they are routed back to different channels for conducting terrorist activities,” a source claimed. The cartel, the probe has revealed, was importing opium in the garb of legitimate exports like talc stone, gypsum powder and basil seeds, packed in material like gunny bags, cartons etc. It was then transported in containers to Chabahar port in Iran. From there, the consignments containing the contraband were shipped to JNPT Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Mumbai. The material was then separated from legitimate export items and sent to makeshift factories. Special chemical experts from Afghanistan were roped in to process the contraband and turn it into pure and saleable heroin. These chemicals experts operated from makeshift factories in different states, the biggest of them being in Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh. The heroin is then delivered to Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Jammu & Kashmir and various other states using different supply chains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-arrest-in-citys-biggest-drugs-seizure-three-more-suspects-brought-in-from-mumbai/articleshow/84533428.cms||Raj Shekhar

While the State Cancer Institute still does not have its own blood bank, it is arranged from a storage facility available at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), among other health institutions. Advocacy group ‘Movement for Peace and Justice for Welfare’, in a memorandum submitted to the state government and health authorities concerned, have demanded a dedicated blood-storage capacity at the cancer institute. “Certain elements from the State Cancer Institute often demand additional money to arrange the blood from GMCH. The gratification amount ranges from Rs 100 to Rs 500 per bottle sought to compensate for “fuel or conveyance charges” in an illegal manner,” group volunteer Adil Madni said. Stating that the demand for “money-for-blood” was putting an additional burden on poor patients admitted at the State Cancer Institute, Madni said that an official intervention is a must to put check on such unethical practices. When contacted, CEO of State Cancer Institute Dr Aravind Gaikwad on Sunday said that efforts were on to set up a dedicated blood-storage capacity at his institution. “The limited resources and manpower in the past delayed raising of such facility. While the government has now given an official boost to our institute by providing necessary resources, we will try and set up a round-the-clock working blood storage capacity,” he said. Refuting charges of “money-for-blood” at State Cancer Institute, Gaikwad said that patients and their relatives must bring such instances to official attention. The State Cancer Institute, which completed six years of its establishment last September, has so far offered healthcare to over two lakh patients from Marathwada and nearby regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/complaints-of-money-for-blood-at-state-cancer-institute/articleshow/84531671.cms||---

The searches were in connection with the ongoing bribery-cum-extortion probe against Deshmukh, who has been evading questioning and has not been contactable on his phones, said ED sources. A diwanji (manager) of the Deshmukh family, Pankaj Deshmukh, was taken into custody by the ED team, said sources. It’s learnt the ED team zeroed down on the two ancestral places of Deshmukh as likely hideouts of the NCP MLA from Katol constituency. The former HM has been repeatedly summoned by ED but he has so far dodged the investigating agency. His family members too have been issued summons by the ED. After collecting documents and details of properties and assets at the Vadvihira residence, the team is learnt to have taken Deshmukh’s manager Pankaj into custody. They headed to Katol, where searches were already underway by another team. Deshmukh is facing two-pronged inquiry by ED and also Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for demanding Rs100 crore from bars and pubs in Mumbai through police personnel. As per the ED interrogation details of Assistant PI Sachin Vaze and others, Deshmukh received Rs4 crore from the bar and pub owners in Mumbai. The agency has recorded confessions of his personal secretary and assistant Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde respectively, corroborating statements made by arrested police sub inspector Waze. Amid speculation of yet another search at the residence-cum-office of Deshmukh at GPO Chowk in city, the ED team left for Mumbai later in the afternoon. It’s not clear whether Pankaj was taken along by the ED team or released before they departed for Mumbai. On June 25, ED had searched Deshmukh’s residence-cum-office in the city. ED had also searched his Mumbai residences in the past. The latest jolt from ED for the former home minister came a day after his properties worth Rs4.25 crore were seized in Mumbai during investigations. The ED claimed that its probe has revealed that Deshmukh “with the help of Delhi-based dummy companies, laundered the tainted money of Rs 4.18 crore and projected it as untainted by showing the same as amount received in a trust, namely Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha”. Meanwhile, NCP supporters of Deshmukh had a tense day. Hordes of senior NCP leaders parked themselves at Deshmukh’s office-cum-residence at GPO Chowk. Some NCP leaders were also standing outside Deshmukh’s ancestral place in Katol and Narkhed, where the NCP leader has substantial support. The agency is also probing a company called Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd where the Deshmukh family has acquired 50% shareholding. The assets of the company, including its land and shops, are valued at Rs5.34 crore, ED said. The senior NCP leader, however, acquired these properties for merely Rs18 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ed-fails-to-find-anil-deshmukh-at-katol-and-narkhed-too/articleshow/84535620.cms||Soumitra Bose

The alleged crime took place in Bulandshahr’s Khurja town on Sunday. The accused, who is a relative of the infant, had picked her from the house on the pretext of playing with her. A few hours later he left her on a cot outside the home, bleeding and crying. The girl was taken to the district hospital, where doctors said that her condition was stable. Apart from the youth, the girl’s family has accused two others of being involved in the crime. Police force has been deployed in the area after a group of villagers reached the house of the main accused and demanded that he be handed over to them for “quick justice”. Circle officer (CO) Khurja, Suresh Kumar, said that the parents of the child have given a written complaint against the youth, who lives in the same village. “Parents told us that the baby’s clothes were torn and injuries in her private parts were visible. We consulted doctors who suggested that some kind of physical assault had happened with the infant. We have filed an FIR in the matter and the accused was arrested late in the evening,” said CO Kumar.

Yogi Priyavrat, a former wrestler, had been arrested by Rishikesh police for allegedly swindling a jeweller's wife and taking expensive jewellery and valuables from her on the pretext of curing her illness. Police have recovered statues, rudraksh mala, gold bracelets, gold chain and rings worth Rs 42 lakh from the accused, who was posing as a seer. The complainant, Hitendar Singh Pawar, who owns a jewellery shop in Rishikesh, lodged an FIR in which he had alleged that the accused under the pretext of healing his wife’s mental illness had hypnotised her. Pawar also claimed that the accused called his wife at his residence in Doiwala multiple times, since December 2019, and fed her some medicines and swindled the valuables. Dehradun SSP later ordered the fake seer's arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rs-42l-worth-valuables-recovered-from-fake-seer/articleshow/84531720.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Delhi||Court raps police for snail’s pace in cheating case investigation||New Delhi: A city court has pulled up Delhi Police for its “snail’s pace” investigation in a case against a man for allegedly cheating a widow of Rs 1.75 crore paid for purchasing a house. The woman had alleged that she had entered into an agreement with her chartered accountant Ashok Kumar Khattar for purchasing two floors of the house and paid the money to him. However, he was delaying the execution of the deed on one pretext or the other, the complaint claimed. Meanwhile, the widow had filed a civil suit against him, following which he had alleged that one of the agreements to sell was forged by the woman. Aggrieved, she approached the court, seeking registration of an FIR against him. Last December, the court had directed the police to lodge the FIR and called for all the documents that the woman had referred to in her complaint. Additional chief metropolitan Magistrate Arvind Bansal said the relevant documents were yet to be collected and the investigating officer has not clarified if the accused was ever asked to join the investigation. “It appears that matter is being investigated at a snail’s pace despite passage of more than six months since the registration of FIR. The relevant documents are yet to be collected or seized from the accused. IO has also not clarified in the status report whether accused was ever asked to join the investigation,” the court said. The court directed the IO to immediately comply with its orders and file weekly report of the progress of the investigation before it. “In case the court finds that the matter is not being investigated properly, a report shall be called from the ACP concerned,” it said. According to the woman’s complaint, filed through advocate Arpit Bhargava, Khattar and her husband had entered into an agreement in 2012 for purchase of two floors, of which each will take up one floor. The widow and her family stay at the second floor. In 2016, Khattar had allegedly agreed to enter into an agreement to sell with the widow for purchasing the third floor too, the complaint said. It further alleged that despite paying the money to him, he kept on delaying the deed. When the widow filed a civil suit, he had submitted before the court that he had already gifted the floor to his daughter in 2014 before entering into any alleged agreement to sell with her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-raps-police-for-snails-pace-in-cheating-case-investigation/articleshow/84533505.cms||Usha Das

There were no celebrations as we have lost several of our neighbours in this tragedy. I did not sleep at my usual spot as there were last minute arrangements to made, so I did not get hurt. But my older brother-in-law Yogesh Gangwane suffered a back injury and a fracture in the leg,” said Ghasing. When asked how they stay so perilously close to the retaining wall of BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) atop the hill, Ghasing said, “Everyone here is lower middle class, and desperately need asmall roof over their heads in the city. Many are staying on rent despite being aware of the dangers.” Like Ghasing, Suresh Jagdaonkar (45), who earns his living by painting walls and buildings, was fortunate as he and his entire family escaped the landslide. “Since it was raining heavily on Saturday night, and I also had to finish a chore at my mother-in-law’s house in neighbouring Ashok Nagar, my wife and I decided to spend the night there. Our three children were watching television and later climbed up to the mezzanine floor to sleep. When the landslide occurred, it brought in all the earth, stones, gravel into our house as the front door was smashed by the force. My kids’ two pet chickens who were buried in the rubble were also rescued,” said Jagdaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-desperate-for-roof-many-stay-in-peril/articleshow/84535673.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Dehradun||Foothills of Shivalik range flattened to build Maggi Points, cafes: Plea||NAINITAL: After a plea in the high court alleged that hillocks at several locations — which are part of the foothills of the Shivalik range — are being flattened to build cafes, dhabas, resorts, Maggi Points and housing in violation of environmental laws, the petitioner in a rejoinder affidavit submitted images from Google Maps and photos of several sites as evidence of rampant construction. The court has now asked the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) to respond to the allegations in three weeks. A public interest litigation (PIL) by Dehradun-based environmental activist Reenu Paul had alleged that the structures were being built even though the state’s bylaws, amended in 2015, prohibited construction on slopes with inclines higher than 30 degrees. The petition alleged that “hill after hill was being cut yet the authorities had turned a blind eye” to the damage to the sensitive ecology of the valley. In a rejoinder affidavit submitted before the court last week, Paul showed a set of ‘before and after’ images from Google Maps and site photos of the alleged construction. She also said that cafes and restaurants near Mussoorie diversion have come up on stilts in an unplanned manner and landslides there have become common. The Maldevta and Sahastradhara areas, the affidavit said, were once adorned with lush green trees and vegetation, however, over the years the area has come to be marked by loose rubble and barren hills and yet there is no proper muck disposal system. “These tragedies only reinforce the fact that when hills are cut, illegal encroachments are done and sanctions are given out without taking into account geographical/geological features,” read the affidavit. She has also said that the construction at places like Rajpur road, Dhoran, Kothal Gate, Purkul, Mussoorie bypass and Mussoorie diversion has also increased manifold. “In fact, the area in the vicinity of the Doon IT park, once a barren forest land, is now bustling with habitation and the green cover has been cleared out,” read the affidavit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/foothills-of-shivalik-range-flattened-to-build-maggi-points-cafes-plea/articleshow/84531689.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Aurangabad||Bombay high court acquits man in 2012 radio bomb blast case at Ambajogai||AURANGABAD: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has quashed and set aside an April 30, 2014 judgment by a sessions court at Ambajogai in Beed district which had sentenced a 41-year-old man to life imprisonment in connection with a radio bomb blast at the residence of a state transport bus conductor, Om Nimbalkar, on November 30, 2012. “The accused is certainly entitled for benefit of doubt,” the bench of justice V K Jadhav and justice S G Dige said while referring to the evidence on record in its judgment. Nimbalkar lost both hands and eyes, his wife lost an eye and a leg and his mother and two-year-old son lost both eyes in the blast. In the ensuing investigation, the Kaij police in Ambajogai had arrested Aba alias Munjaba Giri of Kendrewadi village on the charge of assembling gelatin sticks in a radio and leaving it in an Ambajogai-Kurla MSRTC bus. Nimbalkar found the unattended packet and took it home. The bomb went off when Nimbalkar put batteries in the radio and turned it on. It was the police’s case that Giri had left the radio bomb in the bus with the intention of framing fellow villager, Gopinath Tarkase, who had lodged a police complaint against him under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The complaint had then led to Giri’s arrest and custody for 17 days, police said. Giri had purchased a cell phone in the name of Tarkase and left the bill of the said phone in the bag containing the radio bomb, the police claimed. The sessions court had convicted and sentenced Giri to life imprisonment under the provisions of the Explosive Substances Act, besides seven years in jail under the Atrocities Act. The HC bench observed that the prosecution case entirely depended on the circumstantial evidence and there was no direct evidence. Also, an extra-judicial confession obtained in the matter was not enough, the court said. The HC observed, “There is nothing in the evidence to indicate as to who has kept the said parcel/bag containing the radio in the rack of the bus. There is no evidence to show that the appellant accused is having expertise to prepare such circuits attaching the explosives gelatine in such a manner in the radio that as soon as the battery cells are inserted in the radio and if radio is thereafter put on by switching the button, there would be a blast. The HC concluded that the prosecution has made one another futile attempt to link the appellant accused with the circumstances of keeping the said bag /box containing the radio in the rack of the said ST bus.” Giri's lawyer Siddheshwar Thombre had submitted that the prosecution had not obtained the consent of the district magistrate as contemplated under Section 7 of the Indian Explosives Act of 1908. The HC said, “We do not think that the circumstances relied upon by the prosecution are of conclusive nature and tendency. There is no complete chain of circumstantial evidence and we are unable to infer, in all human probability, that the said act must have been done by the appellant. The appellant accused is certainly entitled for the benefit of doubt.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-acquits-man-in-2012-radio-bomb-blast-case-at-ambajogai/articleshow/84531730.cms||Mohammed Akhef

As per the economic review report (2020) released in January, 6,662 man-animal conflicts were reported in Kerala in FY 2019-20. Both long term and short term solutions will be provided, it is learnt. Honey bee fencing, SMS-based alarm system and bio-fencing are some of the methods which were found to be effective and will be included under short term measures. Long-term measures include even relocation of residents, away from elephant corridors, to ensure connectivity for movement of wild animals. “We look at forest areas with continuous connectivity that allow animals to move without disruption. Priority will be areas where man-animal conflicts are high; like wildlife corridors of Wayanad. Elephants are forced to move through human habitats as their corridors are blocked. Many residents are ready to relocate. Primitive tribes are not relocated since they aren’t worried about man-animal conflicts as they live harmoniously with nature,” said a forest officer. He added that man-animal conflicts are high in northern districts due to unscientific intervention and fragmentation. Geetha Vazhachal, the chieftain of Kadar tribal community in Vazhachal, echoed this view. “What I learned from my forefathers is that we should stay away from the path of animals. My experience is that they attack people only when their paths are disrupted. A group of tribesmen in our area came across a herd of elephants recently while on their way to collect honey. They changed paths to avoid conflict. Seeing a baby elephant in the herd, they moved further away from the spot and watched the mother elephant dragging a log to facilitate the baby elephant to cross a heap of mud. Later, the mother elephant pushed the baby with its trunk to cross the mud heap. They waited till the herd crossed that river,” she said. The department will assess casualties, crop damage in each area and ascertain areas where residents must be relocated. Residents will be relocated by giving a compensation of Rs 15 lakh for each adult in the family. Forest minister A K Saseendran has told officers to submit the report within a week. Now, range officers have been asked to submit details on man-animal conflicts within their limits. “The proposals will be scientific and site-specific, related to the problems reported in each area. Solution should be an integrated one as animals also adapt to preventive measures like solar fencing,” said another forest officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/forest-dept-readying-steps-to-end-man-animal-conflicts/articleshow/84531756.cms||T C Sreemol

Videos of water flowing on the city roads were widely circulated by residents on social media. The Dehradun Municipal Corporation's (DMC) control room received several complaints of waterlogging and choked drains after over three hours of continuous showers. Most of the city roads, including Prince Chowk, Darshan Lala Chowk and Arhat Bazaar, were submerged. “The heavy rainfall has given us some respite from the heat, but it has left the drains overflowing. It will take a few hours for the water level to recede,” said Satish Raheja, a commuter at Prince Chowk. Meanwhile, debris also started flowing down into the villages in Maldevta. It had to be removed by a PWD team on Sunday morning. “We were living under constant stress as the debris kept falling after short durations of rains,” said a local villager in Maldevta. To take stock of the situation, Dehradun Mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama reached the disaster control room set up by the DMC. The officials said that people called on the helpline numbers while the team reached to clean up choked drains. The newly laid tiles at Paltan Bazaar, too, came off the ground. Repairing work has started. Also, on Sunday, cabinet minister Ganesh Joshi along with officials from district administration had visited areas like Neelkanth Vihar and Badrinath colony to meet the locals after roads and 'pushta' (walls) were damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/incessant-rains-waterlogging-wreak-havoc-in-doon/articleshow/84531771.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Party’s district committee has decided to constitute an ad hoc local committee to replace the dismissed panel. The decision is the latest crackdown by party leadership on the issue which led to a massive embarrassment for the party in the run-up to assembly election. Also, party has demoted two members of Kunnummal area committee K P Chandri and T K Mohandas in connection with the pre-election protests. Chandri is the president of Kunnummal block panchayat. Kozhikode district secretariat had, earlier this month, taken action against Kuttiady MLA K P Kunhammed Kutty by demoting him from district secretariat to district committee. The decision showed that though the party was forced to accept the demand of protesters and give the seat to local leader K P Kunhammed Kutty, it has not taken the public revolt, which had the active support of many Kuttiady local committee members who had participated in the two protest marches, lightly. The party has also found that despite the public demand raised by the cadres in Kuttiady local committee for Kutty’s candidature, there has been a vote drain as Kunhammed Kutty could only get a lead of less than 50 votes in Kuttiady panchayat. The party’s rank and file had rooted for Kutty’s candidate in the first protest march and they had put up posters and banners in support of his candidature in the area.  The local party cadres had taken out a huge protest march on March 10 in a public show of dissent which shook the CPM leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-disbands-kuttiady-local-committee/articleshow/84531779.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||City outskirts dumping ground for industrial effluent||AHMEDABAD: Recently a team of Gandhinagar police caught two tankers near Kalol in the middle of the night. Suspicious, police got hold of the drivers and seized the vehicles for further probe. The questioning revealed that they were headed to Vatva to dump the liquid. Teams of GPCB and FSL were brought to the spot as 60,000 liters of liquid turned out to be highly concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCA) which is effluent from an industry based in Kalol GIDC. In June, investigators booked seven others including managers and top management of the companies found involved under sections of IPC, Environment Protection Act (EPC), and Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Act. The primary accused also showed the spot near Vaishnodevi Circle where the effluent was dumped directly in the sewage line. It was not the first instance caught by the investigators of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar police – Ahmedabad even recorded multiple deaths in past five years where the cause of death was suspected to be acidic effluent. Mayur Chavda, SP of Gandhinagar police, said that according to the procedure, the effluent must be processed in effluent treatment plant (ETP) before it’s taken to designated spots by GPCB for the environment-friendly disposal. “But that process costs about Rs 1 lakh per 10,000 liters approximately. Thus, the seized stock must cost about Rs 6 lakh to process. Instead, the accused offered to dispose it at one-sixth of the cost,” he said. Investigation revealed that the accused and their associates at least ferried one tanker daily in the past seven months to dispose of the untreated effluent. A senior FSL official said that HCA is highly corrosive in nature. “Direct dumping of the acid in conventional sewage lines not only creates fumes which are dangerous for humans, but also corrodes or damages the lines. Thus, the chances of its percolation into nearby soil and groundwater cannot be ruled out,” said the official. GPCB officials could not be contacted for their comment on the issue, but sources close to the development said that fewer cases of this nature have been registered in the recent past. It requires industrial unit-level or GIDC-level surveillance which is difficult. Paperwork of the effluent processing and real picture are often different, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-outskirts-dumping-ground-for-industrial-effluent/articleshow/84533651.cms||Parth Shastri

In Goa, they are a perfect setting for unique celebrations, crocodile worship and boat festivals even as their potential for honey, vegetables and medicinal benefits need to be explored. Making a case for comprehensive mapping of mangroves and identifying their importance in various aspects with other activists, Fr Bolmax Pereira, a botanist and priest, suggested conservation status for the Kandella candel as a state mangrove species. The submission at the recently held public hearing for the draft coastal zone management plan (CZMP) was prepared by a team led by him and supervised by Goa Foundation. “Kandella candel species has discontinuous distribution along the Indian coast, but is found abundantly in Goa’s estuaries of Zuari, Mandovi and Cumbarjua,” Pereira said. The study urged marking of mangrove sites with Avicennia spp, Aegicera and Sonneratia caseolaris species for mangrove honey, areas with Acrostichum aureum species (‘akur’) a vegetable delicacy, and potential mangrove ‘pharmacy’ sites. Some people are aware that extracts from mangroves and dependent species are rich in bio-active compounds, effective for treatment of diseases. But these medicinal properties and their full potential is yet to be investigated and utilised, scientist A G Untawale had stated in a co-authored book. Untawale had said that mangrove extracts can treat a host of problems and diseases — toothache, sore throat, fungal infections, bleeding, fever, kidney stone, rheumatism and malaria. Further, the study by the botanist and others called for a proper management plan, inclusive of restoration and conservation, which component is missing in CZMPs. Team member Saisha Harmalkar, from Chorao, said that many mangrove areas have been missed out in the map, which may leave them open for manipulation. Besides the Chorao mangrove swamp, which is protected as a bird sanctuary, other mangrove areas in Merces, Mapusa, Curtorim, Raia, Cumbarjua need to be protected, they said. Areas cleared of mangroves and unprotected ones need protection, too. “The marking of mangroves along Goa’s rivers and restoration of cleared mangroves is important to arrest breaching of bundhs and influx of saline waters in fields,” Talullah D’Silva, another team member said while presenting submissions in North Goa. Ana Smriti Paes from Chicalim, a student and team member, said that reclamation has wiped out mangroves in many stretches from MPT to Loutolim along the banks of the Zuari. Mangroves have also been termed as ‘bona fide offenders’ by a former NIO scientist Simon D’Souza for encroaching in cultivable land. “These mangroves that have invaded the khazan lands have not been identified in the CZMP,” Pereira said. The overgrowth is due to the government’s failure to maintain bundhs destroyed by barges or to serve interests of pisciculture. “These (invasive mangroves) will die out if bundhs are repaired. Hence, they must be surveyed and demarcated,” Abhijit Prabhudesai of Rainbow Warriors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-mangroves-have-unique-food-and-medicine-need-management/articleshow/84537510.cms||Paul Fernandes

When the IUML is of the view that Muslim community got a raw deal with the government decision, a section in the Congress and the Kerala Congress are of the view that it has ensured natural justice to all the communities which deserve minority scholarship. However, the Congress is under pressure from the IUML and hence is not ready to take an open stand favouring the government decision. Even though opposition leader V D Satheesan was first to accept the decision, he had to backtrack after pressure from the IUML leaders. “The UDF will discuss the issue and evolve a consensus in this. We are of the view that all deserving communities should get the benefit and it should be implemented judiciously. No community should lose their share because of others. Hence, we will try to ensure natural justice to all,” said former chief minister Oommen Chandy. He said that the opinion of all the UDF constituents will be discussed in the meeting and then the UDF will come out with a consensus on the matter. For this the UDF meeting will be held soon, he added. Meanwhile, Congress senior leader and MP K Muraleedharan has urged KPCC president K Sudhakaran to convene the political affairs committee meeting to discuss the issue. He said instead of leaders airing different opinion on this, it would be better to have a collective opinion. “Everyone in the UDF has the freedom to express their opinion unlike in the LDF. There are difference on the minority scholarship within the LDF also. But nobody is coming out due to fear,” said Muraleedharan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/udf-kpcc-to-discuss-minority-scholarship-row/articleshow/84531833.cms||---

Thackeray also asked the authorities to identify landslide-prone sites and ‘dangerous’ buildings and shift the residents to safer places. He directed the SRA, MMRDA and Mhada to provide PAP accommodation for these residents. He instructed the BMC to keep stormwater drain department staff on standby and de-watering pumps functional at nights too. Doctors and medical teams of Covid centres and field hospitals have also been asked to be on alert. Even as torrential rains wreaked havoc in the city leaving 32 dead in five separate incidents of landslides, electrocutions and a house collapse, a four-year-old boy from Nalasopara, Anmol Singh, is feared to have fallen into an open manhole. It is not known if the lid was opened by civic staff or some locals to drain out rainwater. The fire brigade has launched a search, while two civic teams have fanned out in Bilalpad, Tulinj, to look for the boy. At 1pm on Sunday, the IMD issued a ‘red’ alert indicating extremely heavy rains at isolated places for a 24-hour period for Mumbai. For the second time in two days, the city saw intense rain activity overnight with as much as 200mm of rain being recorded in six hours (11.30am-5.30am). In the 24-hour period ending at 8.30am on Sunday, the IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded 235mm rain and the Colaba observatory, 197mm. By Sunday morning, Vihar became the second lake this monsoon overflow after Tulsi. Intense rain was recorded over the catchment area lakes supplying water to Mumbai between July 17 and 18 for the first time this season. Several parts of the city were waterlogged and chronic flooding spots submerged till afternoon. Both the eastern and western suburbs reported heavy flooding with water entering homes in several areas, including Bhandup, Kurla, Nahur, Borivli and Goregaon. The BMC claimed that its pu-mping stations ejected 4,423.50 million litres of water till 9am. BEST buses were diverted on 118 routes due to waterlogging at 34 locations, including Sion, Gandhi Market, Hindm-ata, Andheri, Chembur and Kurla. Local train services were suspended during the early hours and were restored by 9am on Western Railway and at 11am on Central Railway. Mumbai airport was closed for flights from 12.42am to 5.24am, during which nine flights were diverted to other airports, said an MIAL spokesperson, adding that flight operations were normal during the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-200mm-rain-swamps-mumbai-city-through-the-night/articleshow/84537507.cms||---

Their bodies, probably lying on the roadside for hours, were spotted by a passerby who informed police. The latter came and took charge of the bodies and sent them for post-mortem by midnight. However, more than 18 hours have passed but their bereaved family is yet to receive the bodies for the last rites as the post-mortem had not been conducted till the time of filing this report. Sanjay Sharma, uncle of the deceased, told TOI that the two brothers were the sole breadwinners of the family. They worked in a showroom in Hapur. The elder one, Nitin Sharma (25), who had got married a year-and-a-half ago, has left behind a two-month-old baby and a young wife. The family was looking for a match for the younger brother (22). “We were informed about the accident at 11:30 pm on Saturday. The doctors had not started with the autopsy till 5 pm on Sunday,” he added, as family members waited outside the post-mortem house for the bodies. The bereaved family is yet to come to terms with the tragedy, he added. “Their father has not eaten anything since Saturday night when they received a call from the police. The mother keeps losing consciousness. The family is now staring at a stark future without an earning member,” said Sanjay Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/18-hrs-on-family-awaits-post-mortem-to-collect-bodies-of-2-brothers-killed-in-road-accident/articleshow/84531829.cms||Ishita Mishra

The submission was made in a bunch of cases being heard by the high court on the state government’s order to cap the school fees in the pandemic-hit year. According to KAMS, which has a membership of 3,600 schools, the survey was conducted to understand the extent of financial losses schools suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic. While the actual strength in the schools that participated in the survey was 1,85,933, the number of students enrolled last year by paying fees was 1,25,839. “These schools have not been able to get in touch with these children despite making attempts. They do not know whether they have enrolled in other school as they have not collected their transfer certificates (TCs),” said association general secretary D Shashi Kumar on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/32-in-250-pvt-schools-did-not-take-admissions-last-yr-survey/articleshow/84538107.cms||---

While the serial showcased the ills of child marriage, the panchayat is aimed at addressing female adolescents’ issues — of the girls, by the girls, for the girls! Kunariya village, around 18km from district headquarter of Bhuj, has a population of around 4,000 people. Young females from the village, aged between 10 and 21 years, will contest elections for this unique panchayat. This ‘girls only’ council will run parallel to the adult village version, but addresses issues pertaining to adolescent girls and women only in the village. Scheduled to be held on Monday, the election for Balika Panchayat too is a closely contested affair. The whole village has geared up in the poll mode with rallies, door-to-door campaigns heating up while the voters’ meeting has turned out to be point of great attraction for the past one week. Result will be declared on the same day. Eight candidates are vying for the sarpanch post, of whom four have withdrawn their candidature. The contest will be between Bharti Garva (20), Rubina Node (19), Trushali Suthar (20) and Afsana Sumra (17) and every individual candidate is busy convincing 450-odd voters in the village why she should be voted to power. Sarpanch of the village, Suresh Chhanga said, “The concept is that these elected girls will bring the schemes that will address issues of girls and women in the village. The other idea is to prepare the future women leaders.” Chhanga elaborated that while women enjoy 50 percent reservation in the Panchayat, elected women’s decisions are often overshadowed by their husbands. By the time these girls can contest the real elections, they will understand their constitutional rights and responsibility and won’t allow others to take decisions on their behalf, he added.  Bharti Garva, one of the candidates for sarpanch position, is doing her graduation. “The other candidates are my friends and we are only learning the democratic process. If I win, I want to ensure that women should remain physically and mentally healthy too. They should get nutritional food and avail education at least till graduation. I want to focus on reducing girls’ school dropout ratio,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kutch-gears-up-for-balika-panchayat-polls/articleshow/84531854.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

But the second wave of Covid left Asha Barot devastated snatching away her husband Raman and along with it her marital bliss. Forty-year-old Asha, who had never worked till then, was left high and dry. “I had no idea how I would start earning. Fortunately, I came across this sanitary napkin manufacturing unit that started in my area two months ago by Vatsalya Foundation. Women working in the unit were earning a decent amount enough to sustain their household,” Asha, who decided to join the unit to eke a living, told TOI. “I underwent training to make sanitary napkins and started working full time. I make a decent earning now and I am happy that I can educate my children. I am not scared any more,” said Asha. Like her, about nine other women who have either lost their earning member in the family, or lost a job are working in the unit. Kalpana Ahirao, 34, was at a loss when her father-in-law died of Covid. “I am a single mother and we were dependent on my father-in-law’s pension. After his death, I was clueless on how to make ends meet. Then I met Payal Rao who had started this sanitary napkin making unit in Bhayli and I joined them. Today, I take care of my family,” said the confident mother of two girls. Swati Bedekar, who runs Vatsalya Foundation, said that the idea behind starting this unit was to give a helping hand to women who lost their husband or earning member of the family in the pandemic. “Many of them never worked in their life and they are clueless about how to sustain their family. We funded and established this unit in Bhayli so that such women can work and earn a living,” Bedekar told TOI and added these women make about 20,000 sanitary napkins every month. “When my husband lost his job during the second wave of Covid, I decided to take up my family’s responsibility. I started this unit with the help of Swati Bedekar two months ago and I am happy that many other women like me are now able to sustain themselves,” 35-year-old Payal Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodaras-padwomen-keep-home-fires-burning-in-covid-hit-families/articleshow/84533794.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: 200 potential drugs tested for Covid treatment||HYDERABAD: Covid-19 is emerging as perhaps the first pandemic in human history for the treatment of which over 200 drug compounds have been tested and about 70 therapeutic agents subjected to clinical trials so far. A research study involving scientists, including those from the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Hyderabad, found that as many as 265 clinical trials were conducted to find a suitable treatment for the virus and of them, 115 have been shown to have direct effect on reducing the viral load and managing the disease. Interestingly, except for the vaccines, all the drugs tested so far are old medicines and repurposed for Covid-19 with varying degrees of success. “The acute progression of Covid-19 and high infection rate pose an enormous challenge for its therapeutic management and critical care. The viral structure, genome (complete genetic information) and proteome (complete protein information) have been deciphered which yielded cues for targeting already available therapeutic entities. More than 200 compounds have been screened and 69 therapeutic agents are undergoing clinical trials across the world,” the study said. The study said a plethora of anti-parasitic and anti-viral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and stem cell therapies were tried as part of well-designed clinical trials. Apart from vitamin C, vitamin D supplementation has been found to be useful in reducing the risk. It was found that vitamin D lowers viral replication rates and controls the pro-inflammatory cytokines production responsible for lung injuries. Vitamin D supplementation can also manage the risk of influenza. The study was published in the recent issue of scientific journal Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy. Apart from NIPER, Hyderabad, researchers from Dr BR Ambedkar Centre for Biomedical Research, University of Delhi, and the Chandigarh College of Pharmacy, Mohali, were also part of the study. The team comprised Mukesh Kumar, Jitender Madan, Rupinder Kaur Sodhi, Shashi Bala Singh and Anju Katyal. “Covid-19 has forced the human civilizations to think, innovate, develop and prioritize all possible strategies to combat the infection. The tested drug combinations have demonstrated mixed non-uniform results in the affected patients. Therefore, a need to extend the repertoire of drugs or adjunct therapeutics to deal with Covid-19 is warranted,” the researchers suggested. According to the study, antimalarial drugs like chloroquine diphosphate and hydroxychloroquine, anti-viral drugs like Ritonavir and Lopinavir, Interferon (recombinant), Favipiravir, Baloxavir, Darunavir, Ganovo, ASC09/Ritonavir, Arbidol hydrochloride, Carrimycin and Triazavirin, corticosteroids like Methylprednisolone, stem cells involving mesenchymal stem cells from umbilical cord, blood plasma from umbilical cord, blood mononuclear cells and immunomodulators like recuperative plasma, and monoclonal antibodies like Tocilizumab, Adalimumab, Ixekizumab and Camrelizumab were tested. Doctors also tested drugs like Remdesivir and Heparin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/200-potential-drugs-tested-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/84533784.cms||Syed Akbar

As per laid down norms, a minimum of 25% of the total parents need to have grievances against the fees charged by schools. Deputy director of education for Aurangabad division, Anil Sable on Sunday said the DFRC has received few complaints, but none of them fulfil the required condition. “As per law, 25% of the total parents must come together and lodge a complaint related to a fee hike, which is not the case in grievances we have received so far. We are looking into a complaint against one school as the matter is referred to us by the Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court,” he said. As per enabling provision of the Maharashtra Fee Regulation Act 2011, the state school education department last month had formed DFRCs in the state to resolve fee-related complaints between school management and Parents-Teachers Association (PTA). Educational activist Prashant Sathe said the government should remove the condition of minimum 25% aggrieved parents for investigating fee-related issue. “Despite objection to fee-hike, many parents hesitate to openly come forward against the school management fearing any grudge against their wards by school authorities. While the PTA has powers to lodge a complaint, members of such panel are often hand-picked based on proximity to the school management,” he said. Meanwhile, the DFRC for Aurangabad division — earlier had jurisdiction over Aurangabad, Jalna, Parbhani and Hingoli and Beed districts — will also have jurisdiction over Nanded, Osmanabad and Latur districts that comes under Latur division. The panel, whose president is yet to assume charge, has a retired joint director of education Rajendra Dhogane, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (Aurangabad division) chairperson Sugata Punne and charted accountant Rajkumar Kothari among its members with deputy director of education for Aurangabad division as the ex-officio member secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/25-aggrieved-parents-norm-becomes-a-hurdle/articleshow/84529749.cms||Prasad Joshi

The Pollution Control Board (PCB) has also alerted the health department at state and district levels over the increasing biomedical waste with a caveat to ensure all measures are undertaken to esnure safety standards. In 2016, the biomedical waste generated daily was around 16,000 kg. There is an annual increase of around 2,000 kg of biomedical waste per day. In 2020, it rose to 20,400 kg per day and has now touched 23,500 kg. This is a steep rise of another 1, 500 kg waste per day. Officials say that the biomedical waste generation has increased for various reasons. “One of the main reasons could be that hospitals are more regularly using Covid-19 related equipment like PPE kits, masks, gloves as well as general equipment used in other procedures. They may be using single-use needles and plastic items due to Covid-19,” an official said. Biomedical waste is of four types— red, yellow, white and blue. Most of the items used in Covid-19 treatment fall mainly under the red and white categories. Red category includes contaminated waste (recyclable), plastic and rubber and white category includes metallic sharps. Except for the ‘yellow’ biomedical waste, rest of the categories can be recycled after due technical process involving elaborate treatment. The yellow category contains human anatomical waste, whereas the blue category includes glassware and metallic implants. Environment and forest minister A Indrakaran Reddy said that a good disposal system for biomedical waste is in place with 11 private plants doing the job. “The biomedical waste is well taken care of, we are regulating the process,” he said. Staff from these plants go to the hospitals and collect the material for treatment in the required manner and the process is monitored by the PCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-stares-at-biomedical-waste-crisis-amid-covid/articleshow/84533758.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The Board of Technical Education took a decision earlier this month to conduct the examinations in the online mode. Final year students of the different diploma programmes in the state had made representations to the directorate of technical education demanding cancellation of the examinations, which were earlier scheduled to be held in the offline mode. The students had questioned as to why only their exams were being held in the offline mode, when the Class X and XII public exams have been cancelled in 2021, citing safety reasons due to the pandemic. The students argued that after the Goa University also decided to hold its semester end exams in the online mode, the diploma final year exams are the only ones which were scheduled to be held offline. Giving instructions for the exams to be held from Monday, the Board of Technical Education said, “Students shall download the question paper forwarded by officer in-charge of the institute, at the start time of the theory exam, as per the exam schedule. Student shall upload the scanned copy of answerbook and use only his or her seat number as the file name for uploading the answerbook to the officer in charge of the institute by 2pm on the day of the examination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/online-exams-for-diploma-courses-starts-from-today/articleshow/84537530.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||GHMC takes steps to change larvicides||HYDERABAD: Following concerns about mosquitoes in Hyderabad becoming resistant to chemicals used in anti-fogging operations, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials are now taking measures to change the insecticide and larvicides currently being used in the fogging and anti-larval operations in the city. The issue seems to have come under the lens of the officials after citizens and civic agencies working against this menace said that even anti-larval operations have not helped in keeping the mosquito menace under control, especially at a time when dengue cases are on the rise. On July 10, TOI published the issues being faced by citizens and civic authorities about the mosquito menace that has turned acute despite the regular fogging and anti-larval operations to check breeding of mosquitoes. “After the article was published, the higher-ups in the department discussed the issue and considered changing the chemicals being used in the anti-fogging and anti-larval operations,” said Dr Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC. Officials also said that the civic body is preparing to write to the Vector Control Research Centre, Pondicherry and National Institute of Malaria Research, Delhi to invite their teams to Hyderabad and assess the anti-fogging and anti-larval chemicals being used in GHMC limits. Entomologists reiterated that even though fogging does not eliminate mosquitoes completely, it is being done mainly due to demand from the public. “We use a chemical called Melathion which does not kill dengue or chikungunya causing mosquitoes. As per WHO, fogging using this chemical, especially in residential areas, is not advisable as it causes health issues for children, elderly and pregnant women,” said Dr A Rambabu, chief entomologist. Currently, to control breeding of mosquitoes in stagnant water, authorities are conducting house-to-house anti-larval operations, releasing gambusia fishes into the water bodies as they eat the larvae of mosquitoes, and dropping oil balls in dirty water ponds or stagnant water, which forms a film on the surface of the water, killing mosquitoes and larvae, and breaking the reproductive chain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-takes-steps-to-change-larvicides/articleshow/84533852.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s active case nos. cause of concern, experts urge caution||HYDERABAD: Though the daily Covid-19 case count has come down considerably across the state, the active caseload is still a worry. The state currently stands at the ninth place in terms of active cases (9,824). Maharashtra still tops the list in having the highest active caseload at 1.3 lakh followed by Kerala at 1.23 lakh cases. There is a huge difference between these two states and the rest in terms of active cases. Other states having more active case are Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam. For every 100 cases, two people are currently infected in Telangana. Active cases per million population could be an indicator of the stress the health infrastructure faces at a given time. Though there is no pressure on the bed capacity in the state, it does not indicates that all is well. People cannot drop guard and have to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, say health experts. Looking at the national data, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar have more cumulative cases than Telangana (state has around 6.5 lakh) . The cumulative caseload in these state is more than seven lakh, but the active caseload less than 1,000. It means that the number of new infections being added in these two states is less than what it is in Telangana. In a wave-like scenario, if the cases stretch beyond a given capacity, it would be difficult to stop even preventable deaths. “Though the current situation is not that alarming, people need to be careful with a strict compliance mechanism in place,” Dr Ranjit Kumar Dehury, public health expert and assistant professor, School of Management Studies, University of Hyderabad, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/states-active-case-nos-cause-of-concern-experts-urge-caution/articleshow/84533805.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Almost all private hospitals were selling the vaccines at the upper limit fixed by the government, which is believed to have an impact on the vaccination drive at private hospitals. As per CoWIN portal, a single dose of Covishield and Covaxin was priced at Rs 780 and Rs 1,410, respectively, at private hospitals in Aurangabad district. Santosh Yadav, the business development head of Medicover Hospital, Aurangabad, said no marked increase in footfall of beneficiaries was observed at private hospitals despite the acute shortage of vaccines at state-run centres. “Even the government has appealed to citizens to go for paid vaccination if they can afford it. As per speculations, the third wave of Covid may arrive and therefore getting immunized against Covid is the best possible protection,” he said. While the total number of vaccinations has reached 10,54,771 in Aurangabad district by Sunday evening, only 2,46,531 citizens have got the second dose. Amid many beneficiaries with their second dose due, the local civic body has been covering these citizens on a priority basis during the ongoing immunisation programme considering the shortage of doses. Aurangabad district had witnessed its peak of vaccination programme between June 19 and 25, when the highest number of doses (1.07 lakh) were administered. A total of 80,295 vaccinations were carried out from July 10 to 16 in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/amid-vaccine-shortage-fewer-takers-for-jabs-at-private-hospitals-in-aurangabad/articleshow/84529779.cms||---

District collector S Sivarasu has assured to help those who could not pay the fee in a meeting with the school education department staff. NEET UG 2021 is scheduled to take place on September 12, 2021 in pen and paper mode in 13 languages. While the online registration started from July 13, the last date for filing online applications is August 06, 2021. A candidate in the general category will have to pay Rs 1500 as registration fee and the fee for general EWS/ OBC non-creamy layer Rs 1400. Candidates belonging to SC/ST and persons with disability will pay Rs 800. In a meeting with the school education commissioner K Nanda Kumar, a few district chief education officers had raised their concern over possible low registration this year for NEET. About 80 students are taking up free online NEET coaching provided by the state government in Trichy district. “Many of these students have provisionally enrolled themselves to arts and science colleges over delay in the NEET UG notification this year and paid fee, but parents are reluctant to pay Rs 1400 for NEET registration,” said an official from the school education department. Speaking to TOI, district chief education officer R Arivalagan said they have taken up the matter with the collector who has assured to help genuine candidates who may not be able to pay the fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/district-admin-to-pay-regn-fee-for-poor-students-taking-neet/articleshow/84533837.cms||---
---||Lucknow||At current rate, it will take a year to fully immunise Lucknow||LUCKNOW: The state capital might have crossed the milestone of administering 17 lakh doses of Covid vaccine in six months, but with the current pace of daily average inoculation, an informal analysis shows that it will take at least a year to fully immunise Lucknow district’s adult population of 36 lakh with a two-dose course. The mass immunisation campaign started on January 16. Nearly 17.2 lakh doses were administered by July 17. Of these, about 7.8 lakh doses were used to fully vaccinate 3.9 lakh people (10.8% of the population) with two shots. About 9.4 lakh beneficiaries (26.1%) have received one dose and are waiting for the second after the completion of the gap period. This means that 22.7 lakh people (63%) have not taken even a single dose. According to health department’s data, in six months, the vaccination drive ran for 153 working days with an average of 11,242 inoculations daily. However, the vaccination rate picked up significantly in June with a daily average of 18,800. The highest single-day vaccination count was on June 25 when 28,131 people were given first or second doses. However, in comparison to June, the average vaccination daily in July so far has dropped to around 17,600. A rough calculation shows that to fully immunise the remaining and those waiting for the second dose, health authorities need to administer 54.8 lakh more doses. If vaccinations continue with July rate, it will take 311 days to cover the entire adult population with two doses. Since vaccinations in government centres are not carried out on Sundays and holidays, the campaign will require at least 365 days or 12 months to complete. However, if vaccinations are carried on with the June rate, the process will take 11 months. And, if the pace is increased to that as on June 25 when over 28,000 were given shots in a day, the campaign will be over in just seven months, which means by February. The time period can be further brought down to five months (by the end of this year) by encouraging and involving private players. When contacted, district immunisation officer Dr MK Singh said, “Our target is to cover the entire adult population with at least a dose by September-end before the start of the anticipated third wave of the pandemic. We are incorporating more private hospitals and encouraging them to buy vaccines so that the number of private centres can be increased to 50 from the existing 10-12. This, if it happens, will provide a major boost to the campaign.” “Similarly, we are planning to set up special camps at religious or workplaces. Besides, cluster vaccinations in rural areas and suburbs will also provide a big push. It has already started in three blocks of the district. In the cluster campaign, 100% of the adult population of a locality is vaccinated in a time- bound manner with micro planning and persuasion by visiting every household in the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/at-current-rate-it-will-take-a-yr-to-fully-immunise-city/articleshow/84535950.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The Union government has issued a notification for KVPY, a national fellowship for school and college students interested in pursuing a career in basic science research. The KVPY is funded by the department of science and technology (DST) and the aptitude test is conducted in Hindi and English. Students from Class XI to 1st year UG in basic science subjects are selected for their aptitude for scientific research. Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru screens the applications and conducts an aptitude test at various centres in the country. Fellowships ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 and contingency grants are provided to the students up to Pre-PhD level to help them develop interest in research. Students should have secured a minimum of 60% marks (50% for SC/ST and persons with disability) in aggregate in science subjects. Educationist S Siva Kumar, a retired principal of District Institute of Education and Training, wrote to the DST seeking measures to conduct the examination in regional languages including Tamil. “Language cannot be a yardstick to test the scientific temperament of students as aptitude for scientific research is beyond language. Therefore, the exam should be conducted in other regional languages including Tamil,” he said. Kumar also pointed out the high fee of Rs 1,250 for general category and Rs 650 for the reserved category collected for the test, which many families are not able to afford. He said Sanjay Mishra, advisor and head of INSPIRE division, DST, responded to his mail saying that they will work on his suggestions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/call-to-conduct-kvpy-aptitude-test-in-tamil/articleshow/84533816.cms||Sampath Kumar

Sangli Zilla Parishad CEO Jitendra Dudi has decided to initiate microscopic containment zones in rural areas to stop the spread of Covid. The district has slipped from level 3 of Covid restrictions to level 4 due to the rise in Covid cases in the rural parts. Dudi told TOI, “We have identified 174 hotspots. They will be sealed and barricaded. The residents will have to face restrictions in movement. Only doorstep delivery of essentials will be allowed in these places. All measures such as tracing, testing of suspected Covid patients and isolation will be carried out rigorously.” The authorities have observed that the citizens have stopped following Covid Appropriate Behaviour. The streets are crowded, which is further causing the spread. The officials, therefore, decided to zero in on the hotspots where the outbreak is the most.  Localities with 20 or more cases reported in the last 15 days have been identified. A similar strategy was adopted by the Satara district administration in over 80 villages, which helped them to bring down the Covid count. Meanwhile, Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary has also asked the authorities to ensure strict implementation of the restrictions. Recently, he ordered to close the roadside eateries and the weekly mandis in urban and rural areas to de-congest the streets. “Strict isolation is mandatory. If the patient does not shift in isolation then he or she will be fined. Even after the fine, if the patient denies, then a police case will be lodged against him or her,” said Chaudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/174-hotspots-in-sangli-to-be-sealed/articleshow/84529848.cms||---

Last year, the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the academic calendar including the admission process for UG and PG courses. This year, the state government is in the process of overcoming the academic loss that was caused by Covid-19 by staying way ahead of the academic calendar for 2021-22 issued by the UGC on July 16. As per the UGC guidelines, academic session 2021-2022 shall commence latest by October 1 for first year students. “Although we have commenced the degree admissions, we will be able to conclude them only after the common entrance tests are conducted. This year, our focus is on completing the admissions way before time and begin the classes for first year students latest by September 1,” said R Limbadri, vice-chairman of Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) and convenor of Degree Online Services, Telangana. Following the UGC guidelines, the TSCHE is now in the process of finalising the notification for the common entrance test for PG courses. “The final year examination for degree courses is in progress. As soon as they conclude, we will issue the notification giving almost 30 to 40 days’ time for students to appear for the common entrance test for PG courses,” said Limbadri. This year, the UGC has made it clear that in view of the financial hardships being faced by parents due to lockdowns and related factors, a full refund of fees should be made, including all charges, on account of all cancellations of admissions/migrations of students up to October 31, 2021 for the academic session 2021-2022 as a special case. “Thereafter, on cancellation/withdrawal of admissions up to December 31, the entire fee collected from a student should be refunded in full after deducting not more than Rs 1,000/- as processing fee,” read the guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-academic-session-in-colleges-varsities-from-oct-1/articleshow/84533898.cms||---

The NASBA and AICPA are the nodal agencies that conduct the CPAs exam that enables candidates to pursue finance and auditing with several US-based companies. The US CPA is set to undergo several curriculum and evaluation changes that will give larger flexibility to students from 2024. Among them, technological aptitude is being given priority wherein the newly-licensed CPAs will possess knowledge on data analytics. “The curriculum is set to be tech-driven wherein accounting will not be limited to just gathering information and auditing. Accountants will be expected to develop technological dashboard that will help them to analyse the data. It will not be about just recording entries but also coming up with insights using technology,” said Sripal Jain, co-founder of Simandhar Education, who was recently invited by NASBA in US to discuss the recent changes. In addition to this, the new exam will also allow a professional to select which specialization they want. Three sections that comprise the core of the exam will test skills and knowledge in auditing, accounting and tax, with a recognition of the impact technology has on these areas. “The core-and-discipline model enables candidates to focus on areas that are of either special interest to them or their employer. As the profession evolves, it gives us a greater flexibility,” said Mike Decker, the AICPA’s vice-president (examination and pipeline). A draft blueprint of the remodelled examination will be released by June 2022 for exposure and comments. A final blueprint is scheduled to be published at the beginning of 2023 with the exam launch date targeted for January 2024.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aptitude-test-to-assess-students-for-us-accountants-exam/articleshow/84533921.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Hyderabad||Pits of hazard: Open and damaged manholes a threat to commuters in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: The manholes, which are supposed to be access points for sewers and stormwater drains, seem to be posing a serious threat to road users across GHMC limits. Just an hour’s drive to some parts of the city on Sunday revealed that there are several manholes which are either broken, under repair or raised to such a height that they could violently throw two-wheeler riders out of their seats. “There is one open manhole right in the middle of the road in our colony. There have been several incidents where two-wheelers and cars get stuck in it. People have also suffered some serious injuries because of this problem,” said D Gangadhar, a resident of Bowenpally. “The situation gets worse during rains because the entire street gets flooded and you can hardly notice the open manhole,” he added. The situation prevails despite GHMC suspending two engineers for dereliction of duty and slapping Rs 1 lakh in penalty on Comprehensive Road Maintenance Programme agency after an open stormwater drain near Gandhi Hospital was found to pose a threat to human life. Following this incident, all the assistant engineers of GHMC were asked to go for rounds to inspect manholes every day and ensure that they are repaired and covered. In another such case, residents claim that a broken cover of a manhole at Bhavani Nagar in Talabkatta has crying for attention from past six months. Sharing pictures of a toddler who suffered serious injuries after falling into the open manhole earlier this week, resident Mohammad Saleem said, “We have been requesting the authorities to close the manholes from past six months. The toddler who fell into the manhole suffered multiple fractures in her shoulder.” Saleem also highlighted the issue on Twitter recently by tagging MAUD minister KT Rama Rao. Similar instances of broken and uncovered manholes were reported at SR Nagar, Ameerpet, Erragadda, Moti Nagar, Shalibanda, Aliabanda, Lal Darwaza, Santosh Nagar, Talabkatta, Bhavani Nagar, Himatpura, Khilwat, Kishan Bagh, Bahadurpura main road, Tadbund, Nawab Saab Kunta and Jamalikunta. GHMC chief engineer M Devanand said, “During rains, if there is water stagnation somewhere, our teams working on the ground open the manhole covers to clear the stagnation, but they close it once the water recedes. However, despite taking all measures to ensure that the manholes are repaired and closed, there might be some deficiencies. In such cases, people can always send their grievance on MyGHMC app, and we will see that the problem is resolved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pits-of-hazard-open-and-damaged-manholes-a-threat-to-commuters/articleshow/84535986.cms||Moulika.KV

Justice PV Kunhikrishnan ordered the station house officer of Mulavukad police station to grant protection for the work being done for constructing a terminal for the Water Metro project at Vypeen after considering a petition filed by the contractor. The plea for police protection was filed after a supervisor was allegedly attacked by members of CPM-affiliated CITU and Congress-affiliated INTUC. The court has now ordered Mulavukad station house officer to do the needful to see that the work as per the agreement between the contractor and Kochi Water Metro is completed without any further obstruction from the unions. As per the agreement, the contractor is assigned for construction of terminals at Bolgatty, Fort Kochi, High Court, Mattancherry, and Vypin for the Water Metro project. KMRL’s counsel K Jaju Babu had submitted that the work is to be completed in a time-bound manner and is to be finished by October 29. Though the unions alleged at the high court that a labour dispute is pending with the contractor, the high court declined to interfere in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-orders-police-cover-for-water-metro-work/articleshow/84531916.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s young brigade take the political arena by storm||HYDERABAD: In what appears to be a new trend in Telangana’s political arena, younger aggressive leaders have all been appointed as presidents of their respective political parties and their mission is to strike a chord with the young voters in India’s newest state. Perhaps taking a cue from the younger pack of T Harish Rao, K Kavitha and K Taraka Rama Rao of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), both the Congress and the BJP now have younger leaders at the forefront, heading into the all-important assembly polls in 2023. “The younger leadership in a young state will make the political scene exciting. But one must see if they can bring new ideas into their leadership,” said political analyst, Professor K Nageshwar. At 51, Revanth Reddy has been entrusted the role of turning the fortunes of the Congress party. Once rulers of undivided Andhra Pradesh, the party has faced heavy defeats in recent polls, but analysts say Revanth has the zeal and aggressiveness required to win over the young voters. “Telangana’s politics is driven by welfare schemes, but aspirations and dreams of the youth also matter. This is where the younger leadership should make a difference. Politics is now more open to the youth,” Revanth told TOI. While TRS working president and minister K T Rama Rao is 44, the state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar, who took charge of the state unit last year, is 48 and has been able to make significant difference in addressing youth issues. At 47, YS Sharmila who launched her political party, YSR Telangana party recently, also belongs to this younger brigade of leaders, determined to take the fight to the opposition camp with new ideas. She made her intentions clear by announcing that her party would fight for jobs and highlight the issues of unemployment. She is also keen to take new leaders into her party rather than seniors. " I will build leaders from scratch " she said. Things changed for the BJP when D Arvind, another young leader came to the limelight after beating K Kavita in the Nizamabad Lok Sabha polls in 2019. “The success of Arvind, who is born in 1976 perhaps was a signal to the BJP to usher in younger leaders. And now you see how Bandi Sanjay has been marshalling his troops well,” said a senior BJP functionary. Bandi Sanjay, immediately after getting anointed as state president of the BJP took up youth issues and rising unemployment in the state. “Since the statehood moment this has been a concern and still remains a worry, we will fight on this issue,” he told TOI. According to him, never has so many leaders from BJP Yuva Morcha given senior roles in BJP. So far, all the younger leaders have used social media effectively to express their views, reaching out to party cadres and staying connected with the public in general. KTR has strong younger urban followers and so has Revanth and Sanjay. Political analyst S Ramakrishna said that politics is not any more “elderly” like earlier. “In the recent times, especially in the last decade, younger people are heading big roles in politics, and it’s a welcome trend,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-young-brigade-take-the-political-arena-by-storm/articleshow/84535984.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Though the seropositivity has increased compared to the first two phases of the survey, three out of the eight clusters in the city from where samples were lifted have only 53% to 63% seropositivity, demanding special focus in the adjoining neighbourhoods. Meanwhile, a health official from Madurai Corporation said that the prevalence of antibodies among the samples tested in the city increased dramatically close to 85% in the third serosurvey. It was 45% in the first survey. A total of 510 people were tested for antibodies during the third serosurvey in the city, out of which 435 people had developed antibodies. The 510 people were selected from 17 clusters in various parts of the city, he said. The third phase was completed by the first week of July in Trichy city. Random localities in eight locations were selected by the state health department without involving the local health officials in the selection process. By using the Kish method (respondent selection type), a family member in each of the houses was listed based on their age and one person was selected from the list to collect the blood sample. Adjacent houses in the localities identified were covered for better accuracy in detecting the presence of antibodies. Of the 240 samples collected from the eight clusters in Trichy at the rate of 30 samples per cluster, 168 had a high level of antibodies. Duraisamipuram, Rayarthoppu, Kallukuzhi, Pappakurichi and Eda Street have 70% to 83% seropositivity. Localities such as Jailpettai and two locations in Sangliyandapuram had less than 63% seropositivity. “The results are only for the samples collected, not for the entire area or city. But, definitely, the seropositivity rate has increased, we have to equate the results with the total population to know more about herd immunity,” a health department official said. Antibody development was attributed to prevalence of infection in the second wave of Covid-19. Officials said vaccination status was also recorded in the survey. “Jailpettai has recorded less than 60% seropositivity, the zone will be focussed more in the vaccination drives,” city health officer of Trichy Corporation Dr M Yazhini told TOI. The corporation said that even the localities that had high seropositivity rates will continue to be in surveillance with frequent RT-PCR testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/higher-seroprevalence-of-covid-19-in-trichy-madurai/articleshow/84544714.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Weekend footfall in malls ‘best so far’ post relaxation||KOLKATA: For the malls across the city, this weekend — after further relaxation of timing from July 16 and the resumption of Metro — was the best so far in one month of operations since the Covid-induced restrictions were put in place. The footfall of people and sales went northwards and it would have been better, if Metro was operating on weekends. “This weekend has been the best so far from the business point of view. Our both malls (City Centre 1 and City Centre 2) depend largely on public transport and the resumption of Metro services has added to the footfall, which has resulted in a rise in sales,” said Ramesh Pandey, director, Ambuja Neotia group. The vice president of South City Mall, Manmohan Bagree, said, “This is the best weekend we have experienced so far. Business has definitely improved. We have seen good growth compared to last year also.” The GM of Acropolis Mall, K Vijayan, echoed Bagree that this is the best weekend since relaxation. “For us, the growth in footfall this weekend was 30%-40%. Saturday was the best with 15,000-20,000 footfall. As a whole, Acropolis had witnessed over 50,000 footfall this weekend,” he said. The vice president of Quest Mall, Sanjiv Mehra, was not very gaga about the relaxation from July 16, though he feels that the situation this time is much better than the first wave. Quest is operating from 11 am to 8.30 PM. “Footfall this week was good but compared to last weekend it was more or less the same. But it is definitely much better than the situation during unlocking after the first wave,” he said. On being asked about biggest crowd puller in the malls and categories driving the growth in sale now, Bagree pointed out that food and beverages as usual is the biggest selling category now followed by electronics. In Acropolis too, the highest selling category was F& B followed by footwear, cosmetics and jewellery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weekend-footfall-in-malls-best-so-far-post-relaxation/articleshow/84533953.cms||---

Three persons at the shop were crushed to death on the spot while the remaining four are said to be critical. A few passengers and the driver also sustained injuries as the bus first crashed into the kiosk and then rammed into a tree. The injured, two of them critical, were rushed to a hospital. The deceased were identified as Suresh Kumar (40), Athar Ali (32) and Ved Pal (35). Their bodies were found disfigured, crushed under the wheels. The survivors were identified as Rama Shankar (45) and his three children Arun Kumar (20), Himanshu (8) and Vaishnavi (6). Suresh’s father was under treatment while Athar’s wife was admitted for the delivery of their baby. Ved had come to see his ailing relative. They were all sipping a cup of tea when their life came to a tragic end. Shankar’s wife was admitted to the health facility as well. He was at the kiosk with his three kids. Tilhar station house officer (SHO), Sanjay Singh, reached the site with a police team for the rescue operation. Traffic on one side of the highway was suspended for over an hour. The SHO told TOI, “The bus belonged to a transporter from Meerut and was carrying passengers from Delhi to Lucknow. It was travelling at a high speed.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala govt: Rs 27 crore sanctioned for e-Niyamasabha project||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government has sanctioned Rs 26.62 crore for the implementation of the e-Niyamasabha project, which aims at a paperless legislative assembly. As per an order issued by the finance department, the allocation is in addition to the Rs 10 crore sanctioned last year for undertaking the initial activities of the project. The funds will be used for the comprehensive computerization of the legislative procedures, functioning of the legislature secretariat and for meeting the requirements of Sabha TV. The legislative assembly has switched over to e-Niyamasabha as part of making the assembly paper-free during the tenure of the previous LDF government. However, a large number of documents are still under circulation in the physical format, especially those which are coming from the secretariat, including the answers to the questions raised by the members. The members have been complaining that many times, the answers are provided several months after raising the questions, by when, the questions themselves would have become irrelevant. To resolve the issue, the government is also in the process of integrating the secretariat electronic file flow management system with the e-Niyamasabha project. The C-DIT’s proposal worth Rs 25.68 lakh to create a digital platform to integrate the secretariat file flow management system with the e-Niyamasabha system has been cleared by the government and the work has begun. The e-Niyamasabha project has not been free of controversies either. The project, the cost of which has been worked out at Rs 53 crore, was awarded to Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), the “government accredited agency” for which several government projects are being awarded without inviting any global tender. As part of the award, the government had also sanctioned Rs 13.59 crore as the mobilization advance to ULCCS for the procurement of infrastructure and software segments of the project. This had run into a major controversy last year when the then opposition leader had sought a probe into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rs-27-crore-sanctioned-for-e-niyamasabha-project/articleshow/84531924.cms||KP Saikiran

Senior officials said they have not received any instructions from the district administration to start taking non-Covid patients. Jayashree Natesh, the medical superintendent of the CBD hospital, said over the past few weeks very few Covid patients have been admitted to the hospital and most of the beds are vacant. Admissions to the hospital began to reduce from the first week of June as the infection rate dropped in the district. This was in contrast to the situation in April and May, when all the beds of the hospitals were occupied. Natesh said the district administration has instructed the cantonment board hospital to be prepared for the third wave of Covid. Meanwhile, an oxygen plant has also been installed at the CBD hospital. The oxygen plant has the capacity of producing oxygen that could fill 38 jumbo cylinders and suffice the oxygen need of 35 to 40 patients around the clock daily. The process of recruiting paediatricians for the hospital has also been taken up by the CBD, considering that the third wave would children more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/only-5-admitted-to-deolali-cantt-covid-facility/articleshow/84529963.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kolkata||Kolkata schools line up mock tests to prepare students for CBSE boards||KOLKATA: City CBSE schools have decided to help their students get back to the habit of writing with pens, instead of using the computer keyboard, especially their Class X and XII board candidates who are preparing for the first instalment of the board exam slated to happen in November-December. With less than four months at hand to tackle the problem, schools have come up with a series of mock board exams to get children used to sitting in one place for long to write answers. Online classes have wreaked a havoc on the writing practice of students since the earlier system of submitting written assignments on a regular basis has not happened over the past 16 months. Even exams have been of short durations and children have lost the habit of sitting through long two to three-hour exams. Schools had not expected that the board exams would be divided into two slots and the first slot would be so near. They were all preparing children for the old single format exam scheduled in March 2022. Now, fresh long format exam routines, long duration writing assignments are being planned by schools that will ask students to sit on-camera and complete their work. This will help them sit in one place and continuously write without getting distracted.  “We have to train them to concentrate while sitting in one place and we will do this through long writing sessions of 90 minutes during class hours. This is over and above the 90-minute to 120-minute exams that we will put the board kids through multiple times before November,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. There is a sharp difference in approach to exams this time because children will have to appear for 50% of the syllabus in a 90-minute first instalment test in the MCQ pattern on an OMR sheet. “So many re-adjustments have to be done in less than four months. Along with syllabus completion, writing exams continuously is the only alternative,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School. The tests will prepare children for critical thinking because the questions will be far trickier in the MCQ format since there would be distractors and options that would tend to mislead and students should be prepared to eliminate them. “We have already prepared MCQ worksheets as per topics that we are about to give students for compulsory writing practice. In August, we will have a mock test and one more in September,” said Shatabdi Bhattacharya, principal of Newtown School. Vijaya Chowdhury, principal of BDM International School, said that the set format has changed now and each board examinee will have to be prepared for rigorous exam practice that will start immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-schools-line-up-mock-tests-to-prepare-students-for-cbse-boards/articleshow/84533970.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Justice Rahul Chaturvedi dismissed the anticipatory bail application filed by Khan. According to the petitioner, she was framed for political benefit by her co-workers. The syringes were recovered from the dustbin and her co-workers framed her because of personal rivalry, she pleaded. On May 30, an FIR was registered after district health officials came to know about the incident and a two-member inquiry committee was set up to look into the matter. The committee found Khan guilty of vaccine wastage and “malpractice and indiscipline”. Vaccination in charge Aarfeen Zehra was also booked as she allegedly failed to inform the authorities despite coming to know of the alleged incident. The FIR claimed that the 29 syringes were found in a dustbin were linked to Aadhaar. Additional advocate general Manish Goyal and additional government counsel AK Sand, appearing for state government, opposed the plea on the grounds that the incident was not a mistake or negligence but deliberate act by the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/no-anticipatory-bail-to-anm-for-chucking-vax-in-bin/articleshow/84536019.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Nagpur||Pvt hospital earned Rs34L more in Rs200 registration fee per Covishield dose||Nagpur: Though the central government has capped vaccination charges at private hospitals, Kingsway Hospital has earned around Rs34 lakh more by charging Rs200 per dose as registration charges in addition to the fixed rates. With starting of vaccination at more hospitals, charging of additional fee in the name of registration charges was in the news earlier too. Kingsway had claimed it stopped charging the registration fee in June, but on Sunday a beneficiary shared a July 7 bill showing the Rs200 registration fee. As per the vaccination record, Kingsway has given 23,3368 first doses by July 7. Of these, 16,965 were common people while the rest were corporate beneficaries, who were charged differently. Given that the hospital has charged an extra Rs200 from common people till this date, its extra earning stands at Rs33.93lakh. On June 10, Amit Somani, director of Kingsway Hospital, had said, “Now we are charging Rs780 for vaccination and Rs100 for hospital registration. Generally, we charge Rs200 as registration fee for OPD for new patients and it can be used throughout the year. But for vaccination a 50% discount is being given. We were assuming the revised charges would be applicable from June 21, but we were asked to implement it from June 9.” When TOI shared the July 7 bill with him on Sunday, Somani said, “It (fixed rate) was implemented on July 7 evening. We are refunding those who approach us.” The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has not taken any action despite a citizen highlighting the violations on Twitter over two weeks ago. Businessman Anand Chandwani asked what was the need to levy registration fee when beneficiaries are already registering online on Co-Win system. “I had taken my daughter for vaccination at Kingsway Hospital on July 7. I had opposed the extra Rs200 fee but the hospital staff told me it was compulsory. It was recovered from everyone. I haven’t received any call for refund despite my reluctance to pay it,” he said. TOI spoke to a couple of hospitals, like Wockhardt, Alexis and Orange City, which are also undertaking vaccination drives. Their administrations claimed they are not charging any registration fee. “We are abiding by GOI office memorandum for private Covid vaccination centers dated June 8 to charge Rs780 per dose, wherein we remitted Rs630 per dose through Co-Win portal on July 12 to acquire Covishield vaccine stock by July 16, and are limited to charge Rs150 per dose as service charges in totality. OCHRI management led by Udaybhaskar Nair has clarified that Covid vaccination drive should be undertaken as a nonprofit activity to fortify government efforts to ensure complete vaccination of all eligible citizens by December 2021,” said Dr Anup Marar, director, Orange City Hospital & Research Institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pvt-hospital-earned-rs34l-more-in-rs200-registration-fee-per-covishield-dose/articleshow/84533991.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

It is six months since GHMC poll code ended, but the flood assistance of Rs 10,000 has not been given to another five lakh families, who are still waiting for it,” AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan stated in a letter to KT Rama Rao on Sunday. Stating that continuous heavy rains in the city and surrounding areas for the past few days have again resulted in flooding of colonies, already having caused over Rs 200 crore damages for the families living in Malakpet, LB Nagar, Uppal, parts of Old City and other areas of GHMC, Sravan demanded that the government immediately announce a financial assistance towards flood relief to these families also. “It is evident that GHMC and Telangana government did not learn from their past mistakes. Wonder why issues of our sewerage system, storm water drain system are not upgraded to improve its water discharge capacity. It is shameful that even after eight months of devastating floods, the strategic nala development programme has mostly remained on paper,” Sravan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5l-families-still-waiting-for-flood-aid-of-2020-cong/articleshow/84536047.cms||---

In June, there had been 39 road accidents. Of them, 17 were fatal that claimed 18 lives. In April and May, when the second Covid wave had necessitated stricter restrictions, the number of road accidents was lower and there were fewer casualties. As per police records, in April, there were 25 road accidents. Of them, eight were fatal and eight lives were lost. In May, there were 33 accidents — 14 fatal accidents claiming as many lives. The increased rush on the roads has led to a rise in the number of accidents as motorists often indulge in rash driving and do not obey the traffic rules, said the senior officials of the city traffic branch. In January, 44 road accidents, including 16 fatal accidents, had claimed 18 lives in Nashik city. In February, the number of accidents increased to 49. Nine of them were fatal and 9 lives were lost. March had 52 accidents, including 20 fatal mishaps that claimed 22 lives. This year, till June-end, there have been a total of 84 fatal accidents and 89 people have died. Last year, during the same period, there had been 76 fatal accidents and 79 people had died, as per the police records. Police officials said rash driving was the main cause of accidents on city roads. Moreover, many people also do not follow traffic rules. The police take action against as many motorists as possible who are found breaking the traffic rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/relaxation-in-curbs-drives-rise-in-nashik-city-road-accidents/articleshow/84529987.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Lucknow||On Nishad turf, BJP props up Jai to counter assertive Sanjay||Lucknow: A day after BJP appointed its Rajya Sabha MP Jai Prakash Nishad as state convener of fishermen cell in its UP unit, the spotlight shifted to the saffron party’s strategic move to prop up a new most backward caste (MBC) face to counter an assertive NISHAD party president Sanjay Nishad, who has been bargaining hard with the BJP brass in run-up to assembly elections next year. Sources said, BJP has been swiftly shifting gears to take on NISHAD party chief, more than a month after he met home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda and projected himself as the sole torchbearer of the Mallah vote-bank, which accounts for 18% of the total OBC block. Sanjay had been seeking a ministerial berth in the Union cabinet for his son, Pravin Nishad, a BJP MP from Sant Kabir Nagar. If that was not enough, he ruffled feathers of BJP leadership by throwing up the demand of being projected as party’s deputy CM face in the assembly elections. Both his demands, however, fell flat. Sanjay Nishad had stung BJP in 2018 when his son Pravin contested as a BSP-backed SP candidate and defeated BJP candidate Upendra Shukla during bypolls for Gorakhpur Lok sabha seat, which was vacated after Yogi Adityanath took over reins as CM. The win in Yogi’s political backyard had charged up the Opposition even as SP and BSP cobbled up an alliance for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Party sources said, Jai Prakash will now be tasked to work in around 130 assembly seats, including those in Gorakhpur, which have Nishad voters in substantial numbers. As a matter of fact, the Nishad community along with 16 other sub-caste among MBC, including Kahar, Kashyap, Kewat, Nishad, Bind, Bhar, Prajapati, Rajbhar, Batham, Gaur, Tura, Majhi, Mallah, Kumhar, Dheemar, Dhivar and Machua have been seeking inclusion in SC list. Importantly, the politics around the Nishad community is not new. Just ahead of 2017 assembly elections, the Akhilesh Yadav government had given its assent to include 17 Other Backward Castes in the SC list. Before that in March 2013, the UP Assembly passed a resolution asking the Centre to include 17 castes of the state in the SC category. “The socio-economic status of Nishads is not better than that of Dalits, but they have a strong political presence in east UP,” said sociologist and former director of Giri Institute of Social Sciences, Prof Ajit Kumar Singh. He said the community got bargaining power following BJP’s concerted attempts to consolidate the non-Yadav OBC communities. Jai Prakash Nishad got elected to Rajya Sabha in August 2020, following a bypoll necessitated by the death of SP MP Beni Prasad Verma. His tenure in the upper house will be till July 4, next year. A native of Gorakhpur, Jai Prakash happens to be a BSP turncoat. During previous Mayawati’s regime, he was nominated for UP Rajya Ekikaran Parishad and was given a ministerial rank ahead of 2009 Lok sabha elections. In 2012 UP assembly elections, he got elected from Chauri Chaura on a BSP ticket, but lost to BJP’s Sangeeta Yadav in 2017 state elections. A year later, he joined BJP and was immediately made party’s vice-president of Gorakhpur region. He was later appointed member of the Poorvanchal development board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-nishad-turf-bjp-props-up-jai-to-counter-assertive-sanjay/articleshow/84536063.cms||Pankaj Shah

They rummage through leaves on the forest floor to pick up the black seeds that have fallen under the shade of sandalwood trees and return home by evening. She is one among the 110 local people in the forest protection group at the Marayoor division who are engaged in collecting sandalwood tree seeds and helping the country increase its sandalwood wealth. “We get Rs 300 per kg for sandalwood seeds from the forest department. We collect it when we have no other work. Last year, I collected around 15kg seeds during the seed collection period (September-December),” says Pappa. She says last year the group collected 2,864 kg sandalwood tree seeds from the protected areas of the forest division spread around 11sqkm. As much as 2,500 kg seeds they collected were sold to forest departments and private parties in other states. “We sold only less than 300 kg in Kerala. Rest of the seeds were sold to states such as Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh at Rs 1,500 per kg,” says Binoji K V, facilitator of participatory forest management in Marayoor. A 1 kg bag contains around 3,00-3,500 seeds and 80-90% of them germinate in ideal conditions. It is the quality of the seeds that is driving up the demand for them from other states. “The seedlings have greener leaves and they grow faster compared to seeds from elsewhere. Besides, we are certain they belong to the original mother trees in Marayoor. For growing sandalwood plantations, seed quality is important,” said a Karnataka forest department official in Kolar area. Dr Syam Viswanath, director of Kerala Forest Research Institute, said Marayoor sandalwood trees are unique compared to other local species. “As the sandalwood trees in Marayoor are more than 40–50 years old, quality is assured. We can extract maximum 6% oil content from older trees as against 3-4% from trees that are around 15 years old. Marayoor is a rain shadow region and is ideal for hardwood fromation of sandalwood trees,” he says. Forest officials have been shelling out more funds and increasing its manpower to protect the age old trees in Marayoor. “We do not chop live trees for auction. Trees that die naturally or those that have been uprooted are the ones that are auctioned,” said M G Vinod Kumar, Marayoor range forest officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/marayoor-residents-help-nation-increase-its-sandalwood-wealth/articleshow/84531960.cms||T C Sreemol

Umargam received maximum rainfall of over 225 in 12 hours till 6pm on Sunday. The taluka received 200 mm inches of rainfall in just two hours between 6am and 8am. Industrial town of Vapi too was lashed with nearly 225 mm rain during the same period followed by 150 mm in Navsari’s Jalalpore taluka and Valsad each. Among other areas, Gandevi, Khergam and Chikhli talukas in Navsari and Kamrej and Bardoli in Surat district also heavily drenched. Lives in Valsad and Navsari towns were thrown out of gear as water entered houses and shops of people living in several low-lying areas. Locals said that even after rain stopped later in the afternoon waters did not recede and questioned the preparedness of the civic bodies. “There was one foot water in our house and since it did not recede, we were forced to move the furniture to a height and remove water using buckets,” said a resident of Umargam. Due to incessant downpour, many underpasses became inaccessible. Yet some commuters who tried wading through the water on the vehicles were rescued from gushing waters of a creek near Sarigam underpass by firemen. “Our team rescued a truck driver, four motorcyclists, a car driver who were stuck in the gushing waters,” said a fireman. He added that one biker is still missing and a rescue operation was underway to find him. During the search, a couple of bikes which were dragged away were recovered. Stray incidents of falling of trees were also reported on Dharampur road bringing traffic to a standstill. Surat city, on the other hand, received rainfall throughout the night and later in the afternoon giving a much-needed relief to citizens from heat and humidity. More rain forecast India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned fishermen to not venture out into the Arabian Sea along the north and south Gujarat coasts till July 21 owing to ‘active monsoon conditions’ and with wind speed too likely to reach 60 km per hour. IMD officials also said that the heavy rainfall on Sunday was due to a cyclonic circulation lying over south Gujarat and neighbouring regions. It has predicted heavy rainfall in parts of the state till Tuesday morning. Birds rescued from an uprooted tree Sunday’s heavy rains uprooted a huge tree in Navsari district rendering 40 birds, shelterless. On receiving information about it, volunteers of Nature Club Surat rescued these birds and brought them to their centre to support and treat them. The birds include sub-adult and baby open bill storks and baby pond herons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/south-gujarat-pounded-umargam-lashed-by-200mm-in-two-hours/articleshow/84531997.cms||---

Community medicine experts of Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur medical colleges are partnering with the public transport corporation for analyzing the health condition of its staff and to determine underlying causes for morbidity and rising mortality. In 2021 itself, around 60 KSRTC staff died of various co-morbidities. The team is going through death data of staff from various depots from across the state in the past two-three years. The health experts are now attending KSRTC’s skill-development training sessions to take the drivers and conductors through various facets of the survey. The experts said quantitative and qualitative assessment are being done as part of the project. “The employees are asked to fill in a questionnaire on a web-based platform that will address various factors that govern their mental and physical wellbeing. This will throw light on their dietary habits, physical activities, addiction and access to healthcare. We will also hold focus group discussions and interactive sessions to build on the preliminary data. In addition, issues like burnout syndrome will also be addressed. Occupational risks being borne by the body due to the nature of their work will also be studied,” said a community medicine expert who is part of the team doing the study. The health team will submit a set of recommendations to improve the working conditions and to offset the factors which have a debilitating impact on the mental and physical health of the staff. Transport secretary and KSRTC MD Biju Prabhakar the project was kicked off in the wake of a rise in die-in harness appointments in the corporation. “ I had first-hand experience of their hardships when I had driven a bus. There was hardly any air circulation and the heat was intolerable. Being exposed to such stressful and tiring conditions for longer hours take a toll on your body. This was the reason why we pitched the need for bottle holders and insulation covers on bonnetWith a studied analysis we will be able to arrive at solutions and implement changes that augur well for our staff,” said Prabhakar. Poulin Tania Feriah, deputy manager- HR, KSRTC said the morbidity assessment is aimed at improving the physical, mental and occupational health of drivers and conductors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ksrtc-goes-for-morbidity-assessment-of-employees/articleshow/84531990.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Pune||Met department forecasts moderate rainfall for Pune till Saturday||PUNE: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday forecast moderate rainfall over the city till Saturday. Several areas of the city and district received some spells of rain. The met department recorded 10.6mm and 2.8mm rainfall at Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories, respectively. The sky conditions from afternoon hours had mainly remained overcast. Towards the evening hours, dark cloudy conditions were seen across the district. The ghat areas of the district received heavy to very heavy rainfall mostly in the evening hours, an official from the met department said. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecast division of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “The rainfall activity over the district will activate in the coming days. At present, the presence of upper air circulation over North Madhya Maharashtra, off shore trough between the Arabian sea to the Kerala coast is active. The westerly winds coming from the Arabian sea are strong. All four meteorological divisions of Maharashtra will receivet rainfall because of these weather conditions.” The district has received 312.9mm rainfall, so far, which is below normal (317.1 mm) rainfall by one percent. The subdued rainfall in the first three weeks of July is the main reason behind this scenario, a met official said. The intensity of the rainfall is likely to increase Wednesday onwards as there is a possibility of formation of low pressure area over North West Bay of Bengal, a met official said. The IMDs extended rainfall between July 23 to July 29 has forecast normal rainfall over the state. Meanwhile, officials from the state agriculture department said that the moderate rainfall would give fillip to the farming activities in the district.  Sowing of kharif season crops and paddy cultivation has been stopped for the last two weeks. “As the ghat areas of Bhor, Velhe, Maval, Mulshi, Ambegaon and Junnar are getting rainfall for the last two days, the main paddy cultivation activity has already commenced there,” a senior agriculture official from the Pune district agriculture department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/met-dept-forecasts-moderate-rainfall-for-city-till-saturday/articleshow/84534018.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik Municipal Corporation rules out reopening of schools in Nashik||NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has ruled out the reopening of schools in Nashik city even though district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal had instructed the civic body to consider the possibility. Bhujbal had said that he would also write to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on this matter. The state government has allowed the schools to reopen for students of Classes VIII to XII in villages that have been Covid-free for at least one month. Accordingly, 333 schools in the Nashik district villages are expected to reopen from Monday. However, in the city, NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said several Covid cases are still being reported from all the six divisions. “For any school to reopen, the area where the school is located should not have reported a Covid-positive case during the past month. In the city, there is no such place that has been Covid-free even though the overall number of cases has reduced,” said Nagargoje. NMC’s education officer Sunita Dhangar also said it is difficult to reopen the schools given that positive cases are being reported in all areas of the city. “The government GR talks of reopening schools in the rural areas that have been Covid-free for a month. The district disaster management authority may take a call on that. But in Nashik city, it is difficult to reopen the schools right now,” said Dhangar. The number of active Covid patients in the city had increased from 500 in February to 28,000 in April during the second wave of the pandemic. The situation has improved since. At present, the city has only 643 active patients. Of them, 607 are undergoing treatment in civic and private hospitals, while the remaining 36 are under home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-rules-out-reopening-of-schools-in-nashik-city/articleshow/84530054.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kolkata||11% rise in Kolkata’s nitrogen dioxide pollution this year; least among 8 state capitals: Report||KOLKATA: A recent report titled “Behind the Smokescreen” by Greenpeace India reveals that a year after the initial nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution has increased by 11% in the city. Though the rise is the least in Kolkata among eight most populous state capitals, the NO2 pollution affects health, especially respiratory and circulatory systems and the brain. Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Jaipur, Lucknow and Delhi saw the maximum rise in the NO2 pollution between April 2020 and April 2021. Comparing with April, 2020, it was higher by 125% in Delhi, 94% in Chennai, 52% in Mumbai, 90% in Bengaluru, 47% in Jaipur, 52% in Mumbai, 32% in Lucknow and 69% in Hyderabad in the same month this year. In Kolkata, the NO2 air pollution was 11% higher in April this year than in the same month, last year. The study estimated that 1.3 million children in India live with asthma due to chronic exposure to the NO2 pollution from vehicles, power plants and factories. “The air quality levels in these cities are alarming. The cities and the people are already paying a huge price for our over-reliance on burning fossil fuels. People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown, though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic,” said Avinash Chanchal, senior climate campaigner, Greenpeace India. “As per CSIR NEERI, a massive 25% of particulate matter pollution in Kolkata comes from vehicular emissions. It’s largely anthropogenic and hence it is solvable through stringent measures. Vehicles are the largest contributor to air pollution in Kolkata and we must find ways to promote cycles, electric vehicles in the city at a rapid pace, or we may be staring at another health crisis in the coming years,” said Vinay Jaju, SwitchON Foundation, a network partner of Greenpeace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/11-rise-in-kols-no2-pollution-this-yr-least-among-8-state-capitals-report/articleshow/84534048.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Hyderabad||Allow competitive exams in regional languages: KTR||HYDERABAD: Industries, IT and municipal minister KT Rama Rao on Sunday urged Union minister of state Jitendra Singh to permit candidates taking competitive exams, conducted by the government, to write in regional languages also. In a letter to science and technology minister Jitendra Singh, KTR stated that every year many candidates from different states appear for competitive exams for recruitment in central services, departments and undertakings through Union Public Service Commission and other recruitment agencies. “These competitive exams are held in only English and Hindi, which is a serious disadvantage to students who did not study in English medium or not from Hindi-speaking states,” he said. “Telangana CM Sri K Chandrasekhar Rao wrote a letter to PM @NarendraModi ji requesting to permit candidates taking all competitive exams of central government to write in regional languages also. I am aware of the fact that the Union cabinet approved the proposal to set up National Recruitment Agency which has decided to facilitate a common eligibility test (NRA-CET) to replace multiple examinations for recruitment to central government jobs and conduct these examinations in 12 Indian languages. I wholeheartedly appreciate and welcome the move,” KTR stated. However, it’s very unfortunate to note that these changes were not being implemented properly. This comes as a rude shock to applicants belonging to regional languages, who are forced to lose great opportunities, he said. “Keeping this in view, I humbly request you to look into this issue and permit candidates taking all competitive exams of government, its departments and undertakings held through UPSC, RRB, PSBs, RBI, SSC, etc. to write in regional languages also. Until a proper implementation policy is decided on these regional languages issue, I request you to withhold the recruitment process for notifications already announced and refrain from issuing new job notifications,” KTR urged in his letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/allow-competitive-exams-in-regional-languages-ktr/articleshow/84536112.cms||---
---||Nagpur||MoEFCC ‘no’ to skywalk project in Chikhaldara||Nagpur: The MoEFCC has rejected the Maharashtra government’s proposal to grant Stage-I forest clearance to the construction of the world’s first single cable rope suspension bridge (Skywalk) connecting Hurricane Point & Goreghat Point at Chikhaldara hill station. The Rs 38.21-crore venture is being executed by City & Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Limited (CIDCO) and plans to boost tourism. Though the project falls under the jurisdiction of the Chikhaldara Municipal Council, Amravati, it needs diversion of 0.9286 hectares of dense reserve forest land, equivalent to over two football fields. The proposed forest land in the East Melghat division is part of the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) and also the buffer area of the Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR). On March 15, 2021, the state government sought forest clearance for the project under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act (FCA), 1980. However, last month, the MoEFCC rejected the CIDCO proposal stating that it is non-site specific and can be located on non-forest land. “The proposed area is part of the MTR and supports unique ecological habitat. It is among the last remaining less fragmented tiger territories supplemented by various rare endangered threatened (RET) species of flora and fauna and hence the area needs a high level of conservation and protection,” says the MoEFCC reply to the state. The MoEFCC further clarified that “Chikhaldara is already a favorite hill station and safari hotspot. Any further plans to increase the inflow of tourists should be considered only after conducting a study of ecological tourism and carrying capacity. Hence, the proposal is rejected as per FCA provisions.” “As per the provisions laid down under Para 1.15 of the ‘Handbook on FCA’, published in 2019, there should not be any justification for locating non-site-specific projects on forest land. Therefore, the state government should scrutinize the alternatives in more detail and must give complete justification establishing its inescapability for locating the project in forest area,” said MoEFCC officials on anonymity. Talking to TOI, CIDCO executive engineer Devendra Jamnikar said, “The proposal was approved by officials concerned after much thought and hence, the state recommended it to MoEFCC. The 407-metre-long skywalk, with a depth of 500 feet from the ground, is the first such single cable bridge in the world. Most of these projects in other countries are double cable bridges.” Jamnikar added, “Chikhaldara is the only hill station in Marathwada and Vidarbha region and hence, the project has huge potential to boost direct and indirect employment through tourism. It will also supplement tiger tourism in MTR. We’ve already completed 70% work on the project spending over Rs 23 crores in the last two years.” The CIDCO official said only 0.9826-hectare forest land is needed and even out of this area, 0.8126 hectare consists of overhanging parts which will have no direct footprint of the forest land. Tourists will be using the overhanging bridge to walk across the deep valley and hence it will not have an impact on wildlife. However, wildlife experts alleged both the deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) and chief conservator of forests (CCF), Amravati, were ambiguous while recommending the project in 2018. The CCF did not visit the site and relied on the DyCF report. The DyCF recommended the project ignoring wildlife concerns. The concerns expressed by the MoEFCC that the proposed forest area has rare and endemic species of flora and fauna were mentioned negatively by the DyCF in his report. The DyCF also hid the fact that the project falls in the ESZ and proposed forest land is part of tiger reserve. While recommending the proposal, the forest officials also ignored the fact that such linear projects require clearance from the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) followed by National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) and gave a go-ahead to the project stating no wildlife clearance is required. CIDCO officials said, “We have appointed a team of experts to expedite clearances. A revised report will be submitted soon to seek Stage-I clearance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/moefcc-no-to-skywalk-project-in-chikhaldara/articleshow/84534057.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Not fully operational, flood warning system didn’t help||MUMBAI: A flood forecasting and warning system for the city, launched by the state government last year, is not yet fully operational and did not give any warning of Saturday night’s heavy rain, said BMC officials. Besides, the installation of four more Doppler weather radars — two in the city, and one each in Thane and Navi Mumbai — to get a more accurate weather forecast is also delayed, though these were supposed to be ready by the 2020 monsoon. The Integrated Flood Warning System for Mumbai (iFLOWS-Mumbai) is one of just two such urban flood warning systems in the country — the other being in Chennai — developed by the ministry of earth science (MoES) through collaborations with top research institutions. The MoES initiated the development of iFLOWS-Mumbai in July 2019 using in-house expertise in close coordination with the BMC, and was formally launched by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and the then union minister Harsh Vardhan on June 12 last year. The system is supposed to provide early warning for flooding during high rainfall events and cyclones, using detailed topographical data to generate highly localised pictures of inundation as early as two days ahead of the event. There was no extreme rain event warning for Saturday night from the IMD, said a civic official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This may have been because there were no typical monsoon systems such as a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal or monsoon trough, making the event tough to predict, said experts. The heavy rain was due to in situ convective clouds, said an official. A query to Dr Jayanta Sarkar, scientist and head, IMD (Mumbai), went unanswered. “For such storms, we need the radar,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist. “However, the radar is currently producing images at one-hour intervals — as against the optimum 15 minutes — and this is too late for real-time disaster management.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbainot-fully-operational-flood-warning-system-didnt-help/articleshow/84536197.cms||Richa Pinto

Hackers took control of the data in his laptop and to decrypt the data, demanded a ransom in the form of cryptocurrency worth Rs20 lakh Sumit Kumar’s data saved in his laptop was encrypted by hackers, who demanded ransom in the form of cryptocurrency worth Rs50 lakh. In June and July, the cybercrime cell of the Pune police received four such complaints from software engineers working in Pune. Hackers locked their data and demanded ransom to encrypt it. “None of the techies paid ransom; they approached the police,” senior inspector D S Hake of the cybercrime police said. “We have received four such complaints in June and July,” Hake said. Police said the techies were working from home because of the pandemic and that they were either using unsecured internet connections or had not updated their firewalls. The hackers targeted their data, especially important files that had been compressed by the techies to transmit from their laptops to their official clients or their offices. “These important compressed files were encrypted by the hackers, who demanded ransom to decrypt the data,” Hake said. He said those targeted by ransomware attacks should always approach the police instead of caving to the hackers’ demands. In these four cases, the techies received ransom emails from the hackers. “The hackers generally use fake and fabricated domain names and route their mails to their possible victims via many servers,” Hake said, explaining why it was hard to track down the perpetrators. “Once the mail is opened by the victim, the hackers gain access to the laptop. They take control and encrypt the data, and demand ransom in form of cryptocurrency,” he explained. “The victims can only receive messages from the hackers on their laptops; nothing else works,” he said. Hake said such cases were usually extremely difficult to solve and that techies and those dealing with important data must take precautions. “A well-known form of malware, ransomware ruthlessly holds a computer’s data for ransom via encryption. If the user doesn’t pay the cybercriminal a certain amount of money within a stipulated period, their data will be lost forever,” Rohan Nyayadhish, a cybercrime expert, said, adding, “The hackers ask users to pay ransom in cryptocurrency like bitcoin. If the ransom is not paid on time, the amount is doubled. If payment is not made, the data is deleted,” Nyayadhish said, adding, ““This malware not only spreads by itself rapidly, but also evolves quickly to avoid any attempts at mitigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hackers-use-ransomware-to-target-techies-demand-cryptocurrency/articleshow/84534025.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Anil Ghosh, who according to Sandip Ray made sure that Ray’s iconic frames of classics including ‘Sonar Kella’ and ‘Hirak Rajar Deshe’ didn’t go out of focus, lost his only son in the Stephen Court fire. On Ray’s centenary year, Ghosh is now finding it tough to make ends meet.  Sandip Ray, who too has worked with him, has high regards for Ghosh. “On my father’s centenary, very few from his unit are still around. Anilda’s job was very important. An out of focus shot will never work despite the best performance of actors. Back in the day, the job of a focus puller was complicated. Measuring tapes had to be used to gauge distances. There was a lot of room for taking decisions based on estimate and experience. It will be great if arrangements are made to help him,” he said. A file photograph of Satyajit Ray with Anil Ghosh Ghosh, who has worked in close to 300 films including the ones with Ray, now lives with his wife and their memories in a modest house on Chander Village Road. In his living room almirah sit pretty the trophies collected over the years and a photograph of son Ankush who he lost in 2010. Close by is a laminated photo of him with Ray following Babita in the sequence where she is raped in the forest in ‘Ashani Sanket’. This is one of the famous photos by Nemai Ghosh. The background is a blur where the photographer had tried to capture the movement of the tracking shot with Ray and his focus puller.  It’s been 11 years since Ghosh was bereaved. The scars haven’t healed yet. Loneliness and financial insecurity during the pandemic have only worsened the pain. “My son was a sales manager in a company that had its office at Stephen Court. On that fateful day, he was standing on Park Street when he saw the building going ablaze. Immediately he rushed inside to save his team without worrying about his own safety,” he said. The trauma left him sick. “We even had to undergo DNA tests to see if they matched with that of a charred body. After seven days of relentless search, Ankush’s body was found and identified by my wife,” he remembered. Anil Ghosh at his house on Chander Village Road Now the only time his eyes twinkle with joy is when he talks about his three decades with Ray who had first recruited him as a caretaker for his Ariflex camera. Subsequently, he had graduated to assisting cinematographer Soumendu Roy before working as a co-cameraman in Ray’s unit. “Manik da would always ask me to work with others as well. He would insist that the more I work with everyone, the greater the chance of honing my skills and improving my perfection,” he said, mentioning how he has also worked in Tarun Majumdar’s ‘Nimantran’, ‘Kuheli’, Aurobindo Mukherjee’s ‘Nishipadma’, ‘Agniswar’, Pijush Bose’s ‘Sabyasachi’, Bijoy Bose’s ‘Saheb’, Robi Ghosh’s ‘Sadhu Judhishthirer Karcha’ with Jaya Bachchan and Ashoke Viswanathan’s ‘Sesh Sanghat’ among others.  His favourite Ray film remains ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (GGBB)’. “A tiger from a circus was used for ‘GGBB’. I climbed up the trolley along with Manik da who was operating the camera. While taking the shot, the camera was moving close to the tiger. I was quite a daredevil and wasn’t scared with Manik da around. But Boudi (Ray’s wife), who was standing a little away, told me: ‘Anil, don’t go any closer’. Thankfully, the shot went off well and the tiger didn’t harm anyone,” he said. A file photograph of Anil Ghosh with Jaya Bachchan during the shooting of 'Sadhu Judhishthirer Karcha' that was directed by actor Robi Ghosh Unlike many octogenarians, Ghosh’s memory is still sharp and recollections of Ray anecdotes very engaging. He talks about how his own ‘Santikentani bag’ that was used to keep various knickknacks of Ray became a prop for ‘Joy Baba Felunath’ when the director asked Santosh Dutta to use it during the shooting. “Manik da’s biggest asset was his ability to take extraordinary shots with ordinary cameras. Before taking a shot, he would discuss it at length with everyone and then take the final call. Just watching him being agile on the sets and go to any length to get the right shot was a lesson by itself,” he said, recalling the legend’s impromptu decision to shoot the final scene of ‘Sadgati’ when he saw the rain clouds approaching while shooting for a different scene. “He had predicted that the rains would last for an hour. In reality, the rains had lasted for 65 minutes. Since there was a mad rush to complete the work in the rains, everyone including Smita Patil and Om Puri had helped so that we could take more than 100 ft of trolley shot easily,” he added.  During the filming of ‘Shatranj Ke Khilari’, he had developed a good rapport with the likes of Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan. “By the time we finished filming, even Sir Richard Attenborough started to address Ray as Manik da just the way we did,” he recalled. A file photograph of Anil Ghosh during the shooting of 'Jana Aranya' One of Ghosh’s greatest rewards was the day the legend praised him for instantly getting the “perfect lens” to shoot a “candid shot” of two butterflies for ‘Ashani Sanket’. “When Roy da (Soumendu Roy) had to leave to shoot a big film, Manik da insisted that I stay back with his unit. That’s how much he loved me and my work,” he said.  Once while shooting on a busy Burrabazar street for ‘Jana Aranya’, Ray had accidentally trampled over a basket of guavas. “To compensate the loss of the four or five guavas that had toppled over, he had asked his assistant to get the fruit seller’s address. The man was paid three days’ of remuneration for three-four shots that were taken of him at the Indrapuri studio. Had Manik da been around today, I am sure he would have done something to help me tide over my financial insecurity,” he recalled. A file photograph of Anil Ghosh during the shooting of 'Ashani Sanket' Some months back, few actors including Rajesh Sharma and Debdut Ghosh have visited him at his residence. “With such an incredible body of work, Anil da is our pride. It is sad to see how badly the pandemic has impacted him,” said Debdut Ghosh. Soumitra Chatterjee, who shared a great rapport with Ghosh, had helped to get Ghosh’s eye surgery done. “He was like my elder brother. He too is gone now. During the pandemic, I can’t go for checkups or afford the expensive medicines now. I refuse to beg, have no work and little savings. It is a hand-to-mouth existence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fin-crisis-fading-vision-leave-rays-focus-puller-in-dire-straits-at-80/articleshow/84534134.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

They further claimed some of them had been merged due to vaccine hesitancy among the disabled. Abha Khetarpal, the president of NGO Cross the Hurdles, who is wheelchair-bound, claimed, “I called most of the centres listed on the Delhi government website. The one at Tilak Nagar, which is closest to my house, was only meant for refugees. The centres at RK Puram and Rohini weren’t for people with disabilities.” Most such centres are in government schools. “The centres at Surajmal Vihar, Shakti Nagar and other places did not respond to phone calls. Even the helpline number 1031 was not working,” claimed Khetarpal. Preeti Johar, CEO at NGO Family of Disabled, said, “A mother took her child to Tilak Nagar after a lot of efforts, but found the centre closed. When we came to know of it through social media, we helped them. That centre is now catering to refugees. We spoke to the nodal officer so that PwDs could get vaccinated there.” The NGO helps PwDs reach vaccination centres and they call them a day in advance to reserve the vaccine. “There is hesitancy among PwDs. During our drives in Dwarka, we helped 50 people daily. We were told that in the last two months just 11 disabled were vaccinated because of which the centres were merged. Earlier, no publicity, proper sensitisation and general awareness campaign was undertaken. But it has started now,” said Johar. Responding to the claims, a Delhi government official said vaccination centres meant for specially abled persons were functional, but due to the lack of vaccines, inoculation at some of the centres had to be paused. As the stock was not being supplied at full capacity, some centres were unable to function. Government sources said a special site was started on May 27 and 187 disabled people had been vaccinated till date. Earlier, the site was with the social welfare office and messages were sent to over 1,200 people for vaccination. On June 22, the site was shifted to Sarvodya Vidyalaya, Tilak Nagar. While 84 people were vaccinated at the previous location, 103 were given the shots at the school. The DDA community hall at Avantika, Rohini is a dedicated centre for PwDs. However, due to less footfall it had also been opened to the general public. In Shahdara district, a dedicated centre exists at RPVV Surajmal Vihar, but it is temporarily closed due to non-availability of Covishield.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lack-of-vaccine-availability-mars-functioning-of-centres-for-disabled/articleshow/84534164.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Mumbai||For every degree of warming, 6-7% rise in daily rain likely, says scientist||MUMBAI: Sounding alarm bells for Indian cities, scientists have warned that short bursts of intense rainfall are likely to increase with global warming. The international Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions causing global warming aims to keep global temperature increase to below 2 degrees. The study also found that increases in three-hour extremes were almost twice that of daily precipitation for the same warming scenarios. For every degree of warming, one can generally expect a 6% to 7% increase in daily rainfall, says Vimal Mishra, a scientist with IIT-Gandhinagar who co-authored the study. That’s because the atmosphere’s capacity to hold water increases when temperature increases. But short-duration precipitation seems to be more sensitive to warming. “In most places, we found that sub-daily precipitation extremes are increasing faster than daily extremes—that it’s more sensitive to warming,” Mishra says. Interestingly, another study last year found that daily rainfall extremes did not increase beyond a certain level with rising temperatures—but three-hour extremes did. One reason for that, says IIT-Bombay professor Subimal Ghosh, could be that there isn’t enough moisture in the air most of the time to maintain that level of precipitation for a whole day. “If rainfall is coming down at 100mm an hour, there is enough moisture supply in the atmosphere for three hours of that, but not for 24 hours,” says Ghosh, His study also found that short-duration high-intensity rainfall events are intensifying with warming, leading to “extreme streamflow” in smaller catchments like urban ones. This trend is critical, he says, because sudden bursts of rain are more likely to lead to flash floods that leave little time for evacuation or warning. The trend is also risky for cities because outdated storm water drains and concretisation prevent drainage, leading to flooding of the kind seen on Sunday. Mumbai is currently expanding its storm water drain capacity from 25 mm of rainfall an hour to 50mm an hour, but what it needs now are systems that can handle more than 100 mm of rainfall in an hour, said Kapil Gupta, an urban drainage expert at IIT Bombay. Gupta, who advised the National Disaster Management Authority on new urban flooding guidelines, recommends increasing capacity for a climate change scenario, keeping rivers and drains clear, and building underground storage tanks to absorb extra water. “We need to upgrade our systems to account for increasing extremes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-for-every-degree-of-warming-6-7-rise-in-daily-rain-likely-says-scientist/articleshow/84537572.cms||Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar
---||Pune||Pune: Move to expand use of credit notes faces opposition||PUNE: A group of political leaders have voiced their opposition to the expansion of the credit notes system for various charges at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) since they claim the decision will impact the civic body’s revenue. PMC’s standing committee has expanded the scope of the payment facility available to developers. The notes can now be used to pay property tax, sky sign department tax, road-digging charges and water charges. The civic body had allowed credit notes only for building permissions when they were first approved in January. These notes are given to road contractors for construction on public private partnership (PPP) basis. In such a situation, credit certificates help build roads and bridges without giving cash to developers as PMC has lost a lot of revenue to the pandemic. A proposal to review the expansion has been given to the city improvement committee. “If such certificates can be used to repay different civic charges, it will hamper the revenue. The cash flow will reduce. Property tax and building permissions are key sources of income for PMC. If these suffer, it will cause major financial losses to the civic body,” said Ulhas Bagul, leader of Congress in PMC. “The use of credit notes will cause problems for the civic administration. The dependency on credit notes will dismantle the well-organised financial system of the civic body,” said NCP corporator Prashant Jagtap. “This initiative will help complete long-pending road works. This will not only improve road infrastructure, but also help develop areas. Residential and commercial activities will gain momentum once better road connectivity is available. Income sources have reduced so the PPP model is the need of the hour,” said standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane. He added that limited credit notes will be allotted per year so there won’t be an adverse impact on PMC coffers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/move-to-expand-use-of-credit-notes-faces-opposition/articleshow/84534144.cms||---

Additionally, the Koyna Express, which goes to Kolhapur from Mumbai (CSMT) via Pune, was also cancelled,” Manoj Jhawar, the public relations officer at the Pune rail division, said. However, officials from the Central Railway claimed that there was no disruption in train traffic on the ghat sections till now. “A close eye is being kept and all stations are on alert. The loco pilots too have been told to stay on full alert. As of now, the ghat sections remain unaffected and there is no information about any landslides,” anotherrailway official said. In total train movements were hit badly. As many as 11 trains got short terminated, while six trains got cancelled across the division. According to the Central Railway’s latest bulletin, some of the trains that were short terminated at different stations included Patna-LTT Special, Hyderabad-Mumbai special, Bhubaneswar-Mumbai special, Gorakhpur-LTT special, Amritsar-Mumbai special, among others. The trains that had been cancelled included Mumbai-Amravati special, Mumbai-Gadag special, Mumbai-Secunderabad special, Mumbai-Nanded special, Mumbai-Manmad special and Jalna-Mumbai special. “As many as nine trains were rescheduled as per the bulletin published at 4:30pm. Most of the trains were long distance express trains and some of them included LTT-Thiruvananthapuram special, LTT-Mangaluru special, Mumbai-Bhubaneswar special, LTT-Chennai special, Mumbai-Nagpur special, Mumbai-Puri special, LTT-Jaynagar special, among others,” the official added. “The rain is continuing and is heavy. Hence, all caution is being taken by the rail officials. At this moment, it is difficult to say whether the inter-city trains would resume operations on Monday,” a rail official said. Earlier this year, the Central Railway officials were carrying out maintenance works on the ghat sections including identification and removal of loose boulders to prevent any landslide incidents, were were frequent during the monsoons. In 2019, multiple landslides had hit the ghat sections causing a train derailment too. The sections had to be closed for months for repairs. Railways have decided to cancel 01157/01158 Pune-Solapur-Pune Hutatma Express Special till August 31 because of engineering blocks for the ongoing doubling of tracks work between Bhalwani and Bhigwan (single line section) in Solapur division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tracks-submerged-3-pune-to-mumbai-trains-cancelled/articleshow/84534088.cms||Joy Sengupta

Most of the community members are into various businesses, which have suffered in the pandemic. However, unlike last year, this Eid is expected to witness some activity as norms have been relaxed after fall in Covid cases. At the Bakra Mandi set up ahead of the Eid opposite grain market, there has not been much activity, and traders say fewer customers are coming this time. “Last Eid, people had money that they had earned before the lockdown. But this time, successive lockdowns and restrictions have affected them badly. People don’t have money to eat, how can we expect them to buy sacrificial animals? Last year, we sold a good number of bakras at the mandi, but this time we may not do much business,” says Muhammad Islam, a goat seller who runs a meat shop at New Subhash Nagar. Another trader, Haji Ehsaan, echoes Muhammad Islam. “The Bakra Mandi was set up about a week ago and till now traders have sold around 1,200 sheep or goats whereas last year the corresponding number was 5,000. Traders are hoping to sell their stock, but many customers go back without buying. We hope and pray that things improve two days ahead of Eid,” says Haji Ehsaan. “We buy sheep or goat on every Bakr Eid and will buy this year too, but many community members may not. Lockdowns, restrictions and inflation have left people with little money,” says Khurshid Alam, a businessman from Sufiyan Bagh. Naib Shahi Imam, Punjab, Maulana Usman Ludhianvi says though community members, who are mostly into business, don’t have much money to buy the animals, blame also rests on the unregulated Bakra Mandi, where prices are too high. He says they have advised people to celebrate Eid in a simple manner and feed the poor and needy. He says in view of Covid guidelines, small groups of community members will offer Eid prayers by following social distancing and wearing masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/financially-hit-by-pandemic-many-finding-it-hard-to-buy-sacrificial-animals-for-eid/articleshow/84531999.cms||Shariq Majeed

The complainant, who is from Kolhapur district, had filed a case with the Bhosari MIDC police. The suspects, including members of the ‘Jaat Panchayat,’ have been booked under the relevant sections of the Social Boycott (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. An officer said the complainant had got married to a woman from Moshi in 2019. His wife returned to Moshi following a domestic spat. “In February this year, the complainant’s in-laws called him to Moshi to solve the issue through discussions.” “According to the complaint, his in-laws took the issue to the ‘Jaat Panchayat’,” he said. The complainant stated that the members told him to pay some amount to start the discussions. When he did not pay, his in-laws did, earning a verdict in their favour. When the complainant refused to pay the fine of Rs15 lakh, he was socially boycotted, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10-booked-for-social-boycott-of-26-year-old-kolhapur-man/articleshow/84534125.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Complacency can bring catastrophe, warn experts||AHMEDABAD: Epidemiologists have warned that any complacency in adhering to Covid protocols may bring a steeper infection curve to the city if a new variant enters the disease scene. It may be worse than the second one which had ripped through Ahmedabad in the April-May period. The executive summary of the AMC’s fifth and latest serosurvey states that the sample of 5,000 individuals is insufficient to speculate on the status of herd immunity for the entire city. The first serosurvey had considered 23,000 samples, the second analyzed 17,000 samples, while third and fourth serosurveys took up close to 10,000 samples each. “It will be premature to comment on herd immunity. We have seen antibodies vanishing from previously infected people,” said a senior AMC official. The official added the hope is that 75% of Amdavadis will receive their first vaccine dose before the third wave numbers pick up. “A good vaccination coverage will restrict the third wave to 5,300 cases, similar to the October-November post-Diwali phase,” the official said. Ahmedabad had reeled from a post-Diwali surge in 2020. Twenty days ahead of the festival, between October 28 and November 16, the city recorded 3,700 Covid cases and 46 deaths. But between November 17 and December 6, cases rose by 71% to 6,400 and 179 deaths were recorded. The western parts of the city, which bore the brunt of the Diwali surge, had back then shown a little improvement in antibodies. Areas of the west zone recorded antibodies in 25% of people against 19% in the October round. Similarly, the posh northwest and southwest zones saw seroprevalence of antibodies at 28% and 29% respectively, which was 10% and 11% higher than in the October round. “Last year, we were surprised when a majority of people in whom we found antibodies in July and August lost their immunity cover by October,” added the AMC official. Areas in south, central, and north zones recorded a decline in the populations with Covid antibodies after Diwali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/complacency-can-bring-catastrophe-warn-experts/articleshow/84534326.cms||---
---||Nagpur||60% fee waiver for NU students this session||Nagpur: In a big respite for students from over 500 affiliated colleges of Nagpur University (NU), they are set to get an average 60% fee waiver for this academic session. Notification to this effect is likely to be issued this week. Nagpur University management council has decided that students must get 100% waiver in fee for non-utilized facilities in the wake of lockdown and 60% relief in lab, library and student welfare fees. Depending on the course such as engineering, pharmacy or commerce, the students are likely to get more than 50% fee wavier. Pro VC Sanjay Dudhe told TOI that those activities which were not held due to Covid lockdown can’t be charged for. “A committee was set up and it was decided to reduce the overall fee,” he said. Dudhe said the decision is in line with the state government’s instructions. Last year, since no decision was taken, the colleges continued to charge full fee from the students. The NU has also appealed to students and parents that they shouldn’t be paying any amount other than that prescribed by it and proper receipts must be taken for the fee paid. The advisory comes following a probe led by management council member Vishnu Changde finding a college guilty of charging excess fee. “The college had barred students from filling up exam forms. We enquired with the college and found that fee was not charge head-wise. Students were also not encouraged to fill scholarship forms. Considering there were many such cases, a decision has been taken to waive off 75% exam fee and give relaxations in other heads too,” he said. Changde added that the committee has also proposed to insure students for death, hospitalization and loss of earning member. “Insurance will cover education cost in case of death of a parent. As many students have lost a earning member in the family to Covid, this decision was taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/60-fee-waiver-for-nu-students-this-session/articleshow/84534188.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The symptoms range from a simple headache to temporary loss of male fertility, Guillain Barre Syndrome to nightmares, and facial palsy to short-term memory loss and bone damage, they said. Covid-19 is the first disease that has exhibited scores of symptoms that may last even after complete recovery and up to six months to a year. Opportunistic infections like black fungus (mucormycosis) and pneumonia are just the tip of the pandemic iceberg, health experts point out. Incidentally, Hyderabad was part of an international cohort study covering dozens of cities spread across 56 nations in which it was revealed that long Covid-19 patients suffer from symptoms that run up to 203. City doctors, supporting the international study published in a Lancet publication, relate the symptoms to brain, heart, lungs, reproductive organs, skin and kidneys. Some of the symptoms are psychological in nature and include apart from nightmares and vivid dreams, a sense of fear that someone is stalking, confusion and sleep disturbances. Dr P Ranganadham, senior neurosurgeon, Sunshine Hospitals, Gachibowli, has listed about 40 symptoms related to just the nervous system. “Evidence collected in the last 18 months show that all the six divisions of the central and peripheral nervous systems – brain, spinal cord, retina, nerves, ganglia and muscles - are hit by Covid-19 virus in varying severity,” Dr Ranganadham told TOI. Some of the symptoms Dr Ranganadham has listed are loss of smell, decreased taste, Guillain Barre Syndrome, Miller Fischer syndrome, foot drop, muscle pains, cramps, fatigue, disinterest in work, paraesthesia (pins and needles sensation), numbness, facial palsy, visual loss, disturbances of eye mobility, encephalopathy (damage to brain), encephalitis (inflammation of brain), stroke, epilepsy, meningitis, myelitis (inflammation of spinal cord), ataxia (neuro problems), sleep disturbances, depression, daytime sleepiness, headache, memory loss, confusion and mental fuzziness. Fertility expert Dr Roya Rozati of MHRT Hospital, told TOI that Covid-19 has been found to affect the fertility levels, particularly in men. "Young men are at a higher risk as they are in child-bearing age. The pandemic virus impacts their ability to reproduce," Dr Roya said. Senior physician Dr Luqman Ahmad Khan said he had come across over a dozen symptoms in patients whom he treated. "Long Covid-19 is variable in nature. I encountered the most common symptoms like extreme tiredness and unable to focus or concentration, apart from loss of smell and taste. Many symptoms are of psychological impact of Covid-19 distress," he said. Dr Chetan Rao Vaddepally, consultant pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospitals, has listed around 30 symptoms including multiorgan effects. "Covid-19 hits most, if not all, body systems including heart, lung, kidney, skin, and brain functions. Multiorgan effects can also include conditions that occur after Covid-19 like multisystem inflammatory syndrome and autoimmune conditions," Dr Chetan Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-experts-list-over-100-covid-19-symptoms/articleshow/84537574.cms||Syed Akbar

In an RTI application, the AMC’s birth and death registry department was approached by a citizen for month-wise number of death and birth certificates issued and also applications made by the public. The superintendent of the registry wrote back saying that the information sought was “bulky” and that most of “department employees may have to be engaged in gathering the information during such Covid times. The superintendent refused to part with the information. The application for birth and death figures for years 2018, 2019, 2020 was made by a Kalupur resident Pankaj Bhatt on June 14. “Certificates are processed online and I have asked just numbers which are updated every day. My application does not seek copies of individual birth and death certificates issued by the office. This is clearly a way to block information to the public,” says the applicant Bhatt. He added, “I have copies of month-wise data of birth and death figures supplied by the same office two years back under the RTI Act. What makes the same information bulkier this time is strange. I have applied for first appeal,” says Bhatt. This is not the first time that the department has turned down RTI Act requests seeking death figures for Ahmedabad city for 2020. The department cites two Gujarat information commission orders of 2007 and 2008, a Delhi high court order of 2009 to turn down RTI requests on death figures during 2020 Covid year. The AMC has in all turned down four applications making similar requests between October last year and June this year, claims a senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/birth-death-figures-are-third-party-info-cant-be-made-public/articleshow/84534170.cms||---

In the last week, around 20 pregnant women have taken the first shot in two private hospitals in the city, with them preferring both Covidshield and Sputnik V. Aminesh Dubey, the marketing head of Sahyadri hospital, said they have started vaccinating pregnant women at the hospital as per the government guidelines. “One or two pregnant women on average have been coming to take the jab at the hospital for the past four to five days. So far, eight women have been vaccinated at our vaccination centre,” said Dubey. “Apart from Covidshield and Covaxin, we have also started administering Sputnik V vaccines to the beneficiaries at our centre. Some pregnant women are also preferring Sputnik V,” he said. Another private hospital in the city HSG Manavata Cancer Centre has also started administering vaccines to pregnant women. Dr Raj Nagarkar, the managing director of the HSG Manavata Cancer Centre, said around 12 pregnant women have been given their first shot of vaccine in the past week. Meanwhile, the vaccination for pregnant women in government-run centres in Nashik district is expected to begin from Monday. The State Family Welfare Bureau has issued guidelines to the health officials to start administering vaccines to pregnant women with proper counselling. In Nashik city, around six private hospitals have started paid vaccination at their centres.

The victim had transferred the money last July via RTGS from his bank account in Pimpri Chinchwad. Despite repeated follow-ups, when the suspects did not deliver the order and did not return his money back, he filed a complaint through his friend, giving him the power of attorney in the case, making him the complainant. The complainant told TOI that his friend works in Dubai with a company and is also involved in a business. “The victim’s contact in Dubai told him that a Canadian-based company required gloves during the Covid-19 pandemic last year.” the complainant said. “The victim then came in contact with the suspects from Hyderabad, who promised to supply the gloves. The suspects took Rs60 lakh as a security deposit and informed the victim that a supplier based in the US will provide the gloves to the Canadian company,” the complainant added. The complainant added, “However when the suspects did not deliver the gloves, the Canadian company cancelled the order. That is when the victim found out that the suspects had given him a fake address of a company in the United States.” The victim then demanded his money back from the suspects. The suspects first shared a fake Unique Transaction Reference (UTR) with the victim and then sent him blank papers under the pretext of returning money via cheques. When the victim continued his pursuit of the money, the suspects threatened to kill him. Following which the complainant lodged an FIR.

The plant at a cost of Rs 11.2 crore was proposed near the existing STP on the Trichy-Madurai NH. A source said that the tender was cancelled as the site identified for the STP had either overlapped or was located very close to the site identified for the integrated bus stand (IBT) at Panjappur, which has been a long-pending demand of the residents. Officials also clarified that the 2.4 MW solar power park in Panjappur will remain at the same place as there were discussions about relocating it to make way for the IBT. “Solar power park will not be disturbed. The STP proposal was cancelled to ensure that a spacious and futuristic bus stand proposal was not compromised,” a source said. The cancellation of the STP tender indicates that IBT may be finalised on the eastern side of the Trichy-Madurai NH. Meanwhile, stakeholders in the city’s sewage management said that the cancellation of separate and smaller STP was a good move as the civic body already has a proposal for a 125 MLD capacity sequential batch reactor-based STP in Panjappur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/shot-in-the-arm-for-ibt-as-civic-body-cancels-stp-tender/articleshow/84534143.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Aurangabad||Water line to Aurangabad civic chief’s residence cut||AURANGABAD: Acting on their earlier threats, few workers of the local unit of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) disconnected the water supply to the official residence of civic body chief Astik Kumar Pandey on Sunday. The extreme step, which was not approved by the MNS top-brass, follows warnings issued about 10 days ago. The MNS workers had said that they would disrupt the supply to Pandey’s home as a mark of protest against the erratic water supply in the city. On Sunday morning, a few MNS activists reached the official residence of Aurangabad municipal chief with an automatic cutter and cut the pipe. Photographs of the act went viral on social media. MNS Aurangabad district president Suhas Dashrathe claimed that he was kept in the dark about the party workers’ plan. He, however, added that citizens were running out of patience while waiting for a regular water supply. “Once-a-week water supply has become a norm in Aurangabad, which is considered a metro city. But many areas receive water once in eight days. In addition, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation has been charging an exorbitant amount of Rs 4,050 as water charge. This is outrageous,” he said. MNS office-bearers added that written requests made to the civic administration had fallen on deaf ears. “We had given a warning about 10 days ago that the MNS would be forced to cut the water connection of the civic chief’s residence if our demand is not heard,” they said. Pandey could not be reached for a comment. The AMC authorities said a new scheme would address the water supply-related issues of the city. While it was unclear till Sunday evening whether the connection was restored, the civic administration has lodged a complaint against the MNS workers involved. Six workers , including Bipin Naik, Vaibhav Mitkar, Rahul Patil and Sanket Shete have been booked by the city police for damaging public property among other offences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/water-line-to-aurangabad-civic-chiefs-residence-cut/articleshow/84530095.cms||---

A separate team of health workers from the civic body will collect and register the requests every day to vaccinate this section of population who cannot visit the vaccination camps. The helpline 63852-69208 will be available to place requests between 8 am and 5 pm every day. Apart from the Pwd and the bedridden population in the 65 wards, transgender people interested to get the jab can also make use of the helpline, Trichy corporation said. There are about 66,000 persons with disabilities in Trichy district classified under 22 types of disabilities registered with the district differently-abled department. People with certain forms of disability such as a locomotor disability had to rely on their caretakers to reach the camps. Officials said that many were forced to spend on private transport to reach the camps which was identified as a discouraging factor. Meanwhile, as there was also a demand for doorstep vaccination, the civic body decided to launch the helpline to also cover individuals who are immuno-compromised. “We have earmarked a portion of vaccines to address the doorstep vaccination needs. We will try to vaccinate them within 48 hours once they have placed a request. Transport facility is arranged for health workers,” said Dr A Mohamed Hakkim, coordinator of the urban vaccination camp. Zone-wise demand for doorstep vaccination will be compiled to consider vaccinating the targeted population with health workers and vials available in the nearest vaccination camp to conserve resources. Trichy corporation through the district differently-abled department has also planned to sensitise the PwDs found hesitant to get the jab as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/helpline-for-disabled-bed-ridden-patients-to-avail-doorstep-vax-in-trichy/articleshow/84534174.cms||---

SHGs will also assist people in registering for their vaccine slots on Cowin portal and mobile apps too. Cantonment Board, which hopes to achieve 100% vaccination in its jurisdiction, has imparted training to 100 SHGs with over 18,000 women on mobilising people. They were also advised to follow Covid-19-appropriate behaviour like social distancing norms and masks while interacting with the citizens. At present, vaccination drive for people of 18 years and above was being conducted at designated vaccination centres at Bowenaplly, Rasoolpura, Mudfort, Mahendra Hills and Bolarum. On an average, 100 to 250 people were getting their first or second dose every day free of cost at these centres. The women groups have played a key role in making cloth masks during the first wave of Covid-19 and sold them to various government agencies and NGOs. Now, SCB officials have decided to utilise their services to mobilise people to get vaccinated. “We have divided SHGs to cover all eight wards to meet people,” SCB in-charge, vaccination drive, A Parusuram told TOI. Women groups would visit every lane and enquire about the vaccination and assist people who were yet to get their shots. “With the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) hinting about a possible third wave in the next couple of months, we plan to vaccinate all the eligible people ahead of the next wave,” the SCB official added. Though the exact number of people vaccinated was not known, based on feedback from the medical and health department, over 60% of the population has been vaccinated, the official added. Meanwhile, the number of new Covid cases were declining in the Cantonment. Earlier, it used to report 100 to 150 positive cases every day, now the number came down to single digit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cantt-to-tap-shgs-to-vaccinate-people-against-covid/articleshow/84536201.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Mumbai||Maximum rainfall in Chembur, Vikhroli; highest fatalities too||MUMBAI: Heavy rains battered the city overnight with a massive 200 mm recorded in a six-hour window between 11.30pm on Saturday and 5.30am on Sunday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert for Mumbai at 7.45 pm on Sunday. The forecast will be valid till 8.30 am on Monday. It has sounded an orange alert from July 19-22, indicating heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places.  The two areas that were among those that received the highest rainfall—Chembur (241 mm) and Vikhroli (238 mm)—also bore the maximum brunt of the incessant downpour. Of the 33 lives lost in the city on Sunday, 29 were residents of these suburbs. Till 11.30pm on Saturday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s Santacruz observatory had recorded only 16 mm of rains, but by 5.30 am on Sunday, the city had logged 233 mm rainfall. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray termed it a ‘mini cloud burst’, with the automatic weather stations (AWS) in areas like Bhandup, Kandivali and Vile Parle recording over 100 mm between 1 am-2 am, but the IMD did not term it one. Unlike the previous intense rain event of Friday where only the Santacruz observatory recorded 253 mm rains, while Colaba observatory recorded a meager 12.8 mm, on Sunday, both the Colaba (197mm) and Santacruz observatories (235mm) recorded triple digit figures. The rains recorded by the Santacruz observatory were the second highest for the season with the highest (253mm) recorded so far on July 16. However, due to lack of extreme weather event warning from the weather bureau, no disaster management protocols were activated by the civic body. “While IMD models could not capture the development of the in situ convective clouds, we did issue nowcast warnings and also an impact-based forecast was issued at 1am on Sunday,” Dr Jayanta Sarkar, scientist and head India Meteorological Department, Mumbai said. The IMD’s impact-based forecast said those staying at vulnerable places should be moved, but BMC officials said that by the time the warning was issued, it was too late. Sunday’s intense spell made up for the entire month’s average rain of 827 mm with the total July rainfall now at 849.6mm. In June too, a triple digit rain figure (231.3mm) in a 24-hour span was recorded between June 9-10. With the city experiencing the second thunderstorm in two days, experts said that the frequency of thunderstorms in July appear to have increased. Thunderstorms are generally a June phenomenon, prior to the onset of monsoons as these require land heating as a trigger to form.  “There was development of a thunderstorm near Raigad which moved south east to north west of Mumbai giving widespread rains to the city. In case of Friday’s (July 16) event, the thunderstorm had developed near Thane district and, hence, only the suburbs saw massive rains,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maximum-rainfall-in-chembur-vikhroli-highest-fatalities-too-in-mumbai/articleshow/84537576.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||It’s official: No kanwar yatra in Delhi this year||NEW DELHI: There will be no kanwar yatra in the capital this year as well, with Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday issuing directions that no celebration, gathering or procession will be allowed during the annual pilgrimage due to Covid-19. Earlier this week, the Uttarakhand government had cancelled the pilgrimage, which sees thousands of devotees collect water from the Ganges in Haridwar and bring it back to their villages by mostly walking the distance on foot. Following Uttarakhand, the Uttar Pradesh government also cancelled the kanwar yatra on Saturday. The DDMA order states that the kanwar yatra period will start from July 25 and despite being banned and suspended by the Uttarakhand government, there is an “apprehension of gatherings/congregations/processions... Therefore, in view of the persisting Covid-19 situation, it is decided that the kanwar yatra should not be permitted in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the territory of NCT of Delhi”. Exercising the powers conferred under Disaster Management Act 2005, chief secretary Vijay Dev issued the order in his capacity as the chairperson of DDMA state executive committee. All district magistrates of Delhi and their counterpart district deputy commissioners of police and other authorities concerned have been directed to ensure strict compliance and adequately inform and sensitise the field functionaries to properly implement the instructions. The order states that a previous order on July 10 already directs that all social, religious, cultural, festival, sports, entertainment-related gatherings and congregations are prohibited and visitors are not allowed to religious places in the capital. The order states that any person found violating the instructions will be proceeded against as per the provisions of Disaster Management Act, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws. The pilgrimage, which begins in the later half of July and goes on till the first week of August, was cancelled last year, too, due to the Covid outbreak. The UP government cancelled this year’s yatra after the Supreme Court had said movement of devotees could not be allowed when the third wave was looming over the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-official-no-kanwar-yatra-in-city-this-year/articleshow/84534234.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Two booked for forging cycle firm letterhead to dupe Gurgaon company||LUDHIANA: The police booked two South Delhi residents for cheating and forgery on Sunday. The accused, Santosh Kumar and Raj, had forged the letterhead of Avon Cycles Private Limited to lure a Gurgaon company for a work contract. Balwinder Singh, general manager of Avon Cycles, GT Road, said in his police complaint, “Impersonating as representatives of Avon Cycles, the accused approached the staff of a Gurgaon company, Batx Energies Private Limited, in Delhi in January. The accused claimed that they are associated with Avon Cycles through a mediator and can help them in getting a big contract. And for it, they demanded a share. They also had a letterhead of Avon Cycles and addressed a letter to Batx Energies along with some payment vouchers. However, the staff took pictures of the documents they produced for verification.” The staff shared the documents with the CEO, who asked the company advocate to verify those. “The Gurgaon company’s advocate contacted the lawyer of Avon Cycles. During checking, it was found that Avon Cycles had never issued any such letter or payment voucher to the company,” he added. A complaint was lodged with the Ludhiana police on February 24. Additional deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “The police had tried to contact the accused, Santosh and Raj. But they switched off their cellphones and escaped. It was found during probe that the two had forged the letterhead of Avon Cycles to lure the Gurgaon company. The case has been registered under section 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/two-booked-for-forging-cycle-firm-letterhead-to-dupe-gurgaon-company/articleshow/84532014.cms||---

---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief forms team to strengthen party base||NASHIK: MNS president Raj Thackeray has formed a two-member team to strengthen the party in Nashik. One of the members of this panel is his son, Amit, while the other member is party’s general secretary Sandip Deshpande. Raj and Amit Thackeray had both been in Nashik since Saturday. Although Raj has left for Mumbai, Amit will be in the city for a couple of days more as he and Deshpande will interact with the Nashik MNS cadres and leaders before submitting a report to the MNS chief. Speaking to TOI, Deshpande said they are conducting one-to-one meetings with party office-bearers to know their views and what should be done to strengthen the party organization. “We will submit the report based on the feedback from the office-bearers to Thackeray on Wednesday,” he said. “Best thing is the party supporters at the grassroots are the same even though some leaders left the party. We will contest the forthcoming civic elections on the basis of these supporters. We will give opportunities to fresh candidates during the coming civic elections,” he added. Nashik was once a stronghold of the MNS and it had come to power in NMC during the previous five-year term (2012-2017) as its 40 candidates were elected on the civic body in civic polls held in February 2012. But the party had received a severe jolt as only five candidates got elected during the civic election held in February 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mns-chief-forms-team-to-strengthen-party-base/articleshow/84530129.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BSP chief Mayawati plans mega Brahmin outreach||LUCKNOW: Months ahead of the high-stakes UP assembly elections, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Sunday whipped out the upper caste card by announcing launch of Brahmin conventions from July 23 in a deft political move by the Dalit czarina to return to her tried-and-tested social engineering formula that propelled her to power with absolute majority in 2007 state elections. BSP’s Brahmin conclaves would kick off from Ayodhya, epicentre of Hindutva politics, under the supervision of Mayawati’s trusted aide and party’s Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra. Mayawati said, the decision to organise Brahmin conventions followed atrocities inflicted on the community by the BJP dispensation in UP. “The community got swayed by tall promises and voted for BJP in 2017 assembly elections. Now, Brahmins are worried and looking for an alternative,” Mayawati said, citing the 2007 assembly elections, which witnessed a successful amalgamation of Brahmins with Dalits to catapult Mayawati to power for the first time.At the same time, the BSP supremo made a strong bid to consolidate her core Dalit vote-bank, saying she was “proud” of the SC community which was not influenced by BJP or other Opposition parties, including Congress, and voted en bloc for her party in 2017 assembly polls. Mayawati insisted it was because of Dalits that her party cornered a vote share of 22.23%, which was more than SP (21.82%). BJP had bagged a vote share of 39.67%. “I would suggest that like Dalits, Brahmin should also back BSP. Bahut aajma liya BJP aur doosri partiyon ko. Kitna parkhoge (You have tested them enough),” Mayawati said, maintaining that when her party formed a government in 2007, she took care of the community’s interests. “I hope Brahmins will unite with BSP to ensure robust law and order mechanism, development and employment for youth,” she said. Mayawati’s positioning vis-à-vis the Brahmin community gave further traction to speculations about Mishra being in the driver’s seat to chart the party’s electoral strategy for next year’s elections. Mishra was embroiled in a row few days ago after rebel BSP MLAs accused him of influencing Mayawati and running the party from behind curtains. Mayawati has already suspended 11 of 18 party MLAs for hobnobbing with Opposition parties. Her stand to woo Brahmins, who account for 13% of voters in UP, is also seen as a move to make up for the Muslim vote which could potentially drift towards the Samajwadi Party amid an aggressive minority outreach by the Akhilesh Yadav-led political outfit. The entry of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaddudin Owaisi on UP’s political turf, experts said, may have made Mayawati even more apprehensive. Mayawati’s plan to consolidate the upper caste, especially Brahmin, analysts said, may also be driven by BJP’s aggressive pitch for Hindu consolidation which could wean away the OBC community from Mayawati’s vote base.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-reboots-social-engg-with-big-brahmin-outreach/articleshow/84536217.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Covid cleanliness cuts bacteria in hospitals’, says study||AHMEDABAD: Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are a major concern, with many patients reporting illnesses caused by microorganisms. But the cleanliness in medical setups prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic has reduced the presence of such pathogens significantly, said a study carried out in the city. A paper titled ‘Molecular Characterization of Isolated Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria from Tertiary Care Hospitals of Ahmedabad’ was published recently in JPAM. The authors are Anurag Zaveri, Dilip Zaveri, and Lakshmi Bhaskaran. The paper mentioned that between 2017 and 2020, a total of 4,400 samples were collected from hospital surfaces and ambient air to assess the presence of pathogens. The study said that the presence of klebsiella bacteria was reduced from 80% to 20%, E. coli from 90% to 10%, and pseudomonas from 80% to 20%. “It is possible only because of the awareness in non-specialists and healthcare workers due to the unforeseen critical situation proving to be a blessing for the future generation,” mentioned the paper. City-based experts said several factors were responsible for the phenomenon. “First of all, it’s to do with the stringent rules put in place by all the healthcare facilities catering to both Covid and non-Covid patients, as earlier understanding of the virus was that surfaces could be mediums to spread the infection,” said a city-based doctor. “Second, entry was restricted in the majority of the hospitals, and the medical staff used gloves, face shields, and PPE kits. That reduced the acquired bacteria from the environment and stopped their proliferation in the hospital conditions.” The paper quoted a figure from the US-based studies mentioning that there were 6.87 lakh cases of HAI in the US in 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-cleanliness-cuts-bacteria-in-hospitals/articleshow/84534305.cms||---

Due to the heavy rainfall, the water level in the Kushawati river started swelling on Friday, but late Sunday evening around 8.30pm, the Paroda bridge that links villages of Avedem-Cotombi to Margao-Quepem road was submerged. An area of Paroda from the bridge to the Parvat road junction, about one km to the west, was also flooded. The Paroda bridge was built post liberation during Bandodkar’s first ministry. Its height was very low, barely a few metres from the water level. Some villgers even risked their lies retrieving coconuts flowing over the bridge. All light vehicles plying from Margao to Quepem, Curchorem and Sanguem were diverted through Chandor late night. Avedem local Joe Fernandes told TOI that the bridge needs to be validated through qualified engineers. “It has not been checked at all, we have school children and people walking on it, including movement of heavy loaded vehicles,” he said. Former chief minister Manohar Parrikar inspected the bridge in 2012 and promised the locals that a new bridge will be constructed within si xmonths at the different location across the Kushavati around 100m from the existing bridge, but he failed to fulfill his promise,” said Fernandes. The Avedem panchayat had taken the resolution under disaster management to construct the new bridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/paroda-bridge-goes-under-as-kushavati-swells/articleshow/84536204.cms||Johnny M

The road to the bypass bridge near the chapel remained submerged till late Sunday evening. The road passes through low-lying fields and farmers feared heavy losses to their crop due to continuous flooding in the area. Local councillor John Dias said that the water enters the area from the Sal every year during heavy rain posing difficulties to those moving about on foot or two-wheelers. People of both wards have demanded that the height of the road be increased to avoid flooding. Dias said that local MLA had promised to raise the height of the road and to complete the work before arrival of the monsoon. “Junior engineer Dilkush Gaonkar had carried out the inspection two weeks ago along with me,” Dias said. Cuncolim MLA Clafacio Dias told TOI that he had instructed the previous council, which had his support, to carry out the road construction work and that an estimate had been prepared accordingly. “The said proposal was rejected by the new council formed in April following the recently held municipal elections. The new council stated that it would float a tender,” the MLA said. The present council is supported by Clafacio’s rival Joaquim Alemao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/incessant-showers-maroon-two-wards-in-cuncolim/articleshow/84536222.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Exit from costly pacts set to save discoms Rs 800cr yearly||NEW DELHI: A recent order by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and an earlier guideline by the Union Ministry of Power allowing discoms to exit power purchasing agreements (PPAs) with plants completing 25 years of commercial operations would pave the way for BSES discoms to save Rs 800 crore per annum and the benefit is likely to trickle down to the consumers. The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) had recently written to the ministry requesting de-allocation of Delhi’s share of ‘costly’ power (756 MW) from Dadri-I generating station of NTPC, for ‘optimisation of power purchase cost of Delhi, which will ultimately benefit the consumers of Delhi’. Sources said that there are a total seven power stations that are supplying power at a comparatively expensive rate of more than Rs 6 per unit to BSES discoms. Of these, five stations, including Dadri-I, have completed 25 years and two more power stations will complete 25 years by August 2021 and April 2022. These seven power plants supply around 830 MW power to the discoms and sources said that BSES discoms have initiated the process with the DERC for exiting the remaining power plants in this category. The discoms plan to replace this power with substantially cheaper ‘green power’ available at around Rs 2.5 per unit, which will lead to savings of around Rs 800 crore per annum, sources said. At present, the share of renewable energy is around 10% of long arrangements of BSES, which it plans to increase. The savings would help in recovering past revenue gaps for discoms, which have reached Rs. 51,646 crore as of March 31, 2020. “This substantial difference in the prices of power will help in neutralising cost increases by absorbing the impact of inflation and other factors, including prices of coal, gas etc. In fact, these will ease the pressure on future tariff hikes,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/exit-from-costly-pacts-set-to-save-discoms-rs-800cr-yearly/articleshow/84534238.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nashik||Nashik: Weekly Covid-19 positivity rate rises, test number falls||NASHIK: The number of tests conducted for Covid-19 across Nashik district has declined from 13,000 per day to around 9,000 over the last two weeks even as the weekly positivity rate has increased from 1.8% to 2.22% during the same period. The positivity rate shows the number of patients per hundred tests conducted in a particular area. Considering the fresh weekly statistics, as per the ICMR data, the weekly positivity rate of Nashik city stood at 2.1% and for the rural areas, it is 2.4%, which were 0.8% and 1.6% respectively, a fortnight before. The number of active cases in the city dropped from 1,271 to 643 while it reduced from 1,085 to 845 in the rural areas in two weeks. “The rise in the positivity rate is attributed to fewer numbers of testing, rather than the number of patients. In rural areas, the testing has reduced from about 5,000 per day to 3,000 and in the urban areas, it has dropped from 8,000 to about 5,500 per day,” said Dr Anant Pawar, the nodal officer for Covid in the civil hospital. The health officials of both the rural and the urban areas have admitted to the drop in the number of tests and the reason is the hesitancy by the people. There is also a drop in the number of asymptomatic patients these days. “While there is no change in the protocol of testing high-risk contacts of Covid patients, the issue remains only for the walk-in RT-PCR tests or rapid antigen testing,” said Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation. The bulk of fresh Covid cases are coming from the rural areas, which also has shown a decline in the number of tests. “We are going to increase the testing again so that the positivity rate remains under check. The testing will be increased in villages and talukas, where the numbers of cases are on the rise,” said Dr Kailas Bhoye of Nashik rural health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-weekly-positivity-rate-rises-test-number-falls/articleshow/84530165.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The farmers, along with the comunidade of Guirim, are demanding compensation from the highway contractor for the losses they have sustained due to the waterlogging in their fields. A local farmer said that the contractor has not only dumped construction debris in the tributary of the River Tar, but also in the drains and their fields, thus effectively blocking all water outlets, which has led to the waterlogging. The comunidade of Guirim and local farmers have also demanded compensation for those whose lands have been acquired for the highway expansion. President of Guirim comunidade Tulio D’Souza said that the government should direct the road contractor to compensate farmers whose lands were acquired. “The fields were acquired long ago and the Centre has since released the compensation to the state,” said D’Souza, adding, “Why are they not releasing it?” “We don’t know when they are going to compensate us for the loss. Our fields have been totally destroyed due to the flooding,” a farmer Puna Dessai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/farmers-want-compensation-from-guirim-rd-contractor/articleshow/84536244.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi University aspirants from city fret over making the cut||NEW DELHI: With Delhi University deciding to conduct admissions for undergraduate programmes on the basis of Class XII marks from August 2, CBSE students are wary of losing their berth. Following the cancellation of the board examination due to Covid-19, the result will be based on their performance of the past three years and the inclusion of Class XI marks, they fear, will bring their grades down. However, most of them are also hopeful that due to the new assessment policy, the cutoffs will not be as high as previous years. In 2020, the cutoff was 100% for three courses at Lady Shri Ram College for Women. Darshan Ram of Bluebells School International said, “There is no proper substitute for the Boards. Once the examination was cancelled, we knew that we actually have no control over the results.” Echoing him, U Sai Sruthi, a Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar student who wishes to take psychology (H), said, “It is unfair that the admission will be based on the new marks system, which itself is unfair. This system leaves the students with no choice to better their result. CBSE students usually do not score well in Class XI.” Competing with state board students may make it more difficult as the result criteria are not the same everywhere, said Sruthi. Ram also said the CBSE marks would be lower as it would be a culmination of the three preceding years, not just the five papers. Central Board of Secondary Education is calculating the Class XII marks with 30% weightage to Class X board marks, 30% to Class XI marks and 40% to Class XII assessment conducted by the school. To ensure that the schools don’t inflate marks, the performance has to be moderated on the basis of a school’s results in the last three years. Unsatisfied students may get to sit for an examination later, but there’s no clarity on it yet. “There is no assessment of individual abilities here. The whole system is so unfair for students like me who have worked so hard to better their score in Class XII,” Sruthi added, who felt that conducting an entrance would have been better. Ram, however, said adopting a centralised entrance for the first time could have delayed results. Khurram Nayab, whose daughter studied at Delhi Public School, considered the cutoff-based admission as the best option during this unprecedented time. Vishal Srivas, a BSc (H) mathematics aspirant from the Madhya Pradesh state board, said that as over 90% of the DU applicants were from CBSE, the new assessment criteria would keep the cutoffs lower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-aspirants-from-city-fret-over-making-the-cut/articleshow/84534263.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Goa||India coach Igor Stimac gets one-year extension||Panaji: The technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has decided to hand national coach Igor Stimac an extension till September next year. Stimac took charge of the national team in May 2019. When his two-year contract ended in the middle of India’s preparations for the Fifa World Cup qualifiers, he was given a three-month extension. The technical committee met on Monday and decided it was important for the coach to continue, given that there are three Fifa windows in the next five months, SAFF Cup and, more importantly, the AFC U-23 qualifiers. “Changing coach at this moment did not make sense,” a senior member of the technical committee told TOI after the meeting. “Stimac made a detailed presentation and also explained how the Covid-19 pandemic disturbed everything. These are not excuses. He has introduced a new style (of football) and new players have emerged. We have to give him more time.” It was also not lost on the members that India under-23 will play the AFC qualifiers in October. With Stimac giving many juniors a chance to make their debuts with the national team, members felt it was important for him to stay in-charge as the team battles the likes of hosts UAE, Oman and Kyrgyzstan in group E. As per Stimac’s contract, he remains chief coach of the senior and under-23 teams. “The committee deliberated at length and reached a consensus that in view of the external factors which has had a huge impact on the footballing world in general, and with the national team all set to begin their campaign in their quest to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup China 2023, Stimac be given an extension of his contract till September 2022,” the AIFF said in a statement on Monday. The third round of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers will kick off in February next year. “We had given coach a target of securing the second spot with third an absolute must. He managed to finish third and qualify directly to the next round (of Asian Cup qualifiers). There were some critical questions which he answered. He didn’t shy away. “Some members made their displeasure known, particularly with games which we should have won. The (last group) clash against Afghanistan was brought to the coach’s attention. He agreed we should have done better. We need consistency (with the results) but changing coach is not the solution,” said the member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-coach-igor-stimac-gets-one-year-extension/articleshow/84565732.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

In July 2015, he suffered pain in his right hand and neck, and was admitted to an orthopaedic hospital run by Dr Rajesh Kumar. He was discharged in 10 days after treatment. Tandel, who had health insurance cover from New India Assurance Co Ltd through Health India TPA Services Pvt Ltd, sought reimbursement of Rs 33,925 — the medical expenditure incurred during hospitalisation.The insurance company repudiated his claim, saying the hospital had been black-listed by the company in July 2010. Tandel unsuccessfully approached the consumer district forum in Navsari. He filed an appeal in the state commission, where his advocate M K Dudhiya contended that Tandel had obtained the health cover in 2009 and there was no list of blacklisted hospitals then. The blacklisting of hospitals took place in 2010 and the consumer was not provided a list of these hospitals even though the policy was regularly renewed every year.The commission accepted the argument that the blacklisted hospital was not within the knowledge of the insured person and therefore the bar imposed by the insurance company is non-binding to the insured person.The commission quashed the Navsari district forum’s decision and ordered the insurance company to reimburse the amount with 7% interest since December 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/insurer-told-to-refund-bill-from-blacklisted-hospital/articleshow/84534266.cms||---

TRS general secretaries Bodakunti Venkateswarulu and M Srinivas Reddy said the previous Congress governments too conducted land auctions but spent the money raised through auction for development in Andhra region. “The Telangana government has followed all the rules before conducting the auction of lands. The chief minister has clearly stated that the money raised through auctions would be utilised for the development of Telangana. Revanth should stop his blackmailing politics,” Venkateshwarlu said. Srinivas Reddy sought to advise the opposition parties not to make any comments which can harm the brand image of Greater Hyderabad. The realty market in the state capital is better than several other metros in the country. “The opposition parties are not able to digest the fact that the TRS government is continuing all the welfare schemes despite the state revenues being badly hit due to Coronavirus pandemic in the last one and a half year,” said Srinivas Reddy. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-revanth-reddy-should-stop-his-blackmailing-politics/articleshow/84536238.cms||---

---||Nashik||Malegaon civic body plans to improve health infrastructure||NASHIK: The Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) has requested the state government to provide it with funds to establish an RT-PCR laboratory to test suspected Covid patients during the possible third wave. Currently, MMC sends the throat swab samples to Nashik city and Dhule for RT-PCR testing. Now, it has decided to set up its lab, which will help the hospitals in the region to test faster. The lab has been proposed at the 30-bed Women and Child Hospital at the cost of Rs 3.5 crore “We wish to increase the health infrastructure in Malegaon, that will cater to the working class of the region and make medical help available at a very reasonable rate,” said MMC commissioner Bhalchandra Gosavi The aim is to have a strong infrastructure at Malegaon that will not only help the patients during Covid times but also in the future. The textile town of Malegaon was a Covid hotspot during the very early stage of the Covid outbreak. “There is an imperative need to boost the healthcare infrastructure of the town. So first thing, we wish to have is the RT-PCR lab and then we focus upon the construction of two major operation theatres and three minor operation theatres, that will enable us to conduct surgeries of people in need on a larger scale,” said Gosavi. The MMC has placed the demand of Rs 15.06 crore for all these infrastructures with the state government through the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF). The civic body has placed the demand of Rs 5.8 crore for construction of a major OT, a minor OT, 10-bed ICU, oxygen generation plant with a capacity to refill 400 cylinders per day along with 150 oxygen cylinders at 100-bed Sahara Hospital. The RT-PCR lab has been proposed at the cost of Rs 3.5 crore, besides a minor OT and ICU, paediatric medicines totalling Rs 6.75 crore.

The trains have been stopped and terminated at three stations and they will start their return journey as per schedule, the railway authorities from Bhusawal Division of Central Railway said. “There are very heavy rainfall in Mumbai and the train movement in region has been completely-affected. Hence, the long distance trains coming to Mumbai either have been cancelled from their point of origin or short-terminated at various stations,” Jeevan Chaudhary, public relations officer of Central Railway, said. Chaudhary further added that owing to the situation and priority to local trains, the long-distance trains originating from Mumbai also have been cancelled on July 19. The officer, however, warned the commuters who have booked their tickets to keep checking with the railway enquiry office about rescheduled timings of the trains that could happen once the situation in Mumbai improves. The trains that have been terminated, include 01142 Nandigram Special from Adilabad, that has been terminated at Igatpuri in Mumbai Division. The Amravati CSMT special 02112 has been terminated, that arrives at Nashik as 2.05, has been terminated at Devlali Railway Station, 02170 Mumbai Sewagram Super Fast was terminated at Bhusawal, 07058 Secunderabad-CSMT Devgiri Special at Nashik Road railway station while the 02272 Jalna-CSMT Janshatabdi Express has been terminated at Manmad. The railway officials said these train would continue their return journey at their scheduled timings on Monday. The Central Railway has arranged for return of travel ticket from the respective railway stations for people who want to terminate their journeys. Authorities said those who wanted to continue their journey till Lokmanya Tilak Terminus were allowed to do so considering that the traffic to this terminus was not yet stopped. “Since waterlogging and other issues were related to Mumbai only, the trains to Thane and LTT were not stopped. Hence, the passengers were allowed to travel by other trains till above destinations only,” the authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mumbai-rain-cause-termination-of-4-trains/articleshow/84530197.cms||---

A woman from the travel operator’s office filed an FIR. “A woman came to travel operator’s office around 12.30pm on Thursday, carrying a baby with her. When the woman came in, she was trying to put the baby to sleep. Once the woman put the baby to sleep, she told an employee at the booking office to look after the baby and left saying she wanted to use a restroom,” an officer from the Alandi police told TOI. The officer said, “The woman however did not return. After searching for her in the vicinity, the travel operator informed the police. The baby was sent to a care home.” The police have registered a case under section 317 (exposure and abandonment of child under twelve years, by parent or person having care of it) of the Indian Penal Code. In February this year, employees of a hotel found a two-day-old infant abandoned in some bushes in the old Katraj ghat section.

---||Hyderabad||Water war: Telangana Rashtra Samithi, Congress to protest in Parliament||HYDERABAD: Lawmakers of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and Congress have decided to vehemently protest against the BJP-led government over the Centre decision to take over management of Krishna and Godavari rivers and the irrigation projects on it during the Parliament sessions. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the TRS MPs to raise the issue during the monsoon session of Parliament which gets underway on Monday, whenever there is an opportunity. They have been asked to demand the rightful share of Telangana in the river waters. The TRS has nine MPs in the Lok Sabha, while the Congress has three. TRS has seven members in the Rajya Sabha. Asaduddin Owaisi, representing the AMIM is the lone lawmaker from Hyderabad. While TRS members in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha will counter the Centre’s total control over management of two rivers, the opposition Congress and BJP MPs in the lower house will simultaneously highlight concerns of the state and the failure of KCR to stop Andhra Pradesh from taking up new irrigation projects to divert more water from Krishna river. The TRS has nine MPs in the Lok Sabha, while the Congress has three and BJP four Parliamentarians respectively. “Union Jal Shakti Ministry has asked the two states, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, to deposit Rs 200 crore each, which means that while Centre will have full control of over the management of the two rivers flowing through Telangana and AP and it won’t be spending from its pocket but would be maintaining the irrigation projects in the two river basins with the money given by the states,” TRS MP from Chevella G Ranjit Reddy told TOI. ” At the cost of the state government, they want to monitor and maintain the projects. It is funny,” he said. Telangana government has invested thousands of crores of rupees on new and ongoing irrigation projects. KCR was demanding that the Tribunal allocates the state its share of water. Telangana had also filed a case in the Supreme Court but the Centre asked the state government to withdraw the case. “All of a sudden two river management boards were announced. Neither Telangana nor AP can move forward with any project without the permission of the Centre. Will the centre give permission for irrigation projects in just six months. All these and other points would be raised in the Parliament,” said Ranjit Reddy. Karimnagar MP and BJP state president Bandi Sanjay said they would ensure that not a single drop of allocated water to Telangana is taken away by any other state. “Firstly, we would highlight CM KCR’s failure to settle the river water dispute with AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. We welcome the Centre’s intervention but at the same time would ensure that Telangana does not lose out on its river water share,” he said. Malkajgiri MP and Congress state president A Revanth Reddy said the situation would not have arrived this far had CM KCR completed the numerous irrigation projects started and 80 per cent completed by the previous Congress governments. “Now, it is the question of the rightful share of the people of Telangana in the river water. The Congress will not allow any injustice meted out to them in river water issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-war-trs-cong-to-protest-in-parliament/articleshow/84537577.cms||Roushan Ali

The meeting was attended by RSS Sarkaryawah (general secretary) Dattatreya Hosable, joint general secretary Arun Kumar, the two RSS regional pracharak, BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, his two deputies-Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma-UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal. While it was a closed-door meeting, sources said that the RSS brass fine-tuned the ruling party’s electoral template to take on an assertive opposition. Sources said the RSS pitched for better coordination between Sangh, BJP and the UP government to ensure that the larger socio-political issues are taken up and executed properly. A senior BJP leader told TOI that the meeting essentially saw exchange of ideas between the Sangh and BJP functionaries for an execution of programmes at the district level. The meeting also comes amid strong emergence of CM Yogi Adityanath as a key face of the party in poll-bound UP. It was less than a week ago when PM Narendra Modi praised Yogi for tackling the pandemic, in what marked a pointed endorsement of the party’s saffron mascot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-bjp-top-brass-in-huddle-to-chalk-out-poll-strategy/articleshow/84536255.cms||Pankaj Shah

This will be for the second year in succession that the palkhis will travel to Pandharpur in buses instead of the traditional 250km procession that usually witnesses thousands of devotees walking all their way to the temple town in Solapur district. The state did not allow the procession due to the Covid situation. The revered ‘padukas’ (footwear) of both sants which were kept at Devulwada at Alandi and Dehugaon, will be taken in four separate buses. The state government has permitted at least 40 ‘warkaris’ to accompany each palkhi. The ‘padukas’ will reach Wakhari village, about eight km from Pandharpur, by Monday afternoon. From there, they will be taken by foot to Pandharpur as per tradition. On the day of the Ekadashi, the padukas will be taken to Lord Vitthal-Rukmini temple. Meanwhile, Ganpat Jadhav, in-charge of the rural hospital in Alandi, said, “All participants have been tested for Covid at private hospitals and they are negative.” Kishor Yadav, in-charge of primary health centre of Dehugaon, said, “We tested 40 warkaris who will accompany the palkhi in the last two days. Their reports are Covid negative. We have submitted their reports to the district administration and Sant Tukaram Maharaj temple trust.” Both the temple trusts have decorated the buses which will travel under police protection. The district administration has already issued directives to the trustees not to halt along the route. Also, it has barred assembly of five or more people in the villages along the route of palkhis to avoid possible crowding in view of Covid restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/palkhis-leave-by-bus-for-pandharpur-today/articleshow/84534251.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Delhi||Delhi: No cycling in Central Park-type ridge revamp||NEW DELHI: Plans to rejuvenate Delhi’s Central Ridge on the same lines as New York’s Central Park have seen some changes in the past few months, with the forest department objecting to commercial activities, including cycling, within the 423-hectare forest area. While earlier plans had incorporated amenities such as cycleways, walkways and even small bridges, these have been scrapped and only animal safaris will now be permitted in the Central Ridge. There will be walking trails, of course, but they would be natural ones, not man-made. To compensate, circuits will be created to enable people to go from the forest area to adjoining parks such as Talkatora Garden or Buddha Jayanti Park. Professor C R Babu, head, Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), who is leading the rejuvenation project, including replacement of the invasive vilayati kikar tree with native species, said the ‘sanctity’ of the Ridge would continue and recreational activities would be allowed only in parks fall within the Ridge ‘circuit’. “We want to revive the Central Ridge and that will always remain the priority,” said Babu. “The entire landscape will be evolved to consist of native tree species that should have been native to the Ridge instead of vilayati kikar. The latter will be systematically replaced. The revival work will take place in seven phases, with the entire rejuvenation area divided into seven zones. We will begin with work on the first zone on Sardar Patel Marg, opposite the ITC Maurya hotel.” A recent meeting with forest and wildlife department considered some suggestions that had been made, and some amendments were made accordingly in the plans, Babu revealed. “The new plan has largely been approved, but there are a few sticking points. We will sort them out soon and the rejuvenation plan can then commence,” he said. A forest official confirmed the developments, disclosing that suggestions had been taken from other field experts. “A presentation on the plan was made and some changes were made regarding certain aspects. In the first phase, work will begin on a 100-hectare area,” said the official. Babu also clarified there would no activities in the forested portions of the Ridge save for wildlife safaris. “There is a lot of fauna within the demarcated area, and more wildlife will return once the region is revived,” the professor explained. “People will be allowed to use the natural trails, but no other disturbance will be permitted in the main forest. Already, smaller parks and gardens have been created outside the forest and these are where park benches, gazebos and butterfly patches can be developed. The forest area will have natural waterbodies. Depressions will be revived to hold water. The parks can also have artificial ponds if required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/little-manhattan-no-cycling-in-central-park-type-ridge-revamp/articleshow/84534278.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Police said that A Srinivas, a resident of Kamareddy district, lodged a complaint claiming that one N Swamy, collected Rs 1.7 lakh through different modes, including cash and e-wallet. The payment was made by the victim in 2019. Since then, the accused has not provided the victim a job as promised. “The accused claimed he is a police officer and to gain the confidence of the victim, he would wear a police uniform at his residence. Believing him, the victim thought he can help get government jobs in different departments,” Begum Bazar inspector K Madhu Mohan Reddy said. The accused, Swamy, is also from Kamareddy district. It was in 2018 that the victim got introduced to accused through a common friend.

Speculations are rife about the possibility of BJP and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) joining hands for the NMC polls. Patil and MNS chief Raj Thackeray were in Nashik and had a 10-minute talk with each other at the parking area of the government guest house on Sunday. However, later during the press conference, he dismissed the possibility of BJP and MNS coming together for the polls. “The BJP is confident that it will single-handedly retain power in the NMC in the 2022 elections,” Patil said. Patil who met the office-bearers, elected representatives, party functionaries asked the elected representatives in the corporation to come out with compiled information about those work that were promised in the 2017-election manifesto and at the same time asked them to start the unfinished work in next six months. 'State should cut fuel price by Rs 10' Talking about the rising fuel prices, Patil said the central government has fixed the tax, but the rising prices of oil in the international market was affecting us badly. “If state is able to cut the price by Rs 10, I would immediately take up the issue with the central government for a way to cut down the prices of fuel,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bjp-to-fight-nmc-elections-alone/articleshow/84530238.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The body was naked below the waist and there were injury marks on it. However, the post-mortem report ruled out sexual assault and stated she was strangled to death. Rajkumar Agarwal, additional SP (rural), said, “It appears that the woman was killed for a motive and her clothes were disturbed to indicate the possibility of sexual assault in order to affect the investigation. We have questioned a few suspects but nothing has come out. The autopsy didn’t confirm sexual assault. We are looking for the suspects who had enmity with the family. We are also questioning the three women who accompanied the victim when she left her house to collect fodder.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Senior executive held for stealing firm’s secrets||MUMBAI: A senior executive of a pharmaceutical company has been arrested for allegedly stealing business secrets, including the client list, and using the information to launch his startup. The accused, Satyen Roy (45), who had joined the medical equipment manufacturing firm as vice-president (sales) stole its product blueprint and client database, and quit the company within seven months of joining it, said cyber police officials. Roy, who had been on the run, was arrested recently from a hotel in Ahmedabad. Roy was holed up in an Ahmedabad hotel with his wife and child, said officials of the cyber police station at Bandra Kurla Complex. The police said that they are on the lookout for two other employees of the pharma company—Roy’s secretary and his sales manager—for conniving with Roy by helping him get blueprints of different departments of the company. Before he was nabbed in Ahmedabad, Roy had been on a city-hopping spree. “Anticipating trouble with the law, he had first flown to Kolkata, then to Uttar Pradesh and other places,” said an official. After his location was tracked down to Gujarat, officials pinned him down to the hotel from the Gujarat police’s online database of guests in hotels. After stealing the company’s secrets, he allegedly tried to tarnish the pharma company’s name, said an official. “To pull the company’s clients, he told its customers that the company was cutting ‘huge profits by selling products at very exorbitant’ prices. He offered to sell the same products at lesser rates,” said the official. “The pharma company’s business in that particular section had almost dried up. Formerly, it was to the tune of a few crores, but had dwindled to almost nil.” The police said that Roy, whose monthly cost to the pharma company had been Rs 4 lakh, had also overstepped the limits of his authority by convening meetings with heads of various departments besides other senior employees. “This was done to wangle confidential business strategy as also to take the company’s employees into confidence before absorbing them into his own start-up,” a senior official from the cyber crime police station said. After allegedly pocketing the company’s sales policy format, product print, report format, vendors and client database, Roy stopped reporting to work from May 9. “He tendered his resignation on June 2,” states the complaint lodged by the company’s vice-president (administration), Vikas Upadhayay. The company’s lawyer Sunny Waskar told TOI, “Roy joined our company in October last year. By May this year, he had stolen our company’s secrets.” Roy, who has been booked for ‘criminal breach of trust’, was produced in the Esplanade Court on Friday and has been remanded in police custody till July 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sr-exec-held-for-stealing-firms-secrets/articleshow/84537583.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Kochi||‘Rare phenomenon in Kerala caused 2019 floods’||KOCHI: The extreme heavy rainfall of August 2019, which caused heavy landslide and mudslide leading to flooding of downstream areas, was a ‘mesoscale cloudburst (MsCB)’, normally seen in north India and a very rare and unheard of phenomenon in Kerala, says a study published in Elsevier ScienceDirect. Looking at the larger impact of such events in the state, researchers at the Advanced Center for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR), Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat), said that rainfall exceeding 50mm in two hours was reported in many places from 8am to 10pm on August 8, 2019. If what happened in 2019 is a harbinger of how global warming may continue to affect this region, transformation in cloud nature and extreme rainfall events could be a major threat to the highly-vulnerable Western Ghats ecosystem. “We looked at 2018 and 2019 heavy rainfall events recorded by multiple sources. In terms of the number of casualties and areas affected, the 2018 Kerala flood is considered a major flood and the flood in 2019, a minor one. However, we suggest that the latter must be looked at as a far more convincing evidence of the regional impact of ongoing global climate change. While the 2018 flood partly resulted from a large excess of monsoon rainfall accumulated throughout the season up to mid-August, the rain pattern that caused the 2019 floods is different,” said S Abhilash, director, ACARR- Cusat. “To our best understanding, such cloudburst events have not been recorded in the region ever since the meteorological data collection started. One of the hotspots of heavy rainfall in the Konkan region between 14° N and 16°N seems to have shifted more southward with likely fatal consequences, although longer records are needed to see if this is a systematic shift,” the researchers pointed out. An increase in rainfall intensity may suggest a rising probability for landslides in the high to mid-land slopes of Western Ghats in eastern Kerala during the monsoon seasons. The Western Ghats have been subjected to modifications by human intervention, chiefly for crop cultivation and the nature of the land favours landslides of multiple scales. “Our analysis reveals that the west coast of India is prone to massive flooding both from a moderate to high intensity rain spell that follows a prolonged wet period and also from events such as a cloudburst that pours enormous amounts of precipitation in a very short period.” Heavy precipitation in a short duration brings run-off water beyond the capacity of the rivers, and the sloping topography from high land Western Ghats to low-lying west coast accelerates the rush of flooding waters. Under normal monsoon conditions, the water level in the rivers of Kerala during July and August remains high. It suggests that a prolonged/intense spell of surplus rainfall during these months that follows a normal June monsoon has a huge potential to produce flooding near the river basins of Kerala. The study also highlights that such cloudburst events occurring under ideal ocean-atmospheric conditions may leave a vast area of the state vulnerable to flash floods and landslides, any time during the monsoon season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rare-phenomenon-caused-2019-floods/articleshow/84532086.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Goa||Tillari officials forced to increase water discharge||BICHOLIM: After Tillari inter-state irrigation project authorities began releasing excess water from Tillari reservoir last week, officials were further compelled to increase the water discharge following heavy showers to avoid any danger to the dam. This led to a rise in the level in river Chapora at Sal, Bicholim taluka. However, water resources department (WRD) officials stated that the situation is control. Meghshyam Raut, a local, said that villagers have been consistently demanding that authorities in both states follow proper coordination while discharging water. He also said that the scenario at Sal is better this year due to adequate coordination efforts. However, crops were destroyed at Sal due to waterlogged agricultural land following heavy rains. Farmers fear that they may face acute losses this year as well. Bicholim and Valvanti rivers were in spate owing to the continuous downpour. However, WRD authorities continuously pumped out water from the flooding point at Sakhali to prevent flooding in the market area. At Bicholim town, while the situation was largely under control due to the wall along the walking track. some pedestrians faced harships due to stagnation of water on the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tillari-officials-forced-to-increase-water-discharge/articleshow/84536279.cms||---

While, every year, they have had to suspend operations for a few hours, the increased intensity of this week’s rainfall has forced them to shut shop three times in seven days. “Operations at most shops along the road get paralysed when the road floods. Even if we decide to keep our respective shops open, we have no customers coming in as the entire street is waterlogged,” a businessman from the area, Gajanan Golatkar, said. On Sunday, after the city experienced 113mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm, the 18th June road, which is one of the busiest streets in the city, had to be barricaded in the morning to curb traffic movement on the inundated road. Motorists had to be diverted along alternative routes. Traffic was regularised after the water receded. “People tend to abuse us for barricading the entire road. They don’t realise that driving through the flooded road splashes muddy water into our shops even as we attempt to drain it out,” one businessman said. Senior businessmen in the area recall that the waterlogging was not as severe even until a decade ago. “The water level in the Mandovi is very high this year compared to previous years. Once the water level increases and encroaches on the roads, there is no salvation for us. Irrespective of who takes over the city as mayor or MLA, our problems remain unsolved. Every year we submit a representation to the municipality, yet there has been no solution,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-end-to-woes-for-panajis-18th-june-road/articleshow/84536303.cms||Nida Sayed

More than 75 organizations have joined the platform — Piblitz — after it was made live for NGOs in April this year. Founded by Dharmesh Rajput, an engineer from the 2018 batch of GEC Bharuch, and his younger brother Harnish, Piblitz has been incubated at the Association for Harnessing Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Harnish is a 2020 batch graduate from NIT Surat. The platform has received support under the students’ startup and innovation policy of Gujarat government. “It all started in February this year, when Dharmesh was pitching our community platform to non-profit organizations in India. He then identified a problem, the Indian NGOs are focused on approaching new people but are not developing trust in existing donors. This eventually leads to raising fewer unpredictable funds. Additionally, there was no platform or tool which could solve this problem,” said Harnish. The duo observed that it was difficult for a person to donate a huge amount at one time. But it was easy for anyone to contribute a small amount every month. “On our platform, an NGO can create a page for free and start taking purpose-oriented monthly donations by setting up tiers. A tier is a membership plan of some rupees and describes a specific cause for donation — for instance, ‘food for one child’, ‘stationary for a one street kid’,” he said. Whoever subscribes to a tier becomes a community member and starts receiving automatic email notifications about the NGO’s work. “This helps an NGO gain transparency and gives donors a place where they can connect with other contributors,” he said. “We are on a mission to help 10,000 NGOs in the country maximize their donations by strengthening their personal donor community,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/engineer-brothers-startup-helps-ngos-maximize-donations/articleshow/84532163.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Nagpur||Industrial, corporate inoculations on rise, boost population coverage||Nagpur: Covid-19 vaccination at industrial and corporate companies is on the rise in the district and in Chandrapur with the aim to protect employees, foster safe workplaces and help the administration cover more and more people. It may also ease the burden on government centres, which are facing serious problems due to irregular and insufficient supply of doses from the government. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “Vaccination of all eligible people is necessary to keep cases low and control the deaths. Supply of doses at government centres is limited. In such a situation, industrial and corporate companies have to play a crucial role. They will have to own responsibility of their employees and family members.” He added, “If every establishment sponsors vaccination of its staff, it will help inoculate all eligible people as soon as possible. I will hold meetings with establishments and encourage industrial and corporate vaccination.” The government had allowed industrial and corporate vaccination along with private hospitals from May 1. Private hospitals of the city started to get doses from May 31 but the count was limited to one or two. At present, 14 private hospitals are doing vaccination and facilitating all three vaccines — Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. Therefore, industrial and corporate vaccination has increased. Kingsway Hospital has started vaccination in other districts too. On Saturday and Sunday, Chandrapur-based Dhariwal Infrastructure and Power Limited, RP Sanjiv Goenka Group, in association with Kingsway Hospital, did vaccination of around 500 staff members. Plant head Bhaskar Ganguly and head of administration Sandip Mukherjee took the initiative. Mukherjee said, “Around 950 staff members, including those engaged by contractors are working in the power plant. We ensured vaccination of 45-plus earlier and now, the remaining staffers. Almost all our employees have been vaccinated. The company sponsored expenditure of vaccination of staff and family members of officials.” Kingsway Hospital has done vaccination for 29 industrial and corporate establishments till date. Director Amit Somani said, “15,691 doses have been procured for 29 establishments. Vaccination of 9,444 people has been completed and is in process for 6,247 people. We are getting good response for industrial and corporate vaccination.” Kingsway Hospital conducted vaccination at Ballarpur Industries Limited (BILT) in Chandrapur district before Dhariwal. The hospital has also done inoculation at government bodies like RBI and corporate companies like TCS, Mahindra and Mahindra, Hexaware, Infocepts, HCL, Persistent and Infosys in the district. Wockhardt Hospital has done vaccination of around 6,000 people at 25 corporate establishments. Centre head Abhinandan Dastenavar said, “It's a nice gesture from corporate companies to push their employees and families to get vaccinated at their campus or at hospital. This will help individuals and ensure safety of the company in the pandemic. It will also help in saving cost of hospitalization and prevent losses by absenteeism because of the disease. Ultimately, it will benefit the city, district and nation.” The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) did not conduct vaccination at 153 centres on Sunday, citing lack of doses. The civic body received 34,000 doses of Covishield and 1,200 doses of Covaxin on Saturday afternoon, yet decided to resume vaccination on Monday instead of Sunday. As many as 2,424 people took the jab at 14 private centres in the city on Sunday. The zilla parishad continued vaccination and administered doses to 11,832 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/industrial-corporate-inoculations-on-rise-boost-population-coverage/articleshow/84534344.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||Underground corridor for safe passage to leopards on Surajkund-Pali road||NEW DELHI: An underground green corridor on the Surajkund-Pali road close to the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary has been proposed by the forest and wildlife department to ensure safe passage for leopards and other wild animals. Forest officials said that at least four leopards have died in the last six years after being hit by speeding vehicles on the same stretch. After a leopard was found dead on June 28, forest officials suspected it was one of three leopards that was living in the sanctuary for nearly a year. The department has invited DMRC to conduct a feasibility study for construction of the corridor. A team of forest department and DMRC conducted the survey and recommended construction of an underground corridor rather than an overhead one. Deputy conservator of forests (South) Amit Anand said, “We have sent a recommendation to the chief wildlife warden to construct an underground green corridor for the safe passage of leopards. Vehicles can move on the road. We are planning to block the way connecting underground corridor to the road so that the wild animals do not go to the road.” Chief wildlife warden Nisheet Saxena said, “We have received the proposal for the construction of an underground wildlife corridor.” According to officials, the area connects the Aravali belt and there is a frequent movement of wild animals, including leopards, from Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary to Haryana. “Following the deaths of atleast four leopards in the last six years in this manner, it is necessary to build a green corridor that can play an important role in minimising road accidents,” added the forest official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/underground-corridor-for-safe-passage-to-leopards/articleshow/84534334.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Kochi||Kerala: Safety a concern as tunnel work nears completion||THRISSUR: Though efforts are on to open one of the twin tunnels at Kuthiran by August, officials of the company which had executed more than 90% of its work have raised doubts about the safety aspects. Officials of Pragathi Engineering and Rail Project Private Ltd (PERPPL) have warned about the possibilities of mud slip above the entrance of the tunnel. The Kuthiran tunnels are being constructed as part of the six-laning of the Mannuthy-Wadakkanchery stretch of the national highway linking Kerala with Tamil Nadu. The main work was awarded to KMC Constructions Ltd and this company had subcontracted the work for constructing a twin tunnel at Kuthiran climb to PERPPL. Pragathi Engineering had quit after completing over 90% work on the first tunnel and nearly 75 per cent work on the second tunnel alleging that KMC had not paid a huge amount as the cost of the completed work despite repeated requests. The tunnel work is also now being undertaken by KMC. Pragathi Engineering officials said that hasty opening of the tunnel without undertaking a proper safety audit by a competent authority could be disastrous. “There are possibilities of mud slip and fall of boulders as well as trees at the entrance of the tunnel unless the upper portion is protected using strong cementing and constructing a water drainage systems at tunnel top,” PERPPL spokesperson V Sivanandan. Replying to questions, he said the financial disputes between Pragathi and KMC are being taken up legally. “We have filed cases at the high court to get Rs 36 crore from KMC and on other issues. We are raising these issues because of our concern for the safety of those travelling through the tunnels. Pragathi Engineering should not be blamed if anything untoward happens due to the lack of adoption of adequate safety measures,’’ he said. Revenue minister K Rajan, who visited the tunnel construction site said on Sunday, said that the tunnel would be opened only after ensuring that it was safe. He said a first-level audit has been completed by fire force officials, and based on their report, more firefighting systems like fire extinguishers will be installed in the tunnels. The fire brigade officials will conduct another round of safety audit, the minister said. He said the safety wing of the national highways authority of India will conduct the final safety review before opening the tunnel. He added that the highway construction company could not start collecting toll just because one tunnel is opened. Toll collection can begin after completing all the construction work, the minister said. The contract for converting the 28.5-km-long Mannuthy-Wadakkanchery road was inked in 2009. The total estimated cost was Rs 641 crore. The cost has gone up to over Rs 1,300 crore as per the RTI replies received by Congress leader Shaji Kodenkandath in 2019. Also, the work was getting inordinately delayed due to various reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/safety-a-concern-as-tunnel-work-nears-completion/articleshow/84532041.cms||T Ramavarman

The mine was earlier allotted to the company and has now been placed for e-auctioning as it failed to commence operations. The Odisha government has allowed the company to participate in other e-auctions of mineral blocks. It has put up 11 mineral blocks for e-auction, including BICO. Speaking to TOI, Fomento managing director Ambar Timblo said that they did not commence operations because the Odisha government changed the terms and conditions after the block was allocated. He said that they had placed the bid based on the terms and conditions during the bidding process, but subsequently the Odisha government changed it and later cancelled the mineral block allotted to them. “Fomento is evaluating which areas to participate in the proposed auctions by the Odisha government. The auction process in the state has not yielded positive results this far, as production since auction is at a record low,” Timblo said. “With regards to the BICO auction participation, Fomento has moved the court, as the matter is already pending there. We hope that the matter will be clarified in time before the proposed auction Fomento had challenged the Odisha government in this case post being the successful bidder, as the government attempted to modify and introduce new terms post completion of auction,” Timblo said. With no signs of mining activities resuming soon in Goa, Fomento had decided to expand its footprint outside the state. In February 2020, the Centre had allotted an iron ore mine in an area of 7.5 lakh sqm to Fomento in Odisha with a production limit of 5 million tonnes per annum. Before mining came to a halt in Goa in September 2012, the production at Fomento mines was around 15 million tonnes per annum. The Odisha mine is set to be the biggest in the company’s portfolio. The mine allotted in Odisha was being operated by Bonai Industrial Company Ltd (BICO). The lease was to expire in March 2020 and the Union government decided to e-auction all mines expiring in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-mining-firm-barred-from-odisha-mine-e-auction/articleshow/84537610.cms||Murari Shetye

The groups’s bank guarantees, furnished on different occasions to the tune of Rs .99 lakh, were forfeited by Telangana State Pollution Control Board (PCB). “If the amount of Rs .99 lakh is deducted from the compensation, then the balance amount payable will be Rs .7.3 crore, which the appellant is liable to pay. Of the total compensation amount, as a condition for granting the stay, the appellant had deposited 50%, Rs .4.1 crore. The same has to be deducted. Piramal is liable to pay Rs 3.2 crore,” NGT said in the order. NGT ordered PCB to conduct periodical inspection of Piramal Industries, and, if any violation, initiate action against the industry. Piramal Industries has a manufacturing unit at Digwal village, Kohir mandal, Sangareddy district. One Lakshma Reddy wrote a letter to NGT alleging untreated effluents were being discharged by Piramal unit along with two other industries into the ground, affecting the ground water quality. National Green Tribunal, New Delhi, had suo motu registered a case in 2018. The principal bench in October 2018, directed the PCB and the collector Sangareddy to look into the allegations and take appropriate action in accordance with law within a month. It directed PCB not only to prosecute the violators, but also to recover compensation for the damage caused to the environment from the appellant and others on ‘Polluters Pay’ principle regarding the appellant’s capacity. The joint committee, comprising the respondent officials and officials of Central Pollution Control Board, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur, filed its report. The principal bench in November, 2019, considered the report of the Joint Committee. The committee had assessed the environmental compensation at the rate of Rs .60,000 per day and recommended an assessment of Rs 8.3 crore for 1,386 days. The principal bench, as per order in November 2019, directed PCB to take further action, including recovery of compensation against Piramal. PCB had in December 2020 passed orders for Rs 8.3 crore compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngt-directs-piramal-to-pay-rs-3-2-cr-fine-in-a-mth/articleshow/84535510.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Quoting the tweet, Kejriwal said BJP can hurl whatever abuses at him as it wants to, but its not right to say frivolous thing in the context of Bahuguna. “The leaders of BJP cannot think and process after CM Kejriwal installed a portrait and a statue of the great environmentalist in Delhi legislative assembly,” said AAP’s Uttarakhand wing president Brij Mohan Upreti. “BJP has insulted Uttarakhandis using unacceptable remarks against Shri Bahuguna (sic),” he added.

---||Delhi||Delhi: As raptors find sanctuary at Asola, Shikra numbers double in 4 years||NEW DELHI: The population of Shikra (Accipiter badius), a resident raptor at Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in south Delhi, has doubled in four years, the findings of a four-year survey have revealed. In all, 18 raptor species were found between 2017 and 2020, including 14 species that currently fall under schedule-I of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The study, conducted by Bombay Natural History Society, said while Shikra numbers had doubled, sightings of another winter migratory bird, Steppe eagle (Aquila nipalensis), had also increased considerably with large congregations being recorded at Asola lake. In January 2017, before the survey began, a critically endangered white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) was seen at the sanctuary, which officials said served as the inspiration to carry out an assessment of the raptors. The census began in October 2017 and a month later a near-threatened Pallid Harrier (Circus macrourus) was recorded for the first time there. Sohail Madan, centre manager at the sanctuary and Delhi head of BNHS, who led the survey, said their aim was not only to identify the number of raptor species, but also assess whether there was an increase in their population due to habitat enrichment and conservation efforts. While Shikra have thrived over the years, Steppe eagle sightings have been high in the local waterbodies each winter. “The survey had 250 participants and was carried out every winter over four years. Due to habitat enrichment carried out under the supervision of the Delhi forest and wildlife department, along with a stable prey population, the number of Shikra species doubled in the last four years. Neeli Jheel has also become an important stopover site for migratory raptors like Steppe eagle. In November 2020, 12 Steppe eagles were recorded at the lake for a few weeks after which they moved to other locations,” said Madan. Among the rare and important sightings made during the survey were the red-headed vulture, which is critically endangered, an Egyptian vulture, which is endangered, and a greater spotted eagle, which falls in the vulnerable category, according to International Union for Conservation of Nature. Madan said, “This survey has been an effective tool in not just studying importance of raptors, but also their habitat preferences. Moreover, connecting Delhiites with wildlife programmes like these helps in cultivating ownership for green areas and raising the level of awareness around these majestic birds.” The forest and wildlife department helped remove encroachments from the sanctuary over the last few years, while afforestation took place in areas where the boundary walls were broken, or where human interference was high. Check dams were also created over the last two years to improve moisture conservation at the sanctuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-raptors-find-sanctuary-at-asola-shikra-numbers-double-in-4-years/articleshow/84534365.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Chennai||Stepped back from politics to give Edappadi K Palaniswami, O Panneerselvam a chance: V K Sasikala||CHENNAI: In a recent call to an AIADMK cadre, V K Sasikala explained the rationale behind her decision to step back from politics after her return from the Bengaluru prison on serving her four-year term in the disproportionate assets case. “When they (AIADMK joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami and coordinator O Panneerselvam) claimed they would win 150 seats in the assembly election, I decided to give them a chance and stepped back. But we were defeated. So, I decided to come back and strengthen the party and get back the glorious days,” she said in a conversation to a party woman worker, released on Saturday. On March 3, three weeks after a grand road show and return to Chennai, former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s aide Sasikala made an announcement to ‘step aside’ from politics, urging partymen to remain united and to ensure the party’s victory in the April assembly election. But in a dramatic comeback, Sasikala returned to the limelight, reconnecting with disgruntled cadres, who had written to her urging her to take over the party, and promising them she would ensure the AIADMK’s grand return on the political scene. Relentlessly pursuing her mission to connect with the AIADMK workers, Sasikala, during a call to Gomathi Srinivasan of Villupuram said, “What did I say when I returned from prison? That we should be together. I stepped back and decided to let them go ahead and fulfil their promise to win 150 seats. But what happened. We lost.” Sounding confident about returning to the party and taking over its reins. Sasikala told another party worker Sundarapandian from Sankarankoil, “I am here for party cadres. Unlike them (EPS and OPS), we don’t discriminate on caste or communal lines. When I was in (Poes) Garden with Amma (Jayalalithaa), I was in the habit of reaching out to cadres. This is nothing new to me.” Heaping effusive praise on her, partymen said there was “great expectation” from cadres. “We want you to take over the party and bring back the military discipline that Amma and you had enforced within the AIADMK,” said Sundarapandian. For her party, Sasikala promised to visit Jayalalithaa’s memorial and to the state to meet cadres. Meanwhile, the rattled AIADMK leadership continued with the sacking spree, expelling cadres who maintained links with Sasikala. In periodical intervals, the AIADMK issued orders, expelling partymen from across the state. “We had advised cadres not to get swayed by Sasikala’s gimmicks. But if they continue to reach out to her, we have no option but to expel them,” said a senior leader, seeking anonymity in wake of a recent gag order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stepped-back-from-politics-to-give-eps-ops-a-chance-sasikala/articleshow/84537866.cms||Jaya Menon

Though the incident took place on July 15, the survivor apprised her family of it on Saturday as the accused had threatened her against speaking about it. The minor said in her police complaint, “My parents work as laborers and my siblings and I stay at home. On July 15, I was going to my aunt’s house in a nearby locality, when the accused met me on the way. He asked me to have some snacks with him. I agreed and he brought me a soft drink. After consuming it, I blacked out. When I gained consciousness, I realized he was raping me at a vacant room. When I resisted, he threatened to kill me and warned me against speaking about it.” Scared, the minor kept quiet. On having severe pain in lower abdomen, she told her parents about it. ASI Sukhdev Singh said the family lodged a complaint on Saturday evening after which a case was registered under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. “The accused is a labourer.

---||Noida||Noida: 2 held as ATS busts international VoIP call routing racket||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) busted an international VoIP (voice over internet protocol) call routing racket and arrested two persons in Noida on Sunday. The accused, Abhay Mishra and Shams Tahir Khan, who operated the racket using fake identities (as Aditya and Tushar Sharma, respectively) were arrested from Sector 153 in Noida. ATS also recovered cables, routers, laptop and phone line of a private telecom company. ATS officials said the arrested persons had been running the racket for the last two months. DySP, ATS, Atul Kumar Yadav said the accused, in violation of the rules issued by the government of India (TRAI), converted VoIP calls into voice calls, causing loss of revenue to the exchequer. “Abhay Mishra was a techie who used a software to convert internet calls to normal ones. As per the rules, VoIP calls landing in India must be done on VoIP only. However, the duo took a primary rate interface (PRI) line from a private telecom company by setting up a bogus network company with registration from the United Kingdom,” said Yadav. The duo took PRI lines fraudulently showing that they would run a call center to help NRIs. Yadav said PRI connection allowed transmission of voice, data, or video traffic between the network and the user. “The duo floated an advertisement of their company on social media offering cheaper calls in India from any part of the world which is illegal,” he said. ATS officers said routing of VoIP calls not only caused revenue loss but also posed a threat risk to the country’s security. ATS will seek their remand from the court on Monday and question them about their partners involved in the crime and if they are running more such centres. An officer privy to the probe said ATS would also look into the bank accounts of the accused and the money they got through the racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/intl-call-routing-racket-busted/articleshow/84536350.cms||---
---||Delhi||Water Production Peaks To All-Time High Of 955 MGD||New Delhi: Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on Sunday claimed that its water production in the last 24 hours reached an all-time high of 955 million gallons per day (MGD). Normally, DJB supplies 925-935 MGD water during the summer months. Water minister Satyendar Jain stated that water production would be increased to 980 MGD by December 2021. Officials said sufficient raw water availability and some engineering interventions were used to increase the operational capacity. Data showed that Chandrawal, Bhagirathi, Sonia Vihar, Haiderpur, Dwarka and Nangloi water treatment plants (WTP) were operating above their normal capacities. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: “The government is doing its best to provide water to all. Our engineers are working 24x7 against all odds.” The Haiderpur WTP contributed the maximum amount to the raised capacity by adding 19.5 MGD, followed by the Chandrawal plant that added 5.8 MGD and Bhagirathi produced 4.2 MGD more water above normal. The other facilities raised their production between 1.7 and 3.6 MGD. Besides the 860 MGD raw water from various river sources and canals, an additional 95 MGD was being sourced from groundwater resources, officials said. Delhi government stated that the average production usually hovered around 910 MGD. With the projected demand of 1,236 MGD, the water-stressed capital has a 300 MGD demand-supply gap. According to the draft Master Plan of Delhi 2041 projections, this demand is likely to increase to 1,746 MGD by 2031. Various projects have been conceptualised by DJB to add raw water in the next few years, including plants for usage of unutilised Yamuna water share from Himachal Pradesh, water exchange with UP in which Delhi would provide treated wastewater for irrigation in exchange for 140 MGD raw water, and the Palla project based on Singapore NEWater model in which highly treated water from the Coronation plant would be put back in the river. DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha said optimum levels had been achieved due to sufficient availability of raw water in the Yamuna as well as engineering solutions. “Our engineers worked round the clock for equitable distribution of available water by reducing turbidity, adding alum and increasing tanker trips in areas of distress,” he added. Recently, Delhi faced a shortfall of 100 MGD in production and Chadha accused Haryana for not releasing the capital’s rightful share of water. The Haryana CM denied the allegation stating that Delhi government keeps blaming its neighbouring state for every problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/water-production-peaks-to-all-time-high-of-955-mgd/articleshow/84534432.cms||Paras Singh

While the copious rain has led to a steady rise in water levels, broken and unrepaired bunds have further plagued the villagers with inundated fields. The saltwater has even seeped into the groundwater polluting the wells, in addition to which, issues with ferry connectivity has left many of the villagers apprehensive. “The water has reached beyond the fields and poisoned the well water. The panchayat is supposed to have repaired the bunds, yet the problem has recurred,” said resident of the village, Joe Rodrigues. With a number of houses in the island being Indo-Portuguese structures, many residents are finding their private properties waterlogged. “Even near the Pomburpa church, the river water has entered fields and flooded them. While we are used to seeing inundated roads and fields every monsoon, this time, it has been unusual. There has been no relief from the continuous heavy rain,” another resident said. Yet another resident said that his mobility was affected after flooded roads near the ferry made it difficult for him to avail of the river route. As a result, he was forced to take the Calvim bridge via Aldona to head to work. The Captain of Ports, however, assured that the ferry service to the island village will not be suspended despite the weather conditions. “We have deployed five ferry boats at Chorao for the villagers and there are enough vessels at other routes as well. There hasn’t been any stormy weather that could cause any disruption in services,” captain James Braganza said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/saltwater-in-wells-flooded-fields-chorao-islanders-feel-brunt-of-rain/articleshow/84536352.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Pune||Decline in cases prompts 64% drop in demand for medical oxygen in Pune||PUNE: At 64%, the district has registered a massive drop in the demand for medical oxygen due to the sharp decline in Covid-19 cases over the past few weeks and thanks to the installation of oxygen plants across civic hospitals, revealed a district health office report. The demand for oxygen had risen to 363 metric tonnes in April during the peak of the second wave. The number has dropped to 128 metric tonnes, the report stated. At present, 16 oxygen plants are functioning across civic-run hospitals. The plants produce oxygen at the rate of 13,000 litres per minute (LPM) and can cater to the hospitals’ needs. As per the report, 38 more oxygen generation plants have been proposed across Pune district. The plants will produce 28,000 LPM of oxygen in total. Food & Drug Administration joint commissioner SB Patil told TOI the situation earlier in the second wave was quite concerning with the demand for oxygen rising to over 350 metric tonnes, but it has now reduced to around 120-128 metric tonnes. “Since the production capacity of liquid oxygen for Pune district is around 350 metric tonnes and the demand has dropped to 120 metric tonnes, the remaining oxygen is being supplied for industrial use, which had been stopped earlier,” he said, adding that the demand for oxygen is yet to reach January levels, when it was around 67 metric tonnes. Meanwhile, the health office report added that six oxygen generation plants have started across Pune Municipal Corporation limits . Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation additional commissioner Vikas Dhakane said that the administration has increased its liquid medical oxygen capacity. “During this wave, the demand had reached almost 45 metric tonnes at our civic hospitals. Now, we are planning to have storage capacity of at least 120-140 metric tonnes. The new tanks will be installed in a few days,” Dhakane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/decline-in-cases-prompts-64-drop-in-demand-for-medical-o2/articleshow/84536342.cms||Piyush Bhusari

A signboard has been put up by the local military authority (LMA) regarding civilians being restricted from walking. Over the last two decades, the locals used to pass through this Piru Singh Marg, and attend morning walks and other physical exercises. Angered locals on Sunday lodged a complaint with Union defence minister, Rajnath Singh, through Twitter regarding the issue. “Why are morning walkers illegally barred from walking in Secunderabad Cantonment public roads by LMA,” the walkers questioned the defence minister. When TOI contacted a Defence PRO wing official to get the exact reason for shutting of the gates and restricting of morning walkers at the marg, no response was received. Meanwhile, for the first time, vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu, took the Secunderabad Cantonment’s road closure issue to the notice of the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Naidu referred to the issue when the newly-appointed union minister of state (MoS) for defence, Ajay Bhatt, called on him at his residence on Sunday. On the occasion, Naidu advised Bhatt to examine the issue of closure of public roads in Secunderabad Cantonment area, stating it was causing difficulty to thousands of people living in surrounding colonies. “Look into the closure of public roads in detail and take steps to mitigate the hardship faced by the people,” Venkaiah Naidu suggested to the union minister. Naidu also mentioned about a letter represented by the Telangana government to the Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on the issue.

The big fat weddings instead have turned into muted, intimate affairs held in Ahmedabad itself. And, this is bringing business to city hotels. “Most people who had scheduled their weddings to be held in Rajasthan or Goa have either pushed their bookings to December or have booked venues in Ahmedabad. After deferring their special occasion multiple times due to changing Covid rules, people are opting for quiet wedding in or around the city,” Krunal Parekh, a wedding planner. “Destination weddings were being held till February. However, thanks to the second wave of Covid, many functions scheduled in March got deferred to next year. Now with the threat of third wave looming large, people do not want to take a chance,” Parekh further added. Restriction on inter-state movement, according to event managers, is a key deterrent to hosting a destination wedding. This has encouraged many to go for intimate events held in Ahmedabad, confirmed wedding planners and event managers. This has boosted business for city hotels. So much so that certain hotels in Ahmedabad have hosted at least 30 weddings since June. “About 40 wedding ceremonies were organised at our hotel and business has been good. Weddings which were supposed to take place in the past 18 months have all been deferred. The second that the government lifted restrictions and allowed eventss to be held with 50-100 persons, venues got booked for all auspicious dates. Weddings now are rather intimate affairs, wrapped up in two days instead of a minimum four-day affair earlier,” said Puneet Baijal, general manager, Hyatt Regency Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hotels-gain-as-covid-grounds-destination-weddings/articleshow/84534468.cms||Niyati Parikh

Several parts of the city did not receive water even as the BMC worked on a war footing to restore supply. “The water supply system is expected to be restarted in a few hours, but it may take longer for the filtration system to be up and running. Mumbaikars should boil water before drinking even after supply is back as a precaution,” a civic official said. “Due to the inundation, the filtration and drainage plants had to be shut down. Power supply also had to be cut off...This disrupted supply in most parts of the city.” An MSEDCL spokesperson said the power utility firm had not disconnected supply to the 11kv pumping station. “As a preventive measure, the BMC officials took the decision to disconnect supply at their level,” the official said. Taps ran dry in the island city and western suburbs; water supply was partially affected in the eastern suburbs. Many housing societies were forced to get water from tankers and complained that they were charging exorbitant rates. Late on Sunday, BMC said restoration of supply has begun in a phased manner and several areas in central Mumbai received water at night. Other areas will receive water late on Sunday or Monday morning, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-boil-drinking-water-bmc-tells-residents/articleshow/84537612.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

It warned of strict action against those who continue to violate party norms.“Our party president (M K Stalin) has been insisting on us to end this culture of putting up banners. But there are a few party functionaries who continue to set up banners. Putting up banners hindering traffic movement, leading to accidents that were witnessed during the AIADMK regime in Tamil Nadu and it resulted in deaths,” recalled DMK organisation secretary and Rajya Sabha MP R S Bharathi in a statement on Sunday.“Our party president was the first one to submit an undertaking before the Madras high court saying banners will not be put up on behalf of DMK. While most party functionaries have stopped putting up such banners and hoardings, there are a few still indulging in this. DMK will not permit this anymore,” Bharathi said.He requested party functionaries not to erect banners henceforth without permission. “Party headquarters will act against anyone disobeying the orders of the party president,” Bharathi said.“The banner and hoarding culture had led to unwanted incidents and deaths and hence the party had given an undertaking before the Madras high court. Party headquarters would have received complaints about these being put up somewhere and hence the reiteration to desist from such acts,” said a senior DMK leader.“Hoardings are already banned as per the high court order. Everyone is aware of it, I think. We are going on an all-out drive against posters and the corporation wants even the private walls to be spared of being painted with any private or political slogans,” Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi told TOI.“We will also like to give a formal call to not to deface bridges and other public places with hoardings. All the political parties have all supported in the posters issue, since it is a common drive to beautify the city. We seek the support of everybody in keeping the city clean,” Bedi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dmk-asks-cadres-not-to-put-hoardings/articleshow/84537867.cms||D Govardan
---||Nagpur||Rs1,600cr disaster warning centre in Mihan soon: Min||Nagpur: State government is firming up plans to start a Rs1,600 crore advanced disaster warning centre in Nagpur, said cabinet minister Vijay Wadettiwar here on Sunday. The minister for relief and rehabilitation said this centre will be using high-end Israeli technology and will provide advanced information about natural disasters so that there is ample time available to prepare and react. “Using technology, this centre will provide advanced warning regarding rains, cyclones etc. This will help us to be better prepared to deal with the situation,” said Wadettiwar. “A 10 acre plot is being sought in Mihan and I am hopeful that it will be allotted in the next two weeks. Paperwork for the project has already started,” he added. Giving background on how this idea came about, Wadettiwar said it was during an official trip to Bengaluru. “There they have a disaster information system centre which is very helpful in alerting all stakeholders about natural disasters. So, we realized that in Maharashtra too, we need to have an advanced centre that will help us to monitor the situation,” said Wadettiwar. He said currently alerts are being issued based on weather forecasts. “Many times, we issue alerts but nothing happens. Having an advanced technology enabled system will be very beneficial,” said the minister. On the prolonged dry spell in Nagpur, which got partial relief on Sunday with some light showers, Wadettiwar said it is affecting farming activity. “If this dry spell continues, farmers may have to go for resowing. They need accurate information as they plan everything on weather pattern,” said Wadettiwar. The minister, who was in Nagpur on Sunday, was addressing the media primarily about heavy showers in Mumbai and the casualties in the rain-related incidents. Wadettiwar said, “Before every monsoon, we issue warning to people living near or on hillocks, but not everyone is ready to evacuate. Even with 150mm rainfall, Mumbai faces a lot of problems because of its geography, here 300mm had fallen within a span of 24 hours.” He added Rs5 lakh will be given to families of Mumbai landslide victims, while all injured shall be treated at government’s expense.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs1600cr-disaster-warning-centre-in-mihan-soon-min/articleshow/84534420.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Madurai||Madras high court: Penalise those defecating, dumping garbage on temple land||MADURAI: Taking a serious view that a temple land and a water channel running through the land at Y Othakadai in Madurai district was used for dumping garbage and open defecation, the Madras high court has directed the authorities to take steps to properly maintain the land and the water channel. The court also directed the authorities to impose fines and disconnect the water supply connection to the houses of people involved in such activities. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the land belonging to the Kothandaramasamy temple is being used as a garbage dumping yard and also for open defecation. The water channel running between the land is filled with garbage and sewage water is also being discharged by the residents of the area. The judges took note of the fact that though the 9.49 acres of land was fenced, people are still entering the land and are dumping garbage. The judges observed that due to the lack of drainage facilities and lack of septic tanks, most of the houses in the locality are discharging the drainage water inside the water channel. The judges observed that the menace of open defecation should also be put to an end. They directed the Madurai district collector to constitute a team of experts from the health departments in order to sensitize the people about the ill-effects of open defecation by distributing pamphlets. The judges directed the authorities to conduct periodical inspections at the area to ensure that the temple land is not misused in the future. The court passed the order on a public interest litigation filed by K Kavitha, a resident of Y Othakadai, who sought to clean and maintain the PWD water channel and the land belonging to Kothandaramaswamy temple in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-penalise-those-defecating-dumping-garbage-on-temple-land/articleshow/84532122.cms||---

Normally, dams in the state are seen reaching their capacity in the month of July, but, this monsoon season, the surplus rainfall received in Goa so far may have contributed to the dams overflowing five to six days earlier, officials of the water resources department said. Other than Anjunem, all dams in the state have inbuilt systems that lead to the excess water flowing out once water level in the reservoirs reaches capacity. The minor reservoir of Panchawadi was the first one to begin overflowing on July 12 and continues to be 100% full. The next day, water level in the Selaulim dam reached capacity at 6am. The Selaulim reservoir caters to the water requirements of most of South Goa. The dam has a unique duck bill spillway, which makes for a delightful sight to watch when the water begins to overflow. Usually, large number of Goans visit the Selaulim dam site to witness this, while also looking forward to spending time at the botanical garden developed around the dam area. However, this year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, visit to dam sites have been prohibited. The Amthane dam in Bicholim is also fast reaching its capacity, being 98% full at present. For the second consecutive year, the Gaunem reservoir in Canacona began to overflow on the same day, July 16. The dam was seen reaching its capacity and the release of excess water began exactly at 6.15am on July 16. The other reservoir of Chapoli in Canacona is presently 82% full. Besides, Chapoli, Anjunem reservoir in Sattari taluka is also yet to reach its capacity, with the water level currently at 61%. In the case of Anjunem, the large capacity of the dam means it takes much longer to reach its full level. Anjunem is the only dam in the state which has gates and not an inbuilt system for the excess water to overflow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/reservoirs-begin-overflowing-a-week-earlier-than-normal/articleshow/84536377.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Ramtek temple houses two Vakataka era structures built by Chandragupta’s daughter’||Nagpur: The historic premises housing the popular Ramtek Gadh Temple has two ancient temples which are older than the main one and said to be built between 420 and 450 AD. These temples have been named Varaha and Trivikrama. This disclosure was made by amicus curiae Anand Jaiswal in his affidavit to the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court where he stated that these were Vakataka era structures built by Prabhavati Gupta, daughter of emperor Chandragupta of the Gupta dynasty, who was married to Rudra Sena, the Vakataka ruler in this region. After his earlier visit to the premises, he had informed about two more two ancient Narsimha Temples at the temple’s foot — Rudra Narsimha and Keval from the same era. “These temples are much older than the Ramtek Gadh Mandir. Unfortunately, these temples, their ancientness, their historical importance and their rarity (being Vaishnav Temples built by the Vakataka Dynasty who were predominantly Shaivite) have not been sufficiently publicized and people in Nagpur and nearby areas are unaware of them,” the senior counsel said, while citing inscriptions on the structures. According to Jaiswal, these temples were completely hidden from the public view earlier, but recently, authorities have built an approach road. “Unless the public is made aware about the historicity of these temples by placing a big board providing information, nobody would know that they exist and there would be no attraction for people to make trips. It’s therefore suggested that a sufficiently large signage be put up at the beginning of the road as well as near the parking highlighting the existence, history and uniqueness of these structures so that devotees can know about the uniqueness of these historic structures,” said Jaiswal. He pointed out that the roofs of these temples have developed cracks which have been temporarily filled with cement and need immediate restoration. “It’s also noticed that the interior of these temples are in darkness. It’s necessary to make arrangements for some kind of light, natural or artificial, to highlight their uniqueness. There’s a need to protect inscriptions on those structures,” he said. Need to remove encroachments immediately Informing the HC or its earlier orders to remove all encroachments from the temple’s premises, the amicus curiae has pointed out that shopkeepers have illegally occupied the area. “It’s necessary to remove these illegal occupations which detract the beauty of these stone structures. At the same time, these shop owners must be provided with an alternative, so that their livelihood is not affected. This can be done by providing shops at the bottom of the stairs along the approach road to the temple. This will ensure that the beauty of the temple is restored and the livelihood of the shop keepers is also protected,” said Jaiswal He suggested that appropriate space be identified and demarcated and shops be regularized accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ramtek-temple-houses-two-vakataka-era-structures-built-by-chandraguptas-daughter/articleshow/84534445.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||City police were in contact with Kawre and his family||Nagpur: City police’s special branch was already in contact with Prasad Kawre alias Assallam Mustafa as his wife was a foreigner and frequently visited the city from different countries. Kawre, an engineer, was among the three arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Anti-terrorist squad (ATS) a day ago for his role behind the so-called conversion racket. A section of city police’s special unit had earlier kept a watch on the Kawres but refrained from interfering in their religious activities which is not illegal in Maharashtra. While working in the US, Kawre met his wife who is learnt to be a doctor. Sources from the intelligence stated that Kawre had also influenced his wife for conversion too. “Nagpur police knew his background but conversion is not a crime in Maharashtra and hence, there was no question of legal action,” said a senior officer. The conversion sleeper cell in city, now busted by the Uttar Pradesh ATS, had already developed some favourable pockets or areas in the city from where they were expecting to rope in some candidates to brainwash them to convert. Apart from Kawre, his arrested accomplices were identified as Bhupriypbando Mankar and religious preacher Kausar Alam Shaukat Ali Khan. Sources stated the UP ATS may zero in on close contacts of Kawre, Mankar and Khan too after the custodial interrogation. It’s learnt that the trio, now in the custody of the UP police, were instructed by masterminds Umar Gautam and Mufti Qazi Jehangir at a conference in Faridabad near Delhi to take the agenda of conversion ahead in Maharashtra as there is now a legal bar to such activities like in UP. After the arrests of Gautam and Jehangir, the trio had got alerted and went underground. They tried to make inroads into many localities in the city where they would be able to lure candidates for conversions. A visit by the UP ATS in Vidarbha has not been ruled out by the intelligence agency. In the absence of a legal watch in liberal Maharashtra which does not have any restrictions on religious conversions like in UP, the sleeper cell was supposed to widen its network in the state for which activities had already been kicked off by the trio in Vidarbha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-police-were-in-contact-with-kawre-and-his-family/articleshow/84534456.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Smart City funds spent, but lakes remain dirty||COIMBATORE: Just months after they were opened to the public, five lakes that were rejuvenated and beautified at a cost of Rs 217.06 crore from the Smart Cities Mission, have lost their charm due to lack of maintenance. Former city corporation commissioner P Kumaravel Pandian had hurriedly inaugurated a part of Ukkadam Periyakulam, Valankulam, Selvachinthamni lake, and Selvampathy and Kumarasamy lakes on February 26, hours before the model code of conduct was imposed for the assembly election. TOI found thriving weeds threatening to take over the landscape on Periyakulam bund. Water hyacinths have clogged up the floating jetty, where the corporation had planned to launch a boat service. As garbage bins are conspicuously absent, visitors throw waste along the bund. As only two of the gates are open, people were found jumping over the railing. Unscrupulous elements were seen at the Valankulam lake, which was closed months ago to carry out maintenance. They jump over the railing to enter the place and were found taking a dip in the lake. No security personnel were present to stop such people. The place turns into a den of illegal activities at night. The renovated lakes were closed after Covid-19 cases spiked in the district and were reopened recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/smart-city-funds-spent-but-lakes-remain-dirty/articleshow/84534428.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Coimbatore||Two arrested for hurling petrol bomb at woman in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: The Selvapuram police on Saturday arrested two people, including a minor, for hurling a petrol bomb at a 54-year-old woman following a petty quarrel. Police identified them as V Puviyarasu, 19, of North Housing Unit at Selvapuram and a 17-year-old Selvapuram resident. They had attacked K Vasuki of Mahaliamman Temple Street at Selvapuram. “On Friday around 9pm, Vasuki, who was returning from a temple, saw Afsal, a local resident, kicking her neighbour’s dog, which was tied to her gate. When she raised an alarm, Afsal managed to escape from the place. Vasuki and her neighbours questioned a 17-year-old boy who was with Afsal. The boy said that Afsal kicked the dog after it barked at them. Vasuki threatened to handover the duo to police if the dog is attacked again,” a police officer said. “Later, the boy brought his friend Puviyarasu to the spot and the duo had a quarrel with Vasuki. Puviyarasu hurled a petrol bomb at Vasuki. But it missed her and went off at her neighbour’s house. Neighbours rushed to the spot and caught Puviyarasu. But he threatened the people with dire consequences and managed to escape along with the minor,” the officer added. Based on Vasuki’s complaint, police registered an FIR against the two people and arrested them on Saturday. The duo was booked under sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 294 (b) and 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 (a) of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. The minor boy was produced before the juvenile justice board and was sent to the observation home for juveniles at Lakshmi Mills Junction. Puviyarasu was lodged in the Pollachi sub-jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/two-arrested-for-hurling-petrol-bomb-at-woman/articleshow/84534450.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Porn, lewd comments in Lucknow University’s WhatsApp group||LUCKNOW: Lucknow University BA (VI semester) students on Saturday got stunned when obscene contents — pornogaphic material and lewd remarks about female students and even faculty members — started flashing in a WhatsApp group created by undergraduate students of ancient Indian history and archaeology (AIHA) department. The chief proctor of the university lodged a complaint with the Hasanganj police station for lodging an FIR in this regard on Sunday. The miscreant is yet to be identified. The pornographic images and obscene messages were posted late on Saturday night in the WhatsApp group that was created by a female student on the direction of the faculty for sharing paper presentations. Around 170 BA students were added via a link circulated by the teachers to get automatically added to the group. The person who posted the messages and visuals exited the group immediately after doing it. He entered the group again using the link and posted similar lewd content. Students say that the mobile number of the miscreant which was showing in the group belonged to a male student of the same class. When the latter was asked, however, he denied his involvement. “Around 11.58pm on Saturday, the first sexually explicit picture was posted on the group with the name and phone number of our male classmate. The obscene picture was followed by a message that targeted four girl students through lewd messages,” said a girl student not wanting to be named. She said that the person continued with abusive and objectionable language for female students of the class and teachers as well. In the screenshots of the group shared by students with TOI, a number of messages from female students requesting faculty late at night to look into the matter and take strict action could be seen. Even after repeated requests, the unruly element dropped a second message abusing four male students of the class and went on to tarnish the name of a faculty member. He then again posted pornographic images. “When the abuses crossed all limits and objectionable words were used for our faculty member, I took to Twitter, tagging vice-chancellor Prof AK Rai and dean, student welfare, Prof Poonam Tandon to look into the matter,” said BA student Abhinav Kumar Srivastava. He said the girl students were stressed and scared and having sleepless nights. “The unruly element posted porn images, wrote disrespectful messages and immediately exited the group. He joined back again with a different name and number to drop messages all over again,” said a BA student Ankit Singh. When no action was taken by the LU authorities, nearly 50% of the students took an exit from the group in protest. Later in the evening, a complaint was forwarded by AIHA HoD Prof Piyush Bhargava to the LU proctor office on the basis of which an application for an FIR was given by chief Proctor Dinesh Kumar at Hasanganj police station. “We have lodged a police complaint with the Hasanganj police station in this regard. Also, we have shared a screenshot of the WhatsApp group and the phone number which was used along with the name and contact number of the student who was named in the obscene messages,” the proctor said, adding “no such nonsense will be tolerated. We are also investigating the matter at our end.” It is the second such incident in the AIHA department. Earlier also, similar indiscipline had surfaced in another WhatsApp group in January in BA (V semester).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/porn-floods-whatsapp-teaching-group-of-lu/articleshow/84536380.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Madras high court directs CB-CID to complete probe in encounter case||Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the CB-CID to complete the investigation within two months in an alleged encounter case where a man was shot dead by police at Ramanathapuram district in 2017. The court was hearing a petition filed by G Bhavani, wife of the deceased Govindan. According to the petitioner, her husband, who was taken away by the police personnel was shot dead by a sub-inspector of police (SI) Thangamuniyasamy on April 13, 2017. Though the case was transferred to the CB-CID, the final report was yet to be filed. Hence, the petitioner sought to transfer the case to CBI. The counsel for the state submitted that petitioner’s husband was involved in a Rs 9 lakh robbery case. When the special team started chasing Govindan who was travelling in a car, he got out of the vehicle and attacked a constable Soundarapandian and Thangamuniyasamy. The SI had opened fire in defence in which Govindan sustained injuries and died. Justice B Pugalendhi took note of the fact that the judicial magistrate who conducted an inquiry into the incident had stated that police opened the fire for self-defence. The judge observed that since the case has already been transferred to the CB-CID, there is no necessity for ordering transfer of investigation to any other agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-directs-cb-cid-to-complete-probe-in-encounter-case/articleshow/84532124.cms||---

---||Mumbai||AAR: CHS has to pay GST on maintenance||The Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR), Maharashtra bench, recently held that goods and services tax (GST) is chargeable against the maintenance charges collected by a co-operative housing society from its members, if it is in excess of Rs 7,500 per month. The AAR took into consideration a retrospective amendment dating back to July 1, 2017, made by the Finance Act, 2021, whereby a CHS and its members are treated as ‘distinct entities’. This is the first ruling, post the amendment. Thus, the CHS has to collect and pay GST on the amounts received against maintenance charges from its members, as it is a ‘consideration’ received for supply of goods and services, held the AAR. According to a government circular, a CHS has to levy and collect GST at 18% on the maintenance charges, if these exceed Rs 7,500 per month per member. However, it should be noted that smaller societies with an annual turnover of Rs 20 lakh or less do not have to register and consequently do not have to comply with GST obligations. In this case, Andheri-based Emerald CHS failed in its argument that there can be no supply of services (like providing facilities such as security, cleaning, repairs, or ancillary services like accounting and auditing) by a CHS to its members, as it and its members are not distinct entities. In other words, before the AAR, it contended the ‘principle of mutuality would apply’. The members were only reimbursing the costs and therefore no GST could be levied. This contention was shot down by the AAR. The CHS also stated that post the amendment made by the Finance Act, no notification had been issued. However, the AAR pointed out that the amendment had received the assent of the President on March 28, 2021, and the contentious issue of principles of mutuality in the case of cooperative societies had been settled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/aar-chs-has-to-pay-gst-on-maintenance/articleshow/84537620.cms||---

---||Goa||Foreign coach likely for women’s team as Maymol quits||Panaji: Maymol Rocky has resigned as coach of the national women’s team, prompting the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to start the hunt for her replacement. A former international from Goa, Maymol has been in-charge of the women’s team for the past four years and was preparing the team for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2022 to be played on home soil. The team was making progress, but the first woman to take charge of the Indian women’s team told the AIFF that she cannot continue due to personal reasons. “We tried talking to her, asked her to reconsider,” said one senior official. “We all understand it wasn’t an easy decision for her. She said it was personal. Maymol has worked really hard during her time with the team and deserved to guide the team at the Asian Cup.” Instead, there will be a new coach when the tournament kicks off next year in Mumbai and Pune. The AIFF’s technical committee which met on Monday was told of Maymol’s resignation. Members have suggested that the federation should find a replacement before the team resumes training next month. “We have started looking for a coach. The preference is for someone who has experience of working with women footballers. It could be a foreign coach, although it won’t be easy to convince anyone to come here at short notice during Covid-19 times,” said the official. Early this year, the AIFF had released an advertisement calling for applications from coaches to take charge of the women’s under-20 team. The prominent applicants include Bino George, formerly technical director at Gokulam Kerala FC, and Indian Women’s League winning coach PV Priya. “We are looking at all options that are available to us,” said the member. “The technical committee was told that (U-17 coach) Thomas Denerby has huge experience in international women’s football and we are taking his help to find the right coach. We are preparing for a major tournament, so it’s imperative that we find someone who has experience of managing a women’s team on regular basis.” Suggestions that Denerby take charge of the senior team were quickly dismissed since the Swedish coach remains “fully focused” on India’s preparations for the Fifa Women’s U-17 World Cup 2022. Maymol was assistant to former coach Sajid Dar before she was handed charge in July 2017. She was India’s seventh coach and the first woman to hold the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/foreign-coach-likely-for-womens-team-as-maymol-quits/articleshow/84565989.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Nagpur||MAPL to become history as HAL firm on hiving off co||Nagpur: Vidarbha’s only government-run medicine manufacturing company — Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Limited (MAPL) — is all set to become history as its parent company Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL), Pune, is firm on implementing the Centre’s decision to hive off the company. A few days ago, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had urged the Centre not to hive off MAPL as its closure will be a loss not only to the city, but to the nation. He also cited how a Niti Aayog panel had recommended against the company’s hiving off as it could help boost drug availability in the country. Sudhir Paliwal, representative of former nominee-director in MAPL — Environmental Engineering Inc (EEI) and plant union leader Suresh Gotmare said it will be a big loss to Vidarbha. TOI had on June 13 reported heavy machineries worth crores missing from the MAPL plant situated in Hingna MIDC. Talking to TOI, an HAL official said, “The government of India has decided hiving off MAPL. HAL has no role to play. Cabinet committee on economic affairs had on December 21, 2016 and December 28, 2016 decided to hive off HAL subsidiaries. Accordingly, the subsidiaries may be put up for strategic sale, if viable.” The official added, “The plant is not operational. Therefore, MAPL is a defunct company. Hence, there is no question of procurement of medicines from the company.” MAPL was incorporated in 1979 with HAL holding 59% stake, SICOM 33% and IDBI 8%. Right from the beginning, MAPL had incurred losses due to working capital problems. Subsequently, it was declared sick unit by board for industrial and financial reconstruction on September 4, 2000. The decision was upheld by appellate authority for industrial and financial reconstruction on July 20, 2001. “MAPL operations stopped since 2003-04. SICOM transferred its share to a private party, instead of giving HAL a buy back opportunity. HAL has challenged the move before the high court,” said the official. Paliwal said, MAPL’s revival will be beneficial for Vidarbha as it will ensure availability of medicines, generate employment and result in economic development. “HAL had also set up Karnataka Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Ltd (KAPL) along with MAPL. Now, KAPL is a profit-making company and has become a separate public sector undertaking.” “MAPL is a classic case of injustice meted out to Vidarbha. Even now, there is no inquiry and action after costly machineries from the plant have disappeared,” he said. In 2015, then CM Fadnavis along with the then Union minister Hansraj Ahir and Union minister Nitin Gadkari had visited MAPL plant and announced their plans to revive it. TOI had also reported that parliamentary committee on public undertakings in its report submitted before the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on January 29, 2021 stating that NBCC (India) Limited has been appointed as land management agency and MSTC Ltd as auctioning agency for MAPL. As per the report, this information was given by HAL to the committee. On TOI’s query why HAL has appointed MSTC and also informed the parliamentary committee about it when there are no machineries at the plant, the official said, “HAL is not aware when the committee was informed about MSTC being appointed as MAPL auctioning agency. MSTC was informed about machineries of some other subsidiary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mapl-to-become-history-as-hal-firm-on-hiving-off-co/articleshow/84534508.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

On Sunday, Union minister Nitin Gadkari met the Thawkars to show solidarity. The suspended cops have been identified as sub-inspector Mukesh Dhoble, constables Namdeo Charde and Akash Shahane who had intercepted Thawkar at the nakabandi point when he was trying to flee. Two traffic constables, who were present, were given a long rope by the top brass, stating they were not involved in the episode. The state’s crime investigation department (CID) has so far collected the relevant CCTV footage of the incident from Pardi police station, spot of incident and the private hospital where Thawkar was declared brought dead before admission. An injured Thawkar was taken to the hospital from the police station where he had collapsed. Pardi police had registered the case as an accidental death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cp-suspends-three-in-custodial-death-case/articleshow/84533798.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chennai||‘Demand for Kongu Nadu being raised to intimidate Tamil Nadu’||CHENNAI: Municipal administration and water supply minister K N Nehru has dubbed the Kongu Nadu issue as "intimidatory tactics". In an interview with Julie Mariappan, the minister mocked the suggestion of a separate territory carved out of Tamil Nadu, saying, "How can Kongu Nadu be separated? How will TN get water? Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are facing problems after bifurcation." He indicated plans to form new corporations and municipalities. The government, he said, was looking into corruption charges against former minister S P Velumani, contracts awarded by the previous regime, and the projects stalled due to lack of funds. Q: How do you see the ‘Ondriya Arasu’ (Union government)-Kongu Nadu fight?‘Ondriya Arasu’ has been welcomed by even media stalwarts. We abide by the leader’s command and we will certainly go by what the party, leadership and the chief minister say tomorrow. They are talking of Kongu Nadu to intimidate us. Actor-comedian Vadivelu jocularly said, why are Orathanadu and Chettinadu left out? How can Kongu Nadu be separated? How will Tamil Nadu get water? Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are facing problems after bifurcation. Will they (BJP) increase the burden on themselves? Q:Is the DMK working on a strategy to strengthen the western region?We have reorganised the district units by appointing a secretary for every two assembly constituencies (in Coimbatore). We lost by less than 4,000 or 5,000 votes, therefore it is wrong to say the western belt is theirs (the AIADMK’s). We have won two seats in The Nilgiris, three each in Erode and Tirupur. We lost all seats in Coimbatore due to the dominance of the local minister who handled a department for a decade. In Trichy we won all the seats. We will strengthen the party. We are confident of people’s trust in us. The government is hugely popular, and we are working with the people and our chief minister has been running the government well. If this continues, people say he will remain the CM for two to three terms. Q: The DMK alleged corruption against former municipal administration minister S P Velumani. Will you pursue it further?It is being looked into by the chief minister who handles police and vigilance portfolios. He will decide. Q: Multi-crore projects started by the AIADMK government ahead of elections are mired in controversies. Will these projects see the light of day?The state will stall the work if there are any faults in the contracts. The projects will continue if there is no wrongdoing. Q: How many projects are stalled? How much funds are required to complete the ongoing projects?There are projects that have still not begun either due to lack of funds or stuck after floating tenders. All of them are under scrutiny. Tenders can be floated only when there are adequate funds. Q:Tamil Nadu’s urban population is 49% and the decadal projection is higher. How have you planned to better the infrastructure and ensure uniform growth of all regions?The urban population now stands at 55% and will touch 60% in 10 years. Since Chennai, Coimbatore and Madurai are bigger cities, projects reached them fully. For instance, Coimbatore received several hundred crores of rupees worth infrastructure projects when former CM M Karunanidhi conducted the world Tamil classical conference in 2010. Madurai also got high-cost schemes during his tenure. Similarly, special funding was allotted for Chennai when our present CM was mayor and local administration minister. The aspirations of poor and middle-income groups are to get underground sewerage, uninterrupted water supply, lights and good roads. Our aim is to provide all of them. The major problem for the government is collection and transportation of solid waste. Chennai alone generates 5,000 tonnes of waste a day. A 100-tonne bio-compressed natural gas (bio-CNG) plant is on a trial run in Egmore. Bio-mining process has picked up pace. The CM has given suggestions on all fronts to take the state forward. Q:Is there a proposal to expand corporations, municipalities and town panchayats and in the process take up fresh delimitation?The previous regime had done delimitation of wards in 2018 and issued a government order on quota for SC and ST and women to conduct polls. But the exercise was erroneous. Even the number of voters was not maintained properly. Dominant women seats have been reserved for men and reserved seats have been made general. A lot of complaints poured in. We must keep in mind the outcome of issuing a second order and possible court cases. Also, our election manifesto talks about new corporations and municipalities. If such decisions are taken, reservation of seats for SC/ST and women will change. Those are being studied and we will give effect to the change. Q: How are you going to deal with the growing drinking water needs?We are evolving plans to augment the groundwater table. TN receives abundant rainfall once in five years, but it goes waste, running off into the sea. The CM has directed the water resources department to construct check dams for irrigation and water supply. This will be our model. Q: The previous AIADMK government did not pursue the plan for pipeline supply from Kandaleru reservoir to Poondi. Do you have plans to bring water from Mettur reservoir to Chennai?The Andhra Pradesh government has approved the pipeline project and the components are being studied. The CM will make the announcement on fund allotment and transportation. A detailed study has been done to bring Cauvery water from Biligundulu on the inter-state border. There is a demand for 1,200mld to meet Chennai’s water needs. Two desalination plants are functional, there are two more, a 150mld capacity plant coming up at Nemmeli, and there is a plan to build a 400mld plant in Perur on ECR. We are ready with the plans to meet the requirements for another 10-15 years. Q: The major and minor waterways of Chennai are contaminated despite the best efforts of successive governments. What are your plans to restore them?Scientific advancement was lacking earlier, but now we have it. Equipment is available to remove water hyacinth and floating material on waterways and excavators are available to enhance the flow of water in the river. Waste water treatment by national and international agencies are also being looked into. A modular sewage treatment plant of 1mld capacity to achieve new discharge standards is on a trial run on Spur Tank Road in Chetpet to check sewage outfall into river Cooum. We need to have more plants to release good water into the rivers. Q: Being an opposition party at the Centre, how has been the fight to get funds for the state?The Union government allocated `3,691 crore under its Jal Jeevan Mission to provide tap water supply in rural households in Tamil Nadu this fiscal. TN health minister visited the Union health minister and they have extended support. Nothing has been stalled so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/demand-for-kongu-nadu-being-raised-to-intimidate-tamil-nadu/articleshow/84537869.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Madurai||Madurai: Demand to shift child welfare committee office to city limits||MADURAI: Parents of children produced before the child welfare committee (CWC) and police personnel in Madurai district have urged the authorities to shift the office, currently located in Muthupatti, to a location in the city, as they are facing difficulties in reaching due to lack of proper transport connectivity. CWC is functioning in a rented building on the same premises, where the reception home is functioning. A space was allotted for CWC in the newly-built district administration building but could not be shifted as it was small. Around 50 children are being produced before the CWC every month. More than 200 children, who lost at least one of their parents, were produced before the CWC in the last couple of months to get certificates to become eligible for government welfare measures. A woman police from Tallakulam station said that children rescued from child marriage, abandoned and sexually assaulted, who need care and protection are produced before the CWC. Members of the committee will take a call on whether to send the children with their parents or to a home. “CWC is 10km away from the district administration office, where most of the government offices are located. Lack of connectivity is the issue. Hiring an autorickshaw would cost a minimum of Rs 500, which has to be borne by us or the parents,” she said. Parents say that it would be better if the reception home is also available in a more accessible area. “Even women police would not be comfortable while shifting the children to reception homes at odd hours since the road leading to the home is deserted,” a parent of a victim said. Officials from district administration said that there is a proposal to construct a new building to house the CWC and reception home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/demand-to-shift-cwc-office-to-city-limits/articleshow/84532159.cms||V Devanathan
---||Ludhiana||Scattered rain inundates parts of Ludhiana||LUDHIANA: Even as the city received scattered rainfall on Sunday, it left some areas waterlogged. The showers flooded Ferozepur Road, Chandigarh Road and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar. Residents said the authorities were yet to come out with a plan to resolve the problem, which bugs these areas every year. Chandigarh Road and Ferozepur Road have come under National Highways Authority of India due to an ongoing construction work there. A resident of Chandigarh Road, Dr Premjit Singh, said, “After a five-minute rainfall, our area was flooded. Sewerage lines are blocked from Jamalpur to Shingaar Cinema. The problem will not be resolved if these are not cleaned. Water from dyeing units in Focal Point adds to the area woes. Every monsoon, Chandigarh Road gets flooded at least 25 times.” Arvind Sharma of SBS Nagar said, “The Ludhiana Improvement Trust did not clean the road gulleys and sewerage system in the locality and handed over the maintenance of sewerage to MC recently. The civic body has not started the maintenance work because the resolution got approval a few days ago. So, waterlogging is troubling the area this time too.” Gurpreet Singh of Ranjit Enclave said, “Ferozepur Road is an important stretch, as it is used by commuters frequently. But its storm sewerage line is not in working condition which is why waterlogging is severe here.” Executive engineer of operation and maintenance cell, MC Zone B, Ranbir Singh said, “We had floated tenders to lay storm sewerage line that will carry water from Chandigarh Road to Buddha Nullah. It will take time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/scattered-rain-inundates-parts-of-city/articleshow/84532145.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana logs 98 Covid-19 cases for second consecutive week||LUDHIANA: For the second consecutive week, the district recorded less than 100 Covid cases. The health experts, meanwhile, say the authorities must use the time before the probable third wave to ramp up infrastructure to avoid mistakes of the second peak. As per the health department data, 98 cases were logged between July 11 and July 17. The figure was the same in the preceding week (July 4 to 10) as well. However, in the week before it (between June 27 and July 3), the number was 167, which is 41.3% more. The number of cases was 256 from June 20 to 26; 449 from June 13 to 19; 901 between June 6 and 12; and 1,658 during May 30 to June 5. The figure was the highest at 9,587 between May 9 and 15. On the state chart, Jalandhar is at the top with 101 weekly cases, Bathinda second (99) and Ludhiana third. Ropar has the lowest number at four. District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said new cases are less as positivity rate has been very low. “We are monitoring things, so that the pandemic remains under check,” he added. “Even as the new cases are declining, there are chances of the third wave. There were problems during the second wave and if the authorities don’t take steps this time, it will be their negligence. We need to work on war footing and utilize the time to make arrangements for the possible third wave. While it is important to speed up immunization drive, the authorities must ensure that there is sufficient oxygen supply, beds, ambulances (at least 200) with oxygen cylinders and trained manpower. Also, there is a need to have protocols for treatments,” said Ludhiana IMA former president Dr Narrotam Dewan. “Some government buildings and stadiums can be used as Covid facilities. There should be time-bound installation of oxygen plants in private hospitals. Besides, teams to monitor required measures are the need of the hour. People should also follow Covid rules of wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing and avoiding crowded places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/district-logs-98-cases-for-second-consecutive-week/articleshow/84532158.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BSP chief Mayawati aide to chant Ram before Brahmin embrace||AYODHYA: In what could mark a paradigm shift in her political strategy, BSP chief Mayawati has asked her party’s Brahmin face and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra to visit Ramjanmabhoomi and offer prayers before kicking off the Brahmin Sammelan in Ayodhya. This was confirmed by Mishra on Sunday on his official Facebook page, where he wrote — “We have to repeat the victory of 2007 in 2022 to save Uttar Pradesh and its people by taking the blessings of Lord Ram in Ayodhya on July 23. Sarwajan hitaye, sarwajan sukhaye (welfare of all).” And it will perhaps be the first time a senior BSP leader would be visiting Ramjanmabhoomi — centrestage of Hindutva politics — in what would be the Dalit party’s first public endorsement of Ram Mandir. As a matter of fact, Mayawati, herself, has never visited Ayodhya even though she carved out Ambedkarnagar from the then Faizabad in 1995. The BSP chief has also been known to stay away from religion-based politics. Mayawati’s decision to ask her key aide Satish Mishra to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla before launching the Brahmin conclave in Ayodhya is being seen as tweaking of her social engineering formula with soft Hindutva to not just wean away Brahmins, but also to effectively counter BJP in the run-up to assembly elections. BSP’s local Brahmin leaders in Ayodhya also confirmed to TOI that Mishra would offer prayer at Ramjanmabhoomi to send out a pointed message to upper caste Hindus. “After its elected members of zila panchayats and block development councils openly backed BJP in the just-concluded rural bodies polls, BSP will now give a message to upper caste Hindus, especially Brahmins that the Dalit party is pro-Ram," said political analyst Dr Anil Kumar Singh. He said BSP seems to be changing its strategy for its much-needed political resurrection in Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-aide-to-chant-ram-before-brahmin-embrace/articleshow/84536467.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Madurai||Free schemes pave way for social justice, says Tamil Nadu minister||MADURAI: The free schemes by the Tamil Nadu government, which many continue to claim are regressive, are really schemes for social justice and economic development and has put the state above northern states on these two criteria, said minister for finance P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan. He was speaking at the function organised by the social welfare scheme to distribute benefits to women under the Thalikku Thangam Scheme in Madurai on Sunday, in the presence of minister for commercial taxes P Moorthy. As many as 548 beneficiaries from the city, Madurai East, Madurai West, Usilampatti, Sedappati, Melur, Kottampatti, Alanganallur, Thiruparankundram and Vadipatti received 8g of gold each. Gold worth Rs 1.99 crore, weighing 4.38kg, was given to the beneficiaries. He said that the basic policy of the Dravidian movement was equality in education, wealth and job opportunities for women. “The communities which gave equal opportunities to women across the globe prospered,” he said. “In 1920, the Neethi Katchi which was the pillar of the Dravidian movement made it possible for women to vote and also have the right to primary education. Whenever the Dravidian parties came to power in the state, they have strived to take development of women to the next stage. Women have also been given representation in the election process. In Tamil Nadu, there are no girls under the age of 18 today who are illiterate. But, in the northern states only 30% of the girls below the age of 18 are educated,” he said. “The average per capita income of a person in Tamil Nadu is Rs 2.5 lakh, whereas in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh it does not exceed Rs 75,000, he said. This is the reason why schemes like the Thalikku Thangam are implemented in the state,” he said. “It was suspended for sometime for want of gold, but chief minister M K Stalin took steps to ensure that it continued without delay and now it is being given again,” he said. “Many continue to say that the free schemes of the Tamil Nadu government are regressive. But, these are not just free schemes, they are for social justice and economic development,” he said. It is through these schemes Tamil Nadu excels above northern states, he said, adding that the DMK government will strive to improve them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/free-schemes-pave-way-for-social-justice/articleshow/84532197.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 50 deaths this monsoon as evacuation policy only on paper||MUMBAI: Around 50 people have been killed in rain-related incidents this monsoon alone in the city, a majority of them in landslides, house collapses and incidents of retaining walls crashing on huts in hilly areas. While local authorities have failed to take steps to prevent landslide deaths over the years, the state, too, does not have a policy to shift people living precariously on hill slopes. The fact-finding Chitale committee on the 2005 flooding had prepared a comprehensive report recommending resettlement of people living in landslide-prone areas. While the BMC claims that it has issued notice for evacuation in most cases, the opposition alleges that the BMC does not take enough efforts to actually move residents to safer locations. Activists accuse the BMC of giving a token warning every year and then doing nothing. The BMC says every year it asks people to vacate unsafe homes. “But we cannot forcibly evacuate them,” said a civic official. On Thursday, activists again blamed the government and civic authorities for negligence and lack of coordination resulting in non-rehabilitation of slum-dwellers residing in landslide-prone and dangerous areas. “A central government policy mandates shelter for all by 2022. So, why can’t the state agencies build houses to rehabilitate these slum-dwellers after collecting nominal cost from them under the scheme?” advocate-activist Godfrey Pimenta said. He said cement houses block natural water flow and percolation, causing such incidents. “After the Sunday incident, I again wrote to the chief minister requesting him to pay attention to the issue,” he said. Congress corporator and opposition leader in the BMC Ravi Raja said the probem is that slum-dwellers want rehabilitation in the vicinity and the authorities want to send them far away. “There is no political will to resolve the stand-off,” he said. In July 2019, a 15-foot-tall wall around a BMC reservoir near Kurar village in Malad (East) collapsed within two years of construction and claimed 26 lives. The rehabilitation of those slum-dwellers was stuck in a dispute between the forest department and the BMC. The BMC had ordered an audit of all retaining walls in the city after the Malad incident, but the opposition alleges that nothing much was done. “The BMC only carried out an audit of some slopes where there are water reservoirs. Apart from that, no detailed audit has been done of the dozens of retaining walls in the western and eastern suburbs,” said Vinod Mishra, BJP corporator from Malad. Atul Bhatkhalkar, MLA from the adjoining Kandivli, said different authorities like MMRDA, SRA, Mhada have different policies for rehabilitating people living on hill slopes and dangerous areas and there is lack of coordination. “There should be a common policy for such rehabilitation, and it should be made a priority project to save lives,” he said.  Last year there was a major landslide at Malabar Hill, which damaged NS Patkar Marg and the BMC had to rebuild the road along with a new retaining wall. SP MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said that despite repeated incidents of house collapse and landslides, the BMC and the government had not taken any action against any official for negligence or dereliction of duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/50-deaths-this-monsoon-as-evacuation-policy-only-on-paper/articleshow/84536615.cms||Vijay V Singh

Those travelling towards Hafeezpet and Miyapur have to navigate through roads with overflowing drain water. Those moving towards Hi-tech city, Kothaguda, and Gachibowli too have to face a similar problem while also having to take alternative, longer routes due to road closures. “It takes quite a while to reach Gachibowli owing to closure. Authorities should complete the work as early as possible to ensure smooth passage of traffic,’’ said Vinay who uses the route on a regular basis. Shopkeepers from Kondapur told TOI that several complaints have been lodged but no corrective steps have been taken to address the issue of overflowing drain. “There seems to be no permanent solution planned.

The association claims that the minister was violating provisions of the Delhi School Education Rules 1973 and has demanded Rs 5 crore for “hurting the rights of its member schools.” Sisodia had announced that if any parent wanted to shift their children to government schools, they could get provisional admission without TC. The directorate of education will be getting the transfer certificate from the private schools that the children will be leaving. “The statement is propagating the parents to get admission in government schools without getting the SLC and other formalities which are hurting the rights of the member schools to recover the outstanding fee/funds from the students,” stated the notice. A government source, however, said, “The order is only for government schools. The order did not mean that TC will not be required.

K Sudheesh, who owns a homestay near Chettiyar Park, announced the free stay offer on Facebook on Wednesday, when the results were out and the post went viral within no time. Sudheesh, a native of Kozhikode in Kerala, completed hotel management and started his firm in Kodaikanal in 2003. He along with his friend own the homestay, which is located away from the hustle-bustle of the town.   “Students who scored good marks flaunted their grades through social media. Meanwhile, there was a discussion in my school friends group about how it would affect the students, who could not make it. That’s when I thought of giving them a sojourn in the hill station to de-stress them. But, never thought it would go viral,” Sudheesh said. Students are under immense pressure when it comes to academic performance. Not everyone can excel in examinations and exams are not the end of the world, he said. In Kerala, 99.47% of students have passed, which roughly translates into only one among 200 students has failed in the exam, he said. “There have been a large number of inquiries from parents and students alike in the last four days. Many students asked whether they can come with friends without parents. Only students with their parents will be allowed. Apart from accommodation, food is also provided to them at free of cost,” he said. Given the volume of inquiries, he expects a good number of people from the neighbouring state. He has spoken to some of his friends, who are running homestays to accommodate a few of them. They have readily agreed, Sudheesh said. Owing to the pandemic situation, he will give priority to adults, who have got both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/kodai-homestay-owner-offers-free-vacation-for-class-x-failed-students/articleshow/84532226.cms||V Devanathan

Residents of Ali Gulshan Colony in Barkas told TOI that waterlogging has become a major concern in the area and that despite repeated complaints no action has been taken to fix the issue. “We have taken up the issue with the GHMC zonal commissioner. Drain water enters houses forcing residents to move to safer places or suffer inside. Water accumulation on roads has also been a nightmare for residents. A drainage line worth around Rs 50 lakh was laid by GHMC in the locality and now the contractor is shirking responsibility citing the area comes under Jalpally,’’ said Talha Kaseri, MIM worker from Barkas division. “When we meet the higher-ups, they assure to resolve the issue but the contractor refuses to take it up citing jurisdiction issues. We want to ask him who is to fix the boundary? Whether the area is in GHMC or Jalpally municipality? The issue has been brought to the notice of zonal commissioner again,’’Kaseri said. Residents have said they will stage protests if the issue continues to drag. It is said that tussles between contractors and authorities have resulted in inconvenience to locals. Assistant engineer David told reporters that the contractor has been told to resolve the issue and that he would be instructed once again to take it up immediately. Officials acknowledged representations made by Talha Kaseri, said they will be considered and the contractor will be asked to ensure immediate resolution of problems in the area.

People from semmaan or madayar communities had taken care of the irrigation job and were integrated into every society in many parts of Tamil Nadu. Art historian K T Gandirajan, who visited the archeological site in the Perungamanalur area, on Sunday, said that he had located the site with the help of local people, who still worship the structure, which has two stone pillars standing straight and another one placed horizontally on them. The inscriptions were found on the load bearing stone, known as ‘Summaithangi kal’ located near an ancient well in the middle of a field. One of the stone pillars has inscriptions in eight lines. Based on palaeography the age is determined to be between the 13th century AD and 14th century AD, he said. The semmaan community served the village by taking the responsibility of maintaining sluices of the village tanks, a very risky job. They would dive into the deep pockets of the tank to close and open sluices as per requirement. They were considered a fearless community, which served the village. They were given wages in the form of grains by all the people in the village. Agricultural activities were usually carried out based on the prediction of the ‘semmaan’ who knew how long the water would last. During floods they had to open and close the sluices and many lost their lives in the line of duty. “This particular stone may have been erected for one such person who lost his life,” he said. Even today, the people offer prayers at the stone before beginning cultivation or harvest. Gandhirajan said that the community was common in all the villages till the mid-20th century. Many such stones in this region do not have the King’s name on them, indicating that people of the region dealt with their needs. “Even to this day, when the village tanks in Perungamanallur fill up, people are informed by beating the ‘tandora’ that they should come forward to strengthen the bunds, and all communities assemble together and carry out the work,’’ he said. Meanwhile, another stone pillar dates back to the 16th-17th century with the embossed figure of ‘Vamana’, an avatar of lord Vishnu, was found near Gundankanmai in Cholapuram in Sivaganga district by the Sivagangai Tholnadai Kuzhu. The founder of the committee, professor K Kaliraja, said that the stone may have been used to measure the water level in the tank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/700-year-old-memorial-stone-found-near-usilampatti/articleshow/84532228.cms||---

At least four who escaped death after admittedly consuming illicit liquor have lost their eyesight. They are Ijhar Alam of Telpur, Mumtaz Mian from Deorwa and Sukhal Mian and Noor Alam Khan of Manguraha.Sitting on a charpoy, his wife Soni Khatoon holding his hand, Ijhar Alam, a 40-year-old mutton seller and father of six, stared wide-eyed in a dingy room at his Telpur home. “I do not normally drink,” he opened in an exculpatory low tone, his voice soon betraying deep anguish. “That day, I went and ‘taniye pee leni Ram Briksh ke gharey’ (drank a little at Ram Briksh’s place),” he cups his palm to emphasise how ‘little’ alcohol he had imbibed.“After coming home, I suffered cramps in my tummy and got medicines. But, it didn’t help. I lost consciousness and when I gained sense, I could not see anything,” Ijhar said. “I took him for treatment (in a private clinic),” Soni, still clutching her husand’s hand, says. This reporter waves his palm hoping that the victim is not blinded. But it is not a blur. “I cannot see any movement,” he answers in pain.Ijhar was referred to the Government Medical College (GMCH) at Bettiah by a private doctor. “He was admitted but left ‘against medical advice’,” GMCH superintendent Dr Pramod K Tiwary said. A cursory look at his admission slip showed a mention of abdominal pain and vomiting. Pathological reports mentioned ‘Grade 1 fatty liver’. A little ahead at Deorwa village, Lal Bibi -- the widow of last week’s hooch victim Bikau Mian, too, recalled her husband losing vision before his ‘inteqal’ (death) on Friday. “Hooch is openly sold here and my husband had come home after drinking. He soon fell ill,” she recalled. “My husband had come home after drinking and he had lost his vision,” Saiful Nesa, the widow of Jhulpan Mian, another hooch victim from Deorwa, told TOI.“Apart from hooch joints, people gather in a village orchard here to smoke weed, drink and gamble,” Sabina Khatoon, former panchayat samiti member, said. “Bahu-beti ka chalna muskil kar diya hai nasheri-juariyon ne (gamblers and drunks have made it difficult for women to pass by). How is this possible without the police knowing?,” she said.Sabina then mentions Mumtaz Mian, admitted in a nursing home at Bettiah. It was on Mumtaz’s cousin Bhola’s admissions about consuming liquor that the police lodged a case in the hooch tragedy leading to action against the hooch mafia network and errant cops. “After gaining consciousness, Mumtaz has had no vision,” Sabina said. “The patient was discharged this morning,” Dr Anjani Kumar said, adding that Mumtaz had been under police custody.A few kilometres further, TOI learnt of two more hooch survivors having lost their eyesight at Manguraha. Sukhal Mian (55) was able to come out with assistance, his wife Halima sobbing behind him. “I had gone to Hardia (neighbouring village) and had a glass (of hooch) at Lakshman’s (hooch peddler) place. I had only one glass for Rs50. ‘Laukal band ho gayil (my eyesight was gone),” Sukhal said, undecided whether it is the hooch or god’s wrath. “Daaru se bhayil ki Allah aankh le lelan,” he said. A medical team from Ramnagar PHC arrives. Dr Aishwariya Chaubey, a GP, speaks to Sukhal. “He needs to see an ophthalmologist,” the physician advised Sukhal.Noor Alam Khan, another hooch survivor from Manguraha, who too lost his vision, left for specialised treatment at Parwanipur in Nepal on Sunday. “He too had drunk liquor at Hardia and we were about to go to Ramnagar together to see a doctor. But, Noor decided to go to Nepal instead. His in-laws live at Jaganathpur (near Birgunj),” Sukhal said. Parwanipur in Nepal is famous for eye treatment.By late evening, Mumtaz’s folks got worried for he had not reached home though discharged from the clinic early morning. “He was taken by the police and locked in the Bettiah Town PS the whole day,” Ranjan, a family friend and lawyer told TOI late Sunday evening. “After much persuasion, Mumtaz is now being taken to the GMCH. He has lost his eyesight,” the lawyer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/four-champaran-hooch-survivors-lose-eyesight/articleshow/84532285.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

However, a few areas received almost 50 mm of rains by the evening hours. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society, Gansibazar recorded the highest rainfall of 48.8 mm followed by 47.8 mm at Chandulal Baradari, and 43.8 mm at LB Stadium. The road dividers led to water-logging at Khairtabad, Raj Bhavan with four-wheelers and two-wheelers finding it difficult to pave their way through the water. “Every year when it rains, the area around the Khairatabad RTA gets water-logged. The slope from Taj Krishna towards Khairatabad RTA has been a vulnerable spot for water-logging every monsoon. Despite this, no efforts have been made to resolve the issue,” said Mahesh J, a resident of Somajiguda. Water-logging was also reported in other areas such as Nagole, Old City, Chintalkunta, and LB Nagar, among other areas. The sudden downpour led to traffic snarls in many parts of the city. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad has extended the thunderstorm and heavy rainfall warning in many districts including Hyderabad till July 22. This has been attributed to an east-west shear zone in addition to a trough and a cyclonic circulation that persists over Telangana. As per IMD data, Hyderabad so far has recorded 85% of excess rainfall with 356.1 mm of rains from June 1 till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/waterlogging-at-raj-bhavan-causes-traffic-snarls/articleshow/84536592.cms||---
---||Lucknow||RT-PCR report must for entry to Uttar Pradesh from high caseload states||LUCKNOW: Ramping up preventive measures, the state government on Sunday made RT-PCR negative report mandatory for people coming from states with more than 3% positivity rate. The report should not be more than four-day old. People who have been administered both the doses of vaccine will be exempted from the condition. The decision was taken during the meeting of Team-9 presided over by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The rule will not only be applicable to people coming by air, rail and road but also to those using private vehicles. The development came a day after the UP government announced suspension of the proposed ‘Kanwar Yatra’ following a call by Kanwar association in the wake of pandemic. The CM said the community should take decisions on issues pertaining to faith. “The feeling of Kanwar association should be respected,” he added. The decision to make RT-PCR report mandatory comes amid high positivity rate in some cities of Maharashtra and Kerala. According to reports, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Buldhana, Pune (rural), Palghar and Raigadh have recorded test positivity rate higher than 4.5%. Likewise, the positivity rate in Kerala has been hovering around 10%. Yogi directed the officials to ensure contact tracing and testing of people coming from states with high positivity rate. He said these people should be subjected to antigen test and thermal scanning on arrival in UP. According to officials, the state is determined not to lower the guard as it gears up for a possible third wave of coronavirus pandemic, which is said to affect the children. In the last 24 hours, UP recorded 56 new Covid-19 cases, while 69 recovered from the infection. The state recorded 1,262 active cases, which was down from 1,339 recorded a day ago. The positivity rate in the state is 0.02%, while the recovery rate is 98.6%. The state conducted testing of more than 2.54 lakh samples. According to the state health department, no new case was detected in another seven districts – Aligarh, Chitrakoot, Hathras, Kasganj, Mahoba, Shamli and Shravasti – taking the total number of such districts to 47. The CM also pitched for scaling up of the vaccination process. More than 4.03 crore doses of vaccine have been administered. The CM also pressed for associating the health workers with ‘Health ATMs’, a one-stop digital touch-point integrated machine designed to diagnose all chronic disease, delivering primary care and diagnostics, in CHCs and PHCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rtpcr-report-must-for-entry-to-up-from-high-caseload-states/articleshow/84536553.cms||---

The chief minister has sanctioned another Rs 2,000 crore for implementation of the scheme in Huzurabad constituency alone, in addition to Rs 1,200 crore announced for the programme in the entire state earlier. The date of the launch of the Telangana Dalita Bandhu would be announced soon. Like the Rythu Bandhu scheme, beneficiaries of Dalita Bandhu will get financial assistance deposited directly into their bank accounts. “Problems of Dalits will not be uniform and they would differ from rural to semi-urban to urban areas. Classification should be done and Dalita Bandhu should be implemented successfully,” KCR told officials. Along with Rs 10 lakh cash to each family, a safety fund will also be created under the scheme. In case of an emergency, for a family covered under Dalita Bandhu, the safety fund will help them sustain and not fall into poverty. “The aim of Dalita Bandhu scheme is to lift Dalit families from their present situation to prosperity. We need officials who can put their heart and soul with commitment and dedication to make this scheme a success,” the CM said. Officials informed the CM that 20,929 of the families under Huzurabad assembly segment would be selected as beneficiaries. The scheme would be implemented under saturation mode for the eligible families as per guidelines. Based on results following the implementation of the pilot project, officials will review and extend the scheme all over the state.

These committees will conduct meetings every month to discuss and solve the issues being faced by the consumers, especially the industry. Five businessmen and four PSPCL officers have been appointed as members of these committees, which, in the coming days, will be expanded. The committee set up for issues concerning the west circle will comprise Jaswinder Singh Thukral, president of Janta Nagar Small-Scale Manufacturers’ Association (JSMA), and chief engineer of PSPCL Bhupinder Khosla. It will also have Tejveer Singh Johar as representative from the industry and deputy chief engineer of PSPCL Somnath Mahi. East circle panel will include general secretary of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) Pankaj Sharma and president of Knitwear Club Darshan Dawar as members from the industry and PSPCL will be represented by deputy chief engineer Jagdev Singh Hans and Sanjiv Prabhakar. President of Induction Furnace Association of North India (IFANI) KK Garg will be a representative for issues and disputes at zonal level. Hailing the development, businessman Savinder Singh Hunjan said, “We are thankful to PSPCL for finally taking the right step and forming the trade facilitation committees for solving our problems by giving representation to businessmen. We are sure that the appointment of Jaswinder Thukral as the leading member of the committee will help thousands of industrialists from the micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector to take their problems to the highest level for early resolution.” Inderjit Singh, another businessman, said, “It is only because of unrelenting protests by businessmen against PSPCL’s unauthorised use of electricity (UUE) penalties that the department has woken up. We welcome the formation of the committees, but PSPCL also needs to ensure that meetings of the committees are conducted regularly regardless of transfer of their officers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/trade-facilitation-panels-with-bizmen-power-officers-as-members-set-up/articleshow/84532234.cms||Mohit Behl

Though the textile shops in the region have been allowed to operate with a 50% customer capacity at any given time by following all standard operating procedures, the sale season due to the month of Aadi has thrown these precautions to the wind. RMR textiles on MM Street in Karaikudi had announced a 50% discount on silk saris and witnessed a large crowd from early in the morning on Saturday. Initially, the workers in the shop did thermal scanning checks and asked people to use the hand sanitizer. By afternoon, the shop was crowded as the municipality officials who came there had to send them out with the help of police personnel. The shop was then sealed. Shops in Karaikudi were seen exerting caution, but it was not the case in shops in other southern districts, which saw large crowds throughout Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shop-sealed-in-karaikudi-for-violating-covid-norms/articleshow/84532235.cms||---

The senior citizen, who was crossing the tracks, failed to notice the oncoming Mumbai-Varanasi train in the afternoon. An official on the platform shouted out to caution the loco pilot who hit the brakes just in time. The train engine came to a halt just two to three inches short of the elderly man who was almost under the front part of the engine. Railway staff helped him come out. The loco pilot, assistant loco pilot and the official who raised the alarm will be awarded Rs 2,000 each for saving the man’s life, said CR general manager Alok Kansal. Earlier, in the day, the suburban tracks were submerged in 6 to 8 inches of water as train services were suspended for nearly four hours on Western Railway and over six hours on Central Railway. Passengers on emergency duties such as government staff and medical staff were badly hit due to suspension of services earlier in the day. The water-logging was most at Kurla, Sion, Wadala, Chunabhatti stations. Railways used several pumps and deployed a huge task force to drain out the water on tracks. While 59 long-distance trains were hit, 14 were cancelled due to the heavy rain. WR services resumed fully by 9am, CR trains on CSMT-Karjat/Kasara Main line started at 10am after water level at Sion station receded. “Harbour line was the worst hit between CSMT and Mankhurd as there was water on tracks at Chunabhatti.

He was one of the many parents who turned up for the special parent-teacher meet (PTM) held at Delhi government schools on Monday. The meet will continue for two weeks. Ahmed said he couldn’t miss it and wanted to meet his child’s teacher also. “I come back from work and then sit with my son as all his worksheets come on my phone. I hope it is not a problem if I submit the worksheets late?” Ahmed asked the teacher at Shaheed Hemu Kalani Bal Sarvodaya Vidyalaya. As they live in a joint family, his wife does not get time to teach her son. On Monday, the PTM was for children up to Class III. Out of the 93 children in this school, the parents of 30 of them attended the meeting. In a few other schools, even children accompanied their parents. Another parent, Mohammad Mohsin Akhtar, who works at a shop in Lajpat Nagar market, added, “My elder son, who also goes to a government school, helps him with his worksheet. Both me and my wife have smartphones, so the children use her phone for the classes.” Akhtar also inquired with his younger son’s teacher on how the child was doing with his studies. “Help the child with reading and writing. Every day, ask him to write one page. Ask him to read a book and mark words, which he doesn’t understand. They can send it to me on WhatsApp and I will help,” the teacher said. Kamala Sutar, whose son has taken admission in the same school in class VI this year, also attended the PTM. Sutar has got her child shifted from a private school in Garhi as they could not afford the Rs 900 monthly fee. “Because of Covid-19, the earnings have reduced at home and it is only my husband who works. Now since our son has been admitted, I came to the meeting to understand how he will be taught. With schools closed, children have lost out on studies,” said Sutar, adding that for now, she was only helping him with his studies. She has studied till Class X and is from Odisha. Some schools welcomed the parents with paintings, rangoli and cards. At Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Mayur Vihar, parents were given handmade cards, while Government Girls Middle School, Chauhan Bangar had sent online invitation cards for the meeting, which was held after a long gap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/day-1-teachers-parents-brave-heavy-rain-to-turn-up-for-ptm/articleshow/84568463.cms||Shradha Chettri

We, therefore, do not face any challenge from the opposition,” he said, while speaking to TOI. Singh completes two years as UP BJP chief on Monday. Singh said that there were also various `vaicharik’ (ideological) issues, including construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, which would be taken up by the party in the due course of time. This was a strong pointer to BJP’s strategy to keep the temple issue pulsating while taking on its political opponents. Singh said that the party would also project the development of religious places like Vindhyachal, Chitrakoot and Shakumbari Devi (Saharanpur), by the Yogi Aditynath government. “The party has managed to fulfill all the ideological commitments it made to the people in the past,” he said, stressing that the abolition of Article 370 was one of the key victories for the ruling party. At the same time, he said, the party sought to ensure a better livelihood for the poor and downtrodden. The UP BJP chief said his main focus area is now execution of programmes decided in the state executive meet vis-a-vis 2022 assembly elections. The party had decided on a host of campaigns including the constitution of the team of `Swasthya Swayam Sewaks’ by July 20. This will be besides the a special vaccination campaign on July 23, 24 and 25 in which street vendors, shopkeepers and other service providers would be covered. Buoyed by its electoral success in the recently concluded rural local bodies’ elections, the party will organise felicitation of party supported candidates who got elected as block chairman and members. The programme is scheduled to be organised between July 26 and July 31. After this, the party will take up physical verification of booth level committees between August 16 and September 15. Singh said that the party would solely rely on the team work of the party workers who have been working hard to raise the political stature of the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-challenge-from-opposition-in-2022-polls-says-up-bjp-chief/articleshow/84536627.cms||Pankaj Shah

Cyclone frequency in the Arabian Sea increased by 52% between 2001 and 2019 compared to 1981-2000, while the number of very severe cyclones rose by 150% in the same period, the study found. Meanwhile the Bay of Bengal, traditionally the source of most cyclones, saw frequency dip by 8% during the same period. The increase is related to rising ocean temperatures and greater moisture availability due to global warming, said scientists from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune who conducted the study. While the Bay of Bengal is also warming, it is not warming as much as the Arabian Sea and has a deficit in moisture supply, said study co-author and IITM scientist Roxy Mathew Koll. It’s not just the frequency of cyclones that has increased in the Arabian Sea. The same period saw a 20% increase in the intensity of cyclones in the post-monsoon period. Accumulated cyclone energy almost tripled, the study found. Both factors indicate increased storm strength. Cyclones are forming at slightly lower latitudes than before in the Arabian Sea which gives them time to intensify if other conditions are favourable, the study suggested. The duration of cyclones went up by 80% in the Arabian Sea, while the duration of very severe cyclones almost tripled in the same period. By contrast, there was no such increase in the Bay of Bengal. The increase in cyclone duration in the Arabian Sea was most prominent in May, June, and October, and was linked to an increase in relative humidity and moist energy related to rising sea temperatures, the study said. “With the ocean warming, there is more heat and moisture available for the cyclone to maintain energy for a longer time,” said Koll. For instance, the recent Tauktae maintained cyclone status for more than a day, even after landfall, he noted. “That’s unusual because cyclones usually dissipate fast due to friction over land and lack of continued supply of heat and moisture from the oceans,” he said. Though many cyclones that form in the Arabian Sea don’t make landfall in India, often veering off northwest, the increase in frequency raises the risk to the west coast. In 2019, for instance, five of eight cyclones in the Indian Ocean arose in the Arabian Sea. And Cyclone Nisarga in 2020 and Cyclone Tauktae both caused damage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/severe-cyclones-in-arabian-sea-up-by-150-from-2001-19-in-mumbai-study/articleshow/84537660.cms||---

Real estate developers in the city are seeing a growing demand for co-working spaces or flexible office models, as several private firms juggle with ways to cut down expenses on maintaining permanent on-site infrastructure. Before the second wave of the pandemic hit India, Kolkata had already featured on the list of cities that had adopted this “revenue sharing model” in place of the “traditional rental model”, say some leading developers. Primarc Group director Siddharth Pansari anticipates that the demand for the “flexi office space” model will continue to grow even after the pandemic is over. “It offers a unique value proposition to many property owners who can monetise their assets and build a steady revenue stream. The flexibility factor also helps both small and large businesses,” he told TOI. Managing director of JLL (Kolkata) Surekha Bihani says the overall office leasing market has witnessed several changes in the past 18 months. “We have rolled out a new model where the risk factor is largely divided between the operator and the partner. The hub-and-spoke model (one that comprises an anchor establishment or ‘hub’ complemented by secondary establishments or ‘spokes’) is catching up,” Bihani said. Cost savings, high proportion of lease expiry in the next three years and hybrid work models are some of the factors that will drive the flexible office space segment, says Smartworks founder Neetish Sarda. “According to a report, 30% of all office spaces will be flexible by 2030. The pandemic has paved the way for new work models, prompting various organisations to re-evaluate their real estate needs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/post-covid-flexi-office-space-will-be-city-mantra/articleshow/84524744.cms||Sarthak.G

He also urged the other parents to visit the teachers and learn about the plan for the academic year 2021-22. Special PTMs are being organised at all Delhi government schools from Monday to share the semi online teaching-learning strategies and emotional well-being tips with parents. The PTM will be held from July 19-31 in a staggered manner. During the meeting, the teachers will explain the parents about the importance of establishing emotional connections with their children so that they remain mentally healthy and participate actively in their online classes. Along with this, they have also shared the new evaluation policy of CBSE with the parents of students studying in Class X and XII. “Despite incessant rain, the enthusiasm shown by our teachers and parents for the PTM is commendable. While schools are closed, education of all the children should continue and every child should also get emotional support. I appeal to the parents to ensure they go to the schools and meet the teachers.” Along with special PTMs, joint PTM for Class VI is also being organised. This is for the students transitioning to Class VI from municipal corporation schools to Delhi government ones . tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-urges-parents-to-attend-meets/articleshow/84568485.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Rare cancer surgery lets 4-year-old eat normally again||RAJKOT: Each day for the past two years had been mentally agonizing for the parents of four-year-old Jenab Khan. The little girl was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw, an extremely rare medical condition in children. She was unable to chew and lived mostly on fluids. But a marathon surgery, touted to be the first of its kind among children, has ensured that Jenab eats like any other normal child. The reconstructive or microvascular surgery was performed at Ahmedabad-based Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI) last week and Jenab is recovering well. “Such surgeries are performed in adults. But our research and data shows that it is the first time in India that a reconstructive surgery using healthy tissues of the leg was performed on such a young child,”Dr Hemant Saraiya, plastic surgeon at GCRI who performed the complex operation, told TOI. The cancerous tumour in the jaw was the size of lemon and the surgery lasted for nearly nine hours. “She will be able to eat normally now and should be discharged in a few days,” he added. GCRI officials said Jenab’s parents took her to several doctors and the majority of them suggested jaw removal as the only option. Medical experts say that the microvascular surgery conducted to rejoin severed body parts such as fingers, hands, arms and other amputated parts. Surgeons do it by reconnecting the minute blood vessels which effectively restore circulation before the injured tissue begins to die. Doctors transplanted healthy bone from her leg in the jaw after removing the cancerous parts to prevent spreading it in the body. The Khans live in Junagadh's Bhavnath Taleti area and belong to the economically poor family. "If the jaw part of the child is not removed, then chances of cancer spreading can increase. It was required to be removed to save his life and relieve her from pain,'' plastic surgeon Dr Hemant Saraiya said. Doctors used titanium plates and screws in this reconstruction surgery. Now, she will undergo physiotherapy exercises in the coming days and teeth will be implanted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rare-cancer-surgery-lets-4-yr-old-eat-normally-again/articleshow/84530689.cms||---

Headmasters of these schools said they have decided to advertise about admissions in their school as they are forced to shut due to Covid-19 and parents are not sure whether admissions have commenced or not. “With schools remaining shut, not many are aware of the start of admissions. So, we have decided to put up posters,” said Sumathi Rani V, headmaster (in-charge), Zilla Parishad High School (ZPHS), Pachunur, Karimnagar. She said that while the school, which was established in 1948, used to have about 500 students, the strength is now reduced to 110 because of private and model schools. “We felt that putting a word on social media will help us in getting more students,” she added. Government teachers and headmasters said that it’s not new to print pamphlets or take our rallies to create awareness about admissions and facilities, but lately, schools are making use of social media to reach out to more parents. “Don’t waste your money by sending your children to a private school amid pandemic. Admissions are open for class 6 to class 9 inboth English and Telugu medium at our school,” read a message sent to villagers from K Bhoomi Reddy, headmaster of ZPHS, Chintakunta. Speaking to TOI, Reddy said “We try to attract parents to send their children to our school by showing them our infrastructure, availability of English medium, quality food, among others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/makeover-for-govt-schools-in-state-on-corporate-lines/articleshow/84536738.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Most of the victims were from the four shanties touching the wall on a hillock. When TOI visited the spot, mothers were holding on to their children, gathering wet grains and trying to retrieve their belongings. The men were busy throwing out the muck. “I, along with my three sons and husband, ran out of the house when we heard about the crash.

---||Lucknow||Open-minded about poll alliance in Uttar Pradesh: Priyanka Gandhi||LUCKNOW: Despite having a bitter experience with pre-poll alliances in the state, Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said here on Sunday that her party was not close-minded on the issue. In an informal interaction with media persons here, she said that the Congress's primary goal was to defeat the BJP in the 2022 state elections. When asked specifically whether her party would go for a pre-poll alliance, she first said "it is too early to say." When asked again if she was ruling it out, she said: "I do not rule it out. We are absolutely not closed-minded. We are keeping an open mind. But the party won’t take any step which might weaken it." She, however, was not forthcoming when asked whether she would be Congress's CM candidate in the assembly elections. It is believed that the earlier two poll alliance of the party -- with BSP in 1996 and with SP in 2017 -- did it more harm than good and further weakened it in the state politics. Priyanka, however, added that other parties should also be open-minded about it. Speaking about the party's strategy in the 2022 elections she said: “Our primary aim is to defeat the BJP and we are ready to do anything for this. Congress will finalise its strategy as per the circumstances.” She said that Congress has worked very hard over the past one and a half years. “We have been able to build our cadres till the level of the gram panchayat and Congress will contest the elections with full strength.” On whether she would be seen more often in Lucknow with the 2022 election gaining momentum, she said: “yes of course.” Slamming the BJP leaders for their comment that Priyanka was a political tourist, she said: “I am not a political tourist. I have been regularly coming to UP. This is BJP's propaganda to show me and my brother Rahul as non-serious politicians and we are not going to be cowed down by it.” When asked that Congress workers become active in his presence and become inactive as soon as she leaves the state, she said: “It's other way round. Media pays attention when I am here and but when I am not here, it doesn't. But our cadre keeps working relentlessly." “We have done maximum work during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can see that we are the ones who have raised issues. Our party has been out of power for 30-32 years in the state. It weakens the structure. However, now full efforts are being made and results are showing,"she added. The Congress national general secretary was on a three-day trip to Lucknow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-are-open-minded-about-poll-alliance-in-up-priyanka/articleshow/84536741.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kolkata||Pillars of Hope||Kolkata: The real estate sector in the City of Joy was hit hard when the Covid pandemic struck in March 2020. But after a debilitating second wave and a year and a quarter on, with most states reopening and the economy picking up, hope is building up. The leading players in this sector — valued at over Rs 1.1 lakh crore and which employs a few lakh people in the state — see light at the end of the tunnel following a number of favourable factors which, they feel, will help in reviving the industry in the city as well as in the state in the next few quarters. These include one of the lowest home loan rates in 50 years, non-revision of the real estate price for the past few years despite a sharp increase in the prices of raw materials and lastly, the recent sops for the real estate industry announced in the Bengal budget. The state government has reduced stamp duty by 2% on registration of all kinds of properties up to October 30 this year. Further, the Bengal government has reduced the guideline value (circle rate) for all kinds of properties by 10%. This could lead to savings of Rs 50,000 to over Rs 2 lakh, depending on the value of the property in question. Chairman of Credai West Bengal and chairman of Merlin Group Sushil Mohta and Credai national chairman H V Patodia are optimistic about the real estate sector. Mohta said the recent announcement in the budget would encourage people to come forward to buy ready or almost-ready properties. This way they will save 2%, which is a considerable amount, he said. “This will help in clearing some unsold inventories. A lot of customers who are fence-sitters will take the plunge and hopefully buy properties. Developers will also have the marketing opportunity and invite customers to take this benefit,” he said. Mohta believes that the state government will benefit when the overall sale volume goes up and the total revenue collection increases, as has been witnessed in states like Maharashtra. He said the government should ideally extend this benefit of reduced stamp duty for at least one more quarter (till December) and the circle rate must remain reduced till the economy fully recovers. According to him, Bengal has seen a growth of around 10% year on year in this sector. Incidentally, in the state budget this year, revenue estimate from the sector was pegged at Rs 7,500 crore. Credai national chairman Patodia feels stamp duty cut will be a compelling proposition. “If somebody has money, this is the right time to buy a flat. During the pandemic, the importance of one’s own house has gone up. The home loan rate is at its lowest ever and the real estate price in Kolkata has not been revised for 3-4 years; so, what more do you need,” he said. Managing director of JLL (Kolkata) Surekha Bihani is equally optimistic about increase in uptake. Director of Jain Group Rishi Jain, another prominent developer, pointed out that amid the pandemic, many people returned to the city and now work from home. “We have started getting calls and enquiries following the recent sops, and hope that the next few quarters will be good,” he said. Director of Primarc Group Siddharth Pansari couldn’t agree more. “There was no site visit in May-June, but now it is happening and frequently. The recent incentive will also help if there is no further lockdown. The real estate sector here will do well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pillars-of-hope/articleshow/84524702.cms||---

They were rescued by a group of men using life jackets and ropes tied to their waists in the wee hours of Sunday. Residents of the 40-odd concrete, ground plus one storey houses in Nandale village were woken up as rainwater started entering their homes. Volunteers of an animal welfare organisation ‘Sarpmitra’ alerted the gram panchayat and Saphale police, and rushed to help the villagers at around 4am. The 10 volunteers tied a 250-feet-long rope and formed a chain. Using life jackets, they moved through the waist- and shoulder-deep water and rescued many. Among those saved in the three-hour operation were an 80-year-old man and a six-month-old baby. A woman who was among those rescued said that though the area gets flooded during rains every year, this is the first time that water entered their homes. “A few more hours and water would have reached the first floor,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-70-who-climbed-atop-houses-for-safety-rescued/articleshow/84537673.cms||---

The video was posted on Instagram reels from an account that has over 1.6 lakh followers. Taking suo motu cognisance in the matter, Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has issued a notice to Delhi Police seeking an FIR against the woman. DCW has stated that the videos were obscene the content of which could be termed as sexual. In the video, the child, was made to dance inappropriately, grabbing the woman and making sexual gestures, An official said the actions of the woman could not be deemed fit to be the behaviour of an adult with a minor, that, too, her own child. The commission has stated that the activities of the woman would not only affect the mental state of the child, but also impact other people, including children watching the video. “The child in question, who appears to have been sexualised at such an early stage and is being taught to objectify his own mother, shall, if not checked today, be prone to objectifying other women and may develop a criminal mentality,” DCW said. DCW, through its notice, has asked Delhi Police for a counseling and rehabilitation plan for the child. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dcw-notice-to-cops-over-videos-by-mother-son/articleshow/84568576.cms||---

A proposal regarding this has sparked a debate in the civic body. The prime plot of land in Alkapuri behind the station is a part of the Faramji Compound. It was earmarked for the civic body to develop public utilities and parking. The civic body will, however, have to acquire this land from a private realty firm. The realty firm had approached the Gujarat high court that has asked VMC to decide on acquisition of the land. If the VMC decides to acquire the plot, it will have to pay around Rs 215 crore to the realtor Vastu Shilp Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (VSIPL). A VMC official said that the civic body has been caught in a tight spot over the issue. On one hand, if it decides to acquire the land, VMC will have to pay a huge amount at a time when it is facing a fund crunch. At the other end, if VMC lets go of the land, it will come under criticism for siding with realtors. The issue was brought to the standing committee of the civic body for a decision but it was put on hold by the panel. In the meantime, VMC is going to hold talks with VSIPL to try to work out a solution. Standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel said that the VMC would get 40% of the said land under the General Development and Control Regulations (GDCR) next year. “We need to discuss this as it is not advisable to pay for the entire land when we will be getting a portion of it anyways,” he said. There are other similar plots in the area falling under reservation and if they too seek acquisition on the lines of VSIPL, the VMC will have to cough up around Rs 700 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/prime-land-acquisition-puts-vmc-in-tight-spot/articleshow/84532222.cms||---

The downpours washed away parts of the already-damaged roads, and also led to soil erosion in several parts of Goa. Winds gusting to 40-50kmph accompanied the rainfall, bringing down heavy trees in Margao, Quepem, Benaulim and other parts of the state, but no loss of life was reported. In Margao, a coconut tree fell on an electricity line near the Osia complex, while in Benaulim, a tree fell on an electricity pole. Firemen were kept on their toes throughout the day attending to calls, most of which pertained to uprooting of trees, sources in the fire and emergency services said. The department received 18 calls of trees falling on power lines and blocking roads across the state. IMD has retained the red alert for Monday, and has issued an orange alert till Thursday, indicating that the coastal state is unlikely to get any respite from the unceasing showers. The week-long heavy downpour has already filled up water bodies and dams in the state, spilling over on to roads and fields. The Tillari interstate irrigation project authorities increased the water discharge from the Tillari water reservoir to avoid further danger to the dam because of the rising water levels of the river Chapora at Sal village in Bicholim taluka. The Valvanti river is also in full spate. The water level in Anjunem dam, which received 66mm of rainfall, has reached 86m, while the Aamthane dam is also close to its maximum capacity. Pernem crossed the 100-inch rainfall mark (2,557.9mm) on Sunday. The heavy rainfall has destroyed crops across the state, particularly at Guirim, Sal, Bicholim, Cuncolim and the department of agriculture is expected to assess the extent of the damage in the coming days. Hapless motorists were trapped at some low-lying spots where roads were submerged. While no flights were cancelled or diverted, airlines did report delays in arrivals and departures. Trains along the Konkan route were either delayed or rescheduled due to the heavy rainfall along the Konkan region. Parts of the state also witnessed power outages, as tree branches came in contact with power lines. The locals of the Anjuna-Caisua panchayat area said that they suffered frequent power outages with electricity department officials offering vague answers. The dug-up roads across the state also filled up with rainwater, making it more difficult for commuters. In the state capital, the residents of Camrabhat and Peterbhat have had a harrowing week, with water entering and stagnating in their homes. The continuous downpour paralysed life in Verla Canca, Divar, Calangute-Candolim, and some wards of Cuncolim, with hardly anyone venturing out. At Nagoa, the compound wall of a house collapsed because of the rain, while a small portion of a hillock in front of a chapel on the Parra-Assagao road collapsed, destroying the stairs leading to the chapel. Residents of two wards of Sanvorcotto and Bhattiem in Cuncolim were marooned after the road to the bypass bridge near the chapel was submerged. The state received more than 20cm of rainfall over a 24-hour period, which is likely to continue, said the IMD in the daily weather update for Goa. The heavy rainfall is because of an offshore trough at mean sea level from Maharashtra to Karnataka coasts, along with a possible formation of a low pressure area over the northwest Bay of Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parts-of-goa-cut-off-as-non-stop-rain-continues-to-pummel-state/articleshow/84534892.cms||Newton Sequeira

The ATM is located at Seven Sera mall near Bela village on Morbi-Jetpur road. According to Morbi taluka police, the incident occurred sometime between Friday and Saturday afternoon. The thieves broke open the cash deposit vault behind the ATM and took away Rs 15.70 lakh from it. Bank official Sanjay Rajpara lodged a complaint against unidentified persons. Primary probe suggests that a gas cutter was used by thieves to break the ATM. Police launched a probe in this case based on CCTV camera footage. Earlier last week, thieves had cut open ATMs of two banks during curfew hours in the newly developed Nageshwar area on Jamnagar Road and decamped with Rs 15 lakh in the early hours.

The western state also leads the list as far as registration of property agents across states is concerned, while Uttar Pradesh tops when it comes to complaints disposed of by regulators. Official data till July 10 show that 31,221 projects were registered with RERA in Maharashtra followed by 8,685 in Gujarat. Karnataka has the third most projects registered with RERA (4,151). UP RERA has registered 3,033 projects and the tally in Madhya Pradesh is 3,659. As far as registration of real estate agents or property dealers is concerned, out of 51,895 registrations across states, Maharashtra registered 29,995 of them. In UP, 4,579 agents have been registered and in Delhi barely 389. The data show that 70,001 complaints have been resolved by regulators with two benches of UP RERA leading the list, having disposed of 27,825 complaints. Haryana, which has also set up two benches, reported disposal of 14,591 complaints, followed by Maharashtra, where 10,043 complaints have been resolved. Abhay Upadhyay, who heads the Forum for People’s Collective Efforts (FPCE), which campaigned for enactment of RERA, said, “Merely tracking the number of projects registered under RERA is not of much significance, especially after five years. We need to seek data like number of projects completed within scheduled date as per registration, number of projects granted extension and completed within extended period, number of projects delayed beyond one year from original scheduled completion and number of projects for which registration expired and extension also not sought by promoter to assess the real success and effectiveness of RERA.” He added that similarly the number of complaints disposed of by RERA authorities is of not much importance.

Neither Deshmukh nor his family was found at his house in Katol or his ancestral home in Vadvihira, the two premises raided. Deshmukh is an NCP MLA from Katol, and many party politicians stood outside the raided premises there in a show of support. Similar support was seen at his Vadvihira and Nagpur homes. So far, the ED has issued three summons to Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh, asking them to appear at its zonal office in south Mumbai for their statement in the case, but father and son have both kept citing various reasons to avoid making an appearance. The ED also issued summons last week to Deshmukh’s wife Aarti, who cited health and old age to avoid appearing before the ED. Last week, in the first major action in the case, the ED attached Deshmukh’s assets, a flat in Worli here and land in Uran collectively worth Rs 4.2 crore, going by the purchase value. The Worli flat is worth Rs 1.54 crore and is in the name of Deshmukh’s wife. The 25 land parcels in Uran taluka of Raigad district have a 2006 purchase price of Rs 2.67 crore and are in the name of Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd, a company in which Deshmukh’s sons, Hrishikesh and Salil, have controlling stakes. Sources said the market value of the Uran land parcels is over Rs 300 crore. ED sources said that since they are yet to trace the money Deshmukh allegedly collected from dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze through his personal staff, they have attached his other properties of similar worth. The ED is investigating a laundering case against Deshmukh following allegations that he had asked Waze to extort Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month.

---||Goa||Red alert today too, Goa braces for very wet week||PANAJI: The India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, has extended the red alert — originally issued for Sunday — to Monday too, and has warned of extremely heavy rainfall exceeding 20cm in 24 hours in isolated places.  With the possibility of the formation of a low-pressure area over the northwest Bay of Bengal around Wednesday, there is also the likelihood of very heavy rainfall with scattered and isolated spatial distributions over Goa for about a week. An orange warning has been issued from Tuesday to Thursday. “Heavy rainfall of over 10cm has been reported at rain gauge stations at Vasco, Panaji, and Old Goa from 8.30am till 5.30pm on Sunday,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. By 11.30pm, Panaji recorded 124.3mm (4.9 inches) of rainfall, Old Goa saw 157mm (6.2 inches), and Mormugao saw 159.2mm (6.3 inches), IMD said. Pernem, meanwhile, crossed the 100-inch mark (2,557.9mm) on Sunday. The weekend’s increased rainfall over Goa was due to an eastwest shear zone running above mean sea level, an offshore trough at mean sea level from Maharashtra to Karnataka coasts, a cyclonic circulation over north coastal Andhra Pradesh and neighbourhood areas extending up to 1.5km above mean sea level, and a northsouth trough above mean sea level from central Madhya Pradesh to south Tamil Nadu across Vidarbha, Telangana and Rayalaseema. Winds of speed 45-55kmph gusting to 65kmph are very likely along with rainfall spells. With increased rainfall activity to continue, the IMD has suggested that areas vulnerable for landslide and flooding may be kept under monitoring. “Water levels in rivers may be monitored and necessary precautions may kindly be taken. Fishermen have been advised against venturing into the coast,” the IMD warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/red-alert-today-too-goa-braces-for-very-wet-wk/articleshow/84534972.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Dehradun||49 booked for leasing out tribal land in Jaunsar-Bawar hills to ‘build resorts’||Nainital: At least 49 people belonging to tribal communities in Dehradun’s Jaunsar Bawar region in Chakrata — which houses crucial military establishments — have been booked for allegedly leasing out their land illegally to non-tribals. The matter came to light after a plea in the high court alleged that resorts were being built on tribal land in Chakrata hills which has military establishments, including those pertaining to Army’s special forces. Some areas in Chakrata require Inner Line Permit to visit. The public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by resident Chetan Singh Chauhan following which the court ordered an inquiry. In a report submitted to the court last week, the Dehradun district magistrate informed the bench that cases have been filed against 49 land owners under various sections of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act 1950. Section 157 (b) of the Act prohibits any person belonging to a scheduled tribe from transferring his land to any person not belonging to the ST community by way of sale, gift, mortgage or lease. The Act adds that no transfer of land will be made without approval of the assistant collector. According to the report by the district magistrate, a copy of which is available with TOI, there are at least 50 more cases from Dehradun district pending before various assistant collectors where the land belonging to the SC/ST community has been sold to people not belonging to the two groups without prior permission. The plea filed in June had also alleged that the terms in many lease deeds were exploitative and compared them to those offered by the British East India Company. The deals provided almost no recourse to the locals to regain possession of the land and in several instances, a clause stated that the deal would renew itself after the expiration of the current deed and the owner would have no right to object, according to the PIL. The report submitted by the DM did not mention the specifics of the deeds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/49-booked-for-leasing-out-tribal-land-in-jaunsar-bawar-hills-to-build-resorts/articleshow/84531031.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Travelling without vax cert or negative report, tourists turned away from beach towns||KOLKATA/DIGHA: Tourists who headed to coastal resorts of Bakkhali, Digha, Mandarmani and Shankarpur for the weekend were asked to cut their trips short and return after they were found travelling without vaccination certificates or negative Covid-test reports. Police on Sunday intercepted vehicles carrying tourists to Bakkhali in South 24 Parganas to check whether they had the required documents. The crackdown in East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas will be replicated for tourists headed towards Santiniketan, Taki, Mukutmanipur and Bishnupur, officials said on Sunday. The drive was led by Sagar SDPO Dipanajan Chatterjee, who said that several tourists who failed to show the required documents were asked to return. “Every tourist needs to carry either a vaccination certificate or a negative test report,” he said. Sunderbans police superintendent Bhaskar Mukherjee said the checks will continue. The district administrations are not insisting on an RT-PCR negative report, but are also allowing people with negative Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) reports. The same rules are being enforced in East Midnapore’s coastal getaways. Special teams led by East Midnapore DM Purnendu Kumar Maji made surprise checks in Digha hotels on Saturday. Over 100 tourists were asked to leave in the evening. A canteen, too, was closed by the DM for violating safety norms and operating beyond the 8pm deadline. The DM has warned about sealing hotels and lodges if they allow tourists to check in without proper documents. Ramnagar BDO Bishnupada Roy led teams to check tourist vehicles headed to Digha and Mandarmani and turned away around 150 tourists as they failed to show the necessary documents. Bankura District Magistrate Radhika Aiyar said that no tourist will be allowed at spots like Mukutmanipur or Bishnupur without a double dose of vaccination or a negative Covid report. Somnath Mukherjee, Taki municipality administrator, said, “We are checking if they have a double-vaccination certificate or a negative test report.” The Birbhum district administration is enforcing the same rules for tourists heading to Santiniketan.

---||Ludhiana||Parties in Punjab promise Dalits space, they have it in religion already||JALANDHAR: With the state assembly elections now only months away, all political parties are opening promising prominence to communities and castes. With Jat Sikhs already assured dominance in state politics, BJP is pledging power to Dalits, which SAD is countering with Hindu and Dalit deputy chief ministers. Even with internal strife bubbling over, the Congress too is trying to strike communal balance. While parties talk like they are inventing social engineering in Punjab, the fact remains that these safety valves already exist. For example, heads of two most important and highest Sikh institutions come from so called lower castes. Giani Harpreet Singh, acting Jathedar of Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhs, comes from scheduled caste (SC) background. Similarly, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Bibi Jagir Kaur comes from backward class (BC) background. Though political discourse has been creating a perception that Dalits and Sikhs are two completely different entities, data analysis and observations show that not only SCs make one third of total Sikh population in Punjab but also numerous fellows from so called ‘lower caste’ backgrounds have been working as granthis (scripture readers), ragis (hymns singers), preachers and dhadis (ballad singers). Some of them have reached the top also, in terms of holding offices, as well as, enjoying popularity and respect. It needed a lot of inquiries to confirm caste background of Jathedar Ginai Harpreet Singh as usual reply in SGPC circles and even from those close to him in religious or community affairs was — nobody has ever discussed or bothered. When asked about his caste background, his journey in Sikh religious affairs and elevation to the top post, Giani Harpreet quipped, “It has never mattered to me or those around me. Throughout my only identity have been of a Sikh and only my dedication to Guru’s philosophy and cause has mattered.” His father was also a granthi. “I topped the three-year course from Guru Kashi Gurmat Institute, Talwandi Sabo, in 1997. SGPC officials themselves called me for appointment as parcharak (preacher). I was later appointed head granthi and ‘katha vachak’ two years later and was then appointed Takht Damdama Sahib jathedar in May 2017,” he said. “I have always been saying that Sikh religion provides equal recognition for all,” he added. He appointed Akal Takht acting Jathedar in October 2018. Bibi Jagir Kaur’s caste — Lubana, classified as BC — is widely known as she rose through political field after first becoming MLA in 1997. She also has the distinction of becoming first woman president of SGPC. When asked, she said during her unbroken stint in the Sikh representative body for the last 25 years, she never saw any consideration about caste backgrounds of granthis, ragis, preachers or other employees. “There can be several in the past and currently serving who might be coming from so called lower caste or SC backgrounds. People here really don’t bother or question caste backgrounds of granthis, hazoori ragis at Darbar Sahib or at other historic gurdwaras,” she said. Darbar Sahib is central shrine of Sikhs. Former SGPC secretary Kulwant Singh Randhawa, who served the representative body for over 43 years after joining it in 1956, also shared the same observations. Other prominent examples Former Akal Takht Jathedar Bhai Ranjit Singh came from Ramgarhia background, notified as BC in Punjab. Late Giani Bhagwan Singh, who remained head granthi of Akal Takht also came from so called lower caste background. Former SGPC president Prof Kirpal Singh Badungar also came from BC background. Darbar Sahib hazoori ragi and Padma Shri awardee, Bhai Nirmal Singh, whose death due to Covid last year left the community grieving across the globe, was also from Mazhabi Sikh background. He was trained at SGPC-run Missionary College in Amritsar. Scores of granthis, ragis are from SC, BC Saroop Singh Kadiana, who has been heading a ‘dhadi jatha’ for the last 31 years and also contested as AAP candidate from Phillaur reserve seat in 2017, said that neither before contesting election nor after, when it was known that he was from SC background, he faced any issues. “In fact, several granthis, ragis, dhadis and preachers are from so called lower castes and they serve in different gurdwaras in towns and villages. From my anecdotal knowledge, I can tell that it is possible that rather most of them would be from SC or BC backgrounds,” he said. Responding to a query, he revealed that a member of his group was Ramdasia Sikhs (SC) and two were Jat Sikhs. “Most of the dhadi and ragi jathas would be of people from different caste backgrounds,” said Kadiana, who comes from Ramdasia Sikh community. Manjit Singh Raj, Ludhiana-based ragi who comes from Mazhabi Sikh community, said to be lowest at the caste ladder, says that even his own jatha (group) is a mix. “I have been into Gurbani singing for the last seven years and have never faced any caste issues, though I have been to different gurdwaras across Punjab and outside. People don’t bother in the first place, and even if they know it has never been an issue,” he said. Why SCs among Sikhs ? “In Sikhism there is no place of caste stratification. Sikh leader Master Tara Singh got certain castes among Sikhs included in the scheduled caste list with a lot of efforts as those who had joined the Sikh fold from ‘lower castes’ were still largely economically deprived and deserved benefit of reservation for economic upliftment. Granthis and ragis coming from SC backgrounds is the biggest recognition not only of their religious and social emancipation but also of complete reversal of caste-disabilities,” says former IAS officer and noted Sikh author Gurtej Singh. How Sikh SCs got reservation “Sikhs coming from ‘lower caste’ backgrounds were refused reservation originally in the Constitution even as Sikh representatives of Akali Dal in the Constituent Assembly had pressed for it. Home minister Sardar Patel strongly opposed it in the CA. After making other efforts, Master Tara Singh wrote to the President of India on April 4, 1953 on the issue. Finally, he threatened agitation at Delhi and left with a jatha from Anandpur Sahib on October 1, 1953. He and other Sikh activists were on the way when Prime Minister J L Nehru intervened and four castes – Mazhabis, Ramdasias, Kabir Panthis (Julahas) and Sikligars — were included in the SC list for reservation,” says Tarlochan Singh, former Rajya Sabha member and ex-chairman of National Commission for Minorities. Mazhabi Sikh make largest component Mazhabi Sikhs come from “lowest step of caste ladder”. They share their caste background with ‘ati-shudra’ Balmikis. They make biggest component of SC Sikhs and also among all the SCs with 25.62 lakh headcount in the 2011 Census. In addition 2.07 lakh (24%) among those who mentioned their caste as Balmiki/Bhangi also identified themselves as Sikhs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/parties-promise-dalits-space-they-have-it-in-religion-already/articleshow/84536916.cms||IP Singh

---||Pune||Fake news: Vaccines have no link with 5G networks||PUNE: Several conspiracy theories can be found floating about on social media. And during a pandemic, misinformation can prove to be severely disruptive. One of the most bizarre claims has been the supposed link between Covid and 5G network. Conspiracy theorists, in numerous posts, have said that the Covid-19 vaccines are just another attempt by world governments to connect people to 5G networks. Such claims have been found circulating on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and WhatsApp. According to news reports, claims that "nanoparticles inside vaccines" are being used to link people with 5G networks, have been circulating on message boards and blogs since last year. The claims went on to cause real-world damage when in April 2020, more than 80 5G towers in the UK were set on fire. Police added that at least 40 employees of a service provider were also attacked. The Times Verified service has picked up messages pushing the 5G theory. One message urged social media users to help stop 5G testing "to save lives". An analysis by The New York Times last year found that the 5G conspiracy theory, during Covid, was pushed by at least 487 Facebook communities, 84 Instagram accounts and 52 Twitter accounts. The newspaper said that on YouTube, the 10 most popular 5G conspiracy videos, posted in March, had been viewed "over 5.8 million times". The 5G-coronavirus conspiracy has since been found in social networks across more than 30 countries, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/conspiracy-theories-disrupt-anti-pandemic-efforts/articleshow/84535050.cms||---

The first FIR was registered against members of a family for “obstructing public servants” by refusing to vacate the premises and later allegedly stripping partially. The other FIR was registered against a group of BJP party workers for lockdown violations. Eleven commercial structures and four residential structures were being demolished, on behalf of the MMRDA, on Saturday with a massive police bandobast. “A family locked themselves up in a residential structure and refused to move out. When they would not cooperate, we had to use force to evict them. But one of the male family members took off his trousers and dared us. We bundled him into a police vehicle in the same condition to take him to Vanrai police station,” said an officer. In the meantime, BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar blocked the police vehicle. A video clip of the goings-on went viral. Bhatkhalkar alleged that many people had not got eviction notices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/protest-to-halt-razing-for-metro-2-firs-registered-in-mumbai/articleshow/84537697.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Parties which are alive will have differences: Bajwa||However, Amarinder underlined that he was miffed at the way the issue was handled and even refused to meet Sidhu until the Amritsar East MLA publicly apologised for his “personally derogatory” tweets against him. With the divide between the supporters of Sidhu and Captain deepening, the focus will now be on how the two leaders will work together in a state going to assembly polls in about six months. Even the elaborate exercise through a three-member AICC panel led by Mallikarjun Kharge to take feedback from Punjab Congress leaders failed to end dissent in the party unit. The unstable truce between Amarinder and Sidhu will depend on whether Sidhu and his team will interfere in the affairs of the state government. Also, Amarinder will definitely expect a free hand in the proposed changes in his council of ministers. The announcement of Sidhu’s appointment came as both party MLAs and MPs scrambled to prove their loyalty to one camp or the other. Ahead of Parliament’s monsoon session, beginning on Monday, nine Congress MPs from Punjab also held a meeting at Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa’s official residence in Delhi earlier in the day. It is learnt that many of them openly opposed Sidhu’s proposed appointment as the new state Congress president. However, Bajwa later claimed that he was not in the race for any post and the MPs had only discussed moving an adjournment motion in Parliament on the farmers’ issues and price rise. The meeting is significant as Bajwa had met Amarinder on Sunday evening after being at loggerheads with him for a long time. “Captain called me and I went to meet him. There were some differences between us which have been cleared. There can be differences between two brothers. Parties which are alive will have differences,” Bajwa said, making it clear that the two old enemies had buried the hatchet. One of the MPs, who attended the meeting, said, “Of course, Sidhu was also discussed. Why will we not discuss when the party high command is trying to throw Sidhu on us when there are many old dyed in the wool Congress leaders in the state for the party head’s post.” Reacting to the meeting of the MPs, Punjab panchayats minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, who has been supporting Sidhu, said there can be a survey of MLAs as to who should be the next Congress president. He also said the state assembly elections will be held next year in Punjab so the MLAs should be contacted rather than the MPs. Jakhar, who cancelled the meeting of the 80 party MLAs and all district party presidents he had convened on Monday at 3 pm in Punjab Congress Bhawan at Chandigarh, wanted to pass a resolution that any decision by the Congress high command would be acceptable to all. Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who recently crossed over to Congress from AAP, had tweeted in response to Jahkar announcement, “I urge @suniljakhar not to indulge in show of strength and wait for the announcement of Congress president. Even otherwise the PPCC stands dissolved so the meeting would have no locus standi and would be invalid. It's time to unite and not divide!” The Punjab Youth Congress president Barinder Singh Dhillon has also convened a meeting of the Youth Congress team on Monday afternoon at 4 pm. During the day of hectic political activity, 10 Congress MLAs openly supported Amarinder and released a joint statement urging the Congress high command not to let Amarinder down. These legislators said that “washing dirty linen in public has only let down the party's image during the last couple of months.” They also supported Amarinder’s demand that Sidhu should tender a public apology so that the party and government can function in tandem. Sidhu continued to reach out to the state cabinet ministers and Congress MLAs on Sunday, the second day of such interactions. Tript Bajwa, Punjab panchayats minister, also said on Sunday that like Amarinder had forgotten Rajya Sabha MP Bajwa’s letters against him and the state Congress, the chief minister should also forget Sidhu’s tweets against him and the party in the larger interest of the Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parties-which-are-alive-will-have-differences-bajwa/articleshow/84536943.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Strict virus checks in hills, tourist numbers down by 50%||MUSSOORIE/NAINITAL: Tourist footfalls declined by as much as half in Mussoorie and Nainital this weekend as strict Covid-related checks kicked in. While hotel bookings were made mandatory last week to enter both hill stations, police teams also started thorough inspection of Covid- negative test reports. Compared with the past few weekends when hotels in Mussoorie had recorded 100% occupancy, bookings nosedived to 40% to 50% this weekend. In Nainital, many top hotels had barely 20% occupancy on Sunday. Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand Hotels' Association, told TOI tourist footfall had declined drastically by half in hill stations. “A number of factors have contributed to the decline in tourist rush. The administration has become very strict and there has also been some negative publicity after a video of a large number of tourists taking a dip at Kempty Falls went viral. Heavy rainfall over the past week has also caused people to change travel plans,” Sahni said. Hoteliers said that often tourists arrive without prior bookings but now they were being turned away. “On Friday and Saturday, a number of tourists were turned away by police for not carrying hotel booking slips,” said a hotelier in Mussoorie, adding that hotel reservation must not be mandatory for visitors. “Not everyone wants to book online. In fact, half of the tourists who come here book hotels only after their arrival. This rider has damaged business,” said Ved Sah, secretary of Nainital Hotels and Restaurants Association. Hoteliers are now demanding certain relaxations in the Covid-19 guidelines for upcoming weeks that are due to be released on July 20. “Tourists who are fully vaccinated must be allowed entry without a Covid-negative report while shops should be allowed to open for a longer duration. At the same time, administration as well as stakeholders must promote Covid appropriate behaviour by visitors,” said Sahni. Those associated with the tourism industry said that with the arrival of monsoon, chances of tourism picking up in the next few weeks were slim.

---||Nagpur||HC isn’t for enforcing admn, quasi-judicial orders||Nagpur: Coming down heavily on petitioners complaining against non-compliance of Amravati divisional commissioner’s orders, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday clarified that the HC isn’t an executing court to ensure enforcement and execution of orders passed by administrative and quasi-judicial authorities. “We would have liked to dismiss the petition by imposing costs. But, as this is the first time that such an instance has been noticed by us, we would refrain from doing so and would put an end to the matter by issuing caution to the parties,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said. “We record our displeasure for abuse of the jurisdiction of this court and accordingly, we caution the parties to refrain from doing so,” the bench added before summarily dismissing the petition filed by Jyoti Tayade and others. The petitioners had moved the judiciary alleging encroachment by the respondents on Gram Panchayat land in Amravati. Earlier, they had made various representations to the village sarpanch, Panchayat Samiti members, Zilla Parishad’s chief executive officer (CEO) and Gram Panchayat (GP) members. Subsequently, the CEO appointed an officer to inspect the petitioners’ claim against the respondents, which were found to be true in his report. Thereafter, the executive engineer also ordered an inquiry into their claims, but even its report had similar findings, confirming encroachment on government land. Quoting Section 53 of the Bombay Village Panchayat Act, the petitioners contended that the GP and Sarpanch have powers to remove illegal construction from such areas. Accordingly, the respondents were issued notices to immediately stop construction on the GP land and remove other illegal structures. However, they continued their illegal activities. The respondents then went into appeal against the GP orders before the Amravati divisional commissioner, who ordered fresh inspection and measurement of the disputed land as per the law by the ZP CEO and other authorities on January 1. The petitioners contended that even after six months the CEO has failed to comply with the commissioner’s order forcing them to approach the judiciary doors for directives to the former to expedite the process and remove encroachment. “The petitioners submit that the order passed by divisional commissioner directing CEO to make enquiry regarding encroachment and to remove it if the result confirmed the findings, is not being implemented by CEO. We must make it clear that HC isn’t an executing court for ensuring enforcement and execution of the orders passed by the administrative and quasi-judicial authorities,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-isnt-for-enforcing-admn-quasi-judicial-orders/articleshow/84535026.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Mumbai||Covid patients’ lungs with acute pneumonia heal well: Study||MUMBAI: The initial fear that many post-Covid patients would later develop lung fibrosis is fast receding in the medical corridors. Even lungs of patients who suffered from severe Covid and pneumonia, are showing signs of healing within 3-6 months, according a new study published by doctors from a city hospital. “We found that in the maximum number of patients, the lung function continues to get better,” said the study’s main author, pulmonologist Dr Sumeet Singhania from Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, Andheri. The initial findings of the long-running study were recently published in Lung India Journal. The team began the study mainly because of the mass neurosis among patients about Covid destroying their lungs. “But we found the majority of these patients, by the end of three months, showed very good improvement in the lungs, both structurally and functionally,” said Dr Singhania. Each patient’s lung function test and CT scan were performed. While the Lung India study only has results from 42 patients who were treated with antiviral remdesivir and steroids, the medical team has since completed the study on over 300 patients, some of whom were followed for a year now. Most of these 42 patients admitted to the hospital for Covid had severe pneumonia. The study also focused on a debate within the medical community on whether to start Covid patients with severe lung involvement on anti-fibrotic medicines. Anti-fibrotic agents are meant for patients with idiopathic lung fibrosis in order to slow down the scarring of lungs. Dr Lancelot Pinto, who is attached to Hinduja Hospital in Mahim and not connected to this study, told TOI that discharge papers of many Covid-19 patients would show they were put on anti-fibrotic medication. “The medication is unnecessary and I haven’t prescribed it to a single Covid-19 patient in the last 16 months,” he said. The Kokilaben Hospital study underlines the same thought process. “Our study shows that not each and everyone who is admitted to hospital for Covid infection needs to be started on anti-fibrotic drugs,” said Dr Singhania. Anti-fibrotic medication, by their own definition, are meant to arrest lung scarring or damage. “They cannot reverse the scarring. So where is the proof that it helps Covid patients with lung scarring,” asked Dr Pinto. Dr Singhania said that even in select Covid patients with significant lung scarring improved over a period of time. “The study reveals that Covid-19 pneumonia does not induce a progressive fibrotic pathway in the lungs, at least at three months of follow-up,” said the Lung India study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/despite-severe-covid-patients-lungs-heal-in-over-3-mths-in-mumbai-study/articleshow/84536988.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Hope for boost in vaccine drive after supply push||KOLKATA: The week ended on a slow note across vaccination centres of Kolkata with the city clocking just 4,822 doses on Sunday, even as Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) centres and those at several private and government hospitals remained shut. It could rise significantly this week, though, with most hospitals and civic centres receiving fresh supplies last week. Last week has already seen a major spurt in the number of inoculations with several private hospitals — which had applied for vaccines through the Co-Win portal under the new procurement system — and KMC centres receiving a fresh supply. KMC centres received an augmented supply of vaccines for four days in a row last week. According to a KMC health department official, allocation for each CVC never dipped below 200 doses on an average for four days — Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. This week holds promise of a steady administration of doses without a dip in numbers. KMC officials believe that there won’t be dearth of vaccines for the clinics at least on Monday and Tuesday, going by the existing stock. There are 195 CVCs which are located across 144 KMC wards. This apart, the KMC runs mega vaccination centres from city’s auditoriums, ceremonial houses, theatre halls and academic institutes. The number of doses dropped across most private hospitals even as others kept their CVCs closed. While some CVCs, like at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences and Peerless, remained shut on Sunday, both have received fresh stock and plan to step up the drive from Monday. “We have received our stock of 35,000 doses of Covishield on Saturday. We did not run our CVC on Sunday. We plan to start in-house from tomorrow,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Peerless Hospital, too, has received a fresh supply and plans to vaccinate at least 600 a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hope-for-boost-in-vaccine-drive-after-supply-push/articleshow/84532627.cms||Saikat Ray

My father wanted to hire a car but they were charging exorbitant rates and so we decided to come to Jadavpur the previous day and spend the night at a relative’s place just to stay close to the exam centre. Around 10am, my cousin drove me to the centre on a bike. Had things been smooth, we would have come by train. But we didn’t want to take any risk with the exam. I had prepared for so many years to be able to write the WBJEE. I couldn’t afford to take chances. My father, too, had come with me from Kalna and stayed the night over. My exam went well and we rushed to Howrah station to catch the staff special train at 6.10pm to reach home.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet 60% mafia, need non-Jat CM: Shamsher Singh Dullo to Sonia Gandhi||CHANDIGARH: Claiming that 60% of the Punjab Congress MLAs and some ministers were part of the drug, land, or mining mafia, party’s Rajya Sabha member Shamsher Singh Dullo also wrote to party president Sonia Gandhi that the posts of chief minister and state Congress president should stop going to Jats. Dullo told TOI: "I had asked for an appointment with the AICC president but she asked me to explain over telephone. I did that but I also sent her a letter." Dullo, who had attended the party MPs’ meeting in Delhi on Sunday at the house of another Rajya Sabha member, Partap Singh Bajwa, denied that the MPs had passed any resolution against the appointment of Navjot Singh Sidhu as Punjab Congress president. He said: "But we asked the AICC president to hear us before making the choice. Except Ambika Soni, all other 10 Punjab Congress MPs were present." His letter reads: "The present Punjab cabinet isn’t of the Gandhi-Nehru culture but of the drug, mining, liquor, land, and sand mafia. About 60% of the present MLAs and some ministers are into some scam directly or through their families. They have the ruler’s patronisation." The MP wrote that to send out a clear message to Punjab’s public that the Congress wasn’t with the mafia, it should let the Scheduled Castes, Backward Classes, Hindus, Muslims, and Christians take the top party posts on rotation. "Present Congress Legislative Party (CLP) is dominated by Jats, mostly defectors who enjoy 80% powers despite being just 14% of the population. The CM, state Congress president, Youth Congress chief, and two AICC secretaries are all Jats. The SCs/OBCs and minorities, a vote bank of the Congress, have no representation." Dullo wrote that no SC leader had ever become Punjab CM, "although three Hindu leaders—Gopi Chand Bhargav, Bhim Sain Sachar, and Ram Kishan—were nominated CMs of joint Punjab". "After the creation of Punjabi Suba, only Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir, a Khatri, and Giani Zail Singh, an OBC, were nominated as CM by the Congress," he added. Calling for a clean-up in the party and Punjab cabinet, Dullo suggested to Sonia that if she appointed a Jat as state party president, then an SC should be the CM, or if the CM was retained, the state party president could be from the SCs, who are 41% of the state’s population."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-cabinet-60-mafia-need-non-jat-cm-dullo-to-sonia/articleshow/84536971.cms||Sanjeev Verma

The gazette notification issued by the centre finalising the jurisdiction of Godavari and Krishna River Management Boards will have an adverse impact on the interests of Telangana. “Water is a state subject, but now Telangana state can’t use a drop of water from the irrigation projects without getting the nod from the centre,” he said. Sukender Reddy termed it unfortunate that even Dindi and Musi projects, constructed during the Nizam’s rule, were also brought under the ambit of the Krishna River management Board in the notification issued by the Union Jal Shakti Ministry. “The central government should treat all the states equally, but here is a case where in it is showing discrimination against Telangana. Is all this because BJP has no political future in the state,” he asked. He added: “How can the Centre fix a six-month deadline to get the required permissions for irrigation projects taken up by the state government when applications submitted by the state government for permissions and environmental clearances for irrigation projects were kept pending by the Centre for years?” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-discriminating-against-t-in-river-water-allocation/articleshow/84536982.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The PWD officials said tunnelling work is complete and work will be taken up to install the staircase and fix the inner lighting and other technical issues. The authorities are also working on another subway at Dum Dum Park crossing, which will take a few months more than the Lake Town subway. Both underpasses will be about 68m long, 6.5m wide and 2.7m in height. The combined construction cost has been pegged at Rs 26 crore. “We are trying to open both subways as soon as possible. The one at Lake Town will open earlier,” said Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose. Both underpasses are being set up using advanced box-jacking technique. “No traffic restriction was required on VIP Road while tunnelling for the Lake Town subway as it was underground and led to minimal damage to the surface,” said an official. The long-term plan behind setting up the subways is to dismantle the old foot overbridge at Lake Town crossing to make way for a flyover from Dakshindari to Dum Dum Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/subway-at-lake-town-likely-to-be-ready-before-pujas/articleshow/84532645.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Sayyad, whose children have not attended any classes for almost a year now since he was unable to pay their fees, promptly investigated and contacted the passengers and the police before handing over the bag. “I have to pay Rs 15,000 each for both my children’s admission so that they can continue their studies. It has been almost a year and they have not attended any school. The autorickshaw is a rented one. My daughter keeps asking me when she will be able to resume studies and I have no answer,” Sayyad, who lives in Mithanagar area of Kondhwa, told TOI. Sayyad said he had taken three passengers from the same family from Wagholi and had dropped them at the Pune station in the morning hours. “I used to make around Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 each day but after the second wave, business is slow. The closure of shops after 4pm has impacted our business and I hardly make Rs 200 to Rs 250 a day. I dropped the family off at Pune station and then took another passenger from Poolgate to Kondhwa after which I came home for lunch. As I got ready for my trips for the afternoon, I noticed the bag kept in the luggage space of the autorickshaw. I opened it to see if I could find a contact number,” Sayyad told TOI. He found gold jewellery inside it and Rs 5,000 in cash. “I also found the bill of the jewellery store and a number on which I called. The one answering the phone turned out to be a relative of the passengers. After a while, I got a call from one of the passengers. Then I contacted a senior member of my autorickshaw union who too contacted the passengers and we all met up at the Bund Garden police station where I handed them the bag in the presence of the cops so that no disputes arise,” he said. Sayyad said he could never think of keeping the forgotten bag “It did not belong to me and I realized the anxiety the rightful owners must have been in. I won’t keep anything that does not belong to me even when I am facing problems While my children’s education is a concern, all I could think of at that time was a way to return the bag,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rickshaw-driver-with-no-money-to-pay-fees-returns-bag-with-gold-cash/articleshow/84535078.cms||Joy Sengupta

The motley group of residents, including women and children said they were shocked after knowing that around 431 trees, including a few that are over 50 years old will be transplanted elsewhere while a few will be axed to widen the existing Kolshet road. This displacement of the green cover from the stretch without any public hearing irked the locals who staged an impromptu signature campaign seeking support from locals and nature lovers on Sunday morning. Residents said the entire roughly 1.5km-long stretch has one of the densest green cover in the city and also has a rare tree Urvashi (Amhersia nobilis) of Burmese origin, which is possibly the only one in the entire city. The residents said that though the tree is not scheduled to be displaced, it still is in danger due to construction works. “We were told the corporation was planning to cut and transplant around 431 trees for widening of Kolshet road. The plan is disastrous and we are demanding modification to safeguard the trees,” said Poornima Kagal, a participant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/thane-residents-stage-chipko-protest-to-save-over-400-trees-in-mumbai/articleshow/84537701.cms||Manoj Badgeri

All support structures, including beams and pier walls, are being repaired to remove the corroded portions,” said a KMDA official. Officials said the piers of the 60-year-old bridge were badly corroded. “As of now, the bridge’s upper structure is going through an overhaul as a short-term measure. Eventually, it may have to be reconstructed as the existing structure might not be able to continue taking extra vehicle load. The objective of the ongoing repair work is to strengthen the bridge for at least the next few years, till the reconstruction plan can be made,” said a bridge expert. Repair work on a span of the Bypass-bound flank of Ultadanga flyover is also almost complete and KMDA plans to conduct post-repair load tests within the next few weekends. “The grouting and the gap-filling have been done and the whitewash work is on,” said a KMDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bridge-repairs-at-halfway-point/articleshow/84532662.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Pune||Pune: 12 men land in trouble for holding bullock cart race||PUNE: The Bharati Vidyapeeth police on Saturday arrested 12 men on the charge of organising a bullock cart race illegally at Gujarwadi near Katraj and pushing a police constable who attempted to prevent the race. The arrested men are from Gujarwadi, Kondhwa, Warje, Bhor, Raigad, Velhe, Urali Kanchan and other areas, police said. The bullock cart race was organised at the foot of a hill located between Bopdev and Katraj ghats at 9am on Saturday. Sub-inspector Nitin Shinde of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station said, “The two main organisers, Santosh Nanaware (44) of Kondhwa and Rahul Chaudhary (34) of Warje, are among the arrested men. They do not bet on the races. They do it as a passion and a hobby. Another arrested man, Pandharinath Jagan Phadke, (55), of Panvel, is a prominent name in bullock cart racing. He uploads videos of bullock cart races on different social networking sites. All the men are from business families and are farmers.” After receiving a call, police constable Ravindra Chippa and his colleague reached the spot around 10.30am. The two policemen ordered the organisers to stop the race but they did not pay any heed to them. Despite warning, they raced a bullock cart away from the spot. “They had created a small racing track,” Shinde said. The arrested men then started arguing with the policemen and pushed Chippa away. The police said around 60 to 70 persons had gathered at the spot. Police said the men were torturing the bullocks during the race. Police said that the men gathered in large numbers at the spot to see the race defying the orders of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) preventing the gathering of people in the wake of Covid infection. Gujarwadi-Nimbalkarwadi villages were recently merged in the PMC limits. Police registered the case under the provisions of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and also invoked sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), 270 (whoever malignantly does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting) and 149 (common object) of The Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/12-held-on-charge-of-organising-bullock-cart-race-near-katraj/articleshow/84535103.cms||---

Justice Mukta Gupta extended protection through the local police station and sought response from Delhi Police on a plea by the Hindu-Muslim couple. The plea submitted that they decided to run away from home to solemnise a civil marriage in Delhi after they faced opposition from their families. The couple has argued that they have the right to live and marry on their own accord, which has now been curtailed. They stated that they were scared of groups and individuals against the inter-religious marriage in their native place in Uttar Pradesh and claimed threat to their lives. Earlier this month, the couple had approached Delhi Police for the grant of a safe house. When it was not granted, the couple moved the high court. The petitioners told the court that the father of the girl is a politically influential person and they live in fear of some harm coming to the boy and his family. The couple urged the court to direct the authorities to provide a place for stay till there is a settlement with the girl’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/up-interfaith-couple-gets-interim-relief/articleshow/84568891.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Police arrest woman from Jamshedpur for robbing senior citizen in Pune||PUNE: The Faraskhana police on Thursday evening arrested 30-year-old Pinky Pariyal of Jamshedpur in Jharkhand on the charge of drugging and robbing an elderly woman of her valuables in Pune. A 72-year-old woman from Shaniwar Peth had lodged a complaint with the police on June 25 stating that a woman gave her a ‘pedha’ near a temple following which she grew dizzy. The woman then took her to Swargate in an autorickshaw where she robbed her of her gold ornaments worth over Rs1 lakh. A team comprising senior inspector Rajendra Landge, inspector Rajesh Tatkare, assistant inspector Manoj Abhang and others studied the CCTV footage obtained from the CCTVs located near the temple, Shivaji Road, Swargate and areas near the Pune railway station. The team also obtained footage from a CCTV camera located near a lodge at Pune railway station. The footage showed that the suspected woman was walking into the lodge. When the police checked the register of the lodge, her identity was revealed. Landge said, “Pariyal moves around temples. She keeps an eye on elderly women visiting the temples alone. She then approaches them and offers them ‘pedha’ laced with sedatives as ‘prasad’. Once the elderly women become dizzy, she robs their gold ornaments.” Pariyal has confessed to the police that she had committed the same crimes in Nashik, Shirdi and other important temple towns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-arrest-woman-from-jamshedpur-for-robbing-senior-citizen/articleshow/84535120.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Once crucial to water needs, Bel dam stands forgotten||PUNE: Through the chain-linked fence that lines the bridge over Ambil Odha near the Dandekar Bridge intersection, the Bel Dam looks sorry, almost an irritant for civic officials and the residents along the banks of the canal right next to it. Part of the right flank of the dam, built with heavy masonry, lies broken, and water gushes past it furiously. The chiseled-in slots for the sluice gates also lie empty, with water barely flowing through the channel at the foot of the dam. Rampant garbage dumping and sedimentation have nearly choked that part up but, the rest of the masonry that makes up the dam stands nearly without any major damage, in an imposing, curved structure that resembles the Bel fruit, which gives it the name. On either side, men assigned by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) are working furiously to firm up the canal’s banks. They don’t want a repeat of the flash floods in September 2019 that devastated communities, especially the tenements, along the Ambil Odha. On the day TOI visited the site, the PMC also carried out an anti-encroachment drive in an area just a few minutes down the stream from the dam, to clear up the canal’s channel. Dozens of people were rendered homeless. On the right flank, the men are just about finishing up the high concrete retaining walls that would protect the people living along. On the other flank, they are just about getting started, with an excavator and a drill working away. The banks, and the base of the dam, are littered with food packaging, and liquor bottles, suggesting that the place is quite the hive after sundown. Small groups of men from the nearby slum file in to the banks, chatting, sharing a smoke, and then leaving. In the middle of all this activity, the Bel Dam sits there, lonely and unattended. There is no plaque that marks the spot, nor is there an information board about the history of a piece of infrastructure that would have been crucial for a much smaller city more than three centuries ago. Information is also there in precious little amounts in the chronicles of the city, including in the exhaustive gazettes that the British administration wrote about the region detailing its lifestyle and infrastructure. All that the historians and conservation architects have gathered that it may have been built during the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, with most texts and accounts referring to the dam as being “Shivkaalin”- from the time of Shivaji. The Ambil Odha was later used by the Peshwas and the city’s administrators to build a water supply system for the old city using a network of subterranean canals, although it was later superseded by the British using a system of dams located further out from the city. “What well-known historians have often said is that a lot of the infrastructure in and around the Ambil Odha was built first by Dadaji Kondadeo, probably during the reign of Shivaji, when Pune was populated and expanded. The area where the Bel Dam exists was some way outside the city, and thus it made for an ideal place for a dam to store water for the city’s residents,” said Kiran Kalamdani, a conservation architect based in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/once-crucial-to-punes-water-supply-bel-dam-across-ambil-odha-stands-forgotten/articleshow/84535172.cms||---

This could also push up the medical oxygen requirement from 2,000MT to 4,000 MT, said Tope, who is in Jalna at the moment. He said crowding should be avoided and no permissions should be given for public functions. The first wave in Maharashtra affected 20 lakh people while the second wave hit 40 lakh people. “Experts fear the third wave could infect 60 lakh, so we should be ready to check it,” he said. Meanwhile, after the daily Covid tally hovering between 7,000 and 8,500 for the past 10 days, the state registered 9,000 cases and 180 deaths on Sunday.

The gang offloaded the cars at various ports of the country. DRI had last week busted arrested three persons and seized six high-end cars each worth more than Rs 1 crore. The gang used diplomatic privileges and imported these cars and evaded huge amounts of duty. During the probe, DRI has learnt that the gang has imported around 50 high end cars in the last five years and have also found links of the absconding suspects with 2008 investigations in which the DRI had seized 36 cars that were fraudulently imported from foreign shores. The investigation has suggested that one Abdul Rahman from Dubai is believed to be the kingpin of the racket. The agency is verifying whether he is the same person arrested in the earlier scam. “We have identified more than 20 cars smuggled by these gangs. They forged diplomatic documents of various countries to import vehicles. We are exploring money possibly transferred through hawala channels,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dri-smuggling-gang-brought-in-50-high-end-cars-in-5-years-in-mumbai/articleshow/84537720.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Delhi||Delhi: Sarojini Nagar traders may down shutters over Covid curbs||NEW DELHI: The Sarojini Nagar export market, a 200-shop section within the main market area, has been closed due to violations of Covid-19 norms. Traders in the entire area said they would meet the authorities on Monday and all sections would down shutters indefinitely from Tuesday if their demands were not met. According to a government order issued on Saturday, the export market will remain closed from Sunday till further orders. The order issued by the sub-divisional magistrate of Vasant Vihar said an inspection was carried out on July 17 at 5.30pm during which it was found that the market was “extremely crowded, with Covid norms being grossly violated and no social distancing being followed at all”. The administration has also stated that despite several directions for ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour, the market associations at Sarojini Nagar have not complied with these orders. Many markets in the capital, such as Laxmi Nagar, Karol Bagh Gaffar and Lajpat Nagar, had been temporarily closed in the past few weeks for overcrowding and violation of other Covid-19 norms. In a meeting of all market associations at Sarojini Nagar on Sunday, it was decided that a representation would be made to the authorities on Monday for opening the export market and all markets, including the main section, Babu market and mini-market, would close in protest from Tuesday if their demands were not met. Traders attribute violation of social distancing norms to illegal hawkers and street vendors. Ashok Randhawa, who heads the market association in the mini-market, said shopkeepers could ensure social distancing norms only inside the shops and the administration should do the same in open areas. “There are thousands of street vendors and small goods sellers on roads who are causing crowding, but they are not being stopped,” Randhawa said. A meeting of all stakeholders of the market was held on July 9 to rectify the situation. It was decided that to restrict the entry of hawkers and regulate the crowd in the Sarojini Nagar market, passes will be issued by the market associations and authorised vendors to their members and employees and police will implement access control at all five entry points once the ID process is complete. More civil defence personnel were also to be deployed. “The ID process is underway, but it will take some time to issue more than 4,500 cards,” Randhawa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sarojini-traders-may-down-shutters-over-covid-curbs/articleshow/84532999.cms||Paras Singh
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Businessmen meet new steel minister, demand solution to their problems||LUDHIANA: A delegation of city businessmen led by furnace industry representatives met the new Union minister of steel, Ramchandra Prasad Singh at his office in New Delhi recently. The businessmen held a brief discussion with the minister over the issues being faced by the industry especially the factories located in Punjab. The major point of discussion in the meeting was the setting up of a steel regulatory authority, which should monitor rates of steel raw material and take action against the persons involved in artificial hike in the rates of steel. K K Garg, president of Induction Furnace Association of North India (IFANI), who was leading the delegation said, “We met the Union steel minister Ramchandra Prasad Singh today along with welcoming him for assuming the charge of the ministry, we also discussed the problems being faced by businessmen, specially those belonging to the secondary steel sector. We also apprised him about the issue of rising prices of steel raw material in the country and other hardships being faced by industrialists like increasing rates of power, shortage of industrial grade oxygen gas and dropping sales. The minister gave us a patient hearing and also assured that our problems will be considered by him and after discussing with the officials concerned the solutions too will be provided at the earliest.” Meanwhile, city businessmen are of the view that steel minister should fulfil their long pending demand of forming a steel prices regulators in the country. Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, said, “It is our request to the new Union minister for steel that the first and foremost step he should take for the welfare of industry is to setup a steel prices regulator to keep a check on the rates of steel, which are being artificially inflated by some entities who for their greed are hurting the micro small and medium enterprises (MSME). The regulator must also have the powers to take strict action against the steel producer, distributor, middle man and everyone who is engaged in the sale and purchase of the steel raw material, as this is the only way the situation can be countered.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-meet-new-steel-minister-demand-solution-to-their-problems/articleshow/84537075.cms||---

They also demanded the civic body to clear the channel to ensure sewage water is not stagnating.A large quantity of silt was accumulated in the drainage channel and was recently cleared by the corporation. But instead of clearing the silt, it was left behind. With the city witnessing intermittent rains, the silt has fallen down into the channel, blocking the sewage water from running.Sagaya Rani, a resident said: “With the running water blocked in the channel, mosquito breeding has increased. We could not sleep in the houses due to the mosquito menace. Officials should clear the channel and remove the silt.”G Vijaya, another resident said that children are the most affected due to the swarming mosquitoes as they could not sleep peacefully. They often fall asleep while they attend online classes due to lack of sleep.“We have to keep the windows and doors closed all the time to keep away from the mosquito. But even then, mosquitoes enter the house and create nuisance. We are scared as various diseases caused by mosquitoes are spreading fast,” she said.The residents also urged the authorities concerned to close the channel using cement slabs, which were damaged during the recent cleaning activity. They urged officials to create awareness among all the residents on the problems of dumping garbage into the channel. Drainage channel gets blocked due to the indiscriminate dumping of waste into it, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/residents-of-new-dro-colony-urge-to-clear-silt-from-drainage-channel/articleshow/84456386.cms||---

The authorities will approximately spend Rs 30 lakh on this project. This time, the PWD has increased the height of the bridge keeping in mind the rainfall levels. “We are using cement hume pipes with steel slab to construct the bridge this time. Last week, the bridge collapsed following cloud burst and severe rainfall. Keeping in mind average rainfall of 1,200mm the height has been increased. One more layer of hume pipe is being laid to allow more water to flow underneath,” said Rahul More, executive engineer, PWD-Alibaug division. The work needs to be completed fast as this is the only main connecting road to the tourist hotspots, said a villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/kashid-collapse-pwd-starts-work-on-new-bridge-in-mumbai/articleshow/84537722.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Rides on special buses for Rs 10 gain popularity during the week||PUNE: The recently launched Punyadarsham buses of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML), which allows a full day ride at a one-time fare of Rs 10 is a hit among commuters. The last 10 days since buses were started witnessed close more than one lakh passengers and an income of more than Rs 5 lakh. “The service, with a total of 50 air-conditioned mid-sized buses started on July 9 and the response has been positive. Between July 9 to July 17, close to 1.13 lakh passengers have used the buses with the PMPML witnessing a revenue of more than Rs. 5.63 lakh. Almost all the buses have a good number of commuters and at times it is becoming tough to manage the crowd as we cannot carry more than half the capacity due to social distancing norms,” a PMPML official told TOI. These buses are presently plying on nine routes covering areas between Deccan Gymkhana and Pulgate, Swargate and Shivajinagar and Swargate and Pune station. The everyday passenger traffic in all PMPML buses is around 4 lakh. “Passengers getting into these buses need to have at least one identity card like Aadhaar, driving licence, voter identity card or some such card. Since the passengers can use just one ticket costing Rs 10 to move on these buses on different routes throughout the day, while the conductor gives the ticket, the last four digits of the identity card is written on the ticket so that no one else can use it. We don’t think it is a hassle for passengers in any way and the increasing number of passengers shows that,” the PMPML official said. He said based on the success of the service, they will contemplate using more of their mid-sized diesel buses for similar services in other areas. “The PMPML has 233 mid-sized diesel buses which can be put to use for similar services in other parts of the city. We already have the ATAL (Aligning transit on all lanes) bus service which provides a similar service which is currently active in many areas,” the official said. Commuters said while they were pleased with the service, caution was necessary. “Such plans could really change the perception of people towards PMPML and bring in new riders. However, the crowding in these buses during the present times needs to be addressed to,” Gaurav Kale, a regular commuter, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punyadarsham-buses-for-rs-10-rides-a-big-draw/articleshow/84535262.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Torrent of mud & debris flattens homes on hills||MUMBAI: Nineteen people died and five were seriously injured in Bharat Nagar slum at Mahul after a landslide on a hill abutting the BARC complex and a subsequent flash flood around 12.30 am on Sunday. Even 20 hours later, rescuers were trying to pull out four people feared still trapped in the rubble. Three families lost four members each. The incident has again brought to the fore the issue of illegal constructions along retaining walls of establishments in the city. The deceased included 11 women and eight men. Five were minors, including two in their teens, a two-year-old, a four-year-old, and a ten-year-old. Locals said that amidst heavy rain, water and muck gushed into the homes of nearly 200 families. The force swept way portions of the retaining wall at three locations, and the hillside portions of nearly 50 brick-and-mortar hutments collapsed under the debris. “It was as if all hell had broken loose. People had just gone to bed after dinner. Many must have died in their sleep,” said an eyewitness. Most of the hutment dwellers in the area are daily wagers, plumbers, carpenters, domestic maids and people working odd jobs. Reacting to allegations that the fire brigade and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) reached the spot late, senior fire brigade officials said they got the first call at 1.09 am and at 2.15 am the first fire tender had started rescue operations. “After a higher level alert call at 4.38 am, fire brigade and NDRF operations started in full swing,” an official said. NDRF officials denied rumours of deaths due to electrocution at the site. Chembur and surrounding areas got extremely heavy rainfall, 241 mm, between 11 am on Saturday and 7 am on Sunday. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray termed it a “mini cloudburst”. Questions are being raised as to how the hillside hutments, which came up in 1999, were allowed to abut a wall. BMC norms specify a minimum distance between retaining walls and dwellings. “Why was this norm not followed?” asked BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, who visited the spot. “The place is so risky that another incident can happen anytime in case of heavy rains if existing huts are not shifted.” Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced ex-gratia payment of Rs 5 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased person and free medical treatment for the injured. Thackeray took stock of rescue and relief operations in the presence of municipal commissioner I S Chahal and asked for strong coordination between NDRF, fire brigade and police. He said he wanted the administration to be alert amid heavy rain forecasts. The CM has asked municipal authorities to ensure rainwater drainage from low-lying areas, to keep roads free from water-logging and ensure the restoration of local train services at the earliest. He has also said that medical facilities at jumbo Covid centres should not get affected due to rain. At Mahul, those who escaped recounted their ordeal. Rukhsana Khan, whose home was damaged in the incident, said her six-year-old son was playing close to the door but since the door was closed, the debris did not hit him. Laxmi Jogdandkar, who lives on the first floor, said he and his family were saved from strong rainwater currents because they were not at ground-floor level.

---||Ranchi||State govt launches ‘Mission Kartavya’ to fight 3rd wave||Ranchi: The state government has issued detailed guidelines to all deputy commissioners (DC) of 24 districts for effective management of the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly the predicted third wave, by engaging NGOs and civil society organisations (CSOs). For the purpose, the government has asked the 24 districts to form “GO-CSO Coordinating Committees” for the operation titled “Mission Kartavya” to fight the pandemic. In a letter sent to the DCs, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said the committees of the state and the civil society organisations formed last year under the aegis of Unicef as its nodal agency performed well in preventing the spread of the pandemic and they should be rejuvenated with a clear mandate. He said, “The predicted third wave is likely to be different from the previous waves and accordingly, the committees should be rejuvenated to carry out functions and regular monitoring.” Objectives of ‘Mission Kartavya’ include identifying Covid patients and linking them to government facilities besides providing them psychological and social support. “The committees would also provide the correct information about the health facilities and link affected families with social security schemes of the government,” the letter reads. The DCs have been named as the district level nodal officer for the committees. Out of the reputed and well-managed CSOs functional in a district, one would be selected as the mother CSO responsible for coordinating with the DC office and other CSOs working on the ground. The mother CSO would be responsible for filing a daily report on a format shared by the nodal agency — Unicef. Singh said the committees would be activated with immediate effect and the DCs would be holding their meetings every 15th day. “The minutes of the meeting from every district should be sent to missionkartavya2021@gmail.com and the same would be shared with the WhatsApp group of the district coordination committee by the mother CSO of the district concerned,” he said. In further overhaul in the internal structure of the committees, the letter said each committee would comprise the district programme manager (DPM), the district programme coordinator of the health department, the district child protection officer, the Childline officer, the DPM of Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society (JSLPS), the district resource person of the state social audit unit, the district disaster management officer, the district nodal agency and the inter-agency group. The letter also asked the NGOs and CSOs to form district support centres for mobilization of resources and to create awareness, identify migrant labourers and extend help to the needy. The entire exercises would be supported by the department’s IEC funds and internal resources of Jharkhand CSO Forum, JSLPS and Social Audit Units besides funds from Unicef.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-govt-launches-mission-kartavya-to-fight-3rd-wave/articleshow/84532436.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Tirkey, Yadav face ‘identity crisis’ after joining Congress||Ranchi: Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey and Poriyahat’s legislator Pradeep Yadav, who joined the Congress party soon after the 2019 assembly polls, are going through an ‘identity crisis’ even though it’s been months since they joined the grand old party. Both were part of the now defunct JVM-P but when party president Babulal Marandi merged it with BJP, the duo joined Congress, resulting in Marandi claiming that JVM-P merged with the saffron party while Tirkey and Yadav asserting that the JVM (P)-BJP merger is invalid since with them crossing over to the Congress camp, JVM-P has merged with the grand old party. While the issue concerning both the mergers is currently pending in Jharkhand Assembly speaker Rabindranath Mahto’s court, Tirkey and Yadav are getting impatient over the ‘unrecognized Congressmen’ tag, something which they said is posing a problem for them when they meet people in their respective constituencies. “Both Yadav and I are senior leaders with a huge mass support base and non-recognition will not be good for our political career,” Tirkey said. Yadav, on the other hand, while giving an example of the ‘identity crisis’, said, “In the assembly, we sit separately from Congress MLAs and we can’t grow within the party since we aren’t recognised as Congressmen.” One of the defectors preferring anonymity said the delay in the validation of their identity is making them feel uncomfortable in Congress. “What did we get after joining the party?” he said. Yadav and Tirkey, who are currently in Delhi, had even met Congress’s Jharkhand affairs in-charge RPN Singh in this regard two days ago. Tirkey said, “While we discussed several issues concerning the party and the state government’s work, the major issue discussed was the validation of our merger with Congress. How long will this case go on? There can be only two possibilities — either our merger is valid or invalid.” He added, “I have even offered to resign as an MLA and contest in a bypoll on a Congress ticket.” Singh is learnt to have told him to wait for a month for a solution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tirkey-yadav-face-identity-crisis-after-joining-congress/articleshow/84532571.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Shortage of vaccine derails jab drive again||Ranchi: Several districts, including Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Bokaro, are likely to halt the Covid-19 vaccination drive again from Monday because of inadequate stocks. Ruling parties in the state on Sunday attacked the Union government over the issue and said without a smooth supply of the life-saving drugs and vaccines, scores of people are likely to fall victim to the predicted third wave of the pandemic. On Sunday, the Ranchi district could administer only 180 doses of Covishield at one session site (AG office) while the rest of the vaccination centres were shut. Ranchi civil surgeon Vinod Kumar said they have exhausted all 22,000 doses which they received a couple of days ago. “If we get vaccines by tonight (Sunday night), the drive will be held tomorrow or it will be shut in the whole of Ranchi. Ranchi has about 22 lakh population eligible for vaccination for which we require 44 lakh doses. So far, just about 25% of the population, which is about seven lakh, got both the doses,” he told TOI. In Jamshedpur, the district administration has already announced the closure of all session sites till July 21, the day when the state health department is expected to receive a fresh consignment of doses. An official of the state health department dealing with the stocks said, “According to the schedule, we are expecting 2,13,340 doses of Covishield and 31,130 Covaxin on July 21.” The department said as of Sunday evening, only 89,897 doses are available. “The actual figures would be even less when Sunday’s vaccination figures come by night. The state government has set a target of vaccinating 1,00,400 people per day but going by the vaccine availability, we have stocks only for 0.9 days. In other words, the stocks aren’t even enough to continue the drive tomorrow,” the official explained. On Saturday, as many as 79,233 doses were administered in the state of which 57,579 were first doses and the rest second doses, the department’s vaccination bulletin had said. In terms of cumulative coverage, 67,95,819 persons have received their first dose and 14,84,426 got both the jabs, so far. Reacting to the crisis, state health minister Banna Gupta, who is currently in Delhi, blamed the Union government for the situation. “We have been constantly facing bias in the allocation of the vaccine by the central government compared to other states which are getting a good number of doses regularly,” he told reporters there. In Ranchi, his party, Congress, which is part of the ruling alliance, too, attacked the Centre over the issue. Party spokesperson Alok Dubey said, “At a time when the pace of vaccination is required to be intensified, we are routinely facing hurdles while conducting the inoculation drive. The Jharkhand government has the capacity of quickly vaccinating its people at the rate of over one lakh people daily provided we are given the stock by the Centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/shortage-of-vaccine-derails-jab-drive-again/articleshow/84532929.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Nagpur||Agri dept field offices may again recommend ban on five pesticides||Nagpur: With the pesticide spraying season set to start by month end, field offices of the state’s agriculture department are planning to again recommend a ban on the use of the five formulations which were found to be used by victims of inhalation deaths. In 2017, the state saw a number of deaths due accidental inhalation of pesticides. Majority of the victims were farm labourers. Out of the around 80 deaths in 2017, Yavatmal had seen the highest toll. The deaths have continued even in the subsequent years. A week ago, 46-year-old Durvas Hazare, a farmer from Kinhi Dhanoli village of Nagpur’s Hingna tehsil, fell unconscious after spraying. He was admitted to Wardha’s Shalintai Meghe Hospital where he died after five days. “Hospitals in Vidarbha start receiving such cases as the spraying season starts,” said the doctor in charge. Dr SP Kalantri, the medical superintendent of Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS), also confirmed having come across a number accidental inhalation cases. Such patients are a regular scene in MGIMS, he said. Kalantri had also tweeted a picture of a farmer undergoing treatment as he wrote monocrotphos, a highly dangerous pesticide, is easily available in India though it is banned in 112 countries. Farmers commonly use it for suicides. Monocrotophos is one of the five pesticides found in inhalation cases. Gearing up for the season, the district administration in Yavatmal is also holding medical seminars to discuss similarities between symptoms of Covid and pesticide inhalation. In both the cases, patients need oxygen support. After the deaths in 2017, five pesticide formulations—profefonos-cypermthrine, monocrotophos, profenil-imidachlopr, asataf and difenthiron have been banned from time to time by the state government. The ban, however, stays for two months. A permanent ban has to come from the Centre. A senior agriculture department in Yavatmal said soon a fresh recommendation may be sent for banning the five formulations to prevent accidents. Accidental inhalation of pesticide fumes during spraying leads to contact poisoning. This can also lead to deaths of farmers and farm hands being admitted to hospital for treatment. Many also survive as it is treatable. Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalban Mission (VNSSM), a state government task force on agrarian crisis, said that those who have recovered from Covid are also being insisted to not take up pesticide spraying. “There is already a protocol that persons taking up spraying work should have a medial fitness certificate first. As it includes lung functioning as a parameter, those having recovered from Covid would naturally not qualify for presitice spraying. The onus would be on the medical pracitioners giving the certificate to ascertain the facts,” said Tiwari. Despite the ban, farmers prefer the five formulations, especially monocrotophos, because its easily available. The farm input dealers also push the same formulations, said sources. Surendra Kothari, director of an agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC), at Hinganghat in Wardha, said farmers general go by what dealers recommend. They generally push the five formulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/agri-dept-field-offices-may-again-recommend-ban-on-five-pesticides/articleshow/84533707.cms||Shishir Arya

Furtado said the tenders have been issued only because Smart City funds are about to lapse and that neither has any expert been consulted nor the technical aspect of the laying of the network been taken into account. The former mayor said the funds were available for years and alleged inaction on the part of the Panaji MLA. “Has any proper scientific study been done keeping the topography, pressure, smooth flow, etc, in mind? Even more shocking is the Rs 120 crore tender issued for the construction of smart roads for Panaji. Normally the sewerage network is first completed (this will take at least five years and in Taleigao it is still going on for 10 years) after which the roads are taken up,” Furtado said. “Now without a proper study a faulty sewerage network is being imposed on Panaji just to make sure the funds do not lapse,” he said. The roads he said are likely to be dug up again for the faulty sewerage system and then again re-done and then again dug up to repair the faulty sewerage system and then again redone wasting at least Rs 350 crore of precious public funds in the process are wasted. “This is a massive scam in the making just to raise funds for the upcoming assembly polls which are expected to be a very tough competition for the BJP defector run government,” Furtado said. The former mayor also alleged another case of personal development instead of state’s development. Meanwhile, GFP, insisting that the tender for a parallel sewerage network in the state capital is flawed and will lead to cost overruns, has written to the state government demanding the cancellation of the tender. GFP has warned that if PWD goes ahead with the project, it would approach the high court and get it stopped. “Even more shocking is the Rs 120 crore tender issued for the construction of smart roads for Panaji. Normally the sewerage network is first completed (this will take at least five years and in Taleigao it is still going on for 10 years) after which the roads are taken up,” Furtado said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/furtado-alleges-scam-behind-citys-sewerage-work/articleshow/84535899.cms||---

The annual festival, which will be celebrated on Wednesday, comes as a bonanza for these religious institutes where hundreds of kids are enrolled from different parts of the country. The kids belong to poor families who are unable to sustain them, and send them for Islamic studies. The madrassas don't have their own income but depend on donations and sponsorships from the community and organizations. Ahead of Eid, madrassas are circulating messages appealing to community members to extend as much financial help as possible. Jamiat Ulema Nagpur member Zaid Ansari feels one of the reasons for low income during Eid is fewer ‘qurbanis’ by members. “Loss of job and business has affected many, who would otherwise have offered at least two or three goats during Eid. But if people can afford costly gadgets and lifestyle, they must not take undue advantage of skipping the qurbani,” he said. Because of convenience, many people are preferring ‘hisse wali qurbani’, where a big animal (buffalo) is slaughtered and distributed among the needy. Ansari said the offerings were fewer during Ramazan Eid, two months back, too. Ateeque Qureshi, chief patron of Mominpura Bakra Vyapari Association, said, “The supply of livestock is not proper. This has increased the prices. But customers are also missing.” Maulana Mohamaad Zuhair, secretary, Madrassa Ansar Taleem-ul-Quran Ansar Nagar, Mominpura, said the institutes incur around Rs22 lakh-95 lakh expenditure on a number of things like salaries, utility bills, food for students and their clothing. “The animal hide is not fetching good prices in market. So we appeal to members to donate Rs200, 500 or 1,000 as per their capacity,” said Zuhair, who is also secretary of Jamiat West Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-financial-crisis-madrassas-seek-cash-donations-on-eid/articleshow/84533766.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||India||No unauthorised surveillance: Government||NEW DELHI: The government on Sunday categorically denied any unauthorised surveillance saying official agencies have a well established protocol for interception, which includes sanction and supervision of highly ranked officials at the Centre and states for clearly stated reasons only in national interest. It said news reports on the use of Pegasus software and allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people has no concrete basis or truth. “In the past, similar claims were made regarding the use of Pegasus on WhatsApp by India. Those reports also had no factual basis and were categorically denied by all parties, including WhatsApp in the Indian Supreme Court,” said a government statement reproducing its response to queries by the media. Responding to allegations that its software was used to target the phones of politicians, journalists and officials, the Israel-based NSO group said it sold its products only to vetted governments. It also said the software was used for counter-terrorism surveillance. NSO Group said “it has reason to believe that the records of thousands of phone numbers that the Pegasus project’s media partners examined were not a list of targets of various governments, but part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. Rajendra Kumar, additional secretary in the IT ministry, said:“This news report, thus, also appears to be a similar fishing expedition, based on conjectures and exaggerations to malign the Indian democracy and institutions.” He said India is committed to protecting privacy of its citizens and recent digital media guidelines and a data protection law which is in the making, are steps in this direction. “Each case of interception, monitoring, and decryption is approved by the competent authority i.e. the Union home secretary. These powers are also available to the competent authority in the state governments as per IT Rules, 2009,” the official said. Kumar said India is a robust democracy that is “committed to ensuring the right to privacy to all its citizens as a fundamental right”. He added that commitment to free speech as a fundamental right is the cornerstone of India’s democratic system. The ministry said India has previously too responded to RTIs about the use of Pegasus, and emphasised that the answers are “itself sufficient to counter any malicious claims about the alleged association between the Government of India and Pegasus”. He said the allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-unauthorised-surveillance-government/articleshow/84538794.cms||---

In 2017, the two firms — Jamnadas Morarji & Morarji Tribhuvandas, Gondia, were part of the tendu collection in 11 units under the Gondia division. After the collection season, these firms filed six appeals for reduction of notified yield in 6 units on the ground that they could not collect produce to the extent of sanctioned notified yield due to adjoining units under community forest rights (CFR). The six units were under the jurisdiction of Saundad, Kohmara, Dongargaon, Shenda, Jamdi, Rengepar, Kanhalgaon, Parsodi, Chichgad, Piparkhadi and Kadikasa villages in Gondia district. The CCF, Nagpur, rejected all appeal cases in April 2018 as terms and conditions of the tender notice were violated. The firms further appealed to the APCCF (NTFP) in July 2018, which was also rejected on the ground that these firms bought CFR units adjoining to department units and collected more than double the notified yield by diverting tendu collection from department units. After the collection season of 2017, the firms claimed a reduction of notified yield by 1,843 standard bags and hence, demanded royalty of Rs 1.68 crore from the department. Whereas, these firms made an unauthorized agreement with CFR villages and paid more collection charges than the government-approved rates. Hence, all their appeals were rejected. As per the terms and conditions of the tender notice, before submitting the offer, the parties are advised to inspect the units for which offers are submitted. After submission of the offers, no complaint of whatsoever nature is entertained by the government. “The parties are also not entitled to claim any compensation whatsoever for any loss or damage that may be sustained by him on account of fire, rains, tempest, disease, pest, flood, drought or any other natural calamities or by reasons of any wrongful acts committed by any third party or for any other reason whatsoever,” said forest officials. However, after rejection of all the appeals, the firms appealed before the then forest minister Sanjay Rathod, who, after hearing the appeal in March 2020, passed an order after nine months in favour of these firms in December 2020. In January 2021, APCCF (NTFP) appealed to the minister to reconsider the order on the basis of actual facts as the order of the forest minister was based on old facts. However, a further decision in this regard is awaited from the state government. “If the government accepts the request of these firms to reduce royalty, there will be a huge loss resulting in depriving local villagers of their right to bonus, which runs into crores every year. This will defeat also the state policy for socio-economic development of poor tribals and set the wrong precedence,” said senior forest officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs1-68cr-tendu-royalty-cut-mulled-for-2-firms/articleshow/84533828.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||Goa: Actor’s car vandalised after posting anti-govt video||PONDA: Hours after the release of his social media post criticising the government over its one-time financial assistance to artistes left jobless due to the pandemic, well-known theatre personality and social media influencer, Rajdeep Naik’s car was vandalised on Saturday. The incident has evoked angry reactions. The car’s rear windshield was smashed while it was parked near his residence at Savoi Verem in Ponda taluka. Naik filed a police complaint on Sunday. On Saturday, through a video, Naik had demanded that the Rs 10,000, which the government had announced as one-time financial assistance for artistes, should be scrapped as it was an insult to the community. He said that artistes have been jobless since March 2020 and that no effort had been made by the government to support them. “Will they be able to sustain their families on the meagre OTS amount?” said Naik, who has gained popularity for the satirical videos he posts on social issues. In the video, he has said that a representation signed by more than 150 artistes had been submitted to the minister for art and culture seeking some kind of relief. Even temporary jobs of any type were sought, Naik said. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat demanded strict action against the culprits. “Attack on car of popular Goan actor Rajdeep Naik who criticised #BJP4Goa government’s apathy to support the artist community is a direct reflection of undeclared emergency imposed in Goa to suppress the Voice of Dissent. I demand @DGP-Goa must act & take strict action on attackers,” he tweeted Condemning the “dastardly attack”, GFP chief Vijai Sardesai tweeted, “Goons are let loose to intimidate and silence anyone who questions @BJP4Goa’s arrogance and autocracy.

GFP president Vijai Sardesai has asked Naik to promote MPT as a cruise terminal instead. Sardesai has also requested Naik to advise MPT authorities to put a “full stop to their expansionary motives” and concentrate on making MPT an international cruise port for tourism. “As minister for ports you can take immediate steps to halt the development of Mormugao port as a coal transportation hub and act to convert it into a tourism port as it has the potential to become one of the most preferred cruise destinations of the world,” said Sardesai. He also said that after the closure of Goa’s mining sector tourism remains the only viable economic activity that provides direct and indirect employment for locals. “The end of tourism and fishing, which is a natural corollary to coal transportation, will bring on, not only environmental disaster to our Goem but also economic ruin to all Goemkars,” said Sardesai. GFP said that Goa is slowly being transformed into a coal transportation hub while MPT is using The Major Port Authorities Act 2021 to “gobble up” additional parts of the state’s coastline and riverine ecosystems. “All these laws and projects threaten to destroy our natural beauty and finish Goem as a tourist destination,” said Sardesai. He added that the state government has taken advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to speed up the coal transportation project which suggests that “big business lobbies” are given preference over local interests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-asks-shripad-to-stop-developing-mpt-as-a-coal-hub/articleshow/84535980.cms||---

Encouraging defections and promoting family raj will be their mission for the 2022 election. BJP wants to murder democracy and defy people’s mandate even in future,” Dias said. Questioning the silence of BJP office bearers on strengthening the anti-defection law, Dias said, “BJP has a majority in parliament and if their intentions are clear, the Modi government can amend the law in the coming session itself.” Accusing BJP of “launching various outfits” to divert people’s attention from core issues, Dias said, “These outfits are funded by the crony club of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Their ultimate agenda is to sell Goa to capitalists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-promoting-defections-family-raj/articleshow/84536004.cms||---
---||Goa||Citizens decry ‘illegal’ bungalow near Old Goa world heritage site||Panaji: Illegal activities at the world heritage site, lack of a master plan for proper development and authorities colluding to allow an illegal structure near monuments were flayed by speakers in a meeting at Old Goa on Sunday. The allegedly illegal under-construction bungalow on the river front, a few metres from the Largo de St Cajetan, a monument protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, has triggered protests. The meeting, which was preceded by a peaceful morcha near the site, was organised by some heritage lovers near St Cajetan’s church gate. Prajal Sakhardande of Goa Heritage Action Group said that all rules and regulations, including those of UNESCO and state and central governments, had been openly breached in allowing the illegal construction. Social activist Rama Kandkonkar alleged that centuries-old monuments at the world heritage site had been ignored in the coastal zone management plan, but the illegal structure at Old Goa and even a starred hotel in Tiswadi had been prominently shown in it. Fr Noel D’Costa, a Diocesan priest, alleged that illegal activities in Goa have resulted from lack of a master plan and non-demarcation of the heritage area in the old capital. He explained how various authorities had colluded in approving the structure, even misrepresenting facts before the court. Architect Taher Noronha alleged that permission given for repair of a small structure at the site had been misused. “It is a new construction,” he said. Aruna Wagh, former MLA Vishnu Wagh’s wife, said that Old Goa, as the states’ only world heritage site, was synonymous with Goa’s identity and that politicians and others responsible for its destruction should consider the religious importance of the place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-decry-illegal-bungalow-near-old-goa-world-heritage-site/articleshow/84536029.cms||---

The hearing is likely to decide on the resumption of mining activities in the state. The mining companies had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. During the Portuguese era, the mining companies had been granted mining concessions, which were then converted into mining leases under the act. The special leave petition had stated that the Act should be made applicable from 1987, instead of 1961. Under the MMDR Act mining companies had contented that they’re entitled to extend their leases to 2037.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sc-likely-to-hear-mining-case-on-tue/articleshow/84536067.cms||---

The proposed bridge will be built first and the old one will be replaced later,” D’Souza, who is also the vice-chairman of Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation, said. The foundation stone will be laid in a month and the new bridge is expected to be constructed by early 2022. This project, he said, will help decongest the area as the vehicular traffic has increased on the bridge and it becomes difficult to manage the traffic with the bridge being narrow. The bridge connects several villages including Aldona, Moira, Nachinola, Pomburpa, Salvador do Mundo, Socorro, Ucassaim and Bastora to Mapusa town. Mapusa is a commercial hub and many of these neighbouring villages depend on it for their daily requirements like groceries, fish, etc. The new bridge will not have a pillar constructed in the middle of the river, and hence, will not pose a threat to the flow of the river. D’Souza said that they would like to avoid any debris being dumped into the river, a problem that has affected the flow of the river during the highway construction. The river was recently inspected by both the Mapusa MLA and the chairperson of Mapusa Municipal Council Shubhangi Vaingankar along with all the stakeholders and government officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-bridge-to-join-existing-one-across-river-tar-mapusa-mla/articleshow/84536123.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: With no checks in place, mushroom sales hit new high||PANAJI/BICHOLIM: Last week, a Ponda resident took an early morning drive to Bondla forest sanctuary. Here he quickly gathered a sack full of ‘roen alami’ of which he made 50 leaf-wrapped parcels and sold each for Rs 1,000 at Ponda market. “All were sold in just one hour and he made a profit of Rs 50,000,” a conservationist who observed the transaction in the market said. “Which job gives you such income? It’s a lot of money in rural Goa,” he added. July to August is the ‘mushroom season’ in Goa and the forest delicacies command a steep price ranging from Rs 400 to 800 for roughly 25-30 mushrooms. Prices are fixed by the vendors and this year, they started from Rs 500-550. Most vendors are found on the roadside near the Karapur junction which is a popular point for mushroom sale. Traffic congestion is commonplace here owing to the number of people parking their vehicles to make their purchases. In Panaji, it is the footpath outside the high court for mushroom hawkers. “We cannot purchase mushrooms any more since we cannot afford these exorbitant rates,” said Pravin Gaonkar, a resident of Bicholim. The wild edible fungus are picked by the people of Padoshem, Kudchirem and other areas of rural Sattari and make for lucrative seasonal income for them. Vendor Vinayak Gaonkar from Kudchirem said that the mushroom yield this year was insufficient due to which the rates are high. In recent times conservationists and experts have raised an alarm over harvesting of wild mushrooms. Not only do they warn of harm to the forest ecology, but also the possible triggering of pandemic-like bio-disasters. “The sanctuaries’ staff have been instructed to keep a watch on collections of wild mushrooms and take action against violators. So far, there have been no incidents reported in sanctuary areas,” said deputy conservator of forests of wildlife division Jabestin Arulraj. However, a source from Bicholim said, “At Ponda or Kulan or Karapur nobody from the forest department even made an inquiry. Forget confiscation. This happens because people believe that these are not collected then they would go to waste.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-no-checks-in-place-mushroom-sales-hit-new-high/articleshow/84536161.cms||Nida Sayed

In fact, they delight the bird lovers here who rejoice that MacQueen Bustards have begun flocking the state in large numbers over the last five years. A study done by an ornithologist revealed that between 2016 and 2020, the bird was sighted 140 times in the state. “It is the highest number of sightings of the bird in Gujarat in the last two decades. Between 2011 and 2015, MacQueen Bustards were seen just 26 times in different parts of the state. There are two reasons behind the huge spurt in the sightings. One is that there is a spike in the number of birds flying into the state and the other is that Gujarat offers them an ideal environment,” Devratsinh Mori, who did the study, told TOI. “Also, the number of bird watchers who record their sightings has also gone up in the last few years. So, most sightings of the bustard are now recorded and hence the figures have gone up. It’s heartening news for the bird lovers in the state. I gathered the figures from the birders’ record of the sightings on a website and my own study,” Mori said. Most of MacQueen Bustards fly in Gujarat from Pakistan where they breed in some parts. They arrive in winters and fly away by March before the summers start. The last census of the birds was done way back in 2007 by the Bird Conservation Society. “After that, no state-wide census of this bird has happened,” Mori said. Mori said that these birds were earlier seen only in the Little Rann of Kutch and Greater Rann of Kutch. “But now they are spotted even in Jamnagar, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Amreli, Porbandar, Patan and near Dwarka. Though the number of sightings in these districts is small, it is significant as the bird is exploring areas in Gujarat other than Kutch,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/this-pakistani-frequent-flier-finds-neighbouring-guj-home-away-from-home/articleshow/84532291.cms||Tushar Tere

This was discussed at a recent meeting of NMC chaired by the Union health secretary. “There are presently 82,500 MBBS seats across the country and the government plans to take it to 1 lakh in a year’s time,” a government official said. There are nearly 540 medical colleges in the country that offer MBBS courses, 49% of which are government run and the rest self-financed and on public-private-partnership basis. “The process for adding new medical colleges and increasing seats for MBBS is presently on,” Dr Aruna Vanikar, president of the undergraduate medical education board of NMC, said. Sources in Gujarat medical education fraternity said Gujarat has 5,500-odd UG medical seats and is likely to get three more colleges.

On Sunday, the cops said that one of them is a nurse named Kali Sangada who stays in Santrampur town. “After inquiry, we also found out that the house where the video was shot belongs to Sangada. She hasn’t turned up at her house for the last 15 days. And, after the video went viral, Sangada has gone missing. We have formed teams to track her,” said P Bhoi, police inspector, Santrampur. The cops said that Sangada has been working at a private hospital in Santrampur for the last two decades. “We sent a team to her native place in Rajasthan but she wasn’t there either. We will track her soon. The other three women in the video will be identified once we nab Sangada,” Bhoi added. Bhoi said that the video is more than one-and-half-year old. “When we visited the house seen in the video, there was some additional construction in the backyard which shows that it’s an old video. We have recovered few abortion pills from the house,” Bhoi said. After the video went viral on Saturday, the Santrampur administration swung into action and started searching for the women seen in the video. Shot in the backyard of an old house, the video shows four women taking out parts of a foetus from an unidentified woman. The district health officials said that it was illegal to conduct such abortion. A police complaint was registered under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act on Saturday night by the health officials. The district women’s commission members too reached the spot and demanded strict action against the culprits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-seen-in-illegal-abortion-video-is-a-nurse/articleshow/84532368.cms||---

The municipal corporation, deputy commissioner’s office, estate office, Chandigarh Housing Board, health and industries departments — some of them have failed to build hospitals and nursing homes owing to multiple reasons — got a letter from Badnore asking for the overhaul. The private sector too found a mention. “At present, Chandigarh has health facilities in PGI , Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, but none in the private sector on a large-scale. We may explore multiple options to improve the health care facilities. This is all the more required during the critical situation of Covid-19 pandemic and the prospect of a third wave hitting the nation,” Badnore said in his letter, a copy of which is with TOI. Badnore suggested the 8.24 acre hospital site in IT Park can be auctioned. The Chandigarh Housing Board is the custodian of the land. Around 2.74 acre hospital site is in Manimajra too. The land belongs to UT. Nine nursing sites of the estate office are lying vacant, according to records. They are in key southern areas like sectors 33, 44, 46 and 51. Four sites are in Sector 51, two each in sectors 33 and 46, and one in Sector 44. “There is a dire need to dispose of earmarked sites. The authority and senior officers must concentrate on doing so either through auction or a bid or any other means,” recommended a senior UT official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ramp-up-health-infrastructure-chandigarh-administrator-v-p-singh-badnore-tells-6-departments/articleshow/84538938.cms||Deepak Yadav

Pointing that cases are rising in Kerala even as the second wave is on the decline throughout the country, IMA has warned that if the state goes ahead with easing lockdown measures, it will be constrained to approach the SC. After the proactive call of the PM to stop revenge tourism and not to invite the third wave by mass gatherings, many proposed religious and pilgrimage Yatras were cancelled. The Supreme Court had also taken up the issue and directed everyone to play a vigilant role to mitigate the third wave,” IMA National President Dr JA Jayalal and Secretary General Dr Jayesh Lele said in a statement on Sunday. “Today we are in the declining phase of the second wave throughout the country except in a few states like Kerala and Maharashtra where we are still having a high number of cases. IMA is pained to see that amidst the rise of cases and seropositivity, the Kerala government has issued an order to ease lockdown on the pretext of religious gatherings of Bakrid. It is unwarranted and inappropriate at this time of medical emergency,” said the statement. “When many states like J&K, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal have stopped, with a constructive sense of public safety, the traditional and popular pilgrimage Yatras, it is unfortunate that Kerala had taken this decision which will pave the way for mass gatherings,” it said. “IMA in the larger interest of the country and well-being of humanity, with a sense of responsibility, strongly demands that the Kerala government immediately withdraw this order, enforce zero tolerance on violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour and not deviate from its statutory duty and vision to ensure the safety of the state and nation as a whole,” the IMA said. IMA also assured the Kerala government its proactive support in the ongoing fight against the pandemic. Meanwhile, IMA urged the public to get vaccinated, avoid mass gatherings in any form and asserted that it is the duty of every citizen at this crucial time to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour by wearing mask and observing social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/withdraw-order-to-ease-curbs-for-eid-ima-to-kerala/articleshow/84538961.cms||---

The transport department of the UT administration has completed all the formalities after getting a confirmation from a private company of transporting the bus. The bus will be on trial run first. Routes are finalised --- PGI to IT Park --- touching key points to check efficiency. From August, more such buses will be running on the roads. The fare will be the same as that for local CTU buses. “Commuters will not have to shell out any extra money to take the service of this non-polluting green bus. As the route chart is done, timings and schedule will be released soon,” sources said. The transport department will pay Rs 60 per kilometre to the company that will also provide a driver. “The first bus will reach Chandigarh between July 25 and 30. After the trial run, 19 buses will arrive in August. The charging stations are at ISBT, Sector 17, ISBT, Sector 43and PGI. The CTU depot too has the facility. The bus will be fully charged in 2 to 2.5 hours. It can run around 180 km on one charge,” a senior officer told TOI. “The sitting capacity of each bus is 36 passengers, but with both sitting and standing, the bus can accommodate around 54 passengers at one time,” the officer added. In the first phase a total of 40 buses will arrive; after the trial run in July, 19 more will land in the city in August and the remaining are expected by September. The central government has approved Rs 18 crore for this project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-gears-shift-electric-bus-debuts-next-week/articleshow/84538969.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Delhi||Delhi cops refuse permission for farm protest near Parliament||NEW DELHI: Even as a Delhi Police team met a delegation of farmers near the Singhu border, anti-riot drills were carried out in the city, including Red Fort, ahead of farmers’ planned protest near Parliament during the monsoon session to demand repeal of the three new farm laws. During talks, police refused to permit any gathering at the Jantar Mantar or Parliament on July 22, or on any other day. Cops ask Metro for extra vigil at 7 stationsPolice cited the violence during the January 26 farmers’ tractor march as one of the reasons for refusing permission, besides the Covid-19 scare and security implications of the planned protest. No consensus was reached at the meeting and a second round of talks is likely on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, Delhi Police also wrote to Delhi Metro to keep extra vigil at seven metro stations and close them if needed at short notice, in view of the farmers’ protest near Parliament from Monday. The police urged DMRC to close Janpath, Lok Kalyan Marg, Patel Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Central Secretariat, Mandi House and Udyog Bhawan stations on Monday onwards if required. This is the second time that protesting farmers are planning such a protest in the heart of Delhi. Earlier on January 26, the farmers had carried out a tractor rally which ended in clashes with police personnel as some agitators deviated from the mutually-agreed routes and went to Red Fort, where they unfurled a religious flag atop the historic monument. The incident had resulted in injuries to over 500 policemen. Regarding the drills, cops said that they were being conducted in the wake of farmers’ protest as well as the upcoming Independence Day celebrations. Multiple police teams carried out simulated scenarios to test their preparedness. The farmer leaders told reporters after the meeting that the police had offered them an alternative site for the demonstration and asked the unions to reduce the number of protesters, but they had declined. Farmer unions are planning to intensify their nearly eight-month-long stir by sending a 200-strong team of protestors to agitate at the Parliament house. They are supposed to march from Singhu border to Parliament but there are plans afoot to use buses as well, a senior police officer said. Like last time, farmer leaders have said the participating protesters will be given identification cards and a list of names and the route will be shared. News agency ANI quoted a statement from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) stating that a ninemember coordination committee of SKM met with the Joint Commissioner of Delhi Police on Sunday. “The Delhi Police was assured that the farmers' movement has no plans of laying siege to Parliament or forcibly entering it. Meanwhile, preparations for parliamentary protests are in full swing in SKM contingents. Around 200-350 farmers from different states will hold protests on each working day of Parliament,” SKM was quoted as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-cops-refuse-permission-for-farm-protest-near-parliament/articleshow/84538989.cms||---

Of the 66 patients 47 were children, said chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Mukta Kumar. Those who have been discharged are under supervision of the onsite camp members, Kumar added. She said chlorine, ORS and related medicines are being distributed at houses. The public health engineering department and Huda on Sunday continued the work to repair water pipes in the villages. Water is being supplied in the villages through tankers. The team has also started examining the faulty water connections taken by villagers. Sources claimed many villages had punctured the pipes to draw water illegally, one of the probable reasons behind the contamination. The inquiry report into the death of the nine-year-old child is yet to be submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panchkula-cholera-outbreak-47-of-66-new-patients-are-children/articleshow/84538998.cms||---
---||Business||Cooperative housing society maintenance charges above Rs 7,500? GST will apply||The Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR), Maharashtra bench, recently held that GST is chargeable against maintenance charges collected by a cooperative housing society from its members if it is in excess of Rs 7,500/month. It considered a retrospective amendment dating back to July 1, 2017, made by the Finance Act, 2021, whereby a CHS & its members are treated as ‘distinct entities’. This is the first ruling, post the amendment. Thus, the CHS has to collect and pay GST on the amounts received against maintenance charges from its members, as it is a ‘consideration’ received for supply of goods and services, held the AAR. According to a government circular, a CHS has to levy and collect GST at 18% on the maintenance charges, if these exceed Rs 7,500 per month per member. However, it should be noted that smaller societies with an annual turnover of Rs 20 lakh or less do not have to register and consequently do not have to comply with GST obligations. In this case, Andheri-based Emerald CHS failed in its argument that there can be no supply of services (like providing facilities such as security, cleaning, repairs, or ancillary services like accounting and auditing) by a CHS to its members, as it and its members are not distinct entities. In other words, before AAR, it contended ‘principle of mutuality would apply’. The members were only reimbursing costs and no GST could be levied. This contention was shot down by AAR. CHS also stated that post the amendment made by the Finance Act, no notification had been issued. However, the AAR pointed out that the amendment had received the assent of the President on March 28, 2021, and the contentious issue of principles of mutuality in the case of cooperative societies had been settled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cooperative-housing-society-maintenance-charges-above-rs-7500-gst-will-apply/articleshow/84538981.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Probe handed over to anti-terrorism squad, crime branch||VADODARA: The state home department on Sunday transferred investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Vadodara special operation group (SOG) cop’s wife to Ahmedabad crime branch and the anti-terrorism squad (ATS). The Vadodara rural police have failed to make any headway in tracing 37-year-old Sweety, wife of SOG inspector Ajay Desai, who is missing for the last 44 days. Junior home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja, who was the city on Sunday, said that the investigation will be done swiftly and in a fair manner using technical and forensic help The transfer of probe has come as a major embarassment for the Vadodara rural cops who groping in the dark since June 6 when when Sweety’s brother filed a missing persons complaint at Karjan police. The case was not taken serious and there were were little efforts to trace her. It was only after a month that senior police officials handed over investigations to the deputy superintendent of police, rural. Desai, and Sweety had been staying in Karjan. They got married in 2015 and have a two-year-old kid. On June 5, Desai called up Sweety’s brother and told him that she had left their house. Her brother rushed to Karjan and after searching for her, he approached the police.  The cops have conducted a polygraph test of Desai and preparations are on to go for narco test too. Police said investigation now relies on the burnt bones that were found from an unused property in Dahej some days ago. The bones that are of a human have been sent for further FSL tests to ascertain if they are of a woman. The investigators claimed that the property where the bones were found is of a man who is allegedly known to Desai. What has baffled the cops is that while Desai claimed that his wife left their home in Karjan on June 5, there is no evidence of her having left the residence. The CCTV footage in her residential locality doesn’t show her leaving their house. “Her phone call details also don’t reveal much as she wasn’t in touch with someone in particular,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/probe-handed-over-to-ats-crime-branch/articleshow/84532409.cms||---
---||Kolkata||On eve of Parl session, Trinamool’s isues find support from oppn parties||Kolkata: A day before Parliament commences, Trinamool Congress on Sunday has got a shot in the arm with most issues it raised finding resonance with opposition parties and even those issues that have a direct bearing on Bengal being raised by the opposition at an all-party meeting held in New Delhi. The Naveen Pattanaik-led BJD, for instance, pushed for an Odisha legislative council; three parties brought up the 10th schedule relating to disqualification of MPs for defecting, and Samajwadi Party was critical of the role of governors. Trinamool also found support when it shot down the Centre’s proposal for the prime minister to address party leaders in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on Covid. “We want a discussion on Covid, not outside Parliament but inside, on the floor of Parliament,” said party’s Rajya Sabha leader and spokesperson Derek O’Brien. Covid and inadequate vaccine supplies to Bengal remain key issues over which Trinamool will serve notice for discussion in both Houses. “This suggestion is only an attempt to bypass Parliament,” Derek added. Other opposition parties, including Congress, Left parties, SP and AAP, expressed views similar to Trinamool’s, sources said. On issues that have a direct bearing on Bengal being raised by other parties, sources said BJD pressed for introduction and passing of the Odisha legislative council bill in Parliament. The Bengal assembly has passed a similar resolution that needs to be passed by Parliament. Likewise, TRS, YSR Congress and BSP raised the issue of 10th schedule. This has a direct bearing on the ongoing defection proceedings against two Lok Sabha MPs in Bengal — Sisir Adhikari and Sunil Mondal — who moved from Trinamool to BJP. SP’s Ram Gopal Verma didn’t name the Bengal or Maharashtra governors, sources said, but his “scathing attack” on their roles to undermine elected state governments made it amply clear who he was referring to. Trinamool said on Day 1 of the Parliament session on Monday, it would raise the fuel price rise issue. In a first, party MPs in Delhi will protest by riding bicycles. It was not clear when the party would file a notice demanding a discussion on it. In the seven-point agenda for the 19-day Parliament session, apart from fuel price hike, Trinamool will also raise the issue of repeated attempts to undermine federal structure, motivated functioning of central agencies, repeal of farm laws, releasing MPLAD funds, and inadequate vaccines. The party will serve notices to press for discussions on these issues. Trinamool leaders have also been able to stitch together a broader convergence among parties on parliamentary procedures. “We want the bills to be scrutinised by parliamentary committees. It is a mere 11% now; it should be increased to 50%. Also, there should be short-duration discussions and calling attention motions once every week. On this issue, every opposition party agrees,” an opposition leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-eve-of-parl-session-trinamools-isues-find-support-from-oppn-parties/articleshow/84536490.cms||---

A CID team will also meet doctors at Contai hospital who treated Chakraborty for his bullet injury before he was shifted to Kolkata. The team will also seek opinion from forensic experts and surgeons on the nature of injury that ultimately led to his death. CID officers maintained that recording of statements was routine. “This is part and parcel of any investigation where murder has been alleged. The policemen who were close to him at the barracks have been identified. Some may have been posted out of Contai now. But we will speak to each one of them. Depending on our findings, we might summon a few to Bhawani Bhawan for more clarity,” said a CID source. Sunday’s probe followed two days of questioning of Chakraborty’s 11 colleagues. Forty-year-old Chakraborty had allegedly shot himself in a police barrack in East Medinipur’s Contai in 2018. His widow Suparna — a primary school teacher and mother to two daughters aged 12 and 9 — has recently filed a fresh complaint with Contai police seeking a probe into her husband’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-guard-death-cid-to-record-asis-statement/articleshow/84536604.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

TMC workers and plaza operators pelted stones at each other, leaving eight persons injured. Farakka SDPO Washim Khan rushed to the spot with a huge force to pacify the mob. They sealed the zilla parishad-run toll plaza. Both the toll operating agency and Trinamool lodged separate complaints with the police. Islam said: “I took shelter in an adjoining house to protect myself. Four of our party workers were injured. It is a plot by Congress as Congress supporter Sayan Biswas operates the toll and he had threatened me a few days ago. They attacked us with bricks.” Former Congress MLA of Farakka, Moinul Hoque, claimed the clash took place because Trinamool men tried to extort money. The toll plaza connects Jharkhand and Murshidabad. Thousands of lorries loaded with stone chips travel through this route daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/8-hurt-in-toll-clash-tmc-blames-cong/articleshow/84536503.cms||Sukumar Mahato

However, the house at 13, Bidhan Sarani where she lived with her husband Dwarakanath Ganguly, is lying in neglect and is on the verge of collapse, although it is a grade-II heritage building. There is no trace of its current owner. The doodle, a portrait of Ganguly with the image of the main building of Kolkata Medical College and Hospital in the background, was designed by Oddrija, a Bengaluru-based artist. The northern part of the house had been demolished to make room for a shopping mall much before the building received heritage status in 1997. The southern part has almost been reduced to ruins. The house on Bidhan Sarani, where Kadambini Ganguly lived, is in a dilapidated conditionThe house, originally owned by barrister Gobindo Gupta, was later sold to the Laha family of north Kolkata. The Lahas, in turn, rented out the house to Sadharon Brahmo Samaj in 1870. “In those days, those embracing Brahmoism would be banished by society and family. The ‘banished’ Brahmos used to get shelter in this sprawling complex. This was how Dwarakanath Ganguly stayed here and Kadambini Basu, daughter of Brahmo reformer Braja Kishore Basu, came there to stay here to pursue her study in Bethune College. Love blossomed and they married on June 12, 1883,” said Asim Ahmed, a history enthusiast who knew Kadambini Ganguly’s son, Prabhat Ganguly, very well. Ahmed’s father, Mofi Ahmed, was an acharya of Brahmo Samaj Mandir. It was while staying at this house that the couple battled Calcutta Medical College’s bar on the entry of women students. And it was while staying here that Ganguly joined the medical college on June 23, 1883, despite strong opposition from the society. She was awarded the Graduate of Medical College of Bengal (GMCB) degree in 1886, before going on to study in Britain. Her GMCB even attracted the attention of Florence Nightingale herself, who enquired about Ganguly from a friend in a letter in 1888. “Significantly, Dwarakanath and Kadamabini’s son-in-law, Upendra Kishor Roychowdhury, grandfather of Satyajit Ray, also used to live in this house after marriage, until he built his own house on Garpar Road,” said Subrata Dutta, assistant secretary, Sadharon Brahma Samaj. No one in Brahmo Samaj or in the locality could tell TOI who the current owner of the building was. A couple of private security personnel, who are guarding the ruins, refused entry into the house or to share any details on the current owner. “We, in Brahmo Samaj, are no less responsible for the destruction of this precious piece of history of the city and Bengal. We took note only when part of the building was demolished to build a shopping complex,” said Ahmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pioneering-kolkata-woman-doctor-honoured-by-doodle/articleshow/84536849.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Apart from the hospital land, the state government company had also invited bids for a 6.75 acre plot to set up a star hotel and an area of 1.5 acres for an industrial plot. Another 4 acres of land is on offer for a residential complex. Technical bids for the residential plot have been opened with financial bids to be received soon. However, re-tendering will have to be done for plots on offer for star hotel and industrial unit. According to reliable sources, only one bid was received for the industrial land and none for the hotel. At least three bids need to be received for the deal to be finalized. However, there was good response for the hospital land as MADC got offers from six bidders. Nagpur firm Anjani Logistics emerged as highest bidder. Sources said interested parties have suggested that an area of over 6 acres is too much for setting up a hotel in the area. The last date for fresh bids has been fixed as August 9, said a source. The company’s vice-chairman-cum-managing director Deepak Kapoor could not be contacted for a comment. MADC has fixed the base price on per square metre basis. The base price for the hotel land has been fixed at Rs2,875 a square metre and it’s Rs5,750 for the residential plot. On the hospital, a source said that though the area is relatively small at 15,000 square feet, the multispecialty hospital would come up vertically. A floor space index (FSI) of 1.5 is available, but the hospital can go up to 2.5 after paying the premium for extra FSI.

Covid cases reported since March 1 — taken as the start of the second wave — crossed the 2-crore mark on Sunday. Till March 1, in what can be termed the first wave, India had recorded a little more than 1.1 crore cases. The country’s total caseload stood at 3,11,43,121 on Sunday night, as per TOI’s Covid database. Second-wave cases now account for 64.3% of all infections detected in the country. So far, 2,56,931 deaths have been reported in the second wave, 62% of the country’s total Covid toll of 414,129. The case fatality rate in the second wave so far works out to be 1.28%, as opposed to 1.41% in the first wave. Meanwhile, India reported nearly 2.7 lakh new cases in the week ending on Sunday, a 6.5% drop from the count in the previous week. The rate of decline was only slightly better than the 5.5% drop recorded last week. While the pandemic continues to recede in the country, the rate of decline has slowed considerably in the past two weeks, coinciding with a spike in infections in Kerala and several states in the northeast. In Maharashtra, cases have been falling at a slow pace over the past five weeks. After Kerala, Maharashtra continues to post the highest number of new cases. Deaths registered an 11.4% drop this week as compared to the last. India recorded 5,342 fatalities from the infection during July 12-18, as opposed to 6,035 in the previous week. This was the lowest weekly toll in 14 weeks since April 5-11.This week, 1,574 such “backlog” deaths were added, 1,481 of these by Madhya Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-second-wave-cases-cross-2cr-nearly-2/3rd-of-total-infections/articleshow/84539120.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||Nagpur||Jail overcrowded after anti-crime drive, slow bail rate||NAGPUR: Central jail authorities are now in dire straits with the anti-crime drives and preventive actions heavily pushing up the number of inmates at the barracks which have already crossed the upper limit by more than 500. Various technical issues related to e-filing of cases at the district court, along with Covid-related restrictions on timings and online appearances, have slowed down the bail processes too, aggravating the woes of the jail authorities. The Nagpur central jail, having a capacity of around 1, 840 inmates, is currently housing around 2,350, triggering yet another fear of Covid outbreak. The high power committee, instituted by the high court, had earlier issued directions to release inmates on the basis of certain criteria to de-congest jails. Despite the release of more than 10,000 prisoners on special Covid norms, there had been repeated outbreaks of the virus at the jails across Maharashtra. The power to release prisoners was delegated to prison superintendents by the top brass of the jail authorities. Despite the release of several inmates by Nagpur central jail superintendent Anup Kumre, his plans to de-congest the prison has so far fallen flat. On the contrary, Kumre sounded tense as the barracks are housing excess numbers of inmates than they could accommodate. “Though we have undertaken the vaccine drive and taken other precautions, still the crowded barracks pose a threat of yet another viral spread due to high congestion,” said Kumre. With the overflowing population of the inmates inside the Nagpur central jail, the authorities are reeling under the apprehension of yet another infection spread. Clashes inside the over-crowded barracks between rival gangs and goons have added yet another concern for the jail authorities. The last couple of months had witnessed repeated fights inside the jail. Following threats to some gangsters’ lives and their rivalries, the Nagpur central jail authorities transferred many inmates to other prisons in Maharashtra as a safety measure. According to sources, the jail is teeming with inmates as the numbers of those stepping out on bail has reduced considerably. “Earlier, there used to be a release of around 30-35 inmates daily on bail. Now, the number of bail release has come down to less than five,” said sources. “There had been a steady incoming of inmates as the police department had been undertaking drives to nab criminals and put them behind bars to check the crime rate,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jail-overcrowded-after-anti-crime-drive-slow-bail-rate/articleshow/84533522.cms||Soumitra Bose

The accused were produced in a local court on Sunday and ordered six-day police remand. Panipat SP Shashank Kumar Sawan said, “Following a tip-off, a team of CIA-III led nabbed four persons from a private school. They were helping candidates appearing in the airmen recruitment online examination, conducted by the Central Airmen Selection Board across the country on Saturday.” The team seized mobile phones, Bluetooth devices and other gadgets from their possession, he said. The arrested four have been identified as Jitender Singh Sangwan alias Jeetu of Hisar, Rikki of Baroda in Sonipat, Dharambir of Asan village in Rohtak and Amit Kumar of Harodi village in Dadri. Jitender is a history-sheeter and was earlier arrested gram sachive paper leak scam while Ricky runs a coaching centre in Rohtak and looked for susceptible candidates. All four were arrested from a makeshift control room they had set up at a private school in Panipat. “We have got the details of their deals with applicants, application or enrolment numbers of candidates,” the SP added. Inspector Anil Chhillar, who led the raid, said, “Preliminary investigation has revealed that the accused took Rs 3 lakh from candidates to clear the written examination and Rs 6 lakh for final selection. We are also trying to find their other links and team of paper solvers and their modus operandi.” This is for the third time when a Haryana-based gang has been found involved in cheating during IAF exams.

A portion of the funds earmarked for the scrapped Padmasarovaram project will be used for the construction of the memorial. An artist’s representation of the ‘poet’s area’ For the construction of the memorial near Mangalavanam, the corporation will have to shell out a total of around Rs 2.5 crore. The memorial will consist of a wooded area, a lobby, an art gallery, a ‘poet's corner’, a knowledge park, and a ‘tranquility space’. The project to build a memorial for the first Jnanpith awardee from Kerala had been remaining on paper for more than two decades due to the apathy on the part of authorities. Sankara Kurup had won the highest literary honour of the country for “Odakkuzhal” an anthology of poems, in 1965. “In a short span, we have been able to identify land for the project, clear a dispute over the road access to the land and get the design prepared. So, we have completed all the preparatory works for the construction of the memorial. It will be part of the city’s cultural heritage,” said mayor M Anil Kumar, who is taking a special initiative for making the project a reality. “The corporation council has given its nod for including the project under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) scheme. We are awaiting the approval from the Amrut board for using its funds,” the mayor said. The wooded area will look like a sacred grove, providing a green cover for the memorial. The area near to the art gallery has been earmarked for landscaping. The ‘poet's corner’ next to it will have books and other things related to the poet. Audio records of his works will also be played in the ‘poet’s corner’. “Rarely do we get a chance to design a monument. And the fact that we have got an opportunity to design Sankara Kurup’s memorial doubles up our joy. We have given special emphasis on creating an ambience, which is poetic. We have been keen about preparing a design which matches with the atmosphere of Mangalavanam situated nearby,” said architect S Gopakumar of Kumar Group, which prepared the design of the memorial. Facilities will be provided to people to practise yoga and listen to the music of flute at the ‘tranquility space’. The plan is to develop the memorial into a cultural hub.

FATF continues to keep Pakistan in its ‘Increased Monitoring List’ because of the latter’s failure to do enough against UN-designated terrorists. He was also quoted as saying that India had given China an “appropriate reply” for “infringing” on LAC. Addressing a training programme for BJP leaders, he said LeT and JeM terrorists were sanctioned by the UN because of India’s efforts. “FATF keeps a check on funding for terrorism and deals with black money supporting terrorism. Due to us, Pakistan is under the lens of FATF and it was kept in the grey list. We’ve been successful in pressuring Pakistan and the fact that Pakistan’s behaviour has changed is because of pressure put by India through various measures,” Jaishankar was quoted as saying by ANI. “The PM’s personal efforts made on forums like G20 or G7 made nations realise that terrorism is everyone’s problem. India ensured that the world should be concerned about terrorism,” he said.

The dismal reality is reflected in the increase in hospitalization cases and ICU admissions as well, according to a surveillance analysis report submitted to the district administration. The number of vacant Covid beds have also been shrinking each day in the district. As many as 3,566 Covid beds were vacant on July 11 and their numbers have reduced to 3,017 on Sunday. At the same time the number of patients undergoing treatment for Covid had come down to 225 on July 11. The caseload has now risen again and touched 263 on Sunday. However, district health authorities maintain that the situation will not spiral out of control as people have been getting vaccinated and a large section of people in the society have already been infected with the disease. They also claim there will not be any shortage of beds for treatment as seen during the peak of the second wave. The report says that there has been a gradual rise in seven-day average of daily cases. It further said restrictions based on test positivity rate alone is not going to help reduce further spread of the infection as TPR does not reflect the real situation at the ground level. “We have doubled the number of beds now compared to the peak of second wave. The wave touched the peak when there were no restrictions in place in the society. Moreover, vaccination coverage was only at 20% at that time. Now, the vaccination has crossed more than 40%. Even if we open fully in the days to come, the cases won’t peak as they did a few months ago,” said Dr Mathew Numpeli, district programme manager of NHM. He said they don’t expect the hospital system will be overburdened in the third wave. Steps should be taken to vaccinate vulnerable people, avoid exposure to the infection and provide treatment at the early stage of infection. Another official said the cases will continue to rise in the current rate. “We are seeing conscious attempts on the part of LSGDs to reduce TPR in order to lift restrictions. When cases will rise gradually, it will prove to be burden on the staff and they will struggle to provide treatment. We cannot say vaccination prevents infection. The relief is that the deaths due to Covid-19 can be reduced drastically if vaccination drive gains speed. We need to postpone the surge at least for two months until 70% of the population is vaccinated,” said the official. The district has been recording an average of 16 Covid deaths daily. The authorities have prepared 40 ICU oxygen beds for paediatric cases in Ernakulam General Hospital and Kalamassery medical college each to treat serious Covid cases in children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/report-points-to-surge-in-covid-cases-in-kochi/articleshow/84539240.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Kolkata||Kolkata records a single Covid death; active cases dip to 923 but new cases climb to 92||KOLKATA: The city recorded a single Covid death on Sunday, a day after Kolkata had recorded zero death after a gap of 112 days. The number of fresh cases, though, spiralled to 92 on Sunday from 62 a day ago. There has been a sharp drop in active cases in the city as well, from 1,612 on July 1 to 923 on Sunday. Fresh cases had slid below the1,000-mark on July 4, after 53 days, and have since remained in the three digits. Experts believe it is the drop in the number of deaths, more than the slide in fresh cases, that indicates an improving scenario. They pointed out that this showed that vaccines have started having an impact. While just over a month ago, on June 15, Kolkata had recorded 21 deaths, it was just two on July 16 before finally sliding to zero on Saturday. “We have seen a steady decline in the number of deaths and cases. The death figure had dropped to single-digit figures more than two weeks ago, which was the first good sign. Vaccines are responsible for this, apart from the Covid restrictions,” said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research professor Diptendra Sarkar. But experts said a slowdown in vaccination — like the one that hit Kolkata last month and again last week with several hospitals and KMC centres yet to receive their supplies — could be dangerous with a third wave looming large. “It has be hastened and a steady supply of vaccines ensured so we can inoculate the maximum possible number of people before the next wave,” said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. This month started with just four deaths recorded on July 1. Active cases recorded in Kolkata on that day was 1,612. While both active cases and deaths went up marginally on July10, touching1,118 and three respectively, they dropped significantly six days later on July 16, when Kolkata had 953 active cases and two deaths. “The trend is encouraging and indicates that the second wave is coming to an end. But that also means we could be approaching a third wave. We need to step up vaccination and get as many inoculated as possible over the next one-and-ahalf months so that by the time it strikes, many more would have immunity against the virus,” said internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas. Fresh cases have dropped appreciably in Bengal. While the state had recorded the highest single-day spike in fresh cases on April 27 — 16,403 — it slid to 1,501 on July 1, to 997 on July 10 and to 899 on July 17. “These are good times and the numbers are assuring. But some states still have a substantial number of cases and deaths are happening there. It can spread to our state in a month or two, igniting a third wave. Caution is the need of the hour,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-records-a-single-covid-death-active-cases-dip-to-923-but-new-cases-climb-to-92/articleshow/84539300.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||India||Severe Covid-hit lungs heal in 3 months, says study||MUMBAI: The initial fear that many post-Covid patients would later develop lung fibrosis is fast receding in the medical corridors. Even lungs of patients who suffered from severe Covid and pneumonia, are showing signs of healing within three-six months, according to a study by doctors from a Mumbai hospital. “We found in the maximum number of patients, the lung function continues to get better,” said the study’s main author, pulmonologist Dr Sumeet Singhania from Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, Andheri. The initial findings of the study were recently published in ‘Lung India Journal’. The team began the study mainly because of the mass neurosis among patients about Covid destroying their lungs. “But we found the majority of these patients, by the end of three months, showed very good improvement in the lungs, both structurally and functionally,” said Dr Singhania. Each patient’s lung function test and CT scan were performed. While the study only has results from 42 patients who were treated with antiviral remdesivir and steroids, the medical team has since completed the study on over 300 of patients, some of whom were followed for a year. Most of these 42 patients admitted to the hospital had severe pneumonia. The study also focused on a debate within the medical community on whether to start Covid patients with severe lung involvement on anti-fibrotic medicines. Anti-fibrotic agents are meant for patients with idiopathic lung fibrosis in order to slow down the scarring of lungs. Dr Lancelot Pinto, who is attached to Hinduja Hospital in Mahim and not connected to this study, told TOI that discharge papers of many Covid patients would show they were put on anti-fibrotic medication. “The medication is unnecessary and I haven’t prescribed it to a single Covid patient in the last 16 months,” he said. The Kokilaben Hospital study underlines the same thought process. “Our study shows that not each and everyone admitted to hospital for Covid infection needs to be started on anti-fibrotic drugs,” said Dr Singhania. Anti-fibrotic medication, by their own definition, are meant to arrest lung scarring or damage. “They cannot reverse the scarring. So where is the proof that it helps Covid patients with lung scarring,” asked Dr Pinto. Dr Singhania said that even in select Covid patients with significant lung scarring improved over a period of time. “The study reveals that Covid pneumonia does not induce a progressive fibrotic pathway in the lungs, at least at three months of follow-up,” said the Lung India study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/severe-covid-hit-lungs-heal-in-3-months-says-study/articleshow/84539311.cms||---

SP Karthick held an online meeting with representatives of traders and discussed ideal practices to be followed in the coming days. Rural police said that 51 cases were registered by the police for quarantine violations over the weekend and such violations would result in further spread of the disease. “We have registered these cases as people who are supposed to be in quarantine roamed around without adhering to the instructions given to them by health workers and police officers. The cases were registered under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance,” said a police officer. Police said that the list of persons who are supposed to be in quarantine was being shared with the police on a daily basis and those found violating them would have to face the consequences. “The 51 persons were identified in the past two days while officers verified if those in the list are actually in quarantine,” said an officer. Police said families should try to assign a member of the family who has received at least one dose of the vaccine to go to the market to buy things. Rural police on Sunday registered 375 cases for violating Covid protocol in general. As many as 105 persons were arrested. Action was initiated against 3,650 persons for not following social distancing and 1,750 persons for not wearing masks properly. “Police will have to take action if any sort of crowding is spotted. Shopkeepers should also watch out for this,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ernakulam-cops-warn-of-strict-action/articleshow/84539307.cms||---

There were no celebrations as we have lost several of our neighbours in this tragedy. I did not sleep at my usual spot as there were last minute arrangements to made, so I did not get hurt. But my older brother-in-law Yogesh Gangwane suffered a back injury and a fracture in the leg,” said Ghasing. When asked how they stay so perilously close to the retaining wall of BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) atop the hill, Ghasing said, “Everyone here is lower middle class, and desperately need a small roof over their heads. Many are staying on rent despite being aware of the dangers.” Like Ghasing, Suresh Jagdaonkar (45), who earns his living by painting walls and buildings, was fortunate as he and his entire family escaped the landslide. “Since it was raining heavily on Saturday night and I also had to finish a chore at my mother-in-law’s house in neighbouring Ashok Nagar, my wife and I decided to spend the night there. Our three children were watching television and later climbed up to the mezzanine floor to sleep. When the landslide occurred, it brought in all the earth, stones, gravel into our house as the front door was smashed by the force. My kids’ two pet chickens were rescued,” said Jagdaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/preparation-for-wedding-of-sister-saved-this-mans-life/articleshow/84539370.cms||Vijay Singh

Raina’s uncle, Ashok Kumar, was killed and four people of his family injured during the robbery in Tharial village on August19 last year. Robbers had barged into the house and beaten up the family with sticks before decamping with cash and valuables. While Kumar, a Border Security Force (BSF) contractor, had died on the spot, four others were injured. After the incident, Raina had withdrawn out of IPL 2020 and even implored Punjab CM Amarinder Singh to catch the accused. A Special Investigation Team was formed in Punjab and 11 accused have been arrested so far. According to police, the robbery was carried out by an inter-state gang of robbers belonging to the Chaimaar tribe from UP. “Chajju Chaimaar who planned the robbery hails from Bahedi in Bareilly. He had gone into hiding in Hyderabad after committing the crime,” STF in charge Ajay Pal Singh told TOI. Singh said the team acted on a tip-off that the accused was hiding in his native village of Pachpeda in Bahedi. “We alerted Punjab police and after confirming the man’s identity, a joint team raided the village on Sunday morning. The accused was handed over to Punjab police,” he said. Singh added that during questioning, the accused had revealed that women members of the gang had conducted a recce of the house before the robbery. Three members of the gang are still on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mastermind-of-robbery-at-home-of-rainas-kin-held-after-a-year/articleshow/84539422.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The woman’s hands were tied up. The assailants entered the house despite the presence of two dogs, washed the blood stains and sprinkled turmeric powder to blot their trail, police said. The deceased were identified as Samson Dinakaran, 63, a former time keeper with Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB), popular as Metrowater, and his 52-year-old wife Janet. Samson’s first wife Alia, 55, son Immanuel, 28, and daughter Benita, 30, live in Guduvanchery. An officer said Benita, who spoke to her father over phone daily, tried to contact him during heavy rain on Friday night but gave up after three calls, assuming that he may have fallen asleep. But, when he remained unreachable on Saturday too, she called one of Samson’s neighbours and asked him to check. After going to the house, the neighbour informed her that there was no one inside the house, the door was locked from inside and that the back door was left open. Benita then rushed to the house along with her mother and brother. Finding it empty, she alerted the police control room and the Vandalur-Otteri police were informed. A team of officers rushed to the spot and began making inquiries. The lights outside the house where found switched off. In one of the rooms, the smell of blood was present despite the stains being washed away and turmeric powder was sprinkled all over the room. An empty box was found on the floor. The police team then checked the outer premises and saw that the water sump was left half open. Floating inside were the bodies of Samson and Janet. Their throats bore long knife-cut marks and the hands of the woman were tied up. The bodies were sent to the Chromepet Government Hospital for a post-mortem examination. Police quoting some of the couple’s neighbours said the couple always kept the door locked and never opened it for outsiders. Samson only opened the door for people known to them, an investigating officer said. “It was difficult for the outsiders to get in as the dogs never let anyone,” he added. A case of murder was registered. Janet’s mobile phone was retrieved from the house, while Samson’s phone was found near a fuel outlet (petrol bunk) at Alapakkam near Nedunkundram. Police have collected CCTV camera footage from the locality to nab the killers. The motive behind the murder is yet to established and police are also looking into the possibility of someone known to the victims being involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-couple-murdered-bodies-dumped-in-water-sump/articleshow/84539424.cms||---

T-2 will be converted into three utility blocks, which will house an exclusive area for business jets’ operation, a VVIP safe house and budget rooms for passengers’ short stay. Cial managing director S Suhas said the director board chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had given in-principle approval for the conversion plan of T-2. The works will begin in August. “We are lining up several short-term as well as long-term projects for activating new revenue streams. The civil work of the five-star hotel project has gained momentum. The conversion of T-2 is another ambitious idea to tap potential revenue. We plan to accommodate a Business Jet terminal, a VVIP safe house and a transit hotel in the sprawling T-2 which stands unused now,” Suhas said. A meeting convened by the MD has finalized the blueprint which envisages a cost-effective renovation of the interior of T-2 into three blocks. Thirty per cent of the built-up area will be used for block one which will be converted into an exclusive business jet terminal with 3 lounges. This terminal will cater to both international and domestic business jets. Exclusive areas for customs, immigration and security holding operations will be allotted. “Block-2 will have an area of 10,000 sqft and is earmarked to house a VVIP safe house. This concept will ensure a hassle-free movement of passengers during the VVIP movement. Block-3 will have an area of 60,000 sqft. Cial is planning to build 50 budget rooms for short-stay of passengers at the airport. It is planned to apply the dynamic tariff concept; wherein the rent will be calculated on hour-based scale. Cial plans to complete block 1 and 2 in one year,” said a statement. With the commissioning of the new terminal (T-3), the international flight operations were shifted from T-1 to T-3. T-1 then underwent a renovation process and is used for domestic operation since 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cochin-airport-plans-to-renovate-terminal-2/articleshow/84539359.cms||---

Sources said BJP has been swiftly shifting gears to take on Sanjay Nishad, more than a month after he met home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda and projected himself as the sole torchbearer of the Mallah vote bank. Sanjay had been seeking a ministerial berth in the Union Cabinet for his son, Pravin Nishad. If that wasn’t enough, he ruffled feathers of BJP leadership by throwing up the demand of being projected as party’s deputy CM face in assembly polls. Both his demands fell flat. Sources said Jai Prakash will be tasked to work in around 130 assembly seats, including those in Gorakhpur, which have Nishad voters in substantial numbers. The Nishad community and 16 other sub-castes have been seeking inclusion in SC list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-props-up-jai-prakash-nishad-to-counter-assertive-ally-in-up/articleshow/84539430.cms||Pankaj Shah

The development comes after the NCLT Chennai’s Division Bench – I overruled the objections raised by original promoters led by Palani G Periasamy on valuation of the properties and passed a final order on Friday, July 15, 2021. The bench also dismissed a petition filed by the promoters under Section 12A of the IBC which permits the adjudicating authority to allow withdrawal of application with 90% voting approval by creditors. MGM is likely to convert Le Meridien hotel located in Guindy into a healthcare facility and may retain the Coimbatore property as a hotel. ‘Assets worth Rs 1,600 crore approved to be sold for Rs 423cr’While Rajagopalan declined to comment, Periasamy did not respond to calls from TOI on Sunday. “The NCLT order allows Appu Hotels to appeal in 30 days. It will appeal soon,” a source said. “It is a fact that Rajagopalan offered Rs 423 crore and NCLT Chennai approved it. But we have raised objection to the valuation under Section12A. How can properties worth Rs 1,600 crore be valued so low,” Periasamy had told TOI a few weeks ago. Rajagopalan is chairman of Sri Balaji Educational & Charitable Public Trust and Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth Trust, which run Mahatma Gandhi Medical College & Research Centre (MGMCRI), established in Puducherry in 2001, and Sathya Sai Medical College in Kancheepuram district in 2007. Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth reported a revenue of Rs 636 crore with a surplus of Rs 345 crore in FY20, according to a CARE Ratings Limited analysis. Tourism Finance Corporation of India initiated Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under Section 7 of IBC, 2016, against Appu Hotels for pending debts and orders were passed by NCLT in May 2020. Secured and unsecured creditors then put up claims of around Rs 389 crore. The interim resolution professional (IRP) appointed registered valuers arrived at a fair value of Rs 730.9 crore and liquidation value of Rs 569.3 crore. Rajagopalan, Madhav Dhir and Kotak Special Situations submitted bids, but only Rajagopalan stayed on course with a final resolution plan offering Rs 423 crore, approved by a 87.39% majority in the ninth meeting of the Committee of Creditors on January 22. Estimating the property at Rs 1,600 crore, promoters led by Periasamy objected to the resolution plan citing procedural lacunae and misinformation in the conduct of the CIRP. Counsel for the promoter said the fair value and liquidation value were at least 30% lower than another valuation undertaken in September 2019.

He also abused her. Police said Gowri, of Dileepan Nagar, married Ramesh, a house painter, four years ago. They had a daughter Deekshitha, 3, and 18-month-old son Ashwin. “The couple fought often since Ramesh spent the little he earned on booze and came home drunk every day. He did not provide for the family, the children had to go without adequate food often and Gowri had to try and make ends meet,” a police officer said. Ramesh also kept asking Gowri for money to buy liquor, police said. On Sunday morning, the couple fought again as Ramesh demanded money to buy liquor. “Gowri refused to give him money. He slapped her and left home after asking her to kill herself,” an investigation officer said. Gowri hanged her children from the ceiling using sari and later hanged herself. A neighbour who came to play with the children found the house locked. As repeated knocks went unanswered, the neighbour peeped in through a window and found the three hanging. She broke open the door, lowered the bodies and informed police. They were rushed to a nearby private hospital where doctors declared all three as brought dead. The bodies were sent to Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital for postmortem. The Tirunindravur police have registered a case and an RDO inquiry has been initiated since the woman committed suicide within seven years of marriage. Further investigation by police is also on. Police said Gowri did not leave behind any suicide note but had on many occasions expressed having suicidal thoughts to her neighbours, who in turn reprimanded Ramesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-upset-over-repeated-fights-with-husband-woman-kills-kids-self/articleshow/84539479.cms||---

Covid protocols should be followed but it is not right to ban the yatra. It is my appeal to UP and Uttarakhand governments to rethink their decision,” Jain said. He further stated that the judiciary must not be “selective” in its decision. Meanwhile, the VHP objected to the Kerala government’s decision to relax Covid restrictions in view of Eid-ul-Azha, which will be celebrated on July 21, saying it poses a “huge” public health challenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rethink-move-to-cancel-kanwar-yatra-vhp-tells-up-and-uttarakhand/articleshow/84539518.cms||---

The respective block education officers have arranged for these students to take the exams in Covid Care Centres near them. Overall, nearly 8.8 lakh students are expected to appear for the exams. Of these, over 4.7 lakh are boys. Because of the pandemic and fears over students contracting Covid-19, the education department has introduced a new format for the exams — objective type with multiple choice questions. Answers need to be marked on OMR sheets — a first at this level. On Monday, exams will be held for core subjects of science, mathematics, and social science. Students will be tested for a total 40 marks in each subject. Last year, Covid positive students were allowed to sit for the supplementary exams and CET. With rain lashing the state, transportation for students, especially in rural areas, has been arranged. The department said SDMC vehicles will also be used in case students are unable to reach exam centres. Students from 14,929 schools — 5,289 government schools, 3,397 aided schools and 6,243 unaided schools — are scheduled to appear for the exams. About 6,000 centres have been prepared for the exams. Besides the new truncated format, the exams have been split into two sessions on two days — Monday and Thursday. The language papers will be held on Thursday. More than 1.2 lakh vaccinated officials will be on duty. Only 12 students will be seated in each room, with one student per desk. Each centre will have a health check-up counter, which will open at 8.30am. The counters are equipped with thermal scanners, pulse oximeters, first aid kits and masks. The education department said all arrangements have been made for the smooth conduct of exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/8-8l-to-take-sslc-exam-from-today/articleshow/84537357.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Air pollution: ‘Road dust, construction work are major contributors in Jaipur’||JAIPUR: Two-thirds of air pollution in the city has been attributed to ‘uncontrolled’ road dust (71%) while the rest has been shared by industries (8%), vehicles (8%) and construction activities (4%), a study has said. A combined study by Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) and IIT-Kanpur carried out over a period of three years from 2017-2020 in five selected areas — Ajmeri Gate, Vishwakarma Industrial Area, Jorawar Singh Gate, Malaviya Nagar and Mansarovar — concluded that air pollution could be brought under control in the city by taking a number of steps. Jaipur has been ranked 37th worst air polluted city by a Swiss-based organisation AirVisual and Greenpeace. The report was prepared after studying pollution caused by the transport sector (motor vehicles and railways), commercial activities, industrial activities, domestic activities, institutional and official activities and fugitive non-point sources. The study, which was conducted on city hotels and restaurants, found that many used coal as fuel in tandoors. “The average consumption of coal in tandoors was 30kg/day. The common fuel other than in tandoor is LPG. In most of the cases, it was found that there were no control devices installed at these activities,” reads the report. The total number of big hotels and restaurant enterprises was approximately 1,500 at the time of the survey. Quoting figures collected from the JDA, the report says that 81 per cent of households were using LPG while 19 per cent relied on coal. Brick kilns are considered one of the major contributors to air pollution. The survey found approximately 250 brick kiln are present in Jaipur (outside the city boundary) “These brick kilns use wood and coal as fuel contributing in various kinds of emissions like SO2, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, and CO,” reads the report. Similarly, Jaipur has 450 mining units outside the city boundary contributing to the main reason for air pollution —dust. It also listed out suggestions for the authorities to contain the situation. Restaurants with over 10 seats should not use coal and shift to electric or gas-based appliances. The ash from tandoor should not be disposed of near roadsides. It said by 2030, the city may plan to shift to electric cooking or natural gas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/road-dust-construction-work-are-major-contributors-in-jaipur/articleshow/84539480.cms||---

---||Bhopal||MP: NCC training now an elective subject at Dr BR Ambedkar University of Social Science||MHOW: Dr BR Ambedkar University of Social Science (BRAUSS) is making National Cadet Corps (NCC) training a part of the undergraduate curriculum, and not an extra-curricular activity – the first educational institution in Madhya Pradesh to do so. The NCC module will be introduced as an elective subject from this academic session as per UGC’s ‘choice-based credit system’ (CBCS). Eighteen students have already enrolled for the course. Two-thirds of the credits are devoted to practicals and camps, which include fieldcraft, weapon training, infantry weapons knowledge, map reading and obstacle training. The formal ceremony for exchange of documents between NCC Indore group commander Brigadier HR Desai and BRAUSS vice-chancellor Dr Asha Shukla was held on Saturday. ‘More students will be motivated to take NCC’With the new policy of UGC and special initiative by the central as well as state leadership, NCC has now become an elective subject. Students will get credits, just like any other subject,” Brigadier Desai told TOI. Since NCC was a co-curricular activity earlier, cadets were not able to give due stress to it because of the pressure of the main subjects, he pointed out. “But now that it is one of the main subjects, students will be able to choose it as an elective for their degree. This will motivate more students to join NCC,” he said, adding that BRAUSS is the first university in Madhya Pradesh to start it as an elective course. V-C Shukla said it will open up new opportunities. “The CBCS provides an opportunity to students to choose from among core, elective, minor and skill-based courses. With NCC being made an elective subject, it will benefit the students to move across institutions within the country. As of now, 18 undergraduate students have taken NCC as an elective and their course is on full swing,” she said. “The best part of NCC training is that it prepares good citizens, who think about national issues,” she remarked. “This course will be different from the normal weekend NCC training. A student will have to be regular in class and attend NCC periods like other subjects,” she added. Anupam Rajan, commissioner-higher education, said BR Ambedkar University is the first to start a course with NCC as an elective subject in the credit based system. NCC officer Sanjay Soni said the NCC course, designed by UGC, has both theory and practical parts. “The course comprises the NCC syllabus being taught in schools and colleges, along with many new chapters on discipline, nation building, disaster management and assisting government machinery,” he said. 9 MP NCC unit commanding officer Col Pankaj Atri, NCC officer Maj Sanjay Sohni, Dean Dr Manisha Saxena, Registrar Ajay Verma and other faculty members were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-ncc-training-now-an-elective-subject-at-dr-br-ambedkar-university-of-social-science/articleshow/84539579.cms||---

---||Noida||2020 vs 2021: Murder cases in Ghaziabad down, but thefts up in first 6 months||GHAZIABAD: Incidents of theft are on the rise in the areas under the jurisdiction of almost all police stations in Ghaziabad so far this year. According to Ghaziabad police data, a total of 1,284 FIRs of theft have been lodged in the district from January 1 to June 30 this year, a spike of nearly 19% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, when 1,082 cases were filed. Most of the theft cases registered this year (977) are vehicle thefts. The data reveals that most vehicle thefts have been reported in Kavi Nagar (139), followed by Indirapuram (115) and Sahibabad (95). The most burglaries have occurred in Sahibabad (41), followed by Indirapuram (35). A senior police officer said Indirapuram and Sahibabad are adjacent to Delhi, due to which burglars target them as they can make a quick getaway to Delhi. Most of the couples in these areas are working, and burglars break into their homes while they are away at work, he said. The burglars come to work in these areas as daily wagers and domestic staff and carry out recces before committing crimes. "So far, over 30 thieves have been arrested by police who broke into houses in these areas with this modus operandi,” the officer added. The number of homicides, however, has seen a dip of 10% — while 27 FIRs of murder have been filed till June-end this year, the figure stood at 30 in the corresponding period in 2020. Loni has become one of the hotspots for heinous crimes with six murders, followed by Muradnagar where four cases were filed. Three murder cases each have been reported in Masuri, Tronica City and Loni border. Two were murdered in Nandgram and Kavi Nagar each, while only murder was reported in Bhojpur, Modinagar, Kaushambi and Indirapuram. Not a single FIR of murder has been lodged in Kotwali, Vijay Nagar, Sihani Gate and six other police stations so far this year. In the last six months, only one dacoity has been reported in the district — six armed robbers barged into the house of a property dealer in Loni on May 26 and robbed the family of cash and jewellery amounting to over Rs 1 crore. The incident took place around 2.30pm, when six people on three bikes came to the house, barged in and took the family hostage at gunpoint for over 30 minutes. No arrests have been made in this case till now. Meanwhile, 23 cases of loot and snatching have been reported in the district. Kavi Nagar tops the list with five FIRs, while Sihani Gate and Tronica City have registered three FIRs of loot or snatching each. Ghaziabad SP (rural) Dr Iraj Raja said that police patrolling in the district has been increased to check crime. “CCTV cameras have been installed along roads so that police can keep an eye on them as well,” he said. Asked about what steps have been taken in urban parts of Ghaziabad, SP (city-1) Nipurn Aggarwal said police teams have been deployed in public places both in uniform and in civilian dress to curb snatchings and loot. “More checkposts are being set up on roads so that police can catch suspects,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2020-vs-2021-murder-cases-in-ghaziabad-down-but-thefts-up-in-first-6-months/articleshow/84533483.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Noida||Officer who handed gun to MLA son transferred||Ghaziabad: The forest range officer of Ghaziabad has been transferred to Hapur “with immediate effect” after a video showed him handing a gun to the son of the Loni MLA and the youth firing in the air with it during a plantation drive. Ashok Gupta, the officer, had last week said the weapon was an air gun that belonged to Nagesh, the MLA’s son, and the youth had given it to him “for keeping it safe”. A preliminary inquiry conducted by the forest department has now found that the gun was actually a licenced pistol owned by Gupta. A senior forest officer said Gupta had been handed the transfer order on Saturday, asking him to join the Hapur office “within 24 hours”. On Sunday, he had taken his new charge. “A departmental inquiry will be conducted against Gupta soon,” the officer said. After the video showing Nagesh firing in the air and Gupta handing the gun to him went viral on Thursday, an FIR under Section 336 (acts endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and relevant provisions of the Arms Act was registered against both of them. Police are yet to initiate any action. Soon after getting the transfer order, Gupta handed his licenced pistol to the police and was believed to have admitted that he had passed on the same gun to Nagesh during a plantation drive on Thursday. The police, sources said, would recommend the cancellation of his arms licence. Jitendra Kumar Singh, the SHO of Loni police station, said Gupta had come on Saturday to hand over the gun. “He submitted the gun. During questioning, he accepted that he had given his pistol to Nagesh to fire in the air,” he added. Asked what action they were planning against the forest officer and the MLA’s son, Singh said, “We will first record the statements of Nagesh and the forest guards who were present during the firing. We will also send the gun to the forensic lab to find out when the last shot had been fired from it.” Gupta said he would face the inquiry. “I have given my statement to the police. I am ready for any action,” he added. Loni MLA Nandkishor Gujjar, who had last week asserted that it was an air gun and his son had fired from it to scare away monkeys, stood by his claim on Sunday. “It was an air gun. The pistol has been handed to police for investigation. Let the police carry out a fair probe,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/officer-who-handed-gun-to-mla-son-transferred/articleshow/84533516.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

The study has begun on the 130m-wide road between two blocks in Knowledge Park 5. About 20 places have been identified as ‘choke points’ and RITES has prepared a preliminary report on five such areas. The GNIDA has started examining it, officials said. These points are Pari Chowk, Surajpur entry/exit point, Tilapta Chowk, Honda Chowk and Kisan Chowk. The population growth in Greater Noida for the next 10 years has been projected at 25 lakh from the current 12 lakh and a master plan will be prepared keeping the next 20 years as the time frame. “The city has witnessed rapid development in the past few years and as a result, the population growth has been estimated at about 25 lakh in the next decade. It is necessary for Greater Noida to be ready with infrastructure and other facilities to support the population. We had hired RITES as a consultant to prepare a comprehensive mobility plan. It has started studying the 130m-wide road in Knowledge Park 5 and the overall survey is likely to be completed soon,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA). He added that the work got delayed because of the pandemic. In the first phase of the survey, RITES will collect data and analyse the existing urban transport system. In the next stage, it will identify important roads and intersections and prepare preliminary designs that would offer mobility solutions, and those would be presented in a detailed report.  “The plan will focus on problems faced in the short, medium and long term, and solutions would be provided,” said Bhooshan. He added that the plan will include guidelines from the ministry of housing and urban affairs and ministry of road transport and highways, along with other departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/20-choke-points-in-rites-survey-for-traffic-plan/articleshow/84533556.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The daughter of Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan was seized on Friday and held for several hours by unknown assailants who left her with injuries and rope marks and Pakistan authorities have said they are investigating. “The Afghan government recalled the ambassador and senior diplomats to Kabul until the complete elimination of the security threats, including the arrest and punishment of the perpetrators,” the ministry of foreign affairs said. Pakistan’s foreign ministry in a statement called the decision “regrettable” and said it hoped the Afghan government would reconsider. “The foreign secretary met the ambassador of Afghanistan today, highlighted all the steps taken by the government in this context, and re-assured him of full cooperation,” it said. Pakistan is considered a key player in the peace process in Afghanistan. The neighbouring countries have long had frosty ties. Kabul accuses Pakistan of allowing safe havens for the Taliban, while Islamabad accuses Kabul of allowing militants to use their territory to carry out attacks in Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghanistan-recalls-ambassador-diplomats-from-pakistan/articleshow/84539633.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Unlock 4.0: Night curfew cut by 1 hour, theatres to open today in Karnataka||BENGALURU: With fresh cases of Covid-19 hovering around the 2,000-a-day mark, the state government on Sunday retained the night curfew but allowed theatres and colleges to open with precautions under Unlock 4.0 from Monday. After meeting officials and ministers, chief minister BS Yediyurappa said the night curfew will be an hour less, between 10pm and 5am, while theatres will open at 50% capacity till August 2. Degree and professional colleges will restart in-class learning from July 26 with strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. However, the government made it clear that only those students, teachers and non-teaching staff who have taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine will be allowed to attend offline classes. ‘Reopening of swimming pools not discussed’While pubs cannot reopen, class attendance for students is optional and all skill development training, including long-term technical courses, is permitted. Reopening of theatres comes as a respite for the reeling film industry. “Reopening theatres with night curfew doesn’t make sense. Theatres are allowed with half their seating capacity and night curfew means night shows that start after 7.30pm are not allowed,” said DR Jairaj, president, Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce. Even as many, including producers and exhibitors, want curfew to be lifted and theatres be allowed to take in audiences to full seating capacity, Jairaj has called a meeting of stakeholders on Monday following which he’ll lead a delegation to the CM. Health minister K Sudhakar was conspicuous by his absence at the meeting. Officials said his absence showed a lack of coordination in Covid management. They said Unlock 4.0 guidelines are not in sync with recommendations of the Technical Advisory Committee which reportedly had not permitted reopening of theatres. Revenue minister R Ashoka said temples are allowed to resume normal activities for devotees to have darshan and offer all sevas from Monday. However, guidelines notified by the chief secretary don’t mention it and officials said the relaxation is limited to only services mentioned. “The reopening of pubs was discussed but swimming pools did not figure in the talks. However, restrictions on temples have been removed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/unlock-4-0-night-curfew-cut-by-1hr-theatres-to-open-today/articleshow/84538130.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Haryana sees turnaround from big vaccine waster to a ‘surplus’ score||Gurgaon: All 22 districts of Haryana have achieved negative wastage of Covid-19 vaccines, meaning they have been able to squeeze extra doses from the vials at their disposal. Health department data till July 13 shows a significant turnaround in vaccine usage compared to March 31 when the number of doses wasted was more than 1.4 lakh. Till Mar- ch 31, the state had reported an overall 10% vaccine wastage, after which the health department directed all districts to ensure this was reduced. The state now has an overall -3% vaccine wastage. At 34,568, Gurgaon has got the most extra doses out of its vaccine stock. It is followed by Yamunanagar, which utilised 26,110 excess doses, Palwal (24,462), Panchkula (21,416), Sonipat (19,950), Nuh (16,130), Kurukshetra (15,959), Rewari (13,714), Hisar (13,297), Karnal (12,411), Rohtak (11,374), Kaithal (10,291), Bhiwani (10,138), Sirsa (10,069), Panipat (9,042), Jhajjar (7,682), Ambala (5,919), Charkhi Dadri (5,464), Faridabad (5,278), Fatehabad (3,938), Mahendergarh (1,721) and Jind (1,241). In terms of excess dosage as a percentage of vaccine allocated, Nuh (-13%) and Palwal (-7.5%) have done well. Covishield comes in vials of ten 0.5ml doses each and Covaxin in two sizes of 10 and 20 doses of 0.5ml each. Each vial has one or two doses more to account for spillage while drawing the vaccine. Once opened, the vial must be used up in four hours. Officials said with experience and emphasis on zero wastage, vaccinators in all districts had been sensitised. “All the districts have ensured vials are not opened without enough beneficiaries around,” said Dr Virender Ahlawat, state immunisation officer. “The first two months of the drive were limited to healthcare staff and frontline workers and vaccination was carried out at hospitals and workplaces. The demand picked up after the drive was extended to citizens. This led to better usage of the stock,” he added. He said districts had also prepared micro plans and increased capacity building of health staff and vaccinators. “We have had training sessions to monitor the same,” he added. Vaccinators said they had been given proper training to ensure negligible wastage of vaccine. “Each vial usually carries more than 10 doses. One dose is 0.5ml. We normally get 11 doses in a vial. The syringe which we are using has a capacity to hold 0.5ml drug, which helps in accurate measurement. Therefore, we do not fill less or more vaccines in the syringe and the recipient gets the required dose. We make sure that we do not spill while drawing the vaccine from the vial and don’t open a vial unless we have at least 10 people waiting to get inoculated,” said Pooma, a vaccinator at the Nathupur primary healthcare centre. She added that earlier, there was wastage as they were getting a smaller number of recipients. “Now, the wastage is negative because there is a huge rush at our sessions. We are administering the extra one or two doses which each vial contains to recipients as well,” she said. Four months ago, the state had logged a huge vaccine shortage. Till March 31, Faridabad had reported 10.1% wastage and Gurgaon 9.5%. The highest wastage in terms of percentage was seen in Nuh (14.6%), followed by Rohtak (13.8%), Charkhi Dadri (13%), Panipat (12.4%), Palwal (12.3%), Bhiwani (12.1%), Rewari (11.6%), Kaithal (11.5%), Yamunanagar (11.4%), Jhajjar (10.6%), Kurukshetra (10.5%), Jind (10.4%), Sonipat (10.4%), Mahendergarh (10%), Fatehabad (9.5%), Sirsa (9.3%), Karnal (7.5%), Ambala (7.3%) and Hisar (5.2%). According to the health department, recipients have shown eagerness to get the shots, which has reduced wastage substantially in all the districts. “There are strict instructions that no vial can be opened unless there are 10 people ready for the jab. If there are less than 10 people, they will be given tokens to come to the vaccination centre at a fixed time so that wastage can be eliminated. Also, we are getting 11-12 vials in both Covishield and Covaxin, which we are carefully saving. As the supply has been erratic, we are trying to not to waste any dose,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-sees-turnaround-from-big-vaccine-waster-to-a-surplus-score/articleshow/84536704.cms||Ipsita Pati

The 75-year-old, who has held the office four times before, won 165 votes — exceeding the 136 required — with 83 votes against him, parliament Speaker Agni Sapkota said. Deuba faces the immediate task of procuring vaccines and controlling the spread of Covid, which the government says has infected 6,67,109 people and killed 9,550.  Fewer than 4% of the country’s 30 million people have been fully vaccinated. “Combating Covid will be the first priority of the new government,” Deuba said in parliament. PM Narendra Modi congratulated Deuba on his success. “Best wishes for a successful tenure. I look forward to working with you to further enhance our unique partnership in all sectors, and strengthen our deep-rooted people-to-people ties,” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/nepals-new-pm-wins-trust-vote-amid-covid-19-crisis/articleshow/84539702.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Hospital admissions on the rise while Covid-19 cases fall||BENGALURU: Covid-19 cases may be on the decline in Bengaluru, but, in a worrying sign, hospital admissions of infected patients have doubled over the past few days. Bengaluru reported 1,674 positive cases between July 13 and 16 but witnessed 127 hospital admissions during the period. While the number of cases daily ranged between 400 and 462, the proportion of hospital admissions, however, increased. While Bengaluru reported 401 Covid-19 cases and saw 22 hospital admissions on July 13, there were 411 cases and 46 hospital admissions on July 16. While a serosurvey and genomic sequencing of samples in Bengaluru was approved last week, health department officials say it should have been commissioned much earlier to understand the pattern of the spread. A source in the health department said that the technical committee had insisted on genomic sequencing while the second wave was raging, but a decision on it was delayed. Health experts say the increase in hospital admissions might be small, but it could also portend what the future holds. Dr Anoop Amarnath, geriatrician and member of the state’s Covid-19 critical care support group, said the phenomenon is not restricted only to Bengaluru; some districts in the state are also witnessing a similar trend. “We are indeed seeing a small spurt in the number of hospitalisations and this also may be due to the marginal increase in the number of cases. Also, there may be contributions of the Delta variant that needs further corroboration with genomic data,” Dr Amarnath said. Dr Amarnath said appropriate Covid-19 behaviour will be a key factor as the easing of the lockdown has led to an increase in Covid-19 cases. “The severity of most cases is mild to moderate in terms of intensity of infection,” he added. Dr HM Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA), confirmed data from private hospitals shows an increase in the number of patients being admitted. And while the data is being studied, they are as yet unable to ascertain the reason since genomic data is unavailable, he added. Randeep D, BBMP special commissioner (health), confirmed that there has been a slight increase in the number of hospital admissions. He told TOI about 120 samples had been sent for genome sequencing and 60 of them were processed. It was found that 90% of these samples carried the Delta variant. “Two Delta Plus variant cases have also been reported from Bengaluru,” he said. “We are trying to analyse the data on patients admitted in hospitals to find out if they are from a particular age category, if they were vaccinated, whether they are cases of reinfection and other details,” he said. He said BBMP health officials will meet with PHANA to discuss the issue and understand their perspective Watch Covid-19: Cases fall in Bengaluru, but hospital admissions on the rise||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hospital-admissions-on-the-rise-while-cases-fall-in-bengaluru/articleshow/84539727.cms||Kiran Parashar

The mysterious accident has left the police groping in the dark. According to Shivdaspura SHO Bhupendra Singh, the accident took place on Saturday night when the victim, identified as Ganga Lal, was crossing the road to pay for fuel at a petrol pump. Car driver likely to have abandoned body on road“A car hit him and his body was later found at the SFS area in Mansarovar. It is suspected that the car driver may have been taking Ganga Lal to the hospital for treatment when he died en route,” he said. Sources suspect the car driver may have got cold feet and abandoned the body on the road. “We are investigating the case to ascertain what exactly transpired,” an official said. The location where the body was recovered is over 20km away from Shivdaspur and comes under the jurisdiction of Shipra Path police station. “Some people raised the possibility that Ganga Lal was stuck on the car’s roof and dragged all the way till Mansarovar, but that seems very unlikely,” Singh said. Meanwhile, Ganga Lal’s brother, Shivraj, gave a different version of the accident. He claimed that he was present when the accident took place and had last seen his brother hit by a car. “We were returning home from Bhankrota on bikes. Some people in our group took a halt to get petrol. My brother and I were crossing the road to pay the money at the pump. Just as I had crossed the road I heard a loud thud and when I looked back, I saw Ganga hit by the car,” he said, claiming that he had also informed the police about the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/body-of-30-year-old-hit-by-car-in-jaipur-found-20km-away/articleshow/84539692.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Reviving sales uphill task for car dealers as June euphoria ebbs||BHOPAL: After doing well in the month of June after the lockdown restrictions were eased, car and SUV sales are witnessing a decline in July. However, the dealers say that the sales are likely to be higher than the corresponding period in 2020. The bookings in the fourwheeler segment also reflect shifting of choice from cars to SUVs ever since automobile companies have launched compact SUVs and decline in the sales of diesel cars/SUVs with the diesel prices catching up with petrol. “Sales and inquiries in June was encouraging due to pending orders. However, it has slightly come down in July. Car dealers are now expecting sales to be higher than the sales during the corresponding month in 2020,” said president of Bhopal Automobile Association, Ashish Pandey. Talking about reasons for the decline in sales and inquiries, he said that prices of cars and SUVs have gone up in July and people are apprehensive of a third wave of Coronavirus and therefore they are trying to save funds or at least not spend their money where they can wait. The growing charm of SUVs as compared to cars is reflected in the booking figures of various four-wheeler producing companies at Bhopal and elsewhere in the state. While cars are available at most of these places off the shelf, there is booking of one month to a year for SUVs. “Tata Motors’s SUVs have a booking of 1 to 3 months,” said a marketing personnel with Tata Motors. Maruti is hoping for a 5 to 10% growth in sales as compared to previous year but its premium products are available off the shelf, said an executive at the counter of a Maruti Showroom in the city. Sales of Hundai saw a growth of 15% in June but in July, the sales and inquiries have dropped slightly, dealers said. Its new SUV model has a booking period of one to three months. Cars are available off the shelf here too. Compared to the corresponding month last year, dealers of the company at Bhopal expect a 10% growth. SUV models of Mahindra too have a waiting period of 3 months. Some of Kia’s brands have four months of booking but booking-inquiries have dropped slightly in July compared to last month. One of the brand of MG Motors also has a booking period of a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/reviving-sales-uphill-task-for-car-dealers-as-june-euphoria-ebbs/articleshow/84539729.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
