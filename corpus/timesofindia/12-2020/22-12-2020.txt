December 22, 2020||World||US issues additional visa restrictions on Chinese officials||WASHINGTON: The United States on Monday imposed additional visa restrictions on Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses, taking further action against Beijing in the final month of US President Donald Trump's term. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the restrictions affected officials believed to be responsible for or complicit in repressing religious practitioners, ethnic minority groups, dissidents and others. "China's authoritarian rulers impose draconian restrictions on the Chinese people's freedoms of expression, religion or belief, association, and the right to peaceful assembly. The United States has been clear that perpetrators of human rights abuses like these are not welcome in our country," he said in a statement. US-China relations have plunged to their worst level in decades as the world's top two economies spar over issues ranging from the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing's national security law for Hong Kong, trade and espionage. On Friday, Washington added dozens of Chinese companies, including top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp and drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, to a trade blacklist. Also on Monday, US Department of Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf said it was looking at further restrictions on China, which he called an ever-increasing threat to the United States. Wolf told the Heritage Foundation think tank these included tighter visa curbs on Chinese Communist Party members and a broader ban on goods made with forced labor. He said DHS was also reviewing the activities of Chinese television maker TCL Electronics Holdings. Wolf noted a State Department action this month to reduce the validity of US visas for members of China's ruling Communist Party to one month. "We're ... working with State to consider further restrictions on visa validity periods for CCP members," he added. He said DHS was "continuing to develop and hoped to soon issue" a region-wide ban covering "key categories of products produced with forced labor" in China's Xinjiang region. Wolf did not elaborate, but he was apparently referring to a broad import ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang that the Trump administration considered this year before opting for narrower bans on products from specific entities. US apparel makers have criticized a broader ban as impossible to enforce. Wolf said DHS would soon issue a business advisory cautioning against using data services and equipment from firms linked to China and said it was "reviewing entities such as the Chinese manufacturer TCL," the world's third largest manufacturer of TV sets. Wolf said it had been discovered this year that the firm had "incorporated backdoors into all its TV sets, exposing users to cyber breaches and data exfiltration." Wolf said DHS would soon release a "Strategic Action Plan to counter the People's Republic of China" that would draw on Trump's 2017 national security strategy and a 2020 document laying out a US strategic approach to Beijing. He did not elaborate on this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-restricts-visas-for-chinese-officials-suspected-of-rights-abuses/articleshow/79845737.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Bengaluru||Roddam Narasimha: Epitome of perfection and tolerance||It was 1983 when I first went looking for Narasimha. I was nine months into my graduate studies at Caltech, some 9,000 miles from home, when I realised how far my studies had drifted from the magic that first drew me into engineering — years of exposure to airplanes from my father who worked at HAL in Bengaluru. Roddam Narasimha was visiting the department of aerospace engineering and I thought I might seek his advice. Setting up the appointment was an intimidating prospect. My Brazilian friend Lacerda said his mentor rated Roddam the closest of anyone to the pinnacle of fluid dynamics. An Indian friend simply said that RN truly looked the part, a swashbuckling scientist dressed as sharply as the guy in Digjam suiting advertisements back home. When I finally met him, I was disarmed to find someone else entirely — calm and unperturbed by the competitive ways of the world, the image of my history teacher GK Nagarajan at National High School, Bengaluru. I discussed moving to aerospace with him and mentioned something about the turbulent world. He said Sarvam Turbulence Mayam in Sanskrit (the world is full of turbulence) and said he would have a word with the director, Liepmann. That was the first and last time I discussed research with professor Narasimha. For the past 37 years we have debated and discussed everything else: life, politics, religion, history, culture, tradition, the world and, yes, India. We would talk on the phone very often, and at his home, at NAL and NIAS; to me the N in these institutions meant Narasimha. I liked every bit of it; it softened my view of the world, especially India. It was in 2005 that I again came face to face with him at a meeting in Chicago. He had mellowed even more and looked very paternal. In 2009 I needed him the most when my mother suddenly passed away. He spoke at her funeral and handed me a copy of his own English translations of the Yogavasishta, an ancient dialogue about action in a morally complex and hugely imperfect world. From then on, I started worrying about Roddam incessantly. I approached him on the phone one day in 2012 and suggested a seminar series in his name at the new IIT Gandhinagar. His initial reaction was that such things were only done after one passes away. I said, “heaven can wait!”, and eventually he was convinced. I saw him next in the hotel lobby in Gandhinagar on the morning of the first seminar. I asked him over breakfast how he was settling in, and he launched into a tale about trekking to Lothal the previous day. While returning from Lothal, he visited Sabarmati Ashram, stringing together the foundation blocks of ancient India and the modern republic in a way I could tell deeply satisfied him. I have often wondered what I learned from arguing with RN all these years. I believe it was an appreciation of history and a strong belief that India will make it eventually. For this, I am eternally grateful. It is as if the two hands of wisdom, one of supreme perfection and the other of supreme tolerance, had reached consummation in Narasimha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/roddam-narasimha-epitome-of-perfection-and-tolerance/articleshow/79845819.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Bengaluru||Accountant accused of siphoning off Rs 2.7 crore||BENGALURU: The Bangalore Motor Owners Consumers Co-Operative Society has alleged that a 58-year-old accountant, Sathish Kumar Reddy, has misappropriated more than Rs 2.7 crore since April 2019. The incident came to light after a recent audit. Shankarapura police registered a case against Reddy, the company’s main accountant, based on a complaint filed by its secretary KA Anil Kumar. Reddy, who was responsible for financial transactions, had been irregular at work since the announcement of the nationwide lockdown, the complaint said, adding he was requested to complete the audit, which had to be submitted to the government by November 10. “But he did not attend work,” police said, quoting from the complaint. “...We came to know that Reddy had pocketed Rs 1.9 crore in 2019-2020 and Rs 78 lakh between April 2020 and November 1, 2020,” Kumar stated. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/accountant-accused-of-siphoning-off-2-7crore/articleshow/79845940.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Chennai||It’s Christmas, it’s the season to be jolly||We might be in the middle of a pandemic, but with Christmas — a season of merriment — just days away, quite a few streets and shopping malls in namma Chennai are sporting festive colours. Even as the COVID-19 situation has resulted in fewer than usual shoppers, on the streets of the city’s busiest shopping hub, T Nagar, once could spot many streetside shops selling Xmas trinkets, and attracting passersby. At night, the entire stretch dazzled, thanks to many shops putting up dazzling lights. And at this city mall, a major attraction was the ‘invisible man’, who was seen posing with shoppers for pics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/its-christmas-its-the-season-to-be-jolly/articleshow/79846128.cms||---
December 22, 2020||World||US Congress set to approve $900 billion stimulus package||WASHINGTON: US lawmakers are set to vote Monday on a $900 billion relief package to help millions of families and small businesses struggling amid the pandemic. As the Covid-19 death count rises amid a massive resurgence of the virus that again threatens the economy, Republican and Democratic legislators finally hammered out the plan late Sunday after months of wrangling and bitter debate over what to include. The deal will spare millions of jobless workers who were days away from seeing their unemployment benefits expire, and provide a new round of cash payouts. Small businesses will benefit from more government grants, while the package also includes rental assistance and help to families facing eviction. "It's a good bipartisan deal," Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday. "We will do some good with this legislation." But "as President-elect Joe Biden has said, it's a first step, and we will need to do more. More to get virus assistance to crush the virus. More money to buy vaccines," she said on the House floor. The House and Senate will have to vote on the bill, but it could go late into the night. Congressional leaders have pledged not to leave Washington until the package is approved. The world's largest economy is facing the world's largest coronavirus outbreak, and the virus returned with a vengeance in recent months threatening a tentative economic recovery. The death toll has topped 318,000. Recent data shows retail sales slowed heading into the usually-strong holiday shopping season, while new applications for unemployment benefits have risen for four of the past five weeks after months of declines. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the aid is not enough to deal with the crisis. "This bill is a start, but it is not the end of the story. Anyone who thinks this bill is enough hasn't heard the desperation in the voices of Americans," Schumer said on Twitter. The massive package is part of a $2.3 trillion "coronabus" bill that includes the omnibus bill to fund the government for the coming year. The measure will include a new round of pandemic relief payments, and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the $600 checks will go out as early as next week. That amounts to "$2,400 for a family of four, so much needed relief just in time for the holidays," Mnuchin said Monday on CNBC. While the direct payments are only half the amount provided by the $2.2 trillion CARES Act that Congress approved in March, Mnuchin said it is a "very fast way of getting money into the economy." The $600 payments go to Americans earning less than $75,000 a year, and would be reduced for higher incomes, while those who bring home $99,000 or more will not get a check. The largest provision is the $275 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) aid for businesses, which are government loans that convert to grants if spent on wages and rent. The agreement also contains $25 billion in rental assistance, extends an eviction moratorium for one month. Biden, who will be sworn in January 20, has welcomed the agreement but said much more will be needed to provide "support to struggling families, and investments in jobs and economic recovery," he said in a statement Sunday. Progressive New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez complained Monday that legislators still did not have copies of the more than 5,550-page bill. "It's not good enough to hear about what's in the bill. Members of Congress need to see & read the bills we are expected to vote on," she tweeted. Officials told reporters that software glitches delayed printing the massive document. After months of talk, the deal seemed endangered in the final days by a dispute over a Republican-backed provision to limit the ability of the US Federal Reserve to provide more emergency lending. But Democrats were able to block that move by Republican Senator Patrick Toomey, although they were not able to insert billions of dollars in aid to state and local governments on the front line of responding to the virus impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/congress-rushes-toward-vote-on-900-billion-covid-relief-bill/articleshow/79847024.cms||---

He vowed to quit Twitter if he was proven wrong. The saffron party, which has already set the campaign pitch in motion, was quick to react by saying that the country will lose a poll strategist, though without naming him. On Sunday, Union home minister Amit Shah had said BJP will cross 200 seats in the 294-seat Bengal assembly. Kishor, political strategist appointed by TMC, tweeted on Monday: “For all the hype amplified by a section of supportive media, in reality BJP will struggle to cross double digits.” Kishor even dared BJP to save this post on Twitter. “Please save this tweet and if BJP does any better I must quit this space.” For all the hype AMPLIFIED by a section of supportive media, in reality BJP will struggle to CROSS DOUBLE DIGITS in… https://t.co/g6446uRAyb— Prashant Kishor (@PrashantKishor) 1608526371000State minister and TMC leader Malay Ghatak tweeted in support, claiming that BJP will “struggle to cross double digits” in the 2021 polls.

December 22, 2020||World||US President-elect Joe Biden gets coronavirus vaccine as US inoculation effort mounts||NEWARK: US President-elect Joe Biden received his first injected dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on live on television on Monday in an effort to boost confidence in its safety ahead of its wide distribution next year. Biden has said he would make the fight against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 315,000 Americans and infected more than 17.5 million, his top priority when he takes office on Jan. 20. At age 78, he is in the high-risk group for the highly contagious respiratory disease. A Democrat, Biden will inherit the logistical challenges of distributing the vaccine to hundreds of millions of Americans, as well as the task of persuading people who worry its development was rushed for political reasons to take it. His black long-sleeved shirt rolled up, Biden received the injection from Tabe Masa, Nurse Practitioner and Head of Employee Health Services at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, in front of reporters. Images were carried live on television. After getting the shot, a dose of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc, Biden praised medical professionals as "heroes". "I'm doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it's available to take the vaccine. There's nothing to worry about," Biden said. His wife, Jill Biden, who got the injection earlier in the day, stood by. But Biden also noted that the vaccine would take time to roll out and that people should listen to medical experts and not travel for the upcoming holidays if possible. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would likely get the vaccine next week, Biden's transition team said. Republican President Donald Trump frequently has played down the severity of the pandemic and overseen a response health experts say was disorganized, cavalier and sometimes ignored the science behind disease transmission. 'New American economy'Efforts to limit the economic fallout on Americans from the pandemic were boosted on Sunday when congressional leaders agreed on a $900 billion package to provide the first new aid in months, with votes likely on Monday. Biden on Monday also named additional members to his National Economic Council (NEC), rounding out his economic policymaking team with people his transition office said would help lift Americans out of the economic crisis. David Kamin, an official in former President Barack Obama's White House, will be NEC deputy director, and Bharat Ramamurti, a former top economic adviser to Senator Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign, will serve as NEC deputy director for Financial Reform and Consumer Protection, Biden's team said in a statement. Joelle Gamble will be special assistant to the president for economic policy. "This is no time to build back the way things were before — this is the moment to build a new American economy that works for all," Biden said in the statement. Biden had already named Brian Deese, who helped lead Obama's efforts to bail out the automotive industry and negotiate the Paris climate agreement, to lead the council, which coordinates the country's economic policymaking. Much of the fate of Biden's White House agenda will hinge on the outcome of a pair of Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine which party controls the upper chamber of the US Congress. Harris traveled on Monday to Columbus, Georgia, to campaign on behalf of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, the Democratic candidates locked in tight races with incumbent Republicans. At a drive-in rally for the candidates, Harris, currently a California senator, said she would return to Washington later in the day to vote on the stimulus package. Asked by one journalist whether there were plans to "fumigate" the White House over virus concerns before the Biden administration moved in, Harris said: "I don't have the current status for that." Trump was briefly hospitalized in October with Covid-19, and many of his advisers and White House staff have also contracted the virus. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and White House adviser, was also set to campaign in Georgia for Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. The outgoing president, making unsubstantiated claims of widespread electoral fraud, has focused on trying to overturn his election loss in recent weeks, even as daily Covid-19 deaths soared. His campaign's latest long-shot effort was a petition to the US Supreme Court on Sunday that legal experts said would fail.

December 22, 2020||India||TDP ex-MP used fake firms to loot 7,000 crore||HYDERABAD: The CBI has said Hyderabad-based Transstroy India Private Limited, which is embroiled in one of the biggest banking frauds in the country worth Rs 7,296 crore, had created fictitious firms in the name of maids, sweepers and drivers and made them directors to divert funds. Transstroy is owned by former TDP MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao. In its FIR, CBI alleged that firms like Padmavati Enterprises, Unique Engineers, Balaji Enterprises and Ruthwik Associates swindled Rs 6,643 crore. “Nine firms are non-existent. They have been created to run fraudulent operations with the help of employees,” it alleged. A KPMG forensic audit revealed that the accused had borrowed Rs 9,394 crore from Canara Bank and 13 other banks. The CBI’s banking fraud and securities cell in Bengaluru issued the FIR against Transstroy, Sambasiva Rao, company’s CMD Cherukuri Sridhar and director Akkineni Satish. A case was lodged under sections of the IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act. Rao, however, denied any fraud and said the CBI had wrongly filed the FIR. He said he had taken only Rs 700 crore loan. For instance, Padmavati Enterprises had Sudhakar Babu Gorantla, an employee of Transstroy, as director. Later, the firm diverted Rs 1,848 crore. Similarly, Unique Engineers had an invoice associated with M Sambasiva Rao, a former director of Transstroy. The CBI said Rs 7,153 crore was first transferred from Transstroy account to nine vendors — Padmavathi Enterprises, Balaji Enterprises, Ruthwik Associates, Unique Engineers, Subhakari Enterprises, Agastya Trade Links Private Ltd, Khanala Trading India, AS Associates and Vijay Engineering Equipment — and Rs 6,202 crore was brought back to Transstroy account. The amount was later diverted to related parties, special purpose vehicles and others. An amount of Rs 350 crore was transferred into the accounts of promoters. When the accounts of Sridhar and director R Leela Kumar were checked (between 2012 and 2014), it was found that Rs 450 crore was transferred from the accounts of specific vendors. “The company has also indulged in tampering of its balance sheet,” the CBI alleged. Transstroy’s book of accounts had shown that Rs 719 crore was written off as on April 1, 2016, stating that the unbilled revenue was treated as a sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tdp-ex-mp-used-fake-firms-to-loot-7000-crore/articleshow/79848034.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
December 22, 2020||India||Facebook says system error blocked page of kisan platform||NEW DELHI: A day after Facebook briefly shut out and then restored the official page of Kisan Ekta Morcha (KEM), the social media giant put out a detailed statement clarifying that “an error on the part of its automated systems” had led to the blocking. “As per our review, our automated systems found an increased activity on the Facebook page kisanektamorcha and flagged it as spam, which violates our Community Standards. We restored the page in less than three hours when we became aware of the context,” Facebook said in a statement. Facebook’s decision of unpublishing KEM’s page had drawn some sharp reactions from activists and politicians, who had accused the company of stifling dissent. Facebook, however, denied these allegations. “The vast majority of our work fighting spam is done automatically using recognizable patterns of problematic behaviour. For example, if an account is posting over and over in quick succession that’s a strong sign something is wrong,” Facebook said in a statement shared with TOI. The company also cited examples from the third quarter of 2020, when the social media giant unpublished nearly 2 billion pieces of content through automated systems for violating their spam policies, but restored several of them after a scrutiny by the human review team. “In Q3, 2020 out of the 1.9 billion pieces of content removed globally for violating our policies on spam, we restored 74.9 mn pieces of content globally, when we identified issues ourselves,” said a Facebook spokesperson. Farmers’ bodies have increased their digital presence to counter what they call a misinformation campaign against the protest. They have made accounts across social media platforms to generate awareness about their struggle against the three controversial bills, and their pages have garnered thousands of followers. KEM is one of the most popular pages. On YouTube, KEM has over 658k subscribers. On Facebook, KEM page has 132k followers, and on Instagram 95.5k.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/facebook-says-system-error-blocked-page-of-kisan-platform/articleshow/79848059.cms||Anam Ajmal
December 22, 2020||India||8 years on, Muslim man in interfaith marriage converts||AGRA: Eight years after he married a Hindu woman, a Muslim man from Aligarh has converted to Hinduism “with help from” a Hindutva outfit. Qasim Khan, 28, is now Karamveer Singh. “No one forced me. I took this decision on my own,” he said on Monday. Qasim had met Anita Kumari, 24, when his father had leased a house from hers for a construction workshop. The two fell in love and got married in 2012. Anita’s family was not entirely on board and, a year later, the couple organised another wedding ceremony, this time following Hindu rituals. Her family moved to Delhi, the couple stayed on in Aligarh and had two kids — Kasifa (7) and Ayaz (4). Now, less than a month after the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance 2020 came into effect, Qasim has converted to Hinduism. Qasim said he needs protective cover. “I had sought security from the district administration but they didn’t get back to me. I request the government again, I need protection,” he told TOI. Anita added, “I was never asked to convert or not follow Hindu rituals.” For his own conversion, the “helping hand” came from the local unit of a Hindutva outfit. Neeraj Bhardwaj, a member of the outfit, who got Qasim converted, told TOI, “They are welcome to the fold of Hindu religion. We did the rituals at Arya Samaj temple on Sunday.” He said Qasim had applied for a legal conversion to the district magistrate on December 15. But after he got no response for five days, the temple took over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/8-years-on-muslim-man-in-interfaith-marriage-converts/articleshow/79848079.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
December 22, 2020||India||HC stops Karnataka bid to drop 61 cases against politicians||BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court on Monday passed an interim order directing authorities not to take further steps following the cabinet decision of August 31, 2020, to withdraw from the prosecution in 61 cases. The cases sought to be withdrawn include those against ministers JC Madhuswamy, Anand Singh, BC Patil, and former minister CT Ravi, and the CM’s political secretary, MP Renukacharya. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka passed the order after the state government sought further time to submit compliance report vis-a-vis its December 1 order. On December 1, as per Supreme Court’s directive in the SK Shukla case, the high court had pointed out that the public prosecutor “cannot act like a post box or act on the dictates of the state government” and he must act objectively as he is also an officer of the court. The state government was further told to forward copies of its December 1 order to the public prosecutors to whom instructions have been given to withdraw from prosecution in those 61 cases. The bench pointed out the public prosecutors are bound to invite attention of the court to its order when an application is made under Section 321 of the CrPC. “Moreover, action under Section 321 can be taken only with the permission of the court. No court is bound by such a decision taken to withdraw from the prosecution. Even if an application is made under Section 321 of CrPC, the courts are duty bound to assess whether prima facie case is made out or not and that the court has power to reject the prayer,” the bench had observed in their previous order. The court has now posted hearing on the two PILs to January 29, and the state must submit a compliance report by then. In their PIL, People’s Union for Civil Liberties, Karnataka, claimed that some of the cases sought be withdrawn by exercising powers under Section 321 of CrPC are those pending against the elected representatives, who are a part of the state legislature, and such an action is impermissible. In the second PIL, city advocate Sudha Katwa cited that a number of cases filed against lawmakers and their followers are sought to be withdrawn in a series of orders passed between August 8, 2014, and May 5, 2020. She claimed that it is not only misuse of powers vested under Section 321, but also affects the public at large and doesn’t augur well for the criminal justice system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-stops-karnataka-bid-to-drop-61-cases-against-politicians/articleshow/79848109.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Business||Five measures that may end deadlock over new farm laws||NEW DELHI: With thousands of farmers stepping up pressure on the government to repeal the three new agricultural laws, an SBI report on Monday suggested a five-point strategy to resolve the deadlock. The government had passed three agricultural bills in September with the aim to change the way agricultural produce is marketed, sold and stored across the country. The laws will allow farmers to trade freely without any license or stock limit and lead to increase in availability of buyers for the produce, the report states. However, the farmers fear the laws will lead to the end of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system and want them to be withdrawn. The SBI Ecowrap report suggests five ways that could end the impasse over the new laws: 1) Provide quantity guarantee instead of priceThe report suggests that the government can insert a quantity guarantee clause for a minimum period of 5 years instead of MSP as a price guarantee. This would ensure that procurement to production percentage of crops is at least equal to last years' percentage except in events like droughts, floods, etc. "Historical procurement trends indicate that only 25 to 35 per cent of total wheat production has been procured over the years, with largest procurement happening through Punjab and Haryana. While, in case of rice, procurement has been in range of 30 to 40 per cent with significant procurement by Telangana, Punjab, Haryana and Kerala," the report noted.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); In the recent kharif procurement regime, Punjab has witnessed a staggering procurement of 55 per cent even though it ranks third in paddy production. While, procurement from top paddy producing states of West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh has been nil and 8 per cent, respectively.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); However, most government procurement centres in Punjab, Haryana and a few other states are located within the notified APMC mandis. Farmers fear that encouraging tax-free private trade outside these mandis will make these markets unviable and thereby lead to reduction in government procurement. 2) Convert MSP into floor price on eNAMThe SBI report further suggested that MSP regime be converted to floor price of auction on National Agriculture Market (eNAM) portal. eNAM is a pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the existing APMC mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. These were formed to provide a common online market platform to facilitate trade and provide better price discovery through transparent auction process based on quality of produce. At present, there are about 1,000 APMC mandis, 1.45 lakh traders and 1.67 crore farmers registered on eNAM.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); However, the report admits that converting MSP to a floor price of auction on the eNAM portal will not completely solve the problem as the current data shows that average modal prices in e-NAM mandis is lower than the minimum support price in all commodities except urad.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); 3) Strengthen APMC market infrastructureEfforts must also continue to strengthen APMC market infrastructure, the report said. As per estimates, the monetary loss for cereals is almost Rs 27,000 crore due to harvest and post-harvest losses. While the losses for oilseeds and pulses are Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore, respectively. After production, the produce undergoes multiple rounds of post-harvest operations, handling stages and storage before finally reaching the consumer. Each stage results into some losses which in turn leads to decrease in food availability.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); A 2015 report showed that 4.6-6 per cent cereals, 6.4-8.4 per cent pulses, 3.1-10 per cent oilseeds, 6.7-15.9 per cent fruits, and 4.6-12.4 per cent vegetables are lost during harvest, post-harvest operations, handling and storage.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); 4) Establish contract farming institutionContract farming involves an agreement between a farmer and a buyer which outline conditions for production, quality or grade of product required, terms and timeline for delivery at a pre-determined price. Establishing a contract farming institution in India that will give the exclusive right to oversee price discovery will prove beneficial, especially for small and marginal farmers as they often tend to get crowded out from the growth process, the report suggests. It will enable them to deal with large buyers as large firms often attract small growers with favourable conditions and later tightens them. Contract farming has been instrumental in providing growers access to supply chains with market and price stability, as well as technical assistance. For example, Thailand had the most extensive and widest range of crops by early 1990s. Its market certainty (52 per cent) and price stability (46 per cent) were prime factors due to which farmers participated in contract farming.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); 5) Need for flexible KCC normsThe Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was introduced in 1998 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for issue of KCC to farmers on the basis of their holdings for uniform adoption by the banks. The KCC enables farmers to obtain short term loans at an interest rate of 4 per cent. On timely payment of the loan, the limit can be extended up to an amount of Rs 3 lakh. The card holder also get the facility of insurance which can provide protection to the notified crops. As of March, about Rs 7,09,500 crore KCC loans were given to 6.7 crore active KCC card users, which constitute about 40 per cent of the total agricultural loans given by them. During February-April, banks received 75 lakh KCC applications out of which 36 lakh have been issued. However, the KCC portfolio of banks has come under increasing stress due to a variety of factors like crop losses, unremunerated prices, debt waivers and the rigidity of the KCC product. Therefore, SBI Ecowrap suggests that RBI, in conjunction with the government, must introduce an operational flexibility in the structure and direct the banks to allocate a specific percentage of their loans to particularly agri start-ups to give a boost to agri supply chains in India. As per the model calculations, the SBI believes that income of farmers will rise by a sharp 35 per cent by revisiting the current scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/report-lists-5-measures-that-may-end-deadlock-over-new-farm-laws/articleshow/79848012.cms||---
December 22, 2020||India||Job on compassionate grounds is no bar for remarriage, says HC||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has recently held that a husband's appointment on compassionate ground will not take away his fundamental right to remarry. Dismissing a writ petition filed by one Mohammad Haidar from Amroha, Justice Pankaj Mithal said, “The rules nowhere stipulate that any permission is required by a person employed on a compassionate basis for remarriage. It only provides that the person employed on a compassionate basis shall maintain other members of the family of the deceased government servant. “It also provides that in case he neglects or refuses to maintain them, his services may be terminated. This does not mean that there is any rider on the right of the employee to remarry. This is what has also been laid down by this court in the case of Smt. Santoshi v. State of UP and two others, in writ-A No. 834 of 2020, decided on January 21, 2020,” Justice Mithal said. It has been observed in January 21, 2020 order that the right to marry with a person of choice is an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution of India (protection of life and personal liberty). Merely because the petitioner has been appointed on compassionate basis, he cannot be forced to sacrifice his/her fundamental right of remarriage, after the death of the earlier spouse. A person would not earn any disqualification on this score and warrant any disciplinary proceedings. In this case, the petitioner, Mohammad Haider, was appointed on the compassionate basis after the death of his wife. Thereafter, he wanted to marry the younger sister of his wife. Therefore, he sought permission from Basic Shiksha Adhikari where he is employed to get remarried. When he didn't get any response, he moved the high court for relief. Rejecting the petitioner's plea, however, the court said that no permission was required for remarriage. “As there is no statutory requirement under law for seeking permission of Basic Shiksha Adhikari for the purpose of remarriage by an employee, who has been appointed on the compassionate basis, I am of the opinion that the petitioner has unnecessarily invoked the writ jurisdiction of this court,” the court said in its order passed on November 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/job-on-compassionate-grounds-is-no-bar-for-remarriage-says-hc/articleshow/79848113.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
December 22, 2020||India||Woman loses faith in judge, court shifts case to another bench||MUMBAI: Observing that justice is not only to be done, but it should also be seen to have been done, Dindoshi sessions court’s additional principal judge, in a rare move, has allowed an alleged 26-year-old sexual abuse survivor’s plea to transfer the accused’s anticipatory bail plea to another court room after the woman complained the judge had not even heard the matter before granting him interim relief from arrest, reports Rebecca Samervel. “In fact, the judge should hear the parties before granting any relief. In the present case, it appears that the intervener (the woman) has lost faith in the judge. So, in my opinion, in order to avoid further complications, it would be just and proper to transfer the anticipatory bail application to any other court. It would not cause any harm to the accused if the matter is transferred to any other court,” the additional principal judge said. Both the prosecution and the accused had opposed the woman’s plea. The woman, in her FIR, has accused the man of outraging her modesty and of criminal intimidation. She said cops did not arrest the accused, and therefore, he had sufficient time to file an anticipatory bail plea. The woman further submitted she wanted to intervene and oppose his plea as she had been receiving continuous threats to settle the matter and withdraw the criminal complaint. The woman in her plea seeking the transfer told the court she had submitted the intervention application opposing the anticipatory bail of the accused on December 1. She said the matter was adjourned and two days later, when at 4.30 pm it was finally called out, without hearing anyone, the judge passed the order and granted the accused interim relief. The plea was then adjourned. The woman alleged the judge had not even not opened the case file before pronouncing the order in favour of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/woman-loses-faith-in-judge-court-shifts-case-to-another-bench/articleshow/79848119.cms||Rebecca Samervel
December 22, 2020||India||In message to China, Modi bats for fair code in South China Sea||NEW DELHI: China's shadow loomed over the India-Vietnam virtual summit on Monday with PM Narendra Modi stressing to his counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc that negotiations for a Code of Conduct (CoC) in the disputed South China Sea (SCS) waters should not undermine the interests of other countries or third parties in the region while hailing Hanoi as a pillar of India's Act East policy. The summit saw the two countries sign seven agreements in areas as diverse as defence, petrochemicals and renewable and nuclear energy with the highlight being a framework agreement for cooperation between defence industries. The agreement is expected to help Vietnam utilise two defence lines of credit India announced earlier, $500 million and $100 million, for the Asean country. Modi's reiteration of India's position on CoC is significant as both India and the US fear that China could influence Asean countries into accepting an agreement that ignores the rights of third countries that are not party to the South China Sea disputes. Beijing has so far seemed reluctant to incorporate or acknowledge these rights in the CoC. Held a Virtual Summit H.E. Nguyen Xuan Phuc, PM of Vietnam. We reviewed our cooperation on bilateral, regional and… https://t.co/rIGFO5eyzI— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1608567945000India and Vietnam announced implementation of the High Speed Guard Boat (HSGB) manufacturing project for Vietnam Border Guard Command under the $100 million line of credit with India handing over a completed vessel. Seven more HSGBs will be manufactured in Vietnam. As defence remains the central pillar of India's comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam, both leaders also agreed to further institutionalise such exchanges through mutual logistics support, regular ship visits, joint exercises, exchanges in military science and technology, information sharing, and also cooperation in UN peacekeeping. As expected, in the light of growing Chinese expansionism which has affected both India and Vietnam, the two countries discussed the security situation in the SCS in detail with both leaders reaffirming the importance of maintaining peace, stability, security and freedom of navigation and overflight in the region. In a joint vision document, they also underlined the significance of pursuing peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), without resorting to threat or use of force. "Both leaders underscored the importance of non-militarisation and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities by claimants and all other states, and avoidance of actions that could further complicate the situation or escalate disputes affecting peace and stability," the document said. Modi reiterated that Vietnam was an important pillar of India's Indo-Pacific vision. "Both leaders agreed to explore practical cooperation based on convergences between our Indo-Pacific Oceans’ Initiative (IPOI) and the Asean Outlook on Indo-Pacific (AOIP) which Vietnam subscribes to," MEA secretary (east) Riva Ganguly Das said. Importantly for India, as the countries prepare to take over as non-permanent members of the UNSC, Vietnam resolved to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism, terror financing networks and safe havens, and said it would be put into action through greater coordination in bilateral, regional and global efforts. While Vietnam is encouraging India to invest more in its oil and gas sector, another contentious area with China given the SCS disputes, the focus on renewable energy is something new in bilateral ties. There was a discussion in the context of both India and Vietnam concurrently serving as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council, Das said. "Both prime ministers agreed that India and Vietnam should work closely to actively promote ‘reformed multilateralism’ to make international organisations, including the UN Security Council, more representative, contemporary and capable of dealing with current challenges. Vietnam reiterated its strong support for India’s permanent membership in an expanded UNSC," she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-message-to-china-modi-bats-for-fair-code-in-south-china-sea/articleshow/79848125.cms||Sachin Parashar

December 22, 2020||India||Cops raid instant loan app offices in Gurugram, Hyderabad; link traced to Jakarta||HYDERABAD: Special teams of the Hyderabad police on Monday raided four instant loan app finance offices in Gurugram and Hyderabad, even as investigations showed that the entire illegal operation was run from Jakarta, reports Srinath Vudali. Avinash Mohanty, Hyderabad joint commissioner of police (detective department), said 30 loan apps were run by these four firms, two each in Gurugram and in Hyderabad. “In these four offices, there were nearly 1,000 employees who were working as tele-callers. We are still probing how their operations are being done. We are questioning several persons,” he told TOI. Officials suspect that some Chinese nationals based in Jakarta and elsewhere could be involved. “It is too early to comment any further on this,” he added. Probe is also on to ascertain whether the existing directors of these firms are dummy people, working at the behest of Chinese nationals, police sources said. So far, three persons, including a software engineer and a woman agriculture officer of Telangana, killed themselves after they were humiliated for loan defaults on social media and their contacts harassed by these forms. On Monday, more people knocked the doors of various police stations, saying they were harassed for delay in repayment by a few hours. Police said the employees of these four call centres manage disbursement of loans and in recovery of money by harassing defaulters and the people on their phone contacts. Raids in the city were conducted in a prominent commercial complex in Greenlands and another office located in Prakash Nagar. They have seized at least two servers belonging to these offices located in India. Several people were taken into custody and it has to be seen whether they will be arrested on Tuesday, or they will be let off after serving notice to reappear for probe, sources said. Apart from these 30 apps operated by these four companies, officers said there are dozens of such companies spread across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cops-raid-instant-loan-app-offices-in-gurugram-hyderabad-link-traced-to-jakarta/articleshow/79848217.cms||Srinath Vudali

The secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia is a complication which is caused due to inflammation in the air sacs present inside the lungs. According to the experts, complication can lead to fluid build-up inside the cavity, which can make it harder for a person to breath. Shortness of breath, coughing, chest pains, fatigue and fever are some of the common complications related with pneumonia. AIIMS-Patna nodal officer for Covid, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said the post-Covid syndrome has two issues that people suffers even after recovery, from complications for over three months and full blown pneumonitis. “In the latter case, even if a patient tested Covid negative, the lungs infection remained there. It is because of two reasons — super added bacterial infection and interstitial thickening in lungs,” he said. “The super added bacterial infection causing pneumonitis is more dangerous for post-Covid recovery patients, because the lung has already been weakened by the coronavirus. During winter, the number of pneumonia cases increases, which can be caused by viruses, bacteria and fungi. However, the bacterial one is more lethal for Covid recovered patients,” Dr Sanjeev said. As per the doctors at AIIMS-P, about 4-5 such cases were coming to the hospital per day. However, the institute referred them to PMCH or IGIMS as it was only admitting Covid patients. Talking about the precautions that one should take after recovering from Covid, Dr Sanjeev said people should use face mask, avoid gathering till their lungs are fully recovered, keep themselves safe from pollution, dust and cold as the immunity weakens during winter season. Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha, medical nodal officer at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, said though the number of Covid-19 patients declined at the hospital, more cases of full-blown pneumonitis were coming. “They are having cough, flu, fever and cold, all the common symptoms of Covid, but their Covid test came negative. After that we did the CT scan and antibody test, which showed the presence of pneumonia and antibody against Covid,” he said. He added: “So, it means they are recovered from Covid but infected with super added bacterial infection.” PMCH also witnessed a marginal rise in post-Covid pneumonia cases last few week. Principal Dr Vidyapati Choudhary advised patients who have recovered from Covid to continue monitoring themselves for temperature and oxygen saturation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-city-hospitals-report-rise-in-post-covid-pneumonia-cases/articleshow/79844319.cms||Faryal Rumi
December 22, 2020||Business||Mahindra arm Ssangyong applies for bankruptcy||Chennai: 10 years after Mahindra paid $464 million for a majority stake in Ssangyong Motor, the South Korean company has filed for bankruptcy after defaulting on loan repayments. Earlier this year, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), which holds 75% stake in the company, had said that it was freezing investments in Ssangyong. It was looking to reduce stake and discussions were on with potential investors. In a BSE filing, M&M said Ssangyong has “intimated to the Korean stock exchange, about filing an application for commencement of rehabilitation procedure with the Seoul bankruptcy court under the Debtor Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act of South Korea”.Last week, Ssangyong had defaulted on loan dues worth Rs 408 crore to lenders including JP Morgan, BNP Paribas and Bank of America (BoA). The payments were due on December 14. Ssangyong’s total default amount included approximately Rs 136 crore principal and Rs 13 lakh interest to JP Morgan, around Rs 68 crore principal and Rs 7 lakh interest to BNP Paribas and about Rs 204 crore principal and Rs 19 lakh interest to BoA. The loan default came at a time when M&M was in talks with American auto retailer HAAH Automotive for a stake sale in Ssangyong. “Ssangyong has also applied for an autonomous restructuring support (ARS) programme, which is a court-designed process,” said M&M’s BSE filing. “If the court approves the ARS, Ssangyong will continue to function under the supervision of its board and will negotiate with stakeholders to reach an understanding about a revival package, which may include equity and debt financing and other related actions,” added the statement. Ssangyong has outstanding loans worth around Rs 680 crore. Mahindra has invested over $100 million in the company since takeover. Ssangyong was a bankruptcy-protected asset and M&M was chosen as the preferred bidder from a host of offers. M&M’s share price on the BSE closed over 6% down on Monday at Rs 686.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mahindra-arm-ssangyong-applies-for-bankruptcy/articleshow/79845662.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Siraj Hussain, senior visiting fellow, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), said the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) system need to bring more competition for better price realization. Sudha Narayanan, research fellow at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), said the new agriculture Acts are more from the perspective of supply-chain factors and less from producers, small and marginal farmers. “There is a spatial inequality in terms of how buyers procure and depends on geographical areas ... The Contract Farming Act will not make any change for the women farmers,” she said. Vikas Rawal, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, felt a greater need to increase investments but whether only these laws will be enough for increasing private investment and may not create greater competition but rather monopolize power. N Vijayalakshmi, principal secretary, government of Bihar, said the diversification of crops is a complex issue but can be done. “Planning of agriculture growth as per the climate of the state can be a regular exercise and the researchers or policymakers can meet and discuss for 10 days before the farming cycle for next steps,” she said. Suhkhpal Singh, professor at IIM-Ahmedabad, said the government is not putting the farmers first on the reform agenda. Prabhat Ghosh stated that reform should be introduced in APMC Act instead of repealing it. “We should address the prevailing challenges. Because the people who create problems in APMC will also create challenges in future for the new reforms as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-discuss-new-farm-laws/articleshow/79844232.cms||---

The required visibility of 1,000m was achieved after 10.45 am and the first flight of SpiceJet’s SG- 8719 from Ahmedabad landed here at 11 am, which was scheduled to land at 7.45 am. Around five flights suffered a delay of more than one hour, including three of SpiceJet and two of GoAir. Patna airport officials said several fights on Delhi route got delayed due to inclement weather. However, no diversion or cancellation took place on Monday. Giving an update on fog alert delay in flight operations, Patna airport tweeted on Monday morning: “Due to Dense Fog at Patna Airport, all departures/arrivals and their consequential flights likely to be affected. Passengers are requested to get the updated status of flights from concerned Airlines before starting the journey for the airport to avoid any inconvenience (sic).” Despite the alert, the passengers were irked due to congestion at terminal building and long-queue at security check-ins. “It is frustrating that no Covid protocol has been followed at the city airport. Besides, long queues increase the anxiety,” said Aman Kumar, a banker, who was flying to Delhi. Aastha Priyadarshi, who is travelling to Bengaluru said she caught her flight at the eleventh hour due to huge rush at the departure gate. “It is better to come early at the city airport and sit for an hour inside the terminal building than to caught up in a long queue. I have seen passengers are worried whether they will reach the boarding gates on time including me,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/18-flights-get-delayed/articleshow/79844285.cms||Faryal Rumi
December 22, 2020||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Elephant herd ransacks house of estate worker||UDHAGAMANDALAM: A herd of five elephants ransacked a house at Periakarumbalam near Coonoor triggering panic among residents of the area in the early hours of· Monday. However, the residents of the house escaped unhurt. The herd also damaged a vegetable field nearby. The herd consisting of two male and three female elephants entered Periakarumbalam from Kundha range of forests a few days ago. “As the area has been covered with thick mist for the past few days, we could not track the herd during the night hours. However, we have been giving warning to the locals not to venture out after sunset and early morning,” Coonoor forest range officer Sasikumar said. The herd, however, ransacked the house of an estate worker in Periakarumbalam in the wee hours of Monday. “As we had been tracking the elephant, we alerted the residents of the house in Periakarumbalam and they escaped through the back door. The elephant damaged the front portion of the house”, the forest official said. A team, comprising 15 forest staff, has been formed to track the elephants. “We don’t want to disturb the jumbos. We are monitoring them carefully,” Sasikumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/elephant-herd-ransacks-house-of-estate-worker/articleshow/79846960.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Business||Virus variant: Sensex tanks 1,407 points||Mumbai: News of suspension of flights to the UK from several countries pulled the sensex down by 2,000 points in late trades on Monday. The flight suspension had triggered fears of fresh lockdowns across the world to contain the coronavirus’s new variant, which spreads faster than the earlier virus. With Reliance, HDFC Bank and HDFC leading the slide, the index closed 3% or 1,407 points lower at 45,554 points. Monday’s crash was the biggest one for the sensex in seven months, BSE data showed. Strong selling on Monday also left investors poorer by Rs 6.6 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 178.7 lakh crore. The day’s slide in the sensex came on the back of a Rs 324-crore net selling by foreign funds, according to BSE data. This was the first net outflow by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) since November 25, CDSL data showed. As a result of this foreign fund selling, all of the 30 sensex constituents closed in the red. Nestle, down 1%, was the best performer while ONGC, with a loss of 9.2%, was at the bottom of the table. In sensex’s four-digit loss on Monday, RIL accounted for 155 points, HDFC Bank 145 points and ICICI Bank 143 points, BSE data showed. After a steady start, the markets plunged in the wake of European bourses opening deep in the red. According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, the situation worsened with the weak start of the European markets in reaction to the news of a strict lockdown in the UK. “The recent spurt of Covid-19 cases in the UK has spooked markets world over as the new variant could increase the transmission rate. Now, the next step is strict travel restrictions, which would dent the economic recovery,” Mishra said. For Tuesday’s session, the signs are ominous, market players said. First, Wall Street opened sharply lower and, if it ends deep in the red, that could trigger a fresh selloff on Dalal Street. In addition, Monday’s sharp slide in the domestic market could lead to margin calls by brokers from their clients. Margin money is the regulator-mandated security deposit that every trader and speculator should keep with the exchange to be able to trade smoothly. In case the client suffers loss due to a slide in the market, on top of that setback the client will need to deposit extra funds with the exchange to continue to trade. If the client fails to make up for the margin deficit, the broker could put the client’s stocks on the block, compounding the already existing bearish sentiment and adding to the overall selloffs. Dealers fear such a margin deficit-induced selling may hit the Street on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/virus-variant-sensex-tanks-1407-pts/articleshow/79847020.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Business||Car discounts fail to cheer this December||CHENNAI: A reduced inventory with car dealers due to maintenance shutdowns by auto companies has resulted in little or no discounts this December. Traditionally, December is one of the best months for picking up a bargain. However, this year, incentives are down 67% in SUVs, 61% in sedans and 28% in hatchbacks. The only segment where they are up are MPVs, where incentive count increased by 11%, data from Jato, a firm that tracks auto sector prices, showed. Average SUV discounts and incentives have crashed from Rs 57,569 in December 2019 to Rs 19,075 in December 2020, Jato data showed. In sedans, the average benefit package is down from Rs 53,154 to Rs 20,546, while in hatchbacks it is down from Rs 31,840 to Rs 22,906. Dealers say the pick in festival retail means the stock pipeline is not overloaded and many manufacturers are still struggling to hit peak capacity. “Most OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) have gone for maintenance shutdowns this month for inventory correction after the festival season. While some inventory build-up has happened after the festival season, it is definitely not as high as it used to be so there are supply-side constraints,” said Nikunj Sanghi of JS Fourwheel Motor, a Mahindra dealership. Inventory levels are the lowest for in-demand compact SUVs followed by sedans and hatchbacks, he added. According to dealer sources, December inventory levels typically range from 4-6 weeks. The slowdown prompted a sharp stock correction in December 2019 but even then inventory level at dealerships was between 25 and 35 days. Currently, it is less than 3 weeks. “For 2-3 months, our retail sales have been up to 25% higher than wholesale, which has led to dealer stocks being much lighter this December,” said Naveen Soni, SVP, sales and services, Toyota Kirloskar Motor. As a result, the company has not rolled out its usual ‘Remember December’ sales promotion scheme to liquidate year-end stock. The other factor that is compounding the supply crunch is the low availability of diesel models. “There is a definite demand supply mismatch because in passenger vehicles, most of the diesel models are not available. The festive season saw better passenger vehicle sales as compared to last year. The year-end discounts are always based on availability of stocks, which are unusually low. In fact, dealers are losing sales because passenger vehicles are seeing retail demand in December too,” said Vinkesh Gulati, president, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA). The reason for the diesel skew is a parts supply issue. “Diesel components have a limited number of vendors and the biggest among them is Bosch, which has production constraints because of the second round of lockdown in Europe, where some of their manufacturing units are located,” said Sanghi.The upshot of all this is that dealers are not being able to service the backorders for models, which are in high demand. “Manufacturers don’t have stocks and dealers are carrying very little stock. There are back orders but for want of vehicles dealerships have not been able to retail,” said a Bengaluru-based Honda dealer. Already companies like Maruti, Honda, Mahindra and BMW have announced price hikes in January 2021, citing rise in raw material costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/car-discounts-fail-to-cheer-this-december/articleshow/79845636.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
December 22, 2020||Business||IPO proceeds rose 40% from last year||Chennai: Despite the pandemic and the resulting economic recession, growth capital needs fuelled 2020 into a robust year for initial public offerings (IPOs).In 2020 so far, Indian IPOs have raised $3.5 billion from 42 issues, surpassing last year’s proceeds by 40.5%, as per data from Refinitiv. While the activity was subdued in the first half of the year given the onset of Covid-19, large IPOs were the flavour of the season in the second half. SBI Cards and Payments ($1.4 billion) , Gland Pharma ($870 million), and Mindspace Business Parks ($596 million) and CAMS ($305 million) were the top IPOs. Burger King India’s IPO of $109 million was the most recent one in December bringing the fourth quarter proceeds to $1.4 billion- the highest quarterly total since first quarter 2018 when around $2.9 billion was raised in a single quarter. Burger King’s public market raise was also second highest among quick service restaurants after Coffee Day’s $176 million IPO in October 2015, as per Refinitiv. Analysts said a strong institutional flow has helped equity capital markets gain traction this year. “Covid Capital, new phase of fundraising, dominated the market wherein companies through Qualified Institutional Placements (QIPs) and Rights issue raised capital to shore up their balance sheet and for consolidation,” V Jayasankar, senior ED and Head ECM, Kotak Mahindra Capital, said. “Investors preferred to invest in sector leaders or dominant players anticipating that such companies would emerge stronger and as winners post-Covid.”While initially only Covid-resilient sectors took the IPO route, as the markets turned positive, excess liquidity and positive sentiment saw even the Covid-impacted companies raise funds such as Burger King and Mindspace REIT.Refinitiv data showed that financial services made up the majority of IPO proceeds at over 51%, healthcare followed with 25% share, and real estate came in third at 13%. For calendar year 2021, analysts expect IPOs to be dominated by sectors that have gained from the pandemic such as new-age tech, healthcare and consumer. “Given the robust IPO markets, many unlisted corporates have started engagement with bankers with a view to list earlier than previously envisaged,” a note from Kotak Securities said. Globally, India was in the eighth spot in 2020 in terms of largest IPO proceeds. China and the US ranked as the top two with IPO proceeds of $89 billion and $63 billion respectively, Refinitiv data said. Tech IPOs dominated the US public markets as investor demand for tech stocks picked up, as seen in the recent IPO of Airbnb, a company badly-hit by Covid-19. Airbnb’s shares more than doubled on its first day from its IPO price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ipo-proceeds-rose-40-from-last-year/articleshow/79845559.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

December 22, 2020||Coimbatore||You can have your cake and panettone too||Coimbatore: While the rich dark fruit cake continues to be the most popular Christmas goody, Coimbatorians can enjoy a crusty bite of Italian Christmas delicacy panettone, a slice of the German Christmas specialty stollen, almond crescent cookies or a spoon of the warm sticky toffee pudding to fight cold weather.The local bread market, which shied away from European varieties initially, is being opened to try the new celebratory options, bakers say.People who want a break from the dark fruit cake or plum cake, made using fruits soaked in rum for a year, can enjoy a loaf of stollen. “It is a spiced bread made with a marzipan centre and candied fruits,” says baker at Freshly Baked, Vishak Chandrasekharan. “We introduced stollen for the first-time last year and it was quite popular. It is a good option for those who don’t enjoy fruit cake because of bitterness,” says Anbuchelvan of Chocko Choza, which offers ginger-bread cookie and ginger-bread with cinnamon and brown sugar.Panettone is also being offered by The French Door and a couple of home bakers. It is a dry cake-like sweet bread baked using citron, lemon zest and orange, among others. “Usually, when customers walk in, the fruit cake is what they opt for first. A few of them are open to try out and order panettone, but we need to explain and talk them through it,” says chef at The French Door, Shreeya Adka.Several home bakers are offering sticky toffee pudding in dishes and in cups, which have to be warmed before being served, or served with vanilla ice cream and almond crescent cookies to resemble snow. “We have been seeing brisk sales of our vegan and eggless fruit cakes,” says Chandrasekharan.“Christmas cake gifting is moving away from fruit cake to chocolate cakes and cupcakes,” says Anbuchelvan.While fruit cakes are sold for Rs 450, Christmas special cakes are priced at around Rs 300.Home bakers have stuck to the time-tested all-year favourites like brownies, cupcakes and chocolate chunk cookies among others, accentuated with red and green sprinkles to add the Christmas look.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/you-can-have-your-cake-and-panettone-too/articleshow/79846956.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Patna||Be ready for Bihar polls next year: Tejashwi Prasad Yadav||PATNA: Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, on Monday hinted towards organizational changes in the RJD and action against those members who did not support the party candidates in the recent assembly elections. He also asked the party members to be ready for the elections which, he said, may happen anytime next year. In a review meeting held at the RJD office on Monday, Tejashwi said few people have been holding the same post in the party for a very long time. “After review, reshuffling will be done. Many have been holding a particular portfolio for a long time. What benefit did the party get from them?” he asked. Tejashwi said he had given the detailed report about the elections and the role of different party members to RJD chief Lalu Prasad at their meeting in Ranchi recently. He also said Lalu has given him full freedom to take the right decisions in the interest of the party. He then told the party members to keep working for common people and raise the issues of public interest. “Don’t think that the 2020 election has got over. It may happen anytime in 2021. I appeal to everyone — those who have won and other candidates and party members — to keep preparing for the polls,” said Tejashwi, appreciating how several new faces in the party had won the elections this time. RJD has asked all its candidates, district presidents and general secretaries to give in writing their suggestions as well as grievances and obstacles they faced in the election. The party will form a committee to review the recommendations and grudges. Sources said this was done to avoid any clash in the meeting. Senior party leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui pointed towards loopholes at the ground level from the side of polling agents. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said discussion on the farmers’ plight was done in the meeting, especially on the new farm laws. “RJD has decided to organize seminars across the district headquarters of the party on the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh. Seminars will be based on the plight of farmers and loopholes in the new laws,” Gagan said. Meanwhile, RJD and Congress once again blamed one another for the loss in the assembly elections. Though such discussions were not part of the RJD’s review meeting, its leaders like Anand Mohan’s son Chetan Anand, Ramai Ram and Yaduvansh Yadav, while talking to the media, pointed towards the Congress for their loss in assembly election. However, Congress state research and manifesto committee chairman Anand Madhab criticized RJD leaders for not abiding by the alliance dharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/be-ready-for-polls-next-year-tejashwi/articleshow/79843881.cms||Sheezan Nezami
December 22, 2020||Patna||Christmas: Decorative items flood Patna markets||PATNA: With Christmas round the corner, shopping complexes and markets in the city are flooded with sweet treats, fairy lights and decorative items. Makeshift stalls have also come up on Boring Road, Station Road, Nala Road, Exhibition Road and other marketplaces in the city. Traders said after a dull week amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the sales have picked up in the last couple of days. Christmas trees are in demand and so are the decorative items like bells, gift boxes, candy canes, wreaths, hanging icicles, garlands and candles. Nativity cribs, Santa with reindeer, snowman and miniature biblical statues made of ceramic are also finding many takers. Christmas-themed sunglasses and hairbands with oversized motifs of reindeer and Santa Claus masks are a hit among children. Niraj Kumar, a vendor on East Boring Canal Road, said snow theme decors with New Year greetings are in huge demand. “Kids like the musical toys of Christmas and sweet-tooth delights like chocolate cream candies and gummy bears. Santa clothes are not much in demand, may be because of closure of schools and colleges. Kids generally buy Santa clothes for Christmas celebrations at educational institutes,” he said. Another vendor, Lalit Agarwal, said people are buying decorated Christmas trees with fairy lights. “The prices of such trees range from Rs 200 to Rs 15,000, depending on the size. I am hopeful that the footfall of customers may increase by this week,” he said. Even the city malls are gearing up to usher in the Yuletide spirit with decorative items like Christmas tree, twinkling baubles, stars, snowflakes of varied sizes and Santa caps. They have also come up with exclusive offers and discounts on dresses. The roadside nurseries are flooded with evergreen plants, mostly pine trees. Ranjit Singh, who sells plants near Golghar, said people like real Christmas trees as it gives the true festive spirit. “One has to shell out Rs 150 for the pine trees, which is almost 10 to 12-foot-high. People can decorate it with baubles and hand-crafted decorative items,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/christmas-decorative-items-flood-city-markets/articleshow/79844353.cms||Faryal Rumi
December 22, 2020||Patna||IIIT, Bhagalpur to emerge as model centre: Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank||PATNA: Union minister for education Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank digitally laid the foundation stone of Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) at Bhagalpur on Monday. He expressed confidence that this institution would further revive the glory of Bhagalpur, which excelled in education in ancient times with Vikramshila, once known for imparting education to students from various countries. Speaking through virtual platform, Nishank called upon the students and faculty to pursue the vision and make it a mission to take country to new heights. He stressed on research and development in silk manufacturing and trade which traditionally had been associated with Bhagalpur. Saying that there was no lack of vision and missionary zeal in students, he hoped that the IIIT at Bhagalpur would emerge as a model centre. “This centre has come up under PPP mode with the Centre, state and industrial sector and investment share of 50%, 35% and 15% respectively,” the minister said. “Such institutions and startup centres will make new path for development, challenges and opportunities and impress the world. Today, the world looks at India with hope and confidence once again. We have to show them new ways. We have to convert the race for package into race for patent and should become job givers and not merely job seekers,” Nishank said. India is becoming a super power of education, the minister said while referring to the new education policy. He said it had impressed many countries. Nishank said he has been invited by Cambridge to tell the world about this policy. The education ministers of the UAE, the United Kingdom, Australia, Mauritius and other nations met him and praised this innovative policy, he added. Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion that facilities would be provided to students to get higher education in their mother tongues so that they could become doctors and engineers in their own language, Nishank said this way India would become ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) and education would become the platform for reform and perform. Bihar education minister Ashok Choudhary, who was also present virtually for the event, said, “Bihar has got another excellent institution in the field of higher education in the form of IIIT Bhagalpur. This institute would play a major role in transforming the state’s education.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/iiit-bhagalpur-to-emerge-as-model-centre-minister/articleshow/79843867.cms||Faryal Rumi

December 22, 2020||Business||Paytm Bank has lowest UPI failure rate||Mumbai: Paytm Payments Bank recorded the lowest ratio of failures for remittances using Unified Payments Interface (UPI) among the top 20 banks that account for 95% of transactions. Paytm Bank had a transaction decline ratio of 0.8 for every 1 lakh transactions as against the industry average of 17 per 1 lakh. According to National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) data for November, of the 226 crore UPI transactions, SBI had the largest share of 26%, followed by Axis Bank (11%), HDFC Bank (8%), Paytm Bank (8%) and ICICI Bank (6%). SBI processes over 2 crore transactions daily as against 60 lakh by HDFC Bank and 56 lakh by Paytm Bank. Though SBI has the largest share, it is also responsible for bringing down the industry average in terms of declines. NPCI’s data shows that SBI reported 31 technical declines for every 1 lakh transactions, doing better than only Bank of India, which had 33 failures. Technical decline rate reflects the reliability of the platform. NPCI defines these declines as payments that failed due to technical reasons, such as unavailability of systems and network issues on bank or NPCI side. Among the public sector banks, the best performer was Oriental Bank of Commerce, which matches Paytm Bank’s rate of 0.8 per lakh but it has less than 1% of total volumes. Bank of Baroda at 5%, had the highest market share in UPI transactions among nationalised banks, followed by Punjab National Bank (4%), Bank of India (3%) and Union Bank of India (3%). “Our performance is a testament to the hard work that the team puts in to provide the best technology infrastructure in the global banking space. We are well ahead of others when it comes to leveraging AI and Big Data to offer innovative products & services to our customers across the country. Our tech team, which comprises the best minds in the business, works round-the-clock to provide a seamless and efficient experience,” said Satish Gupta, MD & CEO, Paytm Payments Bank. He added that for most banks the UPI transactions are driven by third-party apps, Paytm Bank is the only one in the country to organically drive UPI transactions. Google Pay and PhonePe currently dominate third-party apps in UPI payments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-bank-has-lowest-upi-failure-rate/articleshow/79847126.cms||Mayur Shetty

December 22, 2020||Patna||Bihar: Over 5 lakh healthcare workers identified for Covid-19 vaccination||PATNA: After the fresh guidelines from the Centre for Covid-19 vaccination drive, the state government is identifying spacious places with three kinds of rooms where shots could be given while maintaining social distance. The task has to be completed by December 31. Unlike routine immunization, which is done even at Anganwadi centres, or door-to-door polio drive, social distance has to be maintained in Covid-19 vaccination. “As per the new guidelines, there needs to be a waiting room, vaccination room and observation room. In the observation room, people after getting vaccines will be kept for 30 minutes under observation,” said state health society executive director Manoj Kumar. He said they have not been told about the deadline. However, they have decided to identify the places by the end of this year. Manoj said for this purpose they were identifying places like police lines, big community centres, Air Force base in Purnia, big private hospitals and other government buildings. Talking about the beneficiaries who will get the shot on priority, he said till Sunday, they had identified 4.6 lakh government healthcare workers and municipal workers and 65,000 private healthcare workers. He further said 45,000 alternate vaccine providers have also been identified. They will be roped in the vaccination drive. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has already advised the officials to ensure that the vaccination is done diligently like polio drive. However, he has also cautioned that routine immunization should not get hampered in the process. The state government has already selected Nalanda Medical College and Hospital as the state-level storage for Covid-19 vaccines and walk-in cold rooms on its campus are being increased. From there, the vaccine will be transferred to ten regional storage centres for distribution. An official in the department said though work on vaccines is in progress, they were expecting Bharat Biotech, which is producing Covaxin, to deliver the vaccine in the state. Cold chains in the health institutes maintain the temperature between 2 to 8 Degrees C.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/over-5-lakh-healthcare-workers-identified-for-covid-vaccination/articleshow/79844337.cms||Sheezan Nezami
December 22, 2020||Business||Supply of games online attracts 18% GST: AAR||MUMBAI: The GST Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR - Maharashtra bench) has held that supply of online games — sent by an email attachment or via a secure link — to customers in India will attract goods and services tax at 18%. The applicant, Amogh Bhatawadekar, sold online games via a website MMOPLAYSTORE.com. He procured online games from suppliers located in China and the US. The games were stored on the cloud and then sold to customers, who paid through PayPal. He sought an advance ruling on various issues. To begin, with the AAR held that section 2 (17) of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) Act defines “online information and data-based access or retrieval services” (OIDAR) to include online gaming. Thus, the online games (e-goods) supplied by him would be considered as services. Further, even if the cloud is located outside India, the customers are in India and GST would apply. However, owing to lack of specific details for determining the place of supply for OIDAR, the AAR did not give a ruling as regards the applicability of GST in case the customers are from abroad and are remitting foreign exchange. As regards supply of the e-goods to him, the AAR, in its order dated December 15, held that in case of procurement from foreign suppliers and supply from out of India, the applicant has to discharge IGST liability under the reverse charge mechanism. The AAR dismissed the contention of the applicant that the e-goods are not received by him (seller) in India, but are stored on a cloud, hence these cannot be considered to be imports in India and would be outside the purview of the reverse charge mechanism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/supply-of-games-online-attracts-18-gst-aar/articleshow/79847066.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Business||Atmanirbhar loans stem bad debt in power sector||MUMBAI: The government’s Atmanirbhar measures to help businesses hit by the pandemic has addressed a historic problem of power companies, and the banks that lend to them. Following the pandemic, the government allocated a Rs 90,000-crore financial package to assist power distribution companies (discoms) across the country. The funding was to be provided through state-owned financiers Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electrification Corporation. “Stressed discoms had availed the loans provided by government power financiers and cleared dues to power-generating companies. And the generating companies, in turn, have cleared dues to lenders,” said IDBI Bank deputy MD Samuel Joseph Jebaraj. He added that these were companies that were perennially classified as an SMA (special mention account — a term for companies that do not repay in time), and lenders were worried that they would slip into the NPA (non-performing asset) category. Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation is one of the discoms that has drawn money to clear dues. But there are still other states that have not availed financing. One of the conditions for financing is that the states implement reforms to reduce distribution losses. Jebaraj pointed out that the Atmanirbhar financing is a short-term fix and there is no alternative for reforms. According to data provided in the ministry of power website, Rs 1,24,695 crore is the overdue from state power distribution companies to power generators. However, the amount paid by discoms against their overdues has increased month on month. One of the reasons for the high outstanding is that collections were hit during the lockdown. In the short term, what this means for banks is that there is one more factor that will reduce the pressure on bad loans. While banks have money stuck in power projects under implementation, most of this has been largely provided for. There are also some companies that do not have a power purchase agreement, but overall lenders see the stress in the sector coming down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/atmanirbhar-loans-stem-bad-debt-in-power-sector/articleshow/79847174.cms||Mayur Shetty

Gondia, at 7 degrees celsius, was the coldest place in the state. Pune’s minimum temperature fell to the season’s lowest, and to a single digit after over a month. With windy conditions, and day temperatures below 30°C, the chill could be felt throughout the day. The minimum temperature had dropped to 9.8 degrees celsius on November 12, after which it climbed to double digits.The season’s lowest minimum was recorded in Shivajinagar on Monday, while Pashan was 10 degrees celsius and Lohegaon a little higher at 11.8 degrees celsius. Day temperatures were 28.4 degrees celsius in Shivajinagar and 28.5 degrees celsius in Lohegaon on Monday.Skymet Weather Services president G P Sharma said the minimum temperature profile in Pune is likely to be in double digits for the next few days, but may not increase beyond 12-13°C for about a week. “The minimum in Lohegaon is generally higher than in the other parts of Pune, which could be attributed to the airport operations in the area. Wherever flying operations take place, temperatures tend to be higher due to airplane fuel combustion,” Sharma said. An IMD official said night temperatures in Shivajinagar will be around 11 degrees celsius for the next few days, except for Tuesday, when it could fall slightly to 9 degrees celsius. In Pashan, the minimum could range between 10-12 degrees celsius, while Lohegaon will witness night temperatures in the range of 11 to 13 degrees celsius.“The minimum also dipped in parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha, where locations like Gondia and Nagpur recorded 7 and 8.4 degrees celsius respectively.

December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Home bakers see spurt in business as Covid-wary buyers avoid shops in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Bakers in the city, who work from their own units at home, or seasonal bakers for Christmas are witnessing a spurt in business this year, unlike large bakers ruing lack of orders due to the pandemic. Home bakers have been so flooded with orders this Christmas that there have been long waiting lists. Most of these bakers have their own baking units at home and are active on social media, where they connect with hundreds of clients across the city and beyond. They are not only accepting orders online but are also arranging for delivery anywhere in the city and the outskirts. People are buying the cakes from these home bakers for themselves or gifting them to friends and relatives since they cannot go to the stores amid the coronavirus pandemic. The added attraction is that each cake can be personalized and customers can choose designs on offer or communicate with the baker through a video chat for their own designs. “A big brand will never have so much time to connect with individual customers. We have the time and space to take the relationship and experience to another level. We have had customers who are so satisfied that they are channellizing their personal and corporate orders towards us, leaving big brands behind,” said Samriddhi Jain, whose brand ‘Cake It’ has seen over 25% growth this season. Ronita Mitra of ‘Bakology’ said, “We have experimented by merging Indian and western and have churned our rasmalai, rabri and thandai cakes. We have our own delivery system too.” Poulami Mukherjee of ‘Bakingwalee’ has a long waiting list this Christmas season. “It’s more than I can handle. People are gifting personalised cakes for almost every occasion,” she said. Paro Chen, a beautician, said she had ordered a birthday cake from a home baker for her son during the lockdown because she could get it delivered at her doorstep. “I was so happy with the experience that ever since, I have ordered countless cakes from them for my family and my clients,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-bakers-see-spurt-in-business-as-covid-wary-buyers-avoid-shops/articleshow/79845639.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Kasba accident spat ends in molestation, one arrested||KOLKATA: A road rage incident — that began with a minor accident — spiralled into a serious crime after two women, driving back to their homes after Sunday midnight were allegedly assaulted and molested by three locals from the Rajdanga Nabapally area in Kasba. The incident occurred around 12.30am after the complainant had accidentally bumped into a lamp post while driving her car. Police have arrested one of the accused, Babu Roy (27). The others are on the run. The women — aged 40 and 31 — were reportedly in a shock after the incident. “We shall record their statements before a magistrate soon,” said an investigating officer. DC (south suburban) Rashid Munir Khan said, “The locals alleged that the women were driving rashly and hit the lamp post. They tried to force the women out of the car. The women maintained it was an accident. Both sides got into an argument and the accused slapped the 40-year-old woman. When the two women protested, the accused assaulted them,” said an officer from Kasba police. The accused also outraged the modesty of the complainant and her companion, he said. “The 40-year-old woman later lodged a complaint. We conducted a raid in the area and arrested Babu, one of the accused. We are searching for the other two accused in Kasba and the surrounding areas,” said an officer. Though a number of road rage cases in the city had hit headlines last year, most notably after the death of a senior citizen in Bhowanipore, police said this was one of the rare cases where a woman has claimed outrage of her modesty.

It also provides that in case he neglects or refuses to maintain them, his services may be terminated.” “This does not mean that there is any rider on the right of the employee to re-marry. This is what has also been laid down by this court in the case of Smt. Santoshi v. State of UP. and 2 others, in writ-A No. 834 of 2020, decided on January 21, 2020. It has been observed in it that right to marry with person of choice is an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution of India (protection of life and personal liberty),” the court added. The court further observed, “Merely because the petitioner has been appointed on compassionate basis, he cannot be forced to sacrifice his/her fundamental right of remarriage, after the death of the earlier spouse. A person would not earn any disqualification on this score and warrant any disciplinary proceedings.” The petitioner was appointed on compassionate basis on the death of his wife. The petitioner now intends to marry the younger sister of his wife. Therefore, he sought permission from Basic Shiksha Adhikari where he is employed to re-marry. Rejecting pleas of the petitioner, the court said, “As there is no statutory requirement under law for seeking permission of Basic Shiksha Adhikari for the purpose of re-marriage by an employee, who has been appointed on compassionate basis, I am of the opinion that the petitioner has unnecessarily invoked the writ jurisdiction of this court.” The court gave this decision on November 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/job-on-compassionate-ground-wont-take-away-right-to-re-marry-hc/articleshow/79846979.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Coimbatore||Centre keen to privatize Salem Steel Plant, says Dayanidhi Maran||Salem: Even as the state government has not taken any step to run Salem Steel Plant profitably, the Centre is keen to privatize it, said DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran in the city on Monday. The Chennai central MP said the DMK government in 2006 secured Rs 2,500 crore from the Centre to revive the plant. “But the present ruling government has not taken any step to improve the condition.”Meeting construction labourers, coir industry labourers, steel plant employees and farmers, as part of an election campaign in the district, Maran said there is a large support for DMK chief M K Stalin among people in rural areas. “While people are expecting Stalin to become the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu after winning in the 2021 assembly election, AIADMK is losing support in villages,” he said, adding that the DMK-led alliance would win more than 200 seats across the state. On Rs 2,500 Pongal gift, Maran said Stalin had urged the state government to give a compensation of Rs 7,500 per family affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent cyclones. “But the chief minister had announced Rs 2,500,” he said, slamming the CM for giving people’s tax money as Pongal gift. Talking about actor Rajinikanth’s political entry, Maran said anyone can come to politics to do good for people. “At the same time, Rajini’s political entry will not affect DMK’s victory in the election,” he said.The MP also hoped that the same alliance that was formed during the 2019 Parliamentary election would continue in this election too. “We had captured 39 out of 40 in that election and 65% of the seats in the local body election,” he said.Salem MP S R Parthiban, Salem (north) MLA R Rajendran and others accompanied Maran during his campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/centre-keen-to-privatize-salem-steel-plant-says-dayanidhi-maran/articleshow/79846983.cms||---

In an obvious reply to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav without taking his name, in his address at Mau collectorate after foundation laying of many development projects, Yogi taunted, “We did not sell the land of closed sugar mills like our predecessors and gave four lakh government jobs to youth without any caste discrimination. The construction of university and airport in Azamgarh are in progress and people from Mau and adjoining areas will not have to travel far for boarding flights for their destination.” SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had recently accused the government of stalling development projects in Azamgarh because it was his parliamentary constituency. The Purvanchal Expressway will become the backbone of east UP and will open new employment avenues for the youth of the region and they will not have to migrate to earn livelihood, the CM added. Yogi said that payment of sugarcane farmers will reach their bank accounts soon and efforts are on to make the closed sugar mills operational again and provide employment to youth. The cases of some sugar mills are under litigation and efforts are being made for their early disposal, after which they will also be reopened, he added. Yogi’s arrival was scheduled at 11am, but his chopper landed almost two and half hours late. He laid foundation and inaugurated 27 projects of Rs 136 crore and also distributed certificates of different government schemes to the beneficiaries. During his visit to Azamgarh on December 14, Akhilesh had alleged that despite most work of the airport being completed, the government could not lay a four-km air strip in the last four years. He also alleged that road construction in Azamgarh had been stalled while dues of sugarcane farmers were not being cleared just because it was his parliamentary constituency. He had also criticized the government for delay in completion of Purvanchal Expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cm-slams-oppn-rebuffscharge-of-stalling-devpt/articleshow/79846834.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Coimbatore||100% waste segregation at source still a distant dream||Coimbatore: For almost a decade, the city corporation has been trying to segregate the wastes based on its composting nature at source. It has even promised the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that it would achieve 100% source segregation by the end of December 2017. But the civic body has a long way to go. At present, the corporation has been receiving about 40% to 50% of total waste as mixed wastes. A corporation source said, “The civic body collects about 900 to 1,000 tonnes of garbage daily. About 40 to 50% of the garbage is mixed waste. We have been taking multiple steps to ensure that the wastes are segregated at its source itself and educating the public because once wet and dry wastes are mixed, it is difficult to segregate. But we continue to get mixed wastes, which is dumped in the dump yard at Vellalore.” Explaining that they have been working to reduce the number of garbage bins, the source said that they have been decorating a place with flowers after removing a bin to ensure that the public don’t throw garbage again at the spot. “We are also in talks with bulk waste generators to make them handle their own wastes and imposing penalties on those who dump waste on roads. So that we can concentrate on handling the domestic wastes,” he added. But residents and activists blame the corporation for not prioritizing the issue and taking enough steps to achieve 100% source segregation. “Until a year ago, I had the habit of collecting dry and wet wastes in different bins and handover separately to the sanitary workers who in turn would dump it in different bins that they had been carrying. But, after seeing how the workers are dumping the mixed wastes into one of their bins without segregating it, I had stopped it. What is the point of painstakingly segregating the waste only to see it getting mixed with mixed wastes,” S Parvathy, a resident of Peelamedu, saidIn some areas, the corporation is not collecting wastes at the door steps regularly and the residents end up dumping the wastes – both wet and dry – together in garbage bins which in turn is carried to the dump yard without further segregation, city-based activist SP Thiyagarajan said. He said, “The corporation should not collect bulk wastes and let its generators handle it, and concentrate on the domestic wastes,” he added. Organizer of Vellalore dump yard opposition committee J Daniel Jesudass said despite investing so much in solid waste management, the corporation has done nothing including door-to-door collection effectively and did nothing to monitor the activities. “When the wastes are mixed together, it will also have medical wastes. When sanitary workers are found handling it without safety gears most of the time, it might cause health hazards to them. It also causes environmental degradation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/100-waste-segregation-at-source-still-a-distant-dream/articleshow/79846999.cms||Nivedha Selvam
December 22, 2020||Coimbatore||Biomining project yet to take off||Coimbatore: Six months after municipal administration minister S P Velumani inaugurated the biomining project at the Vellalore dump yard, the project is yet to take off. The Rs 60.11 crore project was inaugurated on June 5, two years after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the civic body to scientifically dispose the 9.5 lakh cubic metre waste accumulated on 69 acres in the dump yard.The civic body should have ideally implemented the project immediately after it was inaugurated, but it delayed the work citing one reason or the other, said MDMK state youth wing secretary V Eswaran. “The corporation is carrying out beautification works at the water bodies. It should give priority to the project as the lives of people residing around the dumpy yard is badly affected. Stench emanate from the yard. Underground water is polluted.”It was Eswaran’s petition that prompted NGT to direct the corporation to dispose the waste scientifically.Further delay will do nothing other than harming lives and the environment, said J Daniel Jesudass, organizer of the Vellalore dumpyard opposition committee. “Ideally, the corporation should inform the public about the steps it had taken to resolve the issue. But the civic body is not transparent and is not sharing any information,” he said.“The civic body continues to dump mixed waste at the yard. As announced, it should have constructed micro-composting centres to turn wet waste into compost at 65 places. But only 15 such centres are functioning,” another activist said.Meanwhile, a corporation official said the machines required for the project have been installed. “We will start the project once power connection is obtained,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/biomining-project-yet-to-take-off/articleshow/79846998.cms||---

The commissioner, however, added the police will take immediate steps for safe celebrations of the New Year, if the government grants permission. In any case, the police have planned to deploy more number of police personnel on the streets to prevent fatal accidents on the New Year’s Eve.During last year’s New Year celebrations, the city police had set up 25 temporary shamiyanas where drunken drivers and other traffic violators were detained.

December 22, 2020||Chennai||Bumpy ride: TN’s auto exports fall 50% in April-Sept||CHENNAI: The nearly six-week lockdown till May and partial industrial shutdown till the first week of July have impacted the export of automobiles and parts from Tamil Nadu, which almost halved to $1.7 billion during April-September 2020, down from $3.3 billion a year ago. Known as the Detroit of the south, TN’s export basket has always been dominated by automobile and auto components traditionally comprising 40% of total exports. Exports were flat in April-September 2018 and April-September 2019 at around $3.3 billion. Vehicle, component and tyre factories in the Sriperumbudur and Oragadam region hit peak production only in the run-up to the festival season in August and September. “Auto and component exports from TN have grown from $5.4 billion in FY15-16 to about $6.6 billion in FY19-20, at a 5.3% CAGR. Overall exports from TN (barring auto) went from about $20 billion in 2016 to around $24 billion in FY19-20 — an increment of $4 billion over five years. So non-auto exports have done better,” said S Prahalathan, chief GM-India, Exim Bank. The state has a large presence of export-driven industries like textiles & garments, leather goods, software and BPO, and was the largest exporter of leather products and the third largest exporter of software in 2019. In terms of the number of operational and exporting SEZs, Tamil Nadu ranked first, constituting around 15% of India’s total SEZ exports. In 2019-20, auto and components contributed 22% of TN exports followed by apparel (13%), machinery (12%) and footwear (4%). According to the latest data released by the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) for instance, exports of auto components declined by 23.6% to $5.2 billion in April-September ’20 compared to the year ago period. As for vehicle exports, this dipped over 63% in April-October ’20 shows the latest data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). “Apart from auto, TN was the largest exporter of leather products and the third largest exporter of software in 2019,” said Prahalathan. In terms of ranking, TN has slipped in the past couple of years. “TN was the second largest contributor to India’s economy with a GSDP of Rs 12.1 trillion in 2018-19, second to Maharashtra,” said Prahalathan. During the year, exports constituted 18% of the GSDP, up from 16% in 2015-16. The state, however, slipped subsequently as export increase turned flat and then negative. “Tamil Nadu ranked as the third largest merchandise exporter from India in 2019-20, after Maharashtra and Gujarat,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bumpy-ride-tns-auto-exports-fall-50-in-april-sept/articleshow/79845673.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
December 22, 2020||Lucknow||Now, register for NREGS job via SMS, WhatsApp||Lucknow: Getting work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in UP has become easier than before. Now, those looking to be engaged under the scheme just need to send an SMS or a WhatsApp message with their details to a designated number given by the UP government. Under the unique initiative of the rural development department, after getting details through on a designated phone number, the department would subsequently track the person and provide work under the MNREGS. Additional commissioner, MNREGS, Yogesh Kumar said, “One can send a message to mobile numbers 9454464999 and 9454465555 of our department and get work in MNREGS at a place of their choice,” he told TOI. “Once the department gets details, it will track that person,” he said. The department has already received messages from nearly 218 people who are now being contacted. This year, UP has created the highest-ever 30 crore mandays employing over 1.1 crore persons. Sources said that the department has appointed a team to coordinate with the applicants and provide them work. The move will help the state government provide immediate stamping of the time and place where a job is required. The new process will be an improvement over the existing one where a person has to submit a hard copy with the block development officer. “Also, there is uncertainty over when the application is received and when it would be registered,” said a senior official closely associated with the project. “The new process will mainly benefit those who are disconnected and are not able to meet BDO, gram pradhan or rozgar sewak,” he said. The new measure would also help the state government ascertain the duration of jobs sought by an applicant. “At times we get feedback that a person has demanded only six days of work. But we understand that a person would demand a job for a longer duration. The employee wants stability and job security,” the official said. “In this case, the message received along with the complete address will be forwarded to the BDO concerned,” Kumar said, adding that the scope of the new method is much more than what is practised traditionally. “The penetration of mobile phones has been increasing over the years and this makes the task of providing MNREGS jobs easier,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-register-for-nregs-job-via-sms-whatsapp/articleshow/79847707.cms||Pankaj Shah

December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata cops rely on tech for safe festival on Park Street||KOLKATA: A “dynamic” and “tech-driven” plan is what Kolkata Police is looking at to effectively manage the crowd, out on the party street to celebrate Christmas amid a pandemic. Faced with the unique challenge of hosting Christmas on Park Street and adjoining localities in Covid times and at the same time, controlling hordes of people converging on the zoo, Victoria Memorial and Maidan—where maintaining physical distancing might be difficult, given the number of people expected to turn up— police have divided the stretch from AJC Bose Road to Red Road into multiple zones. Each zone will covered by CCTV cameras and drones. All sergeants will use body cams and backpack cameras for live feeds. “The strategy will be dynamic and we will keep shifting our focus, depending on where crowd build up. Proper arrangements will be made to tackle all kinds of situations,” said DC (south) Sudheer Kumar Neelakantam. Sources said this would essentially mean that cops at each sub-zone, managed by a DCP, will keep a constant watch on the number of people assembling in their areas. “If it gets unwieldy, we will physically request the revellers to move out. We will use street furniture to channelise the excess crowd to comparatively less-occupied zones. For this reason, we will prepare multiple barricaded channels (not using all of them at the same time) and take instructions from Lalbazar, based on the live feeds from the multiple cameras,” an officer said. “This is the first major festival that has minimum restrictions and there is no high court directive either. But that cannot be a reason for any laxity. As an administration and law-enforcing agency, we will have to put in our best effort,” said a senior IPS officer. Besides continuous announcements for maintaining distance, there will be prosecutions for anyone not wearing a mask properly. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, too, reminded people to wear masks and maintain social distancing at any cost. At the inauguration of the Park Street festival, she said: “This is an international festival celebrated across the world. We, too, will participate. But because of the pandemic, we need to wear masks and maintain social distancing while celebrating.” A number of traffic restrictions, in the lines of those in last year, will be imposed from December 24. Park Street is likely to be closed to traffic from 4pm on Christmas Day till next morning—turning it into Walk Street—and there will be a host of curbs on the area on Christmas eve, too, police said on Monday. Vehicles will not be allowed from J L Nehru Road and Middleton Street onto Park Street. Vehicles will be allowed from Wood Street towards Park Circus with diversions in adjoining roads. On Christmas eve, traffic will be allowed only from Chowringhee to Park Circus between 1pm and 1am. Various organizers of carnivals and fests on the fringes, such as Haridevpur and Thakurpukur, who had sought police permission are still awaiting final clearances that will come from Lalbazar, which have sought time till Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-rely-on-tech-for-safe-fest-on-park-st/articleshow/79845725.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

AICC general secretary and party’s in-charge for Punjab, Harish Rawat, Congress state in-charge Devender Yadav, and state chief Pritam Singh led the protest. The Congress procession was stopped near the Rispana bridge at the police barricading. After a slight tussle, the Congress members sat on a protest near the bridge. Addressing party members, Rawat said, “Employment is the biggest factor for the youth of this generation and the state government has proved to be a complete failure. The ruling party members need to answer the questions raised by the youth of this state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-tables-rs-4063-cr-supplementary-budget-in-assembly-rs-200-crore-provision-for-kumbh/articleshow/79844758.cms||Kautilya Singh

December 22, 2020||Allahabad||Scope of Govt probe panel limited to SC/ST students: HC||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has held that the committee constituted by the UP government to carry out investigation into the BEd institutions recognized by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) is empowered only with regard to number of students of SC/ST community, who are registered for scholarships and requisite scholarships being rightly given to the eligible students. Giving this judgment, the court set aside the state government order dated October 8, 2020 to the extent that it provided that the committee so constituted under this GO would carry out the investigation in NCTE recognized institutions with regard to other matters as provided under clause 4 of the notification. The NCTE is a statutory body of the Union government set up under the NCTE Act as an advisory body to the government at the Centre and the state on matters related to teacher education. It grants recognition and affiliation for running a BEd institution. Disposing of the writ petition filed by the Association of Minorities Educational Institutions through its secretary Karrar Hussain, Justice Pankaj Bhatia clarified that the authority so constituted would not be empowered to call for any information from NCTE recognized institutions with regard to the items specified in clause 4 of the said GO dated October 8, 2020. The clause 4 of the GO provided that the committees of the state government would investigate in the institutions governed by NCTE Act regarding the policy of admission in BEd, BTC courses, cut off marks, recognition of institutions, seats allotted to it and also the fee fixed. Further, this committee will also investigate and verify the minimum qualification of teachers working there, number of class rooms and required governed under NCTE are being run. The petition is confined in respect of challenge to the GO dated October 8, 2020 whereby it is recorded that the state government has decided that the private institutions imparting BED and BTC education were required to be investigated/verified in terms of the said decision. The sole submission of the counsel for the petitioner was that the directions as contained in clause 4 are beyond the powers conferred upon the state inasmuch as the institution in question are governed by the NCTE Act as well as affiliation granted to the institution of the respective universities and as such the state government does not have any jurisdiction. He further submitted that the institution do not have any grievances if the enquiry is confined to verification of the scholarships being granted to the students of SC/ST community. In view of the said submission, this court at one stage had directed the state counsel to file a reply (counter affidavit). The state counsel filed his reply wherein it is stated that the state government would only verify the strength of the genuine students as provided under the rules.  The department has no intention to check the validity of affiliation as granted by the NCTE. The department only checks and verifies the number of genuine students and whether the benefit of the scheme is being given to the eligible students or not. Only upto this extent and to achieve the aforesaid object, the said order has been issued. Accepting the submissions of the state government, the court observed, “In view of the fact that the state government itself has confined its investigation to the genuine students as provided under the rules pertaining to the grant of scholarship to the SC/ST students and once it is categorically accepted that the state has no intention to check the validity of the affiliation granted by the NCTE, no issue remains under the present writ petition as the parties agree that the state government is fully empowered to verify and check the issue of scholarships and the eligibility of the students, who are entitled to the said scholarships.” This judgment was given on December 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/scope-of-govt-probe-panel-limited-to-sc/st-students-hc/articleshow/79847012.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

December 22, 2020||Kanpur||SP corporator wears shoe garland, protests||Kanpur: The house of Kanpur Municipal Corporation (KMC) witnessed bizarre moments on Monday when Samajwadi Party corporator Suhail Ahmad entered the house wearing shoes garland. Protesting against the inert attitude of the KMC officers towards development work, Ahmad said that the time had come when the public would beat corporators for their failure in completing development works. To save himself from public ire, he wore the shoes garland, he added. The corporators have been complaining since long about the indifferent attitude of KMC officials in ensuring development of the city. Even mayor Pramila Pandey had questioned the working of the KMC officials. Throughout the house session the corporators kept on raising their problems and targeted the officials. The last session of the house had to be suspended without making any decision on any core issue. As soon as the house proceedings began around 11 am, the corporators raised the issue of the city’s development. Some corporators staged a sit-in in protest against the working of executive engineer of zone-4 Puneet Ojha terming him as a careless officer. The situation could be controlled when the mayor asked Ojha to leave the house. The corporators alleged that some engineers were playing games in road cutting. Corporators Suhail Ahmad, Kamal Shukla, Naveen Pandit, Arpit Yadav and Manoj Pandey said that the officials were giving road cutting permission zone-wise and ward-wise which was absolutely wrong. Also taking a potshot at the officials of the district administration for their careless attitude cited the incident in which the mayor got injured in stone pelting by a crowd in Chakeri area but the police had not registered an FIR so far. The corporators demanded the police to register an FIR in the incident. The mayor interfered in the matter and said now she would sit in each zone for some time. “The officials should act and respond decently with corporators and the public”, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sp-corporator-wears-shoe-garland-protests/articleshow/79846875.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Lucknow||Top producer, UP eyeing top slot in potato productivity||Lucknow: The UP government has appealed to the potato growers to cultivate the crop in a prescribed manner so that it helps the state, which is already the largest producer of potato, to secure first position in the country in terms of productivity as well. At the present, with the productivity of 24.22 tonnes per hectare UP is at number six in the country. The department of horticulture plans to raise it to 30 tonnes per hectares by next year to beat all other states. Officials of the horticulture department suggest sowing of potato seeds at a depth of nine inches in three lines at a distance of 28 inches. Apart from this NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) is used at the rate of one quintal in one acre and 50 Kg of urea per acre has been fixed. “This is the best scientific way for a higher productivity,” an official said. Potatoes are sown in an area of 6.1 lakh hectares in the state. Last year, UP produced 148 lakh tonnes of potatoes to stay ahead of West Bengal, Bihar, Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana. A state government spokesperson said till a few years ago, potato farmers did not get fair prices for potatoes, but now potato farming in UP started to be a profitable deal for the farmers. Not only here, multinational food and beverages company ‘PepsiCo’ is also going to set up a new (greenfield) potato chips production unit in the state with an investment of Rs 814 crore. The unit is proposed to be set up on 35 acres of UP state industrial development authority (UPSIDA) land in Kosi-Mathura. It is scheduled to start in 2021 and provide direct and indirect employment to 1,000 people. Officials predict this time UP will set a new record in potato cultivation. In 25 potato-growing districts of the state, potato farming has been done in a planned way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/top-producer-up-eyeing-top-slot-in-potato-productivity/articleshow/79847711.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Dehradun||TOI impact: RMC arranges bonfires for homeless||Rudrapur: A day after TOI highlighted the plight of the homeless in the state in the wake of the prevailing cold weather conditions, the Rudrapur Municipal corporation (RMC) swung into action and lit up bonfires at several points in the city to guard the people in need from the biting cold. Taking cognisance of the TOI report (published on December 21, 2020) that pointed out how the homeless are sleeping out in the open despite a cold wave, RMC commissioner Rinku Bisht instructed all the officials to arrange wood to light up bonfires across the city. Subsequently, campfires were lit on Monday at major locations in the city, including the main market, bus stand, taxi stands, and various crossroads. Meanwhile, a TOI spot visit to one of the city’s night-shelters at Gandhi Park revealed that the facility was locked and there was no staff available to take care of the people coming there. People living in the neighbourhood said that the facility has not opened in recent times. Moreover, another such facility at Agrasen Chowk is still under-construction. “I had to sleep out in the open at Ambedkar Park after finding out that the night shelter is locked,” said Bajrangi, one of the many people sleeping along the roadside. Others sleeping not too far echoed the same ordeal. When queried, Sahayak Nagar Aayukt (SNA) of the RMC, Deepak Goswami, said that the services at the night shelter commence from 4 pm and two men are deputed there for separate shifts till 6 am in the morning. However, the facility was found to be locked at 5 pm during TOI visit on Monday. Diwakar Wasan, a nearby shopkeeper, said that the facility has only four beds and there is no separate arrangement for men and women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/toi-impact-rmc-arranges-bonfires-for-homeless/articleshow/79844783.cms||Aakash Ahuja
December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata municipal corporation wants Covid-19 cremation protocol change after dip in cases||KOLKATA: A senior member in Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s Board of Administrators (BoA), Atin Ghosh, who looks after the civic body’s health department, has placed a proposal to the BoA for introducing Covid cremation at all major crematoriums located across the city in phases. According to Ghosh, he had long been planning to include all major crematoriums on list to make the Covid cremation easier for the family as well as the civic body. A Calcutta High Court directive makes it mandatory for the civic body to allow six members of a Covid victim’s family at the burning ghats at the time of performing the last rites. If the KMC BoA approves Ghosh’s proposal, civic body’s health department will issue necessary instructions to officials at all major crematoriums that include Keoratola, Siriti, Garia, Cossipore, to arrange for cremation of Covid victims. Currently, Covid victims are being cremated at three KMC-run crematoriums — Dhapa, Nimtolla (old complex) and Birjunala at Garden Reach. When former Rabindra Bhawan (Visva-Bharati) director and a member of Sahitya Academy, Swapan Majumdar, died of Covid-19 last month, his family had a harrowing time, waiting at Nimtolla Covid-designate burning ghat for cremation. Recalling the long serpentine queue for cremation on that night, one of Majumdar’s family members, Manabranjan Dutta, told TOI that it seemed an endless wait for cremation of a dear and near one. Dutta said they were told that since Dhapa crematorium was not properly functioning on that day, the queue at Nimtolla grew longer. The KMC BoA member said he was trying to ensure that all city crematoriums open their doors to cremation of Covid victims. Ghosh said crematoriums in all other towns across Bengal are not refusing Covid victims any more. “Now it has been proved that if bodies are wrapped properly they can’t infect anyone. Then why should the Covid cremations be barred at city’s major crematoriums?” he asked. KMC had tried to introduce Covid cremation at some crematoriums in May. But, efforts were thwarted by residents who feared that they would get infected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-wants-covid-19-cremation-protocol-change-after-dip-in-cases/articleshow/79845869.cms||Saikat Ray

Prayagraj Mela Authority (PMA) had finalised the schedule for land allotment after several rounds of meetings.

The decision is expected to help PMA in organising the fair at a smaller scale due to the pandemic. Till now, the administration used to extend facilities like land for setting up a camp to seers, individuals and organisations based on the acreage they received during earlier fairs. This practice prevented organisations and individuals from skipping out on any edition of the Magh Mela. According to the land allotment schedule, Dandi saints who camp in Dandi Swami Nagar and Dandi Bada area of the venue were allotted land on Monday. The process would continue on Tuesday too, if needed. Khak Chowk will be allotted land on December 23 and 24 and, Acharya Bada on December 25 and 26.

The health department authorities say the figure is high for Ludhiana as the district has around 25% of the state’s population. As per the Sunday’s state media bulletin on Covid-19, cases per lakh population of Ludhiana are 696.8. This is the highest value since August 13, when the health department started including the data in its daily bulletin. The data of last month shows that cases per lakh had crossed 600-mark and were 602.2 on November 11 and reached 655.7 on December 1 before gradually increasing to the present value. The data since August 13 indicates that the number of cases per lakh population on the date was 246.8, which increased to 437 by August 31.

December 22, 2020||Lucknow||Moti Lal Vora brought Raj Bhavan closer to common man||LUCKNOW: Soon after assuming the charge of governor of the state in Raj Bhavan, Lucknow, Moti Lal Vora rechristened the ‘Darbar hall’, which was a ball dance room during the British era, into ‘Gandhi sabhaghar’ and decorated the huge hall with portrait of the father of the nation. By doing this, Vora, who had been governor of the state in the most politically tumultuous period from 1993 till May, 1996 when he had to resign after his name had figure in infamous hawala diary — though he was given a clean chit later on — had turned the Raj Bhavan from an elitist place of power to more democratic, inculcating the feeling of nationalism in sprawling buildings. “I would say he was most workaholic, who would work till as late as 2am when the state was under the President’s Rule,” recalls Pradip Dubey, principal secretary, state Legislative Assembly, who had worked with Vora in Raj Bhavan as his LR (legal remembrancer) while expressing his condolence over the demise of Vora. He had started his career as a journalist and then plunged into the freedom movement after joining the Indian National Congress which later elevated him as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. Before Ram Naik, who completed his term in 2019, Vora was in fact the first governor who had thrown open the gates of Raj Bhavan for the public and would magnanimously meet people and address their grievances and concerns. He would extensively tour the state and also participate in the public functions. It was in his regime as the governor that Mayawati became the chief minister for the first time in her political career in 1995. The then prime minister PV Narasimha Rao described Mayawati’s rise as ‘miracle of democracy’. After the BSP had withdrawn support from then Mulayam Singh government, Mayawati was assaulted in the state guest house, Vora intervened and issued orders for her protection and later on, he administered oath to Mayawati to become the first dalit woman CM of the state, with the support of the BJP. The BSP-BJP bonhomie did not last very long and within a year next assembly elections were held. But before that, Vora had to leave the Lucknow Raj Bhavan in on May 26, 1996.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vora-brought-raj-bhavan-closer-to-common-man/articleshow/79847718.cms||Subhash Mishra
December 22, 2020||Kochi||Kerala: Special assembly session to discuss new farm laws||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state cabinet, on Monday, decided to ask the governor to convene a one-day session of the assembly on Wednesday to discuss the news farm laws passed by the Centre and pass a resolution against them. The assembly will only convene for an hour, in which only the leaders of legislative party would speak. A resolution will be moved against the farm laws against which farmers are holding a protest in New Delhi, namely Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. As the ruling front (LDF) and the opposition (UDF) are already against the new farm laws, the assembly is likely to pass a near-unanimous resolution against these laws. Since BJP has only a single member in the assembly, it is unclear whether the member would record his opposition against the resolution or stay away from the session. The cabinet had earlier discussed the matter and had entrusted the state planning board to prepare a detailed report on the requirements and shortcomings of farmers. The agriculture department had also compiled the representations from various farmer organizations in state and handed it over to the planning board. The government will take a call, on whether to approach the Supreme Court against the farm laws on the basis of the report. In a similar manner, when the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 was passed by the Parliament, the state assembly had passed a resolution against the Act, becoming the first state to do so, by convening a special one-day session of the assembly. The lone dissenter against the resolution, BJP’s O Rajagopal, had then asked the speaker against taking up the resolution that was passed by both the houses of Parliament.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/special-assembly-session-to-discuss-new-farm-laws/articleshow/79844810.cms||---

These e-tablets will be kept in college library and will be issued to students like books. Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, who also holds the education portfolio, said the government had decided to procure 160 electronic tablets in 18 government colleges in seven aspiration districts – Shravasti, Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Siddharthanagar, Balrampur, Fatehpur and Chitrakoot. “The decision is in consonance with the New Education Policy (NEP) which lays stress on the use and integration of technology for education. The initiative is also important in the light of ongoing Digital India campaign which aims at making citizens digitally empowered. The conversion not only brings quality in education but technology also helps in academic reforms,” he said. Additional chief secretary (higher education) Monika S Garg said, “Covid-19 lockdown necessitated online teaching in government colleges but students in aspirational districts who are not equipped with smartphones, internet and other e-learning material lag behind.

December 22, 2020||Lucknow||Prez: Georgians should set up knowledge portal for fraternity||Lucknow: President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday said the alumni of the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) should create a knowledge portal for the greater good of medical fraternity. Addressing the convocation virtually, the President said, “I am told there are 12,500 alumni who are active nationally and internationally. It is my suggestion that Georgians create a portal where they can share their experiences of medical cases, critical care, research and anything else pertaining to healthcare. This will become a reservoir of knowledge for all.” President Kovind said not only his own health but also that of others at Rashtrapati Bhawan was in the hands of a KGMU alumnus. During the online-offline convocation, 44 medalists were honoured of whom nearly 50% were girls. This was also only the second time in KGMU’s over 100-year history that the President of India was part of the convocation. In 2005, APJ Abdul Kalam had visited KGMU on its convocation in the 100th year. “There were 31 students, of whom two were women, in the first batch. Today, of 44 medallists, 21 are women, which is almost 50%. I believe women have a major role in building India’s future,” he said. Tthe President also thanked KGMU students, doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and healthcare workers for their selfless work as frontline Covid warriors. “While this is a day to rejoice as ‘doctor’ is prefixed to your names, it is worth mentioning that patients are not mere medical cases, but humans with emotions and fear. They want patient hearing of their problems and good behaviour from the healthcare givers. A patient feels much better when a doctor behaves well,” he said. The President also applauded the university as a role model for having adopted 10 villages under the central government scheme and added that other medical institutions should also take inspiration from it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/prez-georgians-should-set-up-knowledge-portal-for-fraternity/articleshow/79847732.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Verdict in Sister Abhaya murder case likely today||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The CBI special court is likely to pronounce its verdict in Sr Abhaya murder case on Tuesday. The trial of the two accused – Fr Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sephy that continued in this court – concluded on Dec 10. Sr Abhaya (19) was found dead in the well of St Pius X Convent in Kottayam on March 27, 1992. She was the daughter of Ayikkarakunnel Thomas and Leelamma of Areekara in Kottayam and a second-year pre-degree student of BCM College, Kottayam then. The case was initially probed for 17 days by the local police, following which the probe was handed over to the crime branch. They finished the investigation in nine months and submitted a final report before the court on Jan 30, 1993, concluding that Sr Abhaya’s death was a case of suicide. However, on Mar 29, 1993, CBI took over the case following the intervention of government. State government recommended CBI to take over the case after accepting 34 memorandums in this regard from various organizations, action councils and individuals. CBI concluded that it was a case of homicide. Three persons were listed as accused in the chargesheet filed by CBI’s probe team. They were Fr Thomas Kottoor, Fr Jose Poothrukayil and Sr Sephy. CBI’s finding was that Sr Abhaya saw the trio in a compromising situation in the kitchen of the convent when she came to drink water and they killed her fearing that she might reveal their affair. The accused struck her from behind twice using an axe. When she fell unconscious, they took her body outside and dumped it in the well. The chargesheet was submitted on Jul 17, 2009. Following this, the three accused filed discharge petitions before the court. A year ago, CBI court let off Jose Poothrukayil citing that there was no sufficient evidence against him. The trial of the accused had commenced on Aug 26, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/verdict-in-sister-abhaya-murder-case-likely-today/articleshow/79844825.cms||---

A significant drop has been recorded in POCSO cases with a 35% reduction from 339 cases in 2019 to 221 cases in 2020, according to statistics put out by the Hyderabad police brass at the customary annual press briefing held in front of Osmania University Art’s college on Monday. There has been 27% drop in property crimes from 2,694 to 1964, followed by 26% in bodily offences, including murder, kidnapping (2,126-1,565) and 19% reduction in crime against women (2,354-1,908). Hyderabad additional commissioner of police (crimes) Sikha Goel attributed the drop in crime against children and women to the lockdown and also strict enforcement of law. “Most accused in POCSO cases are persons known to the victim. Due to the lockdown, children remained under the watch of parents and adolescents could not go out and meet others. This has resulted in reduction of POCSO cases and crime against women. Property offences have also reduced as most people stayed at home,” the additional CP said. Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar has cited the crackdown against repeat offenders by invoking the Preventive Detention (PD) Act, tracking of history-sheeters and modus operandi offenders, CCTV surveillance and round-the-clock police patrolling as other contributing factors for reduction in crime. There has also been a slight dip in fatal road accident cases from 259 to 231, while the road accident fatalities fell from 271 to 237. Due to the pandemic, the number of drunken driving cases have come down drastically from 29,756 in 2019 to 5,591 in 2020. While other crimes have slightly reduced largely due to the pandemic, there has been a surge in cyber crimes from 1,393 cases in 2019 to 2,314 cases (66.1% increase) in 2020. “Due to the pandemic, people have been spending a lot of time online and it has resulted in increase in cyber crime cases,” Anjani Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/overall-crime-down-by-10-cyber-crime-up-66/articleshow/79847087.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Dehradun||Activists raise alarm over bus service through core area of Corbett||DEHRADUN: Days after the state forest minister announced a bus service through Pakhro-Morghatti-Kalagarh-Ramnagar route (Kandi Road stretch), conservationists have raised an alarm stating that the road passes through the core breeding area of Corbett Tiger Reserve and its buffer zone. They have also sent a letter to the Union environment ministry, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and even the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) seeking urgent intervention in the matter. On December 18, chief wildlife warden JS Suhag had ordered the director of Corbett Tiger Reserve, Rahul, to ‘give permission’ to Garhwal Motors Union Limited to ply a bus service on the route. The move was aimed at making connectivity between Kumaon and Garhwal better and easier. Notably, the Supreme Court had earlier stayed the construction of Kandi Road through the stretch citing violation of wildlife norms. Activists claimed that the bus would not only pass through the buffer zone of Corbett reserve but also through its core area jeopardising the wildlife in the region. In a letter to the NTCA member secretary, Centre for Wildlife and Environmental Litigation Foundation director Bhanu Bansal alleged that the proposed stretch includes “24km of buffer zone between Ramnagar and Kaharagate, and 21 km core breeding area and 32 km buffer zone of Corbett Tiger Reserve between Kalagarh and Pakhro”. Talking to TOI, Bansal said, “This is a clear and serious violation of wildlife laws. Section 38(V)(4)(i) of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 states that the core areas should remain untouched to ensure tiger conservation. There is no question of seeking any kind of permission from the higher authorities as such areas are clearly out of bounds for any kind of human interference.” “Not only that, the Indian government is one of the signatories of the St Petersburg Declaration of 2010 which clearly prohibits any intrusive activity within core tiger breeding areas,” he added. Another activist Ashish Garg said, “The state government’s earlier plan was to construct Kandi Road which was rejected by the Supreme Court. That’s why they have now resorted to the indirect means of allowing a bus service on the stretch first. Locals will then demand a pucca road after which the authorities will complete the construction gradually.” Refuting the activists’ claims, the chief wildlife warden said that the bus won’t ply through the core area of Corbett. “The directive is nothing new. The bus service has been there since the British era and we are just restoring it. In 2017, the high court had imposed a stay on the service and the apex court later stayed the restrictions. In effect, we now have permission to resume the operations. Nobody will be allowed to get off the bus on the route,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/activists-raise-alarm-over-bus-service-through-core-area-of-corbett/articleshow/79843439.cms||Shivani Azad

December 22, 2020||Trichy||Trichiites ask: Why no paid parking on congested roads||Trichy: With on-street paid parking project implemented in Thillai Nagar recently, questions have been raised over the hesitation in implementing the same in congested and encroached localities in the city. As commercial complexes lack adequate parking space, customers park their vehicles on the road. Residents say that crucial roads that have been encroached have been exempted from on-street paid parking project. Pattabiraman Street, an 850m long stretch that links Bharathidasan Road with Thennur high road, has several multispecialty hospitals. However, the road and pedestrian platforms are encroached by shops selling used two-wheelers. They display their vehicles on the platforms throughout the day, making residents walk on the narrow motorable space. “If eliminating traffic bottlenecks and streamlining road traffic is the intention of the paid parking initiative, Pattabiraman Street must have been selected first. It seems that the civic body is only concerned about generating revenue that is why spacious Thillai Nagar Main Road was opted first,” S Ramesh, a resident of Thennur said.One of the congested roads that lack proper parking management is Rockins Road near Trichy railway junction. Connecting the Central bus stand with Trichy railway junction, at least 50% of Rockins Road is encroached by haphazard parking. Karur bypass and Bharathiar roads are other stretches that need smart parking solution on priority. “City police have requested to include Karur bypass road under the paid parking project. Soon, we will also include Pattabiraman Street under the same proposal,” an official source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichiites-ask-why-no-paid-parking-on-congested-roads/articleshow/79847117.cms||Deepak Karthik

The MCC, in ward 50 in K Abishekapuram zone and located on Kulimikkarai road that connects Anna Nagar in Thennur with Alwarthope, is one of the largest in the city as solid waste collected from houses and shops in the ward is brought here. Although the waste is supposed to be segregated and degradable waste converted into manure, Kulimikkarai MCC is being used as a dump yard to deposit all types of waste. Tonnes of waste including plastics are dumped here, making it a second dump yard after Ariyamangalam. As buses from Karur and Coimbatore enter the city passing through Kulimikkarai, passengers are greeted with the foul odour from the compost yard. The recent rains have made it worse.Poor maintenance of the compost centre was cited as a reason by residents opposing micro compost centres in their neighbourhood. “If the rest of the city encounters the fate of MCC at Kulimikkarai, they will certainly oppose new micro compost centre projects proposed in their locality,” said S Tyagarajan, a resident of Anna Nagar. The corporation’s sanitary vehicles daily dump waste collected from elsewhere and dump it at the compost centre, adding fresh waste mounds. While the piled up waste appeared to be several months old, corporation officials claimed that the waste was dumped only recently. “The silt cleared from drainage canals were dumped at the centre. We will remove it soon,” an official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/micro-compost-centre-turns-dump-yard-for-trichy-corpn/articleshow/79847122.cms||Deepak Karthik
December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Telangana: Sukesh Gupta failed on OTS, MMTC tells ED||HYDERABAD: The Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) Ltd has replied to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that industrialist and jeweller Sukesh Gupta, who is an accused in CBI and money laundering cases, failed to pay the defaulted money as part of one-time settlement (OTS) agreement. Sukesh Gupta got a stay on ED investigation from high court in October 2019 on the pretext he had executed an OTS with MMTC. Gupta was accused in the Rs 228 crore MMTC fraud case. The ED has asked MMTC on December 16 to give the present status of OTS between MMTC and MBS group of companies. MMTC general manager RL Gautam, in his reply to the ED, said: “MBS replied on September 18, 2019, to our letter. We have asked MBS to provide an initial deposit of Rs 11.5 crore which is 5% of outstanding in the book of account of Rs 228 crore to consider its proposal as per our OTS policy. MBS had agreed to deposit an initial amount of Rs 11.4 crore in October reply and requested to provide bank details for transfer of the amount. Bank details were provided to MBS.” MBS transferred Rs 2 crore — one each on November 8, 2019, and Nov 25. “Apart from these two cheques, cheques of Rs 1.5 crore were also deposited on Nov 26, 2019, but both the cheques were dishonoured due to MBS stopping the payment. The party had failed to honour its commitment. In the mean time, validity of OTS policy expired on December 12. Due to this, any proposal of the party cannot be considered under OTS policy of MMTC,” he said. Sukesh Gupta told courts that he had exported diamonds worth Rs 220 crore in 2013 to Link Fai Limited based in Hong Kong, but the company is yet to pay him. When TOI tried to contact, Sukesh Gupta was not available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sukesh-gupta-failed-on-ots-mmtc-tells-ed/articleshow/79847134.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
December 22, 2020||Lucknow||Families miss personal touch, watch wards’ honouring online||Lucknow: It was a proud moment for 90-year-old Maya Tyagi to see her granddaughter Richa being awarded a gold medal at King George’s Medical University’s (KGMU) 16th convocation on Monday without having to leave her home. The nonagenarian had the pandemic to thank for which enabled her to watch the ceremony live while sitting in her Hapur home. KGMU decided to stream the event live due to restrictions on gatherings in wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. Unlike previous years when the event used to witness large crowds, KGMU invited only 200 guests — including the 46 medal winners — to the convocation this year in accordance with the Covid-19 safety protocols. The medal winners were allowed to bring a family member each. Initially seen as a disappointment, the decision became a blessing in disguise for family members like Maya who got a chance to attend the ceremony virtually. “I was confident that my granddaughter will shine as she is intelligent and a hard worker. The entire family wanted to see her get the award,” Maya told TOI after watching her granddaughter Dr Richa Tyagi, an MD in respiratory medicine, get the Dr RN Tandon Gold Medal. Tears of joy rolled down the cheeks of Ankita Kumari when she saw her daughter Dr Abhilasha climb up the stage to get the Late Dr Raghvesh Prasad Gold Medal for being best postgraduate girl student in MD paediatrics. “Every parent deserves a daughter like mine,” said a proud Ankita, who watched the ceremony online from Kanpur. Arrangements were made at Kalam Centre at the KGMU campus for other students so that they could watch the convocation live on large TV screens. However, safety protocols took a backseat after the ceremony as students were seen hugging each other, clicking selfies and celebrating the day when they officially became a doctor. Dr Deepa Agrawal, who got the Prof Avinash Kumar Gold Medal for t he best MD radiotherapy student, was missing her father who passed away in November. “I am sure he will be feeling proud in heaven. My other family members watched me getting felicitated live,” she said. “The joy and pride I felt today was matchless,” said Dr Anikta Singh, who won a gold medal for being best student in community medicine. Her doctor husband also attended the function. Dr Shubham Srivastava, who bagged the Dr BN Sinha Gold Medal for best thesis, said, “I am sure everyone got goosebumps while taking the oath.” He has an MS orthopaedics. Dr Nishith Agrwal, winner of Shitla Chandra Bajpai Gold Medal for being best MD paediatrics student, said he felt proud to have fulfilled the expectations of his parents who were also doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/families-miss-personal-touch-watch-wards-honouring-online/articleshow/79847798.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

December 22, 2020||Vijayawada||Tirupati: TTD withdraws 2008 gold coating project||TIRUPATI: Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has discontinued the option for donors to take back their donations to Ananda Nilayam Anantha Swarnamayam project. The decision was taken based on the recommendations of TTD finance committee under trust board chairman YV Subba Reddy. In 2008, the TTD had decided to apply gold coating to the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Venkateswara temple at Tirumala at a cost of Rs 100 crore under its Ananda Nilayam Anantha Swarnamayam project. As TTD linked donor privileges to the scheme over a period of 25 years, 83 people donated 94.809 kilos of gold and 187 people donated Rs 12.86 crore to the temple body. Following the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh high court the TTD was forced to shelve the Ananda Nilayam Anantha Swarnamayam project in 2010. In 2011, TTD framed guidelines to transfer or return the gold and cash deposits received under the scheme. There were four options—take back the donation, be it gold or cash, and forego donor privileges, donors could issue letters to move their donations to TTD treasury and continue the privileges accorded to them, transfer the donations to other TTD trusts and enjoy donor privileges or prepare an ornament of their choice and donate it to TTD. When TTD sent communication to 83 gold donors, only three from Tamil Nadu took back their gold weighing 2.99 kg while 26 donors gave consent to move gold donations weighing a total of 26.98 kg to the TTD treasury. Similarly, out of the 187 cash donors, only one donor from New Delhi took back his donation worth Rs 1 crore, while another three donors including Reliance Industries Limited gave their consent to transfer their donations worth Rs 7.25 crore to other TTD trusts. Left with about 60.28 kg gold and Rs 4.61 crore cash under the scheme and having waited for almost 10 years, but with no communication from the donors, TTD’s finance committee observed that, “the consent offer cannot be open-ended and the same is now deemed to have been closed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-withdraws-2008-gold-coating-project/articleshow/79844853.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||‘Justice eludes common man & I will fight for them’||HYDERABAD: UoH scholar Rohith Vemula’s suicide in January 2016 stirred the conscience of the nation and triggered a new political wave. Emerging out of the shadows, his younger brother Raja Vemula is now trying to find his feet as an advocate. With justice eluding his brother, Raja tells Preeti Biswas that he wants to fight for the common man. Excerpts from the interview What are the kind of struggles you have faced after Rohith’s death? What were the most challenging times for you and your family?Nearly five years after my brother’s death, every day is a challenge for us. Even today, I am driving a taxi with a cab operator to manage my family’s expenses. Living in a country where you have to constantly prove your own identity is the most challenging task. We are thankful to people who have supported us and helped us in our tough times. How has yours and your mother Radhika’s life shaped since Jan 2016?Before Rohith’s suicide, we were living in shadows, far away from the society. My mother didn’t know how a university functions and about castes in a society. After my brother’s death, we travelled several places and met so many people in order to get justice. Today, with the support of people, we have been able to put up a fight against the caste system that prevails in our country, which we did not imagine we could do before Rohith’s death. You have always wanted to be a scientist. But, you pursued LLB and now became an advocate. What led to the change? I pursued masters of science in applied geology from Puducherry University. Before Rohith’s death, I was working as a project assistant in NGRI. After my brother’s death, I realised that if I become a scientist, only I will be benefited from it. Whereas, I wanted to help people. During the protests, I realised that it is only law that can help people get justice. Therefore, I had decided to shift and pursue LLB. Now, I intend to pursue LLM and subsequently do my PhD. What kind of issues would you like to fight for as an advocate?Right from farmers to Dalits, every person is fighting his or her own battle. I want to fight against right-wing totalitarian. Whatever is happening in the national capital region with the farmers is unfortunate. Government is ignoring key issues that affect people. As an advocate, I want to fight for all such issues that affect people at the grassroots. It’s been five years that the case against the accused in the Rohith Vemula case has been pending. Your thoughts on it. I don’t even know what’s happening in courts. The buck stopped at proving whether we belong to the Scheduled Castes or not. It has been five years, but nothing has changed. No investigation. If this is how the system works, how can a common man expect justice from the court of law. Therefore, I want to fight as an advocate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/justice-eludes-common-man-i-will-fight-for-them/articleshow/79847146.cms||Preeti Biswas
December 22, 2020||Kochi||Duo to run from Kashmir to Kanyakumari for a 'healthy India'||KOCHI: Two members of Team Panampilly Nagar Runners (Team PNR), a ‘chapter of Soles of Cochin’, are all set to run from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, starting from January 12. Ram Ratan and Sanjay Kumar will cover 11 states with an aim to raise awareness on good health. They will cover 91 cities and over 1,000 villages during the run. Called ‘K2K run 2021’, Ratan and Kumar will run on the NH 41. “We plan to cover around 70km per day,” said Ratan. The duo, who work in the Indian Navy, aim to spread the message of a healthy and fit India. While the pandemic saw the entire nation coming together to combat the deadly communicable disease Covid-19, there is growing concern that it is resulting in rise of non-communicable diseases as well. The mission of ‘K2K run 2021’ is to raise awareness across the nation about non-communicable diseases, lifestyle hazards, mental health issues, disabilities and more. They will run 4,431 km in 56 days, beginning on January 12, which is the World Youth Day and culminate on March 8 on International Women’s Day. They will also carry the message of women empowerment. The runners will reach Srinagar on January 8 and will start their run from that city. “We plan to run from 3am till 10am covering about 50km and from 5pm to 8pm in the evening covering about 25 to 30km. Our route and running time have been charted. An SUV will accompany us, which will have a three-member team, including a physiotherapist. We are carrying tents. However, as per our plan we will reach some city every night. In places like Rajasthan where there is huge distance between cities, we will stay in town hotels. We expect other runners to join us on certain stretches,” Ratan said. ‘Together We Can’, an NGO which working in the field of mental health and disabilities, has joined to support the team. They will also tie-up with other organizations to promote the message of good health and ‘fit India’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/duo-to-run-4431-km-for-a-healthy-india/articleshow/79844859.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
December 22, 2020||Dehradun||No winter break for board students in U’khand||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand education department is planning to cancel winter vacations for the current academic year (2020-21). The decision is being considered after the majority of the academic year was lost due to Covid-19. The decision will be applicable only for board students of Classes X and XII. However, the decision hasn’t gone down well with several teachers who claim that it is unfair on the teachers to load them with extra work.

December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Maidan ‘filth’: Calcutta HC orders suo motu PIL||KOLKATA: Calcutta high court, on Monday, ordered the lodging of a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) on dumping of waste, illegal parking and construction of concrete structures on the Kolkata Maidan despite orders by the Supreme Court against such activity. The bench of Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Arijit Banerjee has directed the registrar to inform the GOC-in-C, Eastern Command and authorities at the Bengal Area of this order. The state has also been directed to identify its agencies associated with the upkeep of the Maidan so they may be present on Thursday when the matter comes up for hearing. The day’s hearing was held virtually in the presence of the additional solicitor general and state advocate general. The Maidan, the largest patch of greens in the city, belongs to the Ministry of Defence and is looked after by the Local Military Authority. Maintenance and law and order vests on the state authorities. The court was particularly critical of the ‘filth’ that the famous Brigade Parade Ground has turned into and parking of vehicles along Casuarina Avenue, Hospital Road, Queen’s Way, Kidderpore Road and Cathedral Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/maidan-filth-hc-orders-suo-motu-pil/articleshow/79845934.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
December 22, 2020||Amaravati||Tirupati: TTD withdraws 2008 gold coating project||TIRUPATI: Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has discontinued the option for donors to take back their donations to Ananda Nilayam Anantha Swarnamayam project. The decision was taken based on the recommendations of TTD finance committee under trust board chairman YV Subba Reddy. In 2008, the TTD had decided to apply gold coating to the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Venkateswara temple at Tirumala at a cost of Rs 100 crore under its Ananda Nilayam Anantha Swarnamayam project. As TTD linked donor privileges to the scheme over a period of 25 years, 83 people donated 94.809 kilos of gold and 187 people donated Rs 12.86 crore to the temple body. Following the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh high court the TTD was forced to shelve the Ananda Nilayam Anantha Swarnamayam project in 2010. In 2011, TTD framed guidelines to transfer or return the gold and cash deposits received under the scheme. There were four options—take back the donation, be it gold or cash, and forego donor privileges, donors could issue letters to move their donations to TTD treasury and continue the privileges accorded to them, transfer the donations to other TTD trusts and enjoy donor privileges or prepare an ornament of their choice and donate it to TTD. When TTD sent communication to 83 gold donors, only three from Tamil Nadu took back their gold weighing 2.99 kg while 26 donors gave consent to move gold donations weighing a total of 26.98 kg to the TTD treasury. Similarly, out of the 187 cash donors, only one donor from New Delhi took back his donation worth Rs 1 crore, while another three donors including Reliance Industries Limited gave their consent to transfer their donations worth Rs 7.25 crore to other TTD trusts. Left with about 60.28 kg gold and Rs 4.61 crore cash under the scheme and having waited for almost 10 years, but with no communication from the donors, TTD’s finance committee observed that, “the consent offer cannot be open-ended and the same is now deemed to have been closed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ttd-withdraws-2008-gold-coating-project/articleshow/79849304.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
December 22, 2020||Trichy||Yield loss inevitable, compensate all who raised paddy: Farmers||Trichy: Farmers from delta districts have urged the state government to provide compensation to all farmers who raised samba paddy without considering whether their field has been inundated or not. This was because even though the crop will not appear damaged in the recent rain, yield loss was inevitable. Officials say farmers have cultivated samba paddy on over 10 lakh acres in Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur districts alone in the season. However, standing crop was inundated in the recent cyclone Nivar and heavy rain triggered by Burevi in three districts. Director of agriculture V Dhakshinamoorthy said after assessment that crops raised on 7.53 lakh acres were inundated out of which those on 6.86 lakh acres were damaged in the rain. “Once the crop lies inundated for one or two days, the grains will not mature 100%. So, there will be a yield loss. The government should consider the plight of all farmers and announce compensation,” said P S Masilamani, district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam affiliated to CPI.Meanwhile, farmers from Orathanadu and surrounding areas carried out a protest blocking traffic on Pattukottai main road demanding adequate number of direct procurement centres (DPCs). Since they have cultivated early samba crops and started harvest, they urged the district administration to open DPCs immediately. Hundreds of acres of paddy fields were inundated in the rain in Orathanadu, Ulur, Sadaiyarkoil, Soorakottai, Thuraiyundarkottai in Orathanadu block in Thanjavur district. Although the crops had matured in the last week of November, it could not be harvested due to the rain, but the process is now on at a brisk pace. A DPC functioning in Thennamanaadu has been closed for the last one week as a result of which farmers could not sell their produce. Since there was no response from the officials, a group of farmers gathered along with tractors and bullock carts on the Orathanadu-Pattukottai road and blocked the road. Traffic was affected for more than an hour. They dispersed only after officials arrived and assured them to do the needful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/yield-loss-inevitable-compensate-all-who-raised-paddy-farmers/articleshow/79847179.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj
December 22, 2020||Goa||Private varsities may begin in Goa from next academic year: CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said four private universities have approached the state government for permission to set up campuses in Goa, and that they may begin operations from the next academic year. At present, the state-run Goa University, on the Taleigao plateau, is the state’s sole university. The legislative assembly had in February passed the Goa Private Universities Bill, 2020, paving the way for institutions affiliated to private universities to set up shop in the state. In his Budget speech, Sawant had spelt out his plan to make Goa an education hub. “Within a short span of time, the state government will clear the applications from the respective universities after going through the courses they have on offer,” the chief minister told reporters on Monday. “Even international universities have approached the state government for permission to set up here.” He indicated that the government was likely to decide on the pending applications from universities within a month. As per the Goa Private Universities Bill, 2020, a university will be allowed in the state upon the fulfilment of certain conditions such as the creation of a permanent endowment fund of at least Rs 5 crore by the sponsoring body, ownership of the land, building the infrastructure facilities required for establishing a university and appointing at least one professor, two associate professors and an adequate number of assistant professors and support staff for each department or discipline. Sawant said that while there was presently no opposition to the establishment of private universities in the state, NGOs were likely to oppose the idea. “In the interest of the youth and students, we have to allow private universities to offer new types of courses,” he said. Coal-handling will be slashed by 50% Panaji. Reiterating his stand on the double-tracking issue, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said the government would proceed with the project but that coal-handling in the state would be reduced by half. He also accused “politically motivated NGOs” of obstructing development in the state. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pvt-varsities-may-begin-in-state-from-next-academic-yr-cm/articleshow/79847177.cms||Murari Shetye
December 22, 2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan 10th in no. of leopards in tiger reserves||JAIPUR: The ‘Status of Leopard in India 2018’ report, released by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday, has put the number of leopards in Rajasthan's tiger reserves at 476. The report has recorded leopard populations only in tiger-occupied protected areas in the state, including Mukundara, Ranthambore and Sariska reserve areas. The study, conducted across 18 states, put the state in the 10th position in the category. The highest number of leopards has been recorded in MP (3,421), followed by Karnataka (1,783) and Maharashtra (1,690). The figures have been welcomed by wildlife lovers in the state. Vishwaraj Singh, a wildlife enthusiast, said, “The state has five national parks, 25 wildlife sanctuaries and 11 conservation reserves which constitute the protected area network, covering 2.92% of the geographical area of the state. The total leopard population in the state could be above 700, including the 476 in tiger reserves.” A forest staff from Sariska Tiger Reserve said, “There are around 60 leopards in the reserve. Earlier, many were constantly straying out in search of food. An effort has been made to reduce human disturbance in the reserve and improve grassland and prey base.” Experts, however, believe that the number could have increased if the government had taken adequate steps on time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-10th-in-no-of-leopards-in-tiger-reserves/articleshow/79847204.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Dry waste fire causes pollution in Lake||KOLKATA: Dry green waste, including grass, weeds and worn out tree branches, dumped on the sides of Rabindra Sarobar stadium, are often set on fire, causing severe air pollution and distress to local residents. Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), the custodian of Rabindra Sarobar, has started deploying some of their security guards from Monday to prevent the nuisance. On Sunday night, some of the dry waste that had accumulated beside the auditorium went set alight and the entire area was engulfed by smoke. The KMDA authorities had to call in a fire tender to douse the same. “We have been raising the issue for some time that dry waste is getting dumped by the side of the lake. On Sunday night, such waste caught fire and the smoke spread to such an extent that we could not even stand on our balcony,” said Prabir Kumar Bose, a former director of NIT and a resident of the area. Green activist, Somendra Mohan Ghosh, said a few such fires have occurred in the area, causing severe pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dry-waste-fire-causes-pollution-in-lake/articleshow/79845974.cms||Suman Chakraborti
December 22, 2020||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Helping MBBS entrants overcome ‘fear of English’||TRICHY: Securing an MBBS seat in a government medical college was a dream come true for R Gayathri of Maangadu in Pudukottai district. However, having undergone her schooling in Tamil medium in a government school, the fear of learning the MBBS curriculum in English began haunting her. But help has come for Gayathri and others as they await classes to start in February, thanks to the English language proficiency sessions by a voluntary organisation. With a total of 14 students from government schools managing to get an MBBS seat under 7.5% reservation from Pudukottai, Namathu Nanbaragal Narpani Iyakkam – a voluntary organisation based in the district – is training nine of them to improve their English proficiency. Coordinator of the education wing of the organisation, K Sivanesan, said they realised that the students from government schools would struggle in English once the MBBS classes begin as they compete with students from matriculation and CBSE schools who will be well-versed in the language. “We decided to improve the confidence level of these students by not just teaching English but removing their fear of the language. Most of the students are familiar with the language but they were unable to use words appropriately. Instead of focusing more on grammar sessions, we tried to focus on making them speak and correct their mistakes,” said Sivanesan. After a week-long training session, Gayathri is confident of introducing herself in English in front of others besides forming simple sentences. M Dharanika, another student, said Sivanesan could teach the language by knowing their level of understanding and helping them know their mistakes. “Moreover, we interact in English than just write, which has helped us gain confidence in the language,” she said. Sivanesan said they didn’t want to make the students feel left out in the classroom because of their poor English skills. “Further, we are also planning to equip them with the vocabulary of simple medical terms which will be helpful for them during their initial days of learning,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/helping-mbbs-entrants-overcome-fear-of-english/articleshow/79847176.cms||Sampath Kumar
December 22, 2020||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh pushes development in plan to set up industrial parks||AMARAVATI: In a move to attract big-ticket investments into the state, the government has decided to develop five integrated industrial parks over 42,000 acres. The Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) will create the infrastructure required to set up industries in the integrated industrial parks. The Centre has also agreed to extend support to the initiative to boost economic growth. The proposed integrated industrial parks will be coming up in Nellore, YSR Kadapa, Kurnool, Visakhapatnam and Chittoor districts. The Centre has already approved the blueprint by the state government for grant of funds for development of an industrial park in Krishnapatnam. “We are hopeful of getting clearance from the Centre for the remaining four industrial parks,” said industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy. National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT), promoted by the Union industries ministry, is keen to promote the industries along the proposed industrial corridors between Visakhapatnam-Chennai, Chennai-Bengaluru and Hyderabad-Bengaluru. The first integrated industrial park is coming up on an extent of around 2,500 acres in Krishnapatnam. NICDIT has given its green signal for the release of Rs 1,300 crore to create infrastructure in the first phase. The state government has sent detailed project reports (DPRs) to develop similar parks in Kopparthi (YSR Kadapa), Nakkapalli (Visakhapatnam), Srikalahasti (Chittoor) and Orvakal (Kurnool). While APIIC has readied about 13,000 acres for the first phase of development of industrial parks, it has pooled nearly 42,000 acres for the development of the five parks. Gautham Reddy said the industrial parks would play a big role in attracting industries to the state as they were going to develop all facilities required. He said investors are looking at best infrastructure rather than incentives to set up their shop. The minister explained that availability of land, water and cheap power tariff in the state are to be big incentives to bring in industries. The new industrial parks would also generate good employment along with providing economic power to the state, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/state-pushes-development-in-plan-to-set-up-industrial-parks/articleshow/79844868.cms||Samdani MN

December 22, 2020||Dehradun||Lab technician booked for issuing fake Covid-19 certificates to 50 Army aspirants||DEHRADUN: A lab technician in Ramnagar’s government hospital was booked under sections 420, 466 and 468 of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly issuing fake Covid-19 certificates to around 50 applicants appearing in the ongoing Army recruitment exam in Kotdwar. Talking to TOI, Dr Bhagirathi Joshi, chief medical officer (Nainital), confirmed that a lab technician of a government hospital in Ramnagar has issued fake Covid-19 negative certificates to applicants appearing in Army recruitment exam. “The matter came to light when an Army recruitment officer found two different signatures on the Covid certificates issued from the same place.

SHO of Ramnagar police station, Abul Kalam, said that the accused, Prashant Badoli, was booked under cheating and forging documents. “We have received multiple copies of the fake certificates till now but it is expected that the number of fake certificates issued may go up to 50. He has charged these applicants money against issuing fake Covid-19 negative reports,” added the SHO. Also, 10 Army applicants were tested Covid-19 positive when they were all set to appear for the fitness test. They were later isolated by the health department. Meanwhile, with 448 new Covid-19 cases reported in the state on Monday, the tally shot up to 86,765.

December 22, 2020||Goa||‘All hope is lost’: Surging mutant virus hijacks Goa’s dreams of charter season||PANAJI: With the Indian government suspending flights to the UK till the end of this month amid fears of a new strain of Covid-19 found there, operators in Goa have given up hopes of charter flights from the European nation landing in Goa during the ongoing tourist season. “All hope is lost. There’s no chance of charters from the UK coming to Goa this season,” Ernest Dias, chief operating officer (COO) at Sita Travels told TOI. The operators are now hoping that the government will at least permit a travel bubble with Russia to help lift the state’s tottering tourism sector. In a last ditch attempt, the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) had submitted a memorandum to Rupinder Brar, additional director general, ministry of tourism, when she was in Goa to attend a domestic road show on Saturday. Association president Nilesh Shah said TTAG has yet again requested the tourism ministry for an immediate announcement to allow charters and scheduled international flights into Goa under the travel bubble policy of the Indian government from January 1 next year. It will allow the operators some time to plan as the flights need to be announced and sold, and more importantly, flying and landing permissions have to be obtained. “The additional director general told us the tourism ministry is aware of our problems and that our concerns have been conveyed to the Union home ministry. We are hoping an announcement with regard to Russia will happen in January. We are willing to follow SOPs that may be issued for foreign arrivals,” Shah said. Dias said that although Russian tour operators had hinted two months ago that they would not prefer operating for just three months if there was an announcement of Indian borders opening in December, operators here have been receiving feedback from their Russian counterparts that the latter will continue operations till May if the travel ban is lifted next month. While the charter season for Goa ends by March-April, the state has received a few charters from Russia even in May over the past two years. “Tour operators are also going through a tough phase, so they are willing to start operations. We expect a positive development in January,” Dias said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-hope-is-lost-surging-mutant-virus-hijacks-states-dreams-of-charter-season/articleshow/79847231.cms||Bindiya Chari
December 22, 2020||Goa||Goa CM to officials: Import beef from other states||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Monday that he has directed the department of animal husbandry and veterinary services to source live animals and beef from other states to ensure that there’s no shortage of it in the state. Since very little beef is coming from Karnataka, some dealers have reached out to Delhi for supplies, while others are contemplating sourcing the red meat from Kerala. “I worship the cow, but as chief minister of the state, it is my duty to take care of the minority population,” he said, replying to a question on BJP having a different position on beef in other states. “There is a 30% minority population in Goa that eats beef,” he said. Beef supply from Karnataka started on Saturday after eight consecutive days of meat stores being shut. However, the quantity is far less than usual, leading traders to make inquiries if it can be transported by rail from Delhi, and from Kerala. “Some stock currently comes from Delhi by train in the form of pre-packaged frozen beef,” said Simon Baretto, who owns a cold meat storage unit in Margao. “There is no ban in Delhi, so dealers there can continue supplying the meat to us. The next option is Kerala, for which we will have to go there and arrange the supply.” President of the All Goa Cold Storage Owners’ Association, Vernon Lobo, said that there has been a 75% drop in the quantity of beef coming in from Belagavi after supply resumed over the weekend. “When the law gets enforced, our suppliers from Belagavi will have no other alternative but to stop sending beef to Goa,” he said. “Currently, the quantity we receive gets over within an hour or two. While we are presently getting some stock from Delhi, the rates are higher due to transportation. It’s roughly Rs 50-70 cheaper to procure it from Karnataka.” Mohammad Siddiqui has been receiving supply of beef at his cold storage store from Monday, but all of the 100kg he received sold out the same day. “Christmas is just around the corner, and people are unsure about until when supply is going to be consistent,” he said. Currently, round beef is selling for Rs 380-400 kg, tongue for Rs 400 and undercut for Rs 500 a kg. Proprietor of a prominent hypermarket in Panaji said that he has been sourcing beef from Maharashtra from trusted suppliers and has therefore not been affected by the Karnataka bill. “When we can get beef from a neighbouring state, there is no need to go as far as Kerala or Delhi. And that is how it should be,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-to-officials-import-beef-from-other-states/articleshow/79847210.cms||Murari Shetye

Earlier, local MLA Samineni Udayabhanu listed out a number of issues to be resolved in the constituency. He said successive governments ignored the development of the area and requested the chief minister to take up and resolve the pending issues. Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams chairman YV Subba Reddy and Veda pundits from the Tirumala temple also extended the blessings of Lord Venkateswara to the chief minister on his birthday at his camp office in Tadepalli. The Veda pundits rendered Vedasirvachanam on the CM, following which he was handed over the temple’s laddu prasadam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ysrc-functionaries-donate-35k-units-of-blood-on-cms-birthday/articleshow/79850550.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Bareilly||UP authorities defying SC observation by making bids to prevent our essential food supplies from reaching UP-Delhi border’||Pilibhit: With over 100 women and children, a group of 200 farmers from different villages of Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur and Kheri, who had assembled outside Kajri Gurdwara on Monday morning and started their journey for the UP-Delhi border along with 22 tractor-trolleys full of grain, pulses, wheat flour, rice, quilts and blankets, were stopped by police on Pilibhit-Basti NH 730 near Bhopatpur village on Monday. But foiling all attempts of police to stop them, they crossed the border of Pilibhit district at Bareilly-Haridwar NH-74 by 6.15 pm to continue their journey with the support of over one thousand local agriculturists.The farmers said that the authorities were openly defying the recent Supreme Court observation of their “right to peaceful protest” by obstructing their way.This was the third occasion when the administration had deployed heavy police force to foil the attempt of farmers to carry essential supplies to the Delhi border for the protesting farmers. Prior to this, three tractor trolleys had been stopped by the administration at midnight on December 19 and another two in the late hours on December 12.The farmers first staged a three-hour-long dharna near Bhopatpur. They raised slogans in support of their unity and then removed the police barriers to move forward. The administration then barricaded the NH at the bridge of Hardoi feeder canal near Udaikaranpur village in Puranpur area.Till the time the tractor-trolleys reached the spot, over 700 to 800 local farmers and 100 workers of Bhartiya Kisan Union from Puranpur area had joined them. Irked over police attempts to stop their movement, the farmers threw the barricades into the feeder canal.After they moved up to the Assam road police post on the outskirts of Pilibhit city, the administration again blocked their way by deploying the force of 13 police stations and a company of the Provincial Armed Constabulary apart from putting a layer of barricades.District magistrate Pulkit Khare, superintendent of police Jai Prakash Yadav, ASP Pavitra Mohan Tripathi, three COs, two ADMs and city magistrate Arun Kumar Singh were present there to control the situation but the farmers on their tractors pushed through the barricades.Finally, police placed two trucks on NH 74 at Shahi police post of Jahanabad police station near the border of Pilibhit district and made the last attempt to stop them. After a confrontation between the two sides that lasted for half an hour, the police had to remove the trucks and allow them the passage.No district official made any comment on the police action, except Puranpur SDM Rajendra Prasad, who curtly said, “I don’t need to reply to any question on the situation here.”Bhartiya Kisan Union district vice-president Manjit Singh said, “The role of the administration was suppressive and highly condemnable. It was aimed at breaking the supply chain of essential material for the ‘peaceful kisan agitators’ which was not only unfortunate but also against the democratic norms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-authorities-defying-sc-observation-by-making-bids-to-prevent-our-essential-food-supplies-from-reaching-up-delhi-border/articleshow/79844910.cms||Keshav Agarwal
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||GMCH gets Rs12 crore, SSH Rs9 crore boost||Nagpur: The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) is all set for a facelift in 2021 as budgetary proposals worth Rs 21 crore — Rs 12 crore for GMCH and Rs 9 crore for super speciality hospital (SSH) attached to it — submitted by dean Dr Sajal Mitra were sanctioned on Monday. The GMCH and the SSH attached to it will get many advanced facilities in the next six months as purchases have already begun. Dr Mitra told TOI that the cardiology department in SSH will get advanced cath lab costing about Rs 6 crore. “This will be second cath lab for the department and will benefit poor heart patients coming to the hospital from across Central India,” he said. With additional PG seats sanctioned in the last two years, the department has added more professors and students. The enhanced strength will be utilized and the number of surgeries will double next year. In an important boost for the gynaecology department, the in vitro fertilization (IVF) facility will be reintroduced at GMCH. “The IVF is a costly process and childless couples coming from poor family backgrounds can hardly afford it. At GMCH, the facility will be free,” said Dr Mitra. The orthopaedic department, which is the home department of the dean, will get a unique bone bank costing Rs 1.10 crore. “GMCH will be the first medical college in Central India to have bone bank. It works just like a blood bank. It will procure, process and store bones,” said Dr Mitra. Bones will be harvested within seven hours after the death of the donor. They can be used by orthopaedic surgeons in spine surgery, replacement surgeries, revision surgeries, trauma, oncology, filling cavities in maxilla and mandible.Another important addition will be the human milk bank which will be established by spending Rs25 lakh. Nagpur has only private milk banks run with the help of NGOs. For surgery students, the already under-construction simulation lab will get advanced equipment worth Rs 2 crore. The molecular diagnostic laboratory will be installed in microbiology department at a cost of Rs 75 lakh. This lab will be a multi-purpose addition for GMCH. “Cancer diagnosis as well as to-the-point treatment will be possible with this lab. Selected chemotherapy can be delivered with its use,” said Dr Mitra who has got these sanctions for second budget since taking over in 2019. “Instead of just running the show, my focus is on value addition to infrastructure. Together with the HODs of respective departments, we have come up with these plans. They will be reality in the next six months,” said Dr Mitra.

December 22, 2020||Dehradun||In a first, Udham Singh Nagar to get solar-power irrigation schemes||RUDRAPUR: The Udham Singh Nagar district administration is all set to implement the integrated solar-based micro irrigation scheme across the district. Introducing the scheme, the Chief Development Officer (CDO) of the district, Himanshu Khurana, said that in the first phase, 13 such units will be introduced and in the next financial year, when budget from the Government of India is released, the scheme will be further expanded. Talking to TOI, Khurana said, “Udham Singh Nagar is an agriculture-based district. However, the agricultural sector needs proper irrigation facilities and other amenities to reap proper benefits. The major constraint in this sector is farmers’ dependency on electric pumps for irrigation. To reduce this dependency, we have decided to introduce solar power water pumps in the district.” On a pilot basis, two such units have been developed, said CDO Khurana. “The cost of one unit will be around Rs 11 lakh with free yearly maintenance. These solar-powered pumps will be of 5KW capacity and can serve for more than twenty years at almost negligible running cost. The solar-based micro irrigation system would not only save electricity and water usage considerably but also prove to be economical for farmers,” he added. Khurana said that the administration will conduct drives to encourage farmers of the district for community irrigation, adding that the district administration would make available infrastructure in those areas which switch over to solar water pumps. “We hope to get a budget for this scheme in the next financial year under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM KUSUM) Scheme,” he further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-a-first-udham-singh-nagar-to-get-solar-power-irrigation-schemes/articleshow/79844909.cms||Aakash Ahuja
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Woman shot at in Delhi for turning down marriage proposal, 2 held||NEW DELHI: A 23-year-old man who had shot at a woman at point-blank range in Mohan Garden on Friday was arrested within 24 hours of the crime. The man, who is married and has two children, had met the woman on TikTok ten months ago. He was forcing the woman to marry him and attempted to kill her when she refused. The woman, who works at a beauty parlour, sustained a bullet injury in her stomach and her condition is stated to be critical. The accused has been identified as Karan Singh who runs a self-finance business and belongs to Sonepat in Haryana. His aide, 22-year-old Praveen Singh from Panipat, has also been arrested. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said a case of attempt to murder was earlier registered. An inquiry revealed that the two men had come on a motorcycle to shoot the woman. “The bike used by the two men was stolen and had a fake number plate. On Saturday, the cops received an information that Karan and Praveen would come near Goyla Dairy area. A trap was laid and both the accused were arrested. A country-made pistol, three live rounds, one empty round and one stolen motorcycle used in the crime were recovered from them,” the DCP said. Meena said, both the accused confessed that they had shot at the girl in her house as she had refused to marry Karan. “Karan said that he and the woman had come across each other through TikTok ten months ago and they soon started meeting each other. But three months ago, the woman came to know about Karan's wife and children, and she started distancing herself from him. On this, Karan asked the woman to marry him but she refused,” Meena said. Police are yet to find the source of the weapon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-shot-at-for-turning-down-marriage-proposal-2-held/articleshow/79846007.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Goa||Churches across Goa to have more Masses on Christmas day to ensure no faithful left out||PANAJI: Churches are planning additional Masses, putting up screens in church compounds and will be going to smaller chapels to celebrate Christmas Mass, just to ensure that all faithful get an opportunity to join in the feast while staying safe. A well-wisher decided to lend a screen to Our Lady of Succour Church, Socorro for the occasion after more than 200 people signed up for the midnight Mass in the 200 capacity church that can only occupy 50 inside with social distancing. “We will place another 100-200 chairs — all spaced out — in our garden. Whatever is being celebrated inside the church will be projected to those seated outside. Many people prefer attending midnight Mass and we cannot tell them not to attend,” parish priest Fr Santana Carvalho told TOI. The midnight Mass has been brought forward to 9.30pm and additional Masses are being celebrated on Christmas morning with a special Mass for senior citizens. Those who contracted Covid recently or travelled outside Goa over the past two weeks are being asked to stay away from services. Considering the situation, many parishes are restricting services to two from a family, strictly on registration basis, and holding special Masses during the Christmas week exclusively for seniors above 65 and children below the age of 10. In large parishes, like Navelim and Vasco, priests have decided to celebrate Masses not only in the church, but also in all the chapels in the area. “Christmas Mass is otherwise not celebrated in chapels as everyone attends services in the church. Since since it is not possible to accommodate everyone in church with social distancing, we have decided to increase the number of Masses and reach out to as many people as we can by celebrating Christmas Masses in chapels as well this year,” parish priest of Our Lady of the Rosary Church, Navelim, Fr Arlino De Mello said. In smaller parishes, like the one on the island of Chorao, devotees are being allotted Masses ward wise, with services being celebrated simultaneously in the church and chapels. “We decided to make this sacrifice and celebrate more Masses for Christmas so that nobody is excluded,” assistant parish priest Fr Americo Rodrigues says. All Christmas programmes for children and the youth are being done away with. Few have moved online. In Socorro, not to dampen the spirits of the children, the church has planned online singing and Christmas card-making competitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-masses-on-christmas-day-to-ensure-no-faithful-left-out/articleshow/79847267.cms||Lisa Monteiro
December 22, 2020||Agra||After 8 yrs of interfaith marriage, Muslim man converts, asks for security from govt||Agra: Eight years after he married a Hindu woman, a Muslim man from Aligarh has converted to Hinduism "with help from" a Hindutva outfit. Qasim Khan, 28, is now Karamveer Singh. "No one forced me. I took this decision on my own," he said on Monday. Qasim had met Anita Kumari, 24, when his father had leased a house from hers for a construction workshop. The two fell in love and got married in 2012. Anita’s family was not entirely on board and, a year later, the couple organised another wedding ceremony, this time following Hindu rituals. Her family moved to Delhi, the couple stayed on in Aligarh and had two children — Kasifa (7) and Ayaz (4). Now, less than a month after the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance 2020 came into effect, Qasim has converted to Hinduism. Qasim kept repeating he did this of his own volition. He did, however, say he needs protective cover. "I had sought security from the district administration but they didn’t get back to me. I request the government again, I need protection," he told TOI over the phone. Anita added, "I was never asked to convert or not follow Hindu rituals. My in-laws don’t live here either, so there has been no need for that kind of negotiation." Qasim, too, said he never wanted Anita to give up her faith. For his own conversion, the "helping hand" came from the local unit of a Hindutva outfit. Neeraj Bhardwaj, a member of the outfit, who got Qasim converted, told TOI, "They are welcome to the fold of Hindu religion. We did the rituals at Arya Samaj temple on Sunday." He added that Qasim had applied for a legal conversion to the district magistrate on December 15. But after he got no response for five days, the temple took over. In an elaborate ceremony involving ritual "purification", Qasim and his children were inducted into Hinduism. His daughter Kasifa is now Kashish and Ayaz is Anshu. "They have been given documents from the temple certifying they are Hindu now," Bhardwaj added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/after-8-yrs-of-interfaith-marriage-muslim-man-converts-asks-for-security-from-govt/articleshow/79844933.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The decision was taken to encourage the domestic market for brackish water aquaculture products, nearly 95% of which is currently exported to the US, China and countries in Europe. If the area is increased, the products can be sold in the domestic market and in the near future, in the government’s proposed YSR Janata Bazaars too, said P Koteswara Rao, principal, State Institute of Fisheries Technology and additional deputy director of the fisheries department. The government has proposed setting up around 22,000 YSR Janata Bazaars in villages and towns. Rao said brackish water aquaculture is a suitable option for entrepreneurs who have suffered losses in business or those who have lost jobs in the pandemic as the government is offering incentives such as subsidised power at a rate of Rs 1.5 per unit. In a first in the country, the government has constituted a board, AP State Aquaculture Development Authority, to develop fisheries sector, he added. “A minimum of Rs 10 lakh per hectare is required. Even those with little or no education can do good business, but they must have the interest to acquire the skills,” Koteswara Rao told TOI. Brackish water aquaculture requires a salinity to 5 to 15 PPT, which is favorable for Vannamei prawn. At present, nearly 95,000 persons carry out the trade with an annual production of eight lakh metric tonnes while another 500 have shown interest and close to 40 applications have been received in Visakhapatnam district. “Our mandal level committee is scrutinising the applications for issuance for license for brackish water aquaculture. We have received nearly 40 applications,” said Phani Prakash, joint director, AP fisheries department, Visakhapatnam. Recounting a success story, a fisheries official said a farmer produced 17 metric tonnes of Vannamei prawn in 3.2 hectares of brackish aquaculture and sold the produce for Rs 85 lakh, earning Rs 27 lakh per hectare. With a minimum investment of Rs 10 lakh per hectare, the farmer made a profit of Rs 17 lakh. It is possible when all parameters are favourable, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/govt-eyes-domestic-mkt-in-boost-to-brackish-water-aquaculture/articleshow/79844939.cms||V Kamalakara Rao
December 22, 2020||Agra||RSS farmers’ wing demands MSP guarantee||Agra: Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), a farmer's organization associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), staged protest at the district headquarters here on Monday against the three new farm laws and demanded the central government guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for farm produce. The BKS leaders handed over a memorandum addressed to PM Narendra Modi to the district authorities demanding that an independent court be set up in each district to resolve farmers’ issues. BKU Braj region president Mohan Singh Chahar said, “The three farm laws need some important amendments. Central government should guarantee MSP to farmers and enact a law making purchase below MSP illegal. Traders purchasing farmers’ produce outside mandis should be registered by the central and state governments. Details regarding them should be made available on an online portal.” He said, “Central government needs to take back relaxation given to traders for stocking farm produce under the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Provision to take legal action and penalize farmers for stubble burning is causing largescale exploitation. It should be abolished.” Meanwhile, Agra collectorate bar association has extended support to farmers’ protest and will observe a one-day strike in solidarity with farmers’ protesting against the three farm laws since the past 26 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rss-farmers-wing-demands-msp-guarantee/articleshow/79844951.cms||Deepak Lavania

December 22, 2020||Delhi||Delhi: Fresh Covid-19 cases go below 1,000||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 803 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, the lowest since August 17 when the city had recorded 787 new cases. On Sunday, 62,440 tests were conducted, including 34,288 RT-PCR tests and 28,152 rapid antigen tests, the state health department said. Health minister Satyendar Jain said Delhi witnessed a lowest positivity rate of 1.29% for the first time in eight months on Monday. “We still need to take precautions to stay safe!” he tweeted. This is the seventh consecutive day when the positivity rate in the city has remained below 2%. The tally of active cases on Monday dropped to 9,255 cases, the first time since August 4 when the number stood at 9,897. The total number of cases of Covid-19 is 6.17 lakh. The toll stands at 10,304, including 27 deaths reported in the last 24 hours, officials said. While the positivity rate in Delhi has been below 5% since December 2, the death rate has been a cause of concern, but that figure too has been dipping compared to the high fatality rate witnessed during the peak of the third wave of Covid-19 last month. Of the total active cases, latest data shows, 5,405 are recuperating in home isolation and 2,909 are admitted in hospitals, apart from 112 in Covid care centres and 26 in Covid health centres. Total 15,877 Covid beds are vacant in hospitals, 7,399 in Covid care centres and 536 in health centres. According to the Delhi Corona app, 819 out of total 1,522 Covid-19 ICU beds with ventilators are vacant, while 2,850 ICU beds without ventilators out of total 3,578 are vacant. “The third wave of Covid-19 is over. But we cannot be complacent. Preventive measures need to be implemented even more strictly to mitigate the risk of another outbreak,” said a senior doctor at Lok Nayak hospital. She added that mutation of SARS-CoV2 – virus that causes Covid-19 – has been reported in the UK. “Many people have travelled to and from the UK in the recent past. They need to be monitored and checked for any possibility of infection due to the mutated virus strain,” the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fresh-cases-go-below-1000/articleshow/79846013.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Hubballi||Love for roosters: Belagavi family holds birthday party for Veeru, Sheru||BELAGAVI: A Belagavi family has celebrated the fifth birthday of a pair of roosters at their home, replete with cake-cutting and lighting of lamps. Images and videos of the “party” have gone viral and the Langarkande family have drawn praise for their love of the birds. The roosters made an appearance on the cake icing, birthday banners and also dropped in for a brief look. The Langarkandes of Maali Galli has 10 members, including three children and the two roosters, Veeru and Sheru. Meghan said the roosters were brought from the market as chicks on December 20 five years ago. “We bought a total of seven chicks. Unfortunately, five of them died within six months. These two turned out be healthy so we decided to name them Veeru and Sheru,” he said. “Our family deals in arecanuts and business was very dull then. We started doing well soon after the birds came home so my father believes they brought us good fortune.” ‘The two roosters are like family members’The kids are so comfortable with the birds now that they play with them and feed them. The party was held at home, it was a family celebration.” The birds are usually fed biscuits in the morning and grains in the day. “They are like family members so we thought of cutting cakes and lighting lamps,” Meghan said. “Veeru & Sheru have become like our children, only that they wake up before us and wake us up to go about our business,” says Meghan.

December 22, 2020||Bengaluru||Karnataka HC stays govt order dropping charges against legislators||BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court on Monday passed an interim order directing authorities not to take further steps following the cabinet decision of August 31, 2020, to withdraw from the prosecution in 61 cases. The cases sought to be withdrawn include those against ministers JC Madhuswamy, Anand Singh, BC Patil and former minister CT Ravi, CM’s political secretary MP Renukacharya. A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka passed the order after the state government sought further time to submit compliance report vis-avis its December 1 order. On Dec 1, as per Supreme Court’s directive in the SK Shukla case, the high court had pointed out that the public prosecutor “cannot act like a post box or act on the dictates of the state government” and he has to act objectively as he is also an officer of the court. Govt told to forward copies of December 1 order to prosecutorsThe government was told to forward copies of its December 1 order to the public prosecutors to whom instructions have been given to withdraw from prosecution in those 61 cases. The bench pointed out the public prosecutors are bound to invite attention of the court to its order when an application is made under Section 321 of the CrPC. “Moreover, action under Section 321 can be taken only with the permission of the court. No court is bound by such a decision taken to withdraw from the prosecution. Even if an application is made under Section 321 of CrPC, the courts are duty bound to assess whether prima facie case is made out or not and that the court has power to reject the prayer,” the bench had observed in their previous order. The court has posted hearing on two PILs to January 29. The state must submit a compliance report by then. In their PIL, People’s Union for Civil Liberties, Karnataka, claimed some cases sought be withdrawn by exercising powers under Section 321 of CrPC are those pending against the elected representatives, who are a part of the state legislature, and such an action is impermissible. In the second PIL, advocate Sudha Katwa cited that a number of cases filed against lawmakers and their followers are sought to be withdrawn in a series of orders passed between August 8, 2014 and May 5, 2020. She claimed it is misuse of powers vested under Section 321 and doesn’t augur well for the criminal justice system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-told-to-forward-copies-of-dec-1-order-to-prosecutors/articleshow/79848350.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Bengaluru||Stage set for first phase of Karnataka gram panchayat polls today||BENGALURU: Amid fears of a second wave of Covid, Karnataka is all set to go for the first phase of gram panchayat (GP) elections on Tuesday. Though the elections are held without using party symbols, control of GPs is seen by BJP, Congress and JD(S) as building blocks to consolidate power at the grassroots that helps in fighting coming civic bodies polls followed by 2023 assembly elections. Elections will be held to 2,930 panchayats on Tuesday and to 2,832 panchayats on December 27. Counting of votes on December 30. Nearly 5,000 candidates have been elected unopposed. Polling will be held from 7am to 5pm in 23,706 booths. EVMs will be used in Bidar district and ballot papers in the rest of the state. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa has said panchayat polls are as crucial as assembly and Lok Sabha elections since they strengthen the organisation at the grassroots. In the 2016 local body polls, according to an estimate by parties, Congress-backed candidates had won 62,000 of 92,000 GP seats in 2015. This time, the ruling BJP has taken the lead, launching ‘Gram Swaraj’ conventions and forming six ministerial teams to oversee the polls. The Congress and JD (S), too, are leaving no stone unturned to retain and wrest seats from political rivals. A security blanket with 80,000 personnel has been thrown around the state for the polls, a police official said. Asha workers drafted for gram panchayat election dutyConsidering Covid-19 pandemic fears, adequate precautions have been put in place by the State Election Commission (SEC). The number of voters from booths have been reduced from 1,500 to 1,000. For the first time, anganwadi and Asha workers, along with health officials, have been drafted for poll duty. Handsanitisers will be made available in polling booths. Covid-positive voters would be allowed to exercise their franchise in the last hour of the polling and they would be assisted by health officials, SEC said. In the light of reports of auctioning of several GP seats for anything between Rs 5 lakh and 50 lakh, SEC has directed officials and returning officers to verify and issue election certificates only after they are convinced that the results were genuine. “If any candidate is found guilty of withdrawing from the fray to facilitate another to get elected, we will countermand such polls and hold them in January when the polls to the remaining gram panchayats are declared. Cases will be slapped against the guilty under Goonda Act,’’ said state election commissioner B Basavaraju. BOX: Some villages vote 1st time in 27 yearsResidents of Tidigol- Nidigol, twin villages in Sindhanur taluk, Raichur and Hangaraki in Dharwad taluk, will vote in gram panchayat elections for the first time since they were made GPs in 1993, reports Sangamesh Menasinakai. Villagers here always preferred unopposed representatives to avoid political clashes. Two lakh to vote in Bengaluru UrbanAround two lakh people in Bengaluru Urban district will cast their vote in the gram panchayat (GP) elections on Tuesday. Deputy commissioner GN Shivamurthy on Monday said the polls will be held in 11 GPs in Bengaluru North and 15 in Yelahanka taluk. Bengaluru North has about 98,422 voters and there are 538 contenders in the fray for 233 seats. Yelahanka has nearly 1.2 lakh voters and there are 719 contenders for 298 seats. 80,000 cops deployedAbout 80,000 personnel of various ranks have been deployed for election duty. The DGP’s office said 10,969 home guards and 1,746 mobile vehicles have been stationed for the first phase along with 111 platoons of Karnataka State Reserve Police (KSRP) and local District Armed Reserve (DAR). Local police heads have been instructed to ensure Covid-19 norms are followed during polling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/asha-workers-drafted-for-gp-election-duty/articleshow/79848353.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: New releases return after 9-month hiatus||VISAKHAPATNAM: Nearly 1,100 film theatres in the two Telugu-speaking states, including 700 in Andhra Pradesh, are set to return to normalcy with the release of new films this year-end. All theatre managements will reopen with compliance with Covid-19 standing operation procedures such as physical distancing and regular disinfection. Managements of film theatres have incurred a Rs 2,000 crore loss in the last nine months due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Nearly 15,000 film theatre employees depend on class-A category theatres, that is, theatres in cities such as Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Hyderabad, Tirupati, Kakinada and Rajahmundry. Speaking to TOI, Andhra Pradesh Film Chamber of Commerce (APFCC) joint secretary Perla Sambamurthy said while 20% of category-A theatres (city-based) will restart full operations with Wonder Woman, a new movie releasing on December 23, the other 80% will be ready to resume operations with Telugu film Solo Brathuke So Better releasing on December 25. Sambamurthy added that film exhibitors and theatre owners have thanked chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy for waiving off electricity charges for three of the nine months and sanctioning Rs 10 lakh loans at 4% interest to interested theatre managements for maintenance works. The step, he said, has benefitted nearly 50% of theatre managements. A film theatre owner, also a member of the Chamber, said Covid-19 directly affected the livelihood of nearly 12,000 regular staff in the state. K Malleswara Rao, a theatre staff at Vijayawada, said apart from regular staff, staff of vehicle stands, wall posters, sanitation and canteens will heave a sigh of relief with theatres reopening. Speaking to TOI, a crew member of Solo Brathuke So Better said theirs was the last film to have completed its shoot in Vizag city in March just before the nationwide lockdown came into force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/new-releases-return-after-9-mnth-hiatus/articleshow/79850546.cms||V Kamalakara Rao

December 22, 2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Kanjur land ‘still sub judice’, panel told MVA govt in January||MUMBAI: Kanjurmarg or Aarey? The CM and his predecessor continue to wrangle over the appropriate site for the Metro car depot though officials under both governments have endorsed the benefits of picking Aarey. Under the present government, a committee headed by principal secretary Manoj Saunik vetoed the idea of a depot at Kanjurmarg in its submissions made in January. The panel’s 98-page report accessed by TOI reveals that officers of the Mumbai suburban collectorate confirmed during site visits that the land at Kanjurmarg “is still sub judice.” This finding is at odds with claims made subsequently by senior bureaucrats that the land under consideration was unencumbered. The Kanjurmarg plot is 8 km from the Aarey site and the panel estimated additional cost of construction up to Kanjurmarg to be Rs 5,600 crore. And, if the plot is determined by courts to be in private hands, cost to acquire it would be Rs 7,862 crore (2.5 times the Ready Reckoner price), it said. Shifting Metro will delay project by 4 yrs: Saunik panel warned govtThe Saunik panel also pointed out that the proposed Kanjurmarg plot for the metro car shed is in a low-lying and marshy area, which would be among the factors that delay commissioning of the project by four years. The panel’s report was submitted in January 2020, but its findings were not accepted; government went ahead with plans to relocate the depot at Kanjurmarg. There will be challenges of “technical integration” and “complexity of interface” between Metro lines 3 and 6 if the car shed is shifted to Kanjurmarg, said the report, a copy of which was made available to this newspaper. It warned that significant changes would be needed in the Line-6 viaducts if the Line-3 depot is to be located at Kanjurmarg. “Line 6 works would need to be suspended immediately. The administrative responsibility for reviewing, redesigning and constructing the revised Line-6 works would have to be transferred to Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) to examine whether joint running is operationally possible between Kanjurmarg and Aarey. This would also require approval of the MMRCL Board, MMRDA, GoM (government of Maharashtra) and Government of India,” it said. Technical integration of systems of the two lines, particularly of the signalling and telecommunication and of the rolling stock will also be challenging. “Line-6 is being designed for a rake composition of six coaches while Line-3 is being designed with rake composition of eight coaches. A different signalling system of Line-6 would complicate the integration further. The committee considers that it is possible to shift the depot at Kanjurmarg if all repercussions related technical, operational, financial and time delays of integration are worth accepting. However, such shifting of depot would not fully address the requirements of Line-3, and would also hamper the frequency of operations of both the Line-3 and Line-6,’’ warned the committee. “As the main passenger corridor of Line-3 is from Cuffe Parade to Aarey, there is an operational need to have a 16-lines stabling yard at Aarey even if the main depot is shifted to Kanjurmarg,” it added. “If such stabling yard is not built at Aarey then all the trains of Line-3 would have to travel an extra about 8 Km, to and from Kanjurmarg, to cater to… requirements of starting operations in the morning, as well as… the peak hours and off-peak hours… Running a mixed stock of trains on the Aarey to Kanjurmarg portion of Line-6 is bound to lead to a lot of operational complexities… and would also hamper frequency of train operations of both Line-3 as well as Line-6. This will affect the carrying capacity as well as operational efficiency of both the lines and would lead to operational losses in the long run,’’ said the report. Commenting on the geotechnical investigations of the Kanjurmarg site, the report said the “subsoil profile is made up of slush overlaying a highly compressible layer of clay on bedrock.” “The clay layer will need pre-consolidation before construction of a depot over it to prevent uneven settlement in formation as uneven settlement of formation will lead to distortions in the track geometry,” it said. The report added that ground improvements and filling works are needed and expected to take about two years after the contract for construction of works is awarded. It further said that extending the line by 8 kms from Aarey to Kanjurmarg is technically feasible, but requires requisite funding for construction. “This construction will take 71 months to complete from the date of starting geotechnical and topographical investigations. Time is needed for investigations, inviting and awarding contracts and the time required for execution, testing and commissioning. Thus, a 71-month period counted from now would delay overall project commissioning by 4 years beyond December 2021, i.e. December 2025, in this option,’’ it said. “The Committee considers that none of the possibilities of shifting the depot to Kanjurmarg meet the requirements of an alternate site to the present location at Aarey within the brief given by the government. Especially as numerous litigations are ongoing about the land,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kanjur-land-still-sub-judice-panel-told-mva-govt-in-jan/articleshow/79847954.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

December 22, 2020||Delhi||Be ready for vaccine rollout: DDMA||NEW DELHI: After reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the capital, Delhi Disaster Management Authority directed officials to keep all necessary infrastructure and teams ready for the rollout of the Covid vaccine. It also directed them to ensure that Covid tests and contact tracing continue to be high. Delhi, however, reported only 803 single-day Covid cases on Monday and the positivity rate (1.2%) dropped to eight months low. The worry caused by mutated coronavirus strain in the UK surfaced in the DDMA meeting with CM Arvind Kejriwal expressing concern over it because flights from the UK directly come to Delhi. There was, however, no discussion on it because a meeting in this regard was already fixed by the central government. “Reviewed the preparedness for the rollout of Covid-19 vaccination in Delhi and advised the officials to work in close coordination with the union health and family welfare ministry in this regard,” lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, the chairman of DDMA, tweeted. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, chief secretary Vijay Dev, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria and several officials from the central government attended the meeting. After the discussion on the prevailing Covid situation, the work of all stakeholders was appreciated. “Appreciated the exemplary effort put in by all the stakeholders in effective management of Covid-19, while stressing the need for continued and sustained efforts towards higher testing, aggressive contact tracing and strict compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour especially in view of the existing weather conditions,” the LG further tweeted. The LG was informed by officials that the database was ready and the infrastructure was also identified and readied for the rollout of the vaccination. Training of the manpower is going on, he was told.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/be-ready-for-vaccine-rollout-ddma/articleshow/79846030.cms||AlokKNMishra
December 22, 2020||Jaipur||Child rights groups send 1,000 rescued kids home in 4 months||Jaipur: The Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) has sent over 1,000 rescued child labourers to Bihar, Jharkhand and Gujarat in the last four months. All these children were rescued from manufacturing units from areas such as Bhatta Basti, Shatri Nagar and Jawahar Nagar in Jaipur. The rights body has submitted a detail report on the operation to the state recently. RSCPCR chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said these children have been sent to their respective states. “Since the lockdown, we have been getting specific inputs on child labourers stuck here and living in miserable conditions. The real operation of rescuing them started in May and transporting them in August and September. The coordinated efforts with NGOs, transport and police departments have helped us tracking, rescuing, transporting and uniting them with their families,” said Beniwal. The identity of the rescued child labourers has not been released by the commission. Once rescued, they were kept in rehabilitation centres for days before they were sent in buses to their respective district administrations. “Considering the big exercise, our team approached the child rights bodies of Bihar, Jharkhand and Gujarat. The idea was to ensure that these children be united with their families,” said Beniwal. The rights body was surprised to find that a large number of children, despite the pandemic which saw limited transport services, coming from these states. Even at present, hundreds of child labourers are working in Jaipur. Shailendra Pandya, a member of the RSCPCR, said child labourers enter Jaipur/Rajasthan from three entry points – Alwar and Bharatpur. “In most cases, the NGOs give a tip-off which we pass to local police and transport officers. Now, they have changed the strategy and sending child labourers in jeeps and trucks to evade action,” said Pandya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-rights-groups-send-1000-rescued-kids-home-in-4-months/articleshow/79846028.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Madurai||HC laments lack of path to graveyard for SCs||Madurai: Taking suo motu cognizance of a news report according to which a dead body was taken to the graveyard through cultivable land at Marudur village near Melur in Madurai district, Madras high court sought a report from the state government on the availability of basic facilities at places where scheduled caste (SC) community people reside in the state. In the report, members of adi dravidar colony in the village were seen carrying a body to the graveyard through agricultural land due to absence of pathway. A division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi observed that we must hang our heads in shame for discriminating against people belonging to the SC community. They observed that even now such people were not getting basic amenities and being ill-treated by people of other communities. The court observed that not only the living but the dead should be given dignity. Saying that every village should have a pathway to the graveyard, the judges sought response from the government on providing a pathway to the graveyard at Marudur village. Taking a larger view, the court sought a report from the state government on the following queries: Number of places where people belonging to the SC community are residing and the availability of basic facilities such as drinking water and road facilities. Number of places which do not have pathways to graveyard, steps taken to provide them and in what time these would materialise. The case was adjourned to December 23 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-laments-lack-of-path-to-graveyard-for-scs/articleshow/79847962.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Jaipur||Centre should announce free vaccine to all citizens: Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has demanded that the Centre should make a clear announcement to provide free Covid vaccine to all citizens. He said giving information at the right time will remove confusion among the public about the price and availability of the vaccine. This is necessary to increase people’s self-confidence. He directed the officers to make concrete preparations for giving the vaccine to everyone in Rajasthan. Gehlot was addressing a review meeting of the status of Covid in the state at the chief minister’s residence on Monday. He said due to the pandemic and its serious economic consequences, a large section of the population will not be able to pay for the vaccine. He said that it was appropriate to give vaccine priority to frontline health warriors. “But eventually, like any other vaccination campaign, Covid vaccine should also be available for everyone (universal) and free,” he added. Gehlot said ‘micro-planning’ will have to be done with extraordinary preparations for vaccination. To complete the process of vaccination in a large population, it is necessary to have more number of vaccination centres. He asked officials to plan the implementation of the campaign in consultation with experienced medical experts in the field of vaccination. The chief minister has called upon the people of the state to celebrate the New Year with their families inside the houses, just like Diwali, to prevent the spread of the virus. It is necessary to protect oneself, one’s family and the lives of common people, he added. He said night curfew would continue and police patrolling on roads and other public places would be more stringent. He directed the department of local bodies to extend the period of ‘Jan Andolan against Covid-19’ till January 31 for awareness of prevention of infection among people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-should-announce-free-vaccine-to-all-citizens-cm/articleshow/79846031.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Jaipur||Illegal colonies continue to crop up despite JDA drives||JAIPUR: With a spurt in population and increase in demand for land, the illegal construction and development of colonies in the city is on rise. Cracking down heavily on the illegal colonies and encroachments in the state capital, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) in the past three months demolished a total of 61 establishments, which were being developed on 664 bighas of land in separate areas, as per the data. These illegal colonies were developed either after encroaching the government land or on agriculture land without the civic body’s approval. After land mafias became active and developed many illegal colonies during the pandemic, the JDA in October conducted a meeting to tackle the issue. Directions were issued to the enforcement wing to act against these illegal establishments after dividing it into three categories. An enforcement wing official said, “There has been zero tolerance against encroachment on government land. Second point in our agenda was to act against the mafias who are using agricultural land for non-agricultural and commercial purpose after illegally developing a colony. To discourage such practice in future, proceedings for cancellation of ownership under the Section 175 of Rajasthan Tenancy Act against the land holders will also be implemented as per rules.” The commercial complexes that were violating rules such as 60:40 construction ratio, parking fire-fighting system, lighting arresters (for prevention of natural disaster) and others were also under the scanner. “We are keeping a vigil on such establishments to ensure these rules are not violated and investors are not duped,” said an official Though the numbers look impressive, the illegal colonies and construction continued to crop up. Source said, in the past the civic body’s ground officials allegedly turned a blind eye to these illegal constructions and many unauthorised colonies developed around the city. “Settling illegal colonies on vacant government land is not the only type of corruption in the city. Construction of high-rises beyond permissible heights is also a latest abuse of law taking place in many localities. Private developers are blatantly violating the building bylaws, despite JDA actions” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/illegal-colonies-continue-to-crop-up-despite-jda-drives/articleshow/79846029.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Madurai||HC orders action against Bar assn for strike call||Madurai: Observing that Bar leaders are neither labour leaders nor political leaders to call for a strike, which is illegal as per the judgments of the Supreme Court, Madras high court directed the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to take appropriate action under Section 14 – A of the Tamil Nadu Advocates’ Welfare Fund Act, 1987, against the Nagercoil Bar Association, for calling for the strike in support of farmers’ issues. A division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi observed that the legal profession is a noble one, where advocates are supposed to discharge their duties not only towards their clients but also to the society. The judges said the association had taken action against the petitioner, G Sivakumar, an advocate who attended court duty as a dutiful advocate to safeguard the interest of his client, while the president of the Bar association called for a boycott of the court on December 8. A show cause notice was issued to him and he was suspended from the association. He is being prevented from entering courts, denying his statutory right to discharge his obligation to his client. He is not allowed to enter the association, library and wash room. Observing that the court is not convinced of the call for strike, which is illegal, the judges granted interim injunction to the suspension order, saying that the petitioner cannot be put to unnecessary hardship for performing his duties. The court observed that nowadays advocates are quite often indulging in strikes and disturbing the functioning of courts. “Even for political reasons, some of the associations are indulging in boycotts according to the political affinity or communal affiliations and various other reasons.” This had affected not only the rights of litigants, but also advocates who are ready to discharge their statutory duty “as per the Advocates Act and the Bar Council Rules.” Contrary to Supreme Court judgments and forgetting their responsibilities and duties as advocates to their clients, many advocates are often abstaining from court work. “As a result, the justice delivery system is being affected. Justice delivery system is one of the limbs of the State, apart from Legislative and Executive,” observed the judges. Since there is a likelihood of petitioner being abused and assaulted, the judges directed to grant police protection to him to attend court as well as using the Bar room in order to avoid any untoward incident. The case was adjourned to January 18 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-action-against-bar-assn-for-strike-call/articleshow/79847956.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The victims were identified as Harkesh Prajapati and Harkesh Meena. Prajapati’s wife registered a murder case against Meena and two others. According to the FIR, on Monday around 5am, Prajapati received a call that bajri was being taken from his field by three individuals. “When we went to the field, the three persons were taking out bajri and in the past also, we had warned them against it. When we asked them to stop, they threatened us and started manhandling my husband. They shoved him into the pit following which they buried him with the debris. I kept shouting for them to stop but they paid no heed,” said Prajapati’s wife. According to the officials, while they have started an investigation into the matter and registered a case under IPC Section 302 (murder), however, the other victim’s family has not filed a case as yet. “The case is not simply of murder as one more person was killed so we will check the veracity of the woman’s allegations before making any arrests. We are yet to find the other victim’s family’s version as right now we have just a one-sided story,” added the official. After the deaths of the two persons, while Meena’s family did agree to the autopsy, Prajapati’s family did not, though they agreed later. The complainant also claimed that when she started shouting for help, other villagers also came to the spot and asked the accused to take out the victim but the accused did not listen and by the time the victim was taken out, he had already died. The post-mortem was done of both the victims and the bodies handed over to the families. They were cremated on the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-persons-die-in-dausa-wife-alleges-murder/articleshow/79846053.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Mumbai||‘Loss of faith’: Judge in sex abuse case changed||MUMBAI: Observing that justice is not only to be done, but it should also be seen to have been done, Dindoshi sessions court’s additional principal judge, in a rare move, has allowed an alleged 26-year-old molestation complainant’s plea to transfer the accused’s anticipatory bail plea to another courtroom after the woman complained the assigned judge had not even heard the matter before granting him interim relief from arrest. “In fact, the judge should hear the parties before granting any relief. In the present case, it appears that the intervener (the woman) has lost faith in the judge. So, in my opinion, in order to avoid further complications, it would be just and proper to transfer the anticipatory bail application to any other court. It would not cause any harm to the accused if the matter is transferred to any other court,” the additional principal judge said. Following the order, the anticipatory bail plea hearing has been transferred to another court. It will come up for hearing on Tuesday. Both the prosecution and the accused had opposed the woman’s plea. The woman, in her FIR, has accused the man of outraging her modesty and of criminal intimidation. She said cops did not arrest the accused, and therefore, he had sufficient time to file an anticipatory bail plea. The woman further submitted she wanted to intervene and oppose his plea as she had been receiving continuous threats to settle the matter and withdraw the criminal complaint. She alleged she had even informed the police about the threats but they had only registered a non-cognisable complaint in March. The woman in her plea seeking the transfer told the court she had submitted the intervention application opposing the anticipatory bail of the accused on December 1. She said the matter was adjourned and two days later when at 4.30 pm it was finally called out, without hearing anyone, the judge passed the order and granted the accused interim relief. The plea was then adjourned. The woman alleged the judge had not even opened the case file before pronouncing the order in favour of the accused. The woman said her advocate’s request for time to approach Bombay high court, too, was turned down by the court. She said had the court heard the parties and then passed an order on merits, she would have had no objection. The woman further submitted she had complained to the high court’s registrar general of the and city civil and sessions court’s principal judge. The accused opposed the woman’s plea and said the presiding judge had not done no wrong and was conducting his duty honestly. The accused further submitted that looking at the Covid-19 situation and burden of work, the court granted interim anticipatory bail. He also alleged the woman had not come to court “with clean hands”. The public prosecutor, too, denied the woman’s claims and said on the day of the order, the court was busy dictating a judgement and therefore had no time to hear the arguments on the anticipatory bail plea.

They have now entered his paddy field, the farmer said. D Navaneethan Gopalakrishnan’s farm is very close to the Paravai market, from where vegetables are transported to many southern districts and also Kerala. Gopalakrishnan said that about four years ago he had found some snails among his crops but had not bothered as their numbers had been low, however, this year, the snails were much bigger in size and they invaded his banana plantation in three acres of land and started destroying the leaf shafts. “I employed some people to pick them out and put them in drums and fill it with salt water but now their numbers are increasing many fold and I am concerned that they may destroy my paddy crops on 10 acres of land, which are ready for harvesting,” he said.  “These snails may have come through the market, from places like Kerala where they are seen in large numbers,” he said. Assistant director of horticulture department, D Jenarajani and assistant horticulture officer, D Thennagamani visited the farm on Monday. Thennagamani said that this was not a foreign species and that the snails that are usually small in size had grown well because they may have got good feed in the decaying manure in Gopalakrishnan’s field. “Also, the rain this year would have reduced the salinity in the soil, helping them thrive,” he said, adding that they had not seen a similar situation in Madurai so far. The farmer has been advised to use chlorpyriphos to manage the menace. “The immediate concern is the paddy and we have advised him accordingly,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/african-snails-destroy-banana-plantation-of-madurai-farmer/articleshow/79847978.cms||---

The nearly four-month long hospital stay is the longest in the state so far. Kaniyawala (45) is a businessman from Surat’s Begampura area emerged victorious and smiling from the Kiran Multispeciality Hospital where he was admitted on August 18 as a Covid-19 patient with 40 per cent lung involvement. Before Kaniyawala, Devendra Parmar (60) from Dholka had to spend 113 days in the Sola Civil Hospital to tide over a Covid-19 infection. Prominent Congress leader and former union minister Bharatsinh Solanki had spend 102 days in hospital before being discharged. According to treating doctors, after seven days of hospitalisation his lung involvement increased to 60 per cent and his condition started deteriorating. He had to be put on ventilator support. "We put him on ventilator for nearly 45 days and treated him with various medicines. His blood was clotting constantly and we gave injections for blood thinning generally given to cardiac patients. It proved effective and we were able to get him off the ventilator,” said critical care specialist at the hospital Dr Hardip Maniyar. Maniyar added that subsequently a tracheostomy was performed and the patient was put on oxygen support and his conditions started improving. “On two occasions, our medical team lost hope, but we did not give up and continued with treatment,'' he added. “When he was discharged from the hospital on December 14, it was most satisfying day for all of us at the hospital as we won the battle against Covid-19 and saved a life,'' Dr Maniyar added. Kaniyawala’s family was extremely supportive during the treatment and never gave up. They kept cheering him up during the stay in the hospital. After he was removed from ventilation supports, his family members would talk to him daily on video calls and motivate him. His cousin Paresh Kaniyawala ensured that he remained in good spirits. "We never gave up and decided to motivate him during his hospital stay by way of video calling twice a day where 30 members of the family would sit together and talk to him. We considered talking to him a part of the 'treatment' and we could see it working. Whenever we talked with him, we never asked about his health, we only made him laugh and would tell him about future plans once he got discharged,'' Paresh told TOI. “Paresh ensured that everyone from his family visited him wearing PPE kit in hospital on alternate days and this continued for almost 60 days. On his birthday, some family members came with cake in the hospital and celebrated here in the hospital,'' said another critical care specialist at the hospital Dr Kalpesh Chopda. The family initially used kits provided by the hospital for the visits, but later procured their own. Chintesh has a 16-year-old daughter and 74-year-old mother. His wife died last year and his father died a few years back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/45-year-old-battles-with-covid-19-for-119-days-defeats-it/articleshow/79847442.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Madurai||Madurai: Bull tamers gear up for new jallikattu season||MADURAI: With Pongal around the corner , bull owners and tamers have started preparing for the action ahead. Bulls are given extra care to ensure that they get enough training and a healthy diet to face the challenges ahead. Mock vaadivasal has been set up at several places to hone the skills of bulls. For tamers, it is a perfect opportunity to get the much needed practice before they enter the jallikattu arena. The recent relaxations announced by the state government to hold political meetings, religious and sports events in open places with restrictions have boosted the confidence of jallikattu enthusiasts. The decreasing Covid-19 cases are also encouraging, they say. President of Jallikattu Peravai P Rajasekar said, “We don’t think there will be any issues in getting permissions to conduct jallikattu owing to Covid-19. The morale of bull tamers and owners is high, especially after the recent announcement by the state government,” he said. Explaining the process involved in preparing the bulls, Dr S Alagarsamy, a bull owner from Valayankulam village, said, “It starts with regular walking and swimming twice a week to increase the endurance of the animals. They will be made to plough soil mounds and get some rehearsal in the mock vaadivasal,” he said. Special diet to ensure nutrition starts two months before the competition. Oil cakes, cotton seeds, wheat husk, powdered toor and urad dal, raw rice and maize are essential for bulls. They have to be maintained in better health so that they can withstand long journeys and hours of waiting before they enter into the jallikattu arena. N Naveen, 27, a bull tamer from Alanganallur, said, “We are ready to cooperate with whatever restrictions are put in place by the district administration.” Jallikattu enthusiasts said that the number of bulls and participants could be low this time owing to the pandemic. But, it will not take away the spirit of the sport. They are ready to cooperate with the district administration in following the regulations. Alanganallur, Palamedu, Avaniaypuram, Sakkudi, Kulamangalam and Chatrapatti host famous jallikattu events in Madurai. Vadamaadu jallikattu is famous in Melur and parts of Sivaganga. Manjuvirattu, wherein the bulls are let loose in open ground, is famous in Sivaganga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bull-owners-tamers-train-for-action-ahead/articleshow/79847980.cms||V Devanathan
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal sought ban on UK flights; govt alert, says Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: A few hours before the central government announced to temporarily ban flights from the United Kingdom in the wake of a new mutation of coronavirus emerging there, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had urged the Centre to immediately ban all flights from the country. “New mutation of coronavirus has emerged in UK, which is a super-spreader. I urge central government to ban all flights from UK immediately,” Kejriwal tweeted on Monday. Delhi has direct flights to various countries of the world and is sensitive to infection spread in case passengers infected with mutated coronavirus strain travel to the capital. AAP functionary Raghav Chadha had also expressed concern over inbound flights. “Delhi faced the repercussions of unchecked international flights in early days of Covid. We must learn from it and suspend entry of all flights from the UK effective immediately. There is a serious risk of importing SARSCoV2 variant and delay of each day may cost us dearly,” Chadha tweeted. Another AAP functionary said that a major factor behind Delhi’s first Covid wave was returning travellers from countries like the UK. Meanwhile, Delhi government has appealed to those who have recently come from the UK to go for tests at the slightest of Covid-like symptoms and inform the government. India has suspended flights from and to the UK between December 23 and 31, but those who come before that and test negative will be asked to go into self-isolation and those who test negative but have symptoms into institutional isolation. “Delhi government is on alert. Mandatory tests at the airport are being conducted. Anyone testing negative but with symptoms will be kept in institutional isolation and those testing negative will also be asked to go into self-isolation for seven days,” health minister Satyendar Jain said. “All efforts will be made to ensure that the improvement made in Covid management is not reversed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-sought-ban-on-uk-flights-govt-alert-says-jain/articleshow/79846118.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Tegh Bahadur memorial sees footfall like never before||NEW DELHI: A short distance from the protest site at Singhu border stands the Guru Tegh Bahadur Memorial. The commemorative complex, which was opened for public in July 2011, has become the favourite with the agitating farmers from Punjab. They frequent the verdant area to soak in the sun and click photographs. An official at the memorial said, “Earlier, hardly 100 people turned up here in a day. After the farmers camped at Singhu border in protest against the central farm laws, many hundreds visit daily. We stopped the entry tickets from November 29 after a langar was set up near the entrance.” Another official added, “After entry to the campus was made free, we haven’t kept a record of the number of visitors, but farmers come here during day and night time.” The 11.9-acre complex, located close to the police barricading, memorialises Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth of 10 gurus of the Sikh religion. Guru Tegh Bahadur was born in 1621 and martyred in 1675 in Delhi. Dalbir Singh and 10 other farmers from Ludhiana’s Jarkhar village visited the memorial on Monday. The 74-year-old said, “Despite staying at the border for more than 20 days, we only learnt about the Guru’s memorial today. We loved the tranquillity in the complex.” Hardeep Singh was quick to point out the aptness of the protest site being close to the memorial. “Guru Tegh Bahadur fought for human rights and was martyred while protesting against the oppression of the Mughals,” the farmer said. “We are similarly fighting for our rights. The farmers at Singhu are creating history and this is happening so close to the memorial of our Guru.” Lavpreet Singh, 23, from Sherpur Takhtuwala village in Firozpur district came there with his friends. “We clicked photographs and enjoyed the sunlight and the warm weather,” he said. Many farmers there were also glad of the amenities on the complex, including the 14 toilets and two mobile toilets. Gurdeep Singh and Soochana Singh from Patiala lay on the lawns and lazily caught up with the news on their mobile phones. “This place is so beautiful and clean. After being confined to our tractor-trollies for so many days, it was a pleasure to be able to relax on the grass here,” said Gurdeep. The Delhi Tourism website offers this information: “Guru Tegh Bahadur Memorial complex set up as a tourist attraction is dedicated to the ninth Guru of Sikhism, Guru Tegh Bahadur. A 24-metre-high central pylon with petals at the base represents the Guru and his strength, and the three ‘C’ arches denote his three followers while the monoliths represent the 10 Sikh Gurus with their sayings inscribed on them.” However, according to complex officials, the light and sound show was discontinued a few years ago. Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Rithala constituency, Mohinder Goyal, who has set up a langar near the entrance to the memorial, said, “Our langar entered its 21st day on Monday. We had organised another langar earlier at the Nirankari ground in Burari. Nearly 20,000 people eat at our langar every day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tegh-bahadur-memorial-sees-footfall-like-never-before/articleshow/79846123.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

This time, however, there were only a handful of exporters who were importing goods from other countries to Chennai, said V John Paul, a trader. The price had also increased by 30% compared to last year. “I was lucky that I bought some items from Chennai in the first week of December and they sold off quickly. It is good that I did not buy another stock as the sales have dropped,” he said.The Covid-19 crisis and less supply of goods from China are the major reasons why there are less stocks, and the price is also a discouraging factor, said Rameshkumar, a dealer, who said that he had always gone for the best in each season and also got good returns in the previous years.“I was hoping to decorate my tree with a set of angels that I saw on a website, but now it is too late to order and get it on time, and many decorations in the shops in the city are old and there is nothing exciting,” said S Jansi Rani of Arapalayam.Even the Christmas trees that are selling for prices between Rs 300 to Rs 1,000 look like old stock, said Christopher R, a customer in a shop in K K Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/christmas-decoration-biz-sees-20-drop-in-sales-due-to-covid-slump/articleshow/79847981.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Madurai||Getting back to school learning will be huge challenge for young children||Madurai: Both government and private primary and middle schools are fearing major setbacks in the learning development of the students this year as schools are not set to reopen any time soon. Teachers and parents said that for especially young children, simply getting back to school learning would be a huge challenge.“Children have already started losing touch with studies and school. ‘Kalvi Tholaikatchi’ programs, video lessons or assignments through WhatsApp are just not enough. Most children are accompanying their parents to work or being left to their own devices at home. For many children, even the basics of reading and writing would be difficult when schools reopen,” said the headmaster of a government school. The headmaster further said that they cannot even expect all their students to willingly return to school once schools reopen. While at least for higher classes, students fear board exams and make efforts to study, for primary and middle school students, teachers said there is little incentive to get them to learn from home especially if parents are unable to supervise.“Online learning was supposed to be temporary but it feels like it is becoming more permanent. At my son’s school, few hours of online classes happen but teachers depend on us parents to engage and make the children study. In the long run, it is an impossible task for us,” said K Latha, a parent of a Class VI student from a private matriculation school. Teachers said that it is at lower levels that children need to develop foundational knowledge in subjects and grasp concepts which would have an impact on how they learn in higher classes.“The problem is that it is also the age where they get easily distracted. In a home environment, we cannot expect the same results in learning development of children. In classrooms, it is more than just studying lessons, students learn social skills and communication,” said S Ganesan, a primary level English teacher. There are also concerns about the impact of closure of schools on mental health of students. Some private schools are hence trying to counsel parents and hold parent-teacher meets online regularly to monitor the development of the child.“Many parents ask for there to be more online classes because they too are pressured with their work. We try to do the best we could to counsel. Especially with young children and teens, it is a challenge for parents and this pandemic might be a big setback for them even if the children are all promoted to the next class,” said the headmaster of a private matriculation school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/getting-back-to-school-learning-will-be-huge-challenge-for-young-children/articleshow/79847985.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

TOI had reported how bad the surroundings of the spruced-up old palace appeared as Madurai corporation failed to maintain them area clean. Dumper bins, urinals and fallen tree branches were visible outside the grand old palace as it reopened after undergoing renovation.The judges said the corporation should take steps to clean the area as it would create a bad impression among tourists who visit the place annually. Madurai corporation’s counsel R Murali undertook to take necessary steps to clear the garbage. Subsequently, during the day the surroundings were cleaned, dumper bins emptied and disinfected with bleaching powders. However, the area still had the dirty look from garbage soil that coated the wall of the mahal. The dumper bins started filling up as fast as they were emptied. Residents said there should be a permanent solution to make the precincts look beautiful by removing the dumper bins.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-asks-corpn-to-clean-up-naicker-mahal-surroundings/articleshow/79847984.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Delhi||After free gym at Singhu border, request for bodybuilding match||NEW DELHI: A makeshift gym at Singhu border is proving a hit among the farmers, with 300 protesters, most of them between 20 and 40 years in age, visiting it daily. Buoyed by the popularity it has gained, the gym owners have sought the permission of the farmers’ unions to organise a bodybuilding competition. There’s a big rush between 7am to 10am daily. Sandeep and his cousin Deep Malik of Zirakpur in Punjab started the gym last Thursday, their aim being to help the young farmers keep themselves fit. The cousins, who run the Fz Fitness Gym chain in Punjab, brought some exercise equipment to Singhu border and also summoned a fitness trainer. Sandeep said, “We have a farming background because our fathers are farmers. We realised that unlike back home where they are involved in physical activities every day, the protesting farmers needed a gym to pursue fitness.” Malik added, “We not only provide different exercise equipment, but also nutritional supplements to those who need them. If we get a nod from the farmers' unions, we will organise a body-building competition.” The pair plan to open similar free makeshift gyms at other border points where the agitators are camping. “We will shift our gym from the Singhu border only when the protest is called off,” declared Malik. The gym has been a godsend for 32-year-old Randeep Singh of Nawanshahr in Punjab. He said, “I have been engaged in farming for 16 years after the death of my father. In my free time, I like to work out in the gym. The gym service here was the same as what we get back home and I enjoyed myself.” Harpreet Singh likes cycling after dinner, while Gagandeep Singh, a lawyer from Punjab, said, “I have sat on protest at Singhu for 15 days to express solidarity with the farmers. I discovered this gym on Monday and worked out for 45 minutes. I plan to come here daily.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-free-gym-request-for-bodybuilding-match/articleshow/79846137.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
December 22, 2020||Surat||Surat: Diamonds regain lustre, thanks to Christmas demand||SURAT: After a fall in polished diamond exports following the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic, the Christmas seems to have brought loads of goodies for Surat’s diamantaires. The export of polished diamonds witnessed a 158% growth in November this year compared to the corresponding month last year. November is the month when most of the export goods for Christmas and New Year festival are delivered. According to the trade figures provided by Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), the polished diamond export increased to $1,600 million in November this year compared to $620 million during the same month in the previous year. November, however, was the only month since April, when the diamond export witnessed 158% growth. During April-October, the polished diamond export decreased by 5% to 96% as the diamond factories in Surat remained shut for four months due to lockdown imposed in March. Vipul Shah, vice-chairman of GJEPC, said, “Jewellers in America expected to do better than last Christmas. Pandemic and travel restrictions have spurred the demand in some quarters such as the diamond engagement ring category in the US, China and Europe. The US and China, which accounts for about 70% of the diamond jewellery demand, have shown double-digit growth.” Industry experts said that in countries like the US, Europe and China, people have more cash in hand due to the restrictions on travel. Their first option is to purchase diamond-studded and gold jewellery as a safe investment to celebrate anniversary, wedding, engagement or any other occasion during the Christmas season. Hitesh Patel, managing director, Dharmanandan Diamonds Private Limited told TOI, “This year’s Christmas season is one of the best for Surat’s diamond industry. We see stronger recovery and sales then we had expected, given the present environment of the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/diamonds-regain-lustre-thanks-to-christmas-demand/articleshow/79847488.cms||Melvyn Reggie Thomas
December 22, 2020||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Man strangles wife and hangs her to pass it off as suicide, arrested||GURUGRAM: A 25-year-old security guard has been arrested after he allegedly killed his wife and tried to pass it off as suicide by hanging her from a ceiling fan in IMT Manesar on Sunday. According to police, the man had a strained relationship with his wife. After a post-mortem revealed that she was strangulated, her brother has filed a complaint against the guard, following which he was arrested on Monday. Ranjeet Kumar (25), who is from Madhepura district of Bihar, stayed at a rented room in Sector 7 of IMT Manesar and worked as a security guard with a private company. He got married to Sudha (22) five years ago, and the couple has a three-year-old daughter who lives with her grandparents in Bihar. A police officer said Ranjeet suspected his wife was having an extramarital affair, which was the reason behind frequent arguments between the couple. The couple had gone to their hometown before the lockdown and returned to Gurugram two months ago. On Friday, Sudha (22) had gone out for some work. When she returned home in the evening, Ranjeet was waiting for her. He allegedly again accused her of having an affair, which led to an argument and scuffle. Ranjeet allegedly strangled her to death, and then hung her from a ceiling fan for a while. He then took her to a nearby private hospital, where he told doctors that Sudha committed suicide and he came home to find her hanging. She was declared brought dead by doctors. Sudha’s brother Ranjeet Singh, who lives in Chandigarh, received a call later on Friday from her husband, who told him that she had tried to kill herself and had been admitted to a hospital in Manesar. He reached Gurugram the next day. “My brother-in-law called me to say that Sudha had hanged herself, but I couldn’t believe him and rushed to see her,” he said. Police were informed and a post-mortem was carried out. The post-mortem report, which Sudha’s brother received on Sunday, stated that the cause of death was asphyxia due to ante-mortem strangulation. It also said nail clippings of both hands revealed foreign tissue and blood. “Sudha’s family was shocked to find out that Sudha was strangled to death and later hanged to a ceiling fan. Her brother filed a police complaint on Sunday,” said police spokesperson Subhash Boken. An FIR was registered under Section 302 (murder) of IPC at IMT Manesar police station the same day, and Ranjeet was arrested on Monday. He has been sent to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/man-strangles-wife-and-hangs-her-to-pass-it-off-as-suicide-arrested/articleshow/79847489.cms||Bagish Jha
December 22, 2020||Madurai||Farmers in Tamil Nadu being instigated to protest against new laws: Kushboo||MADURAI: BJP leader Kushboo has said only farmers in northern states are protesting against the three Farm Acts while their counterparts in Tamil Nadu are being instigated, adding that the acts were enacted because 1.5 lakh farmers agreed to it. She was speaking at the ‘Modi Vivasayigalin Nanban’ (Modi is Farmer’s friend) rally to popularise farm acts, in Madurai. “The opposition parties are trying to play with the livelihood of farmers,” she said. “Many of the farmers are looking upon the BJP like god, because it has done for them what the Congress could not do. People are being drawn by the actions of BJP and this can be witnessed by BJP’s election performances. In places that it had previously secured one or two seats it has now bagged many. We are not greedy for immediate victories, we will gain our seats gradually.” she said. Kushboo said that Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had performed well in the state and there was no anti-incumbency wave. “But, when it comes to the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, it would be something that would be decided by EPS and BJP president J P Nadda,” she said. “BJP is already an A team and did not need a B team,” she said, adding that she did not come into politics hoping for a seat, when asked if she would contest the assembly polls. “My aim would be to ensure the victory of the party,” she said. Kushboo said that there was nothing new in DMK president M K Stalin’s Mission-200 and that he had only reiterated what Home Minister Amit Shah had said during his recent visit to Chennai. “He seems to have gone through it well and is now making similar announcements,’’ she said, adding she would comment on Rajinikanth’s political entry after he makes his policies known. Referring to Kamal Haasan as Kamal sir, she said he got a fair vote share in the Lok Sabha polls but the Assembly polls are different.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/farmers-in-tn-being-instigated-to-protest-against-new-laws-kushboo/articleshow/79847988.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Vadodara||Eunuchs break away from tradition of blessing newly borns||VADODARA: They are among the first ones to visit the houses to play with and bless a newborn child. They also demand money from the parents and grandparents in return. But the eunuchs of Baranpura Akhada, one of the prestigious groups of eunuchs, have now decided not to visit any house in the city for a year to welcome and bless a newborn. The decision was taken unanimously in a meeting of eunuchs held before Diwali keeping in mind the worsening situation of the pandemic. An incident experienced by a few eunuchs at Old Padra Road in October compelled the community to introspect and hold the meeting. “When we went to bless a newborn child at Old Padra, the kid’s father said that he will give us the money but not let us have the child in our arms. We told him that we do not take money without playing and blessing the child,” said Anju Kunwar, one of the senior eunuchs of the group. She added, “We understand that the man was concerned that the child may contract some infection through us so we unanimously took the decision that we will not go to bless any child for a year.” About 200 eunuchs are associated with Baranpura akhada and they bless over 35-40 newborn kids in a year. The eunuchs also decided to not collect any money from businesses during any festivals. “We did not collect money for Diwali because we are not only concerned about ourselves but also of others’ health,” said Anju. The decision to not collect the money has affected the economic situation of eunuchs too. They were forced to break their savings for daily expenses. “Wedding season has improved the situation a bit as we are visiting the houses of newly-wed couples to bless them,” said Anju. Unlike in the past, when they used to demand a handsome amount at weddings, the eunuchs have decided to accept whatever money they are offered. “We understand the dwindling economic situation due to the pandemic,” she said. During the lockdown, the eunuchs of Baranpura had opened their coffers for the needy ones. Believing in giving back to society the eunuchs had bought food kits and essential items and distributed them in the slums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/eunuchs-break-away-from-tradition-of-blessing-newly-borns/articleshow/79844238.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Whatever I had collected before making this chulha, are still catering to my needs. My kitchen is clean and now I have more time for myself.” Oxfam India piloted improved cook-stoves in Bada Sabaikundi in 2018. Firewood piled outside households is a common visual as one steps into these, otherwise clean, villages. While living in abject poverty, forest is the only solace for these communities. They rely on forest for almost everything – firewood, food, fodder, water and livelihoods. In our very first interaction with women, it was clear that they wanted some change but they could not express their aspirations. It may be because they were used to the burden – the watery & itchy eyes, the black carbon soot, the regular bouts of cough, the drudgery associated with collecting firewood, the long hours spent in kitchen for cooking – and could not imagine a favourable change in their circumstances. Each adivasi household, on an average, consumes 7 kgs of firewood every day for cooking because cooking is not limited to making meals for family, rather it stretches up to preparing animal feed, heating water, boiling paddy, steam cooking oil seeds before oil extraction etc. To meet their daily requirements, women and girls usually spend 6-9 hours per day in the forest collecting firewood – weight of a headload ranges between 25-40 kgs. They largely collect fallen logs or logs felled to facilitate shifting cultivation. In the absence of alternatives, at times, young trees were also cut for this purpose. Such biotic pressure adversely impacts forest regeneration. It was clear that a solution is imperative either to replace firewood or to reduce its consumption whilst being mindful of the history of government interventions that were, largely, unsuccessful. Government of India had started promoting improved chulhas in 1986 which continued for 16 years and then shifted its focus to research and development. In 2014, Unnat Chulha Abhiyan was launched with a target to construct 2.75 million chulhas. Unfortunately, trails of these efforts were not visible in these villages of Jharkhand. However, there were a few recipients of LPG connections distributed under Ujjwala Yojana at one-time subsidised costs. Though communities admired the clean cooking that it offers, cost of LPG refill discouraged them from continuing its usage. In the process, we also learnt that none of the technologies including LPG could replace firewood and we switched our focus to find an improved design of traditional chulha which can reduce firewood consumption. With technical support from Technology Informatics Design Endeavour (TIDE), new design for chulha – suitable for the necessities of this community – was developed. These designs are energy efficient, ecologically and economically sustainable. A chulha can be built for Rs1,500 only. Made of locally available bricks and soil with a design that is not a major departure from the traditional ones, these chulhas were easily accepted by the communities. “This chulha is very much like the ones that we were using. We can make it ourselves. External support is not required to maintain it. I am saving a lot of time and energy that was earlier being spent on cleaning the soot from utensils. The best part is that cooking takes less time and I don’t get irrigation in my eyes. It is a big relief,” says Helen Hansda. Helen got the new chulha in her kitchen when first batch of 80 chulhas were made; not every household gave their consent for chulha construction at the first instance. More so, because every household could not afford to even pay for the bricks then; delayed monsoons led to paddy crop failures which provided cash incomes to communities. Families whose male members had migrated were in a better position. So, the communities decided to pool in the resources to help all interested households. It took them time to see the difference and change their behaviour to adapt to the new designs. Majority of the households of Bada Sabaikundi have now demolished their old chulhas. 261 chulhas have been constructed till now across seven villages in Sundarpahari block which are working at 33% efficiency (estimated conservatively). Going by this estimation, each chulha will potentially remove 3 tonnes of CO2-eq per year. Communities saw its benefits for themselves over a period of time. The recently constructed ones were in village Gardih where every family contributed and raised a resource pool of Rs6,000in no time. This is a remarkable shift! Our objective was not to expose communities to advanced technologies and modern sources of energy but the emphasis was on arriving at a sustainable solution to reduce firewood consumption. Because, these designs were developed in consultation with the women in the community, it catered to their needs and aspirations and they adopted it. For the sustainability of this intervention, it was necessary to develop local market for fabricated steel components and transfer the technology to the users. Few fabricators in the Godda local market and a cadre of stove constructors have been trained. Government’s access to sustainable energy programmes for rural welfare will have to take local contexts and social aspects into consideration. Most importantly, such programmes should aim at enhancing local economic activities to increase the purchasing capacities of marginalised communities. Only then they will be able to afford electricity or clean cooking sources. Until this happens, necessity for energy efficient biomass based cooks-stoves will remain a practical necessity. We hope to see this intervention survive, even after we exit from these villages.

December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad businessman fond of game got gun permit despite record||HYDERABAD: How did a rice mill owner, accused of poaching protected animals in Nizamabad, get himself a fresh gun licence when his original licence had been cancelled in 2015? It is a question that both forest and police officials are grappling with after Luqman Affendi and four others were nabbed with two guns on Sunday after he had poached a black-naped hare. Affendi has also confessed to hunting blackbucks regularly for the past four years. Both the black-naped hare and blackbucks are protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act. Forest officials say it is unusual for a fresh gun licence to be issued to anyone once there have been grounds to cancel the initial licence. Apart from the guns, the officials also confiscated rifle scopes, optical sights with night vision capability and silencers all of which are restricted items. The foresters have informed the Nizamabad police commissioner that possession or trading of these items by civilians without the home ministry’s permission is a punishable offence. Affendi’s arms licence was cancelled after he could not give a valid address proof of his Nizamabad home and prove to the officials that he needed a weapon. But he managed to renew the licence for both his rifles in Hyderabad in August 2017 by submitting residence proof of Humayun Nagar area in Mehdipatnam. TOI also found out that the renewed license had expired on August 30, 2020, and Affendi was granted permission to renew it for the third time for five years. Asked how and why the licence was renewed, ACP Shiva Maruti said, “Since the licence was issued a long time ago, I am not aware of the facts. If forest officials inform us about the misuse of weapon, we will send a proposal to our senior officials to cancel his licence.” “We find it strange that given the circumstances Affendi’s licence was renewed. We also learnt that he was in Kuwait when he was issued a licence in Hyderabad. We are now investigating all aspects of the case,” said M Raja Ramana Reddy, divisional forest officer (vigilance), Hyderabad. During questioning, Affendi told officials how he would to dump bones and leftover body parts of wild animals inside an abandoned borewell in his rice mill in Nizamabad. At times he used to discard the body parts on the road while going back to Hyderabad. Affendi and his brother Imran, who are both from Hyderabad, and three of their employees were arrested on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-bizman-fond-of-game-got-gun-permit-despite-record/articleshow/79847509.cms||Moulika.KV
December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Dakshineswar Metro to get pre-trial exam today||KOLKATA: A pre-trial inspection of the 4km Dakshineswar stretch in the north-south Metro line will be carried out on Tuesday afternoon, ahead of the day-long trials on Wednesday that will be attended by the Metro GM and senior officials. The mini-trial will be carried out by engineers at 1pm on Tuesday with a rake travelling from Noapara to Dakshineswar via Baranagar and back for last minute checks before the main trial kicks off the following day. The primary aim of the trial will be to check the synchronization of the new system with the existing one on the Metro line between Noapara and Garia Station. The trials along this stretch will be intermittent since the rest of the line is operational. The 4km Dakshineswar stretch has been fitted with fire-fighting equipment unlike the rest of the line where only stations have the system. “There are pipelines laid over the viaduct along the tracks. These pipes with nozzles have fire-fighting chemicals that will be released in case there is a fire,” an official explained. The new stretch also has an earthquake monitoring system. The tracks will be joint-less at the crossings, and hence, require low maintenance. Also, instead of rails fastened to the ballasts, the stretch will have rails clipped to precast concrete slabs. The hi-tech tracks of the new section has heavy-duty fastening that offers durability. “We used the world-class Pandrol system of fittings for the tracks to make them highly efficient,” an RVNL official said. “The fasteners must endure heavy load and high speeds. So we have used hi-tech clips and fittings and made the tracks jointless at the crossings,” the official said. Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) is constructing the stretch with its two stations — Baranagar and Dakshineswar. Metro Railway, that operates the north-south and the East-West Metro, will be running it when it is added on to the 27km Noapara-Kavi Subhas line. For Kolkata commuters, the 7km East-West Metro’s Sector V to Phoolbagan section, launched earlier this year, has been the most sophisticated system they have ever been exposed to here. But the new Metro is barely used, registering only around 600 daily passengers. The old Metro, on the other hand, has 1.3 lakh footfall every day. The 4km addition to it should cater to scores of people from the northern suburbs beyond Noapara. The two stations — Baranagar and Dakshineswar — have been built with elegant interiors and modern amenities as well. “The new stations’ décor is very nice and will certainly stand out. But the tracks, which will be subjected intense usage with little time for day-to-day maintenance, are far more advanced and resilient than the rest of the north-south line,” another official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dakshineswar-metro-to-get-pre-trial-exam-today/articleshow/79846145.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

December 22, 2020||Amaravati||Eco-tourism push to attract nature lovers to Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Andhra Pradesh tourism department will be putting special focus on developing nature and eco-tourism. In Visakhpatnam district as well as across the state, trekking and cycling trails will be created alongside other capacity-building activities. The initiative will also include setting up of nature camps and starting wildlife safaris. As per the draft policy, eco-tourism in the state will be developed through creation of experiences which have low-impact on environment, have high-involvement of tourists and benefits for local communities. The tourism department will closely work with the forestry department to create a state-level body for development of eco-tourism. Forest regions of SV national park, Papikondalu Wildlife Sanctuary, Nallamala Wildlife Sanctuary and Araku Valley in the Eastern Ghats will be the focus areas. To cater to a growing number of trekking enthusiasts, safe routes will be identified, created and documented. These routes will have steps, markings, amenity centres and basic tourism infrastructure where necessary. Capacity building activities will be undertaken for training of local youth as tourist guides. Safe routes will be carved out and cycling in groups will be encouraged. Mechanisms will be put in place for ease of obtaining permissions through online application. Since Andhr Pradesh has a tiger reserve, elephant reserve, a biosphere reserve, three national parks and 13 wildlife sanctuaries, safe jungle trails would be created for wildlife safaris. The department of tourism will encourage local entrepreneurship and private players to operate the jungle safaris after they register with the competent authority and operate under their guidelines. Further, the department of tourism will also identify and notify suitable locations for setting up of temporary or tented accommodation for nature camps in collaboration with private players. The private partners may offer services and activities such as trekking and kayaking at nature camps after obtaining the requisite permissions. Visakhapatnam district tourism officer, Poornima Devi, said, “Once the government order (GO) is issued based on the policy, we will take up various tourism activities including nature, wildlife and eco-tourism, especially in Agency areas like Paderu and Araku and start identifying routes and sites for trekking and camping. The DPR sent by the government to Centre for Araku Eco-Tourism Project is pending approval.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/eco-tourism-push-to-attract-nature-lovers-to-ap/articleshow/79850553.cms||Sulogna Mehta

The woman, Salasatti Durga — a native of Nelamuru village in Penumantra mandal in Krishna district — who works in Kuwait, had arrived India on December 16. Cops said that CCTV cameras at the airport terminal had recorded her arrival. On December 17, the woman’s husband Satyanarayana, who wasn’t aware of his wife’s arrival, found out about it when a friend messaged him asking if she had reached. As she had not arrived home, Satyanarayana initially approached police personnel at Gannavaram airport to confirm her arrival and hoped that she would reach in a day or two. However, when she did not reach home and her phone remained switched off, Satyanarayana lodged a missing person complaint at Gannavaram police station. Cops formed three teams and began tracing her whereabouts using tower dumps following which they managed to locate her at Proddatur in Kadapa. A police team has been sent to bring the woman back. The reason behind her disappearance is yet to be ascertained and police said that her statement will be recorded once she returned home. Investigation into the case is still in progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/missing-kuwait-returnee-traced-to-kadapa-district/articleshow/79844839.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Gambling kingpins joins hands with goons to open dens||Nagpur: Gambling kingpins are learnt to have roped in top goons to operate their dens at different places in the city, especially on the outskirts, to avoid being raided. Following the murder of gambling kingpin Balya Binekar, illegal dens had fallen silent with cops increasing surveillance. As raids on small fries continued, some of the big names managed to revive their activities with fresh teams and support from goons. Gambling kingpins had offered partnerships to goons to ensure they stayed with them for recovering cash from gamblers at the dens and also to keep them under their watch and control so that the place is not disturbed. Jadhav, one of the biggest names in gambling, was under the scanner after Binekar’s murder. He is learnt to have shifted his base to Mahalgaon Kapsi from Itwari. At Kapsi, Jadhav is learnt to have opened a den with the Hate gang from Kamptee. The newly formed syndicate has also roped in several former close aides of Binekar, including Sarfaraz and Panna who was a partner too. In another development, Binekar’s den, along the railway tracks at Lalgunj, too, has been captured by Latkar, Thakur and their accomplices. They too now enjoy the support of several goons from the same crime-prone locality to help conduct illegal activities. It’s learnt that Binekar had enmities with several other top gambling kingpins of the city as his den had been drawing substantial visitors. City’s yet another major gambling den operator Raut too has started operating his den at Dhammna which is located at the place where the city and rural limits meet. According to a senior crime branch official, the information would be verified and action would be initiated accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gambling-kingpins-joins-hands-with-goons-to-open-dens/articleshow/79845659.cms||Soumitra Bose

December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||City cops raid 4 loan apps offices in Gurugram, Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Special teams of Hyderabad police on Monday carried out simultaneous raids in four instant loan app offices in Gurugram and Hyderabad with investigations revealing that the entire illegal operation was run from Jakarta. Hyderabad joint commissioner of police (detective department) Avinash Mohanty said 30 loan apps were run by these four companies, two each in Gurugram and in Hyderabad. “In these four offices, there were about 1,000 employees who were working as telecallers. We are still investigating how their operations are being done. We are questioning a lot of people,” Mohanty told TOI. Officials suspect that some Chinese nationals operating from Jakarta and elsewhere could be involved. “It is too early to comment on this more. Let us see,” said Mohanty. Probe is also being done to ascertain whether the existing directors of these companies were dummies working at the behest of Chinese, top sources said. So far, three persons, including a software engineer and a woman agriculture officer of Telangana, killed themselves after they were humiliated on social media and their contacts harassed by the financiers for defaulting. On Monday, more people knocked the doors of various police stations, saying they were being harassed for even delaying repayment by few hours. Police said the employees of these four call centres in Hyderabad and Gurugram manage disbursement of loans and in recovery of money by harassing the defaulters and making telephone calls, both to the defaulters and the people on their phone contacts. Raids in the city were conducted in a prominent commercial complex in Greenlands and another office located in Prakash Nagar. Police seized at least two servers belonging to these offices located in India. Several people were taken into custody and it has to be seen whether they will be arrested on Tuesday or they will be let off after serving notice to reappear for investigation, sources said. Apart from these 30 apps operated by these four companies, officials said there are dozens of such companies spread across the country. Cyberabad police too questioned different persons on Monday in continuation with their probe into the suicides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-cops-raid-4-loan-apps-offices-in-gurugram-hyd/articleshow/79847535.cms||Srinath Vudali

The theft — though minor in nature — is being probed seriously given that the area falls in a high-security zone. When contacted, RCTC officials stated that they would comment after careful analysis of the incident. The cops said they are now planning a security overhaul in the area. The case was recorded on the basis of a letter of complaint lodged by Shyamal Mitra, 63, a security officer of the RCTC, who alleged that around 4pm on Sunday, he detected that some persons had stolen five iron railings and ramps from the main race course track of RCTC. Investigation of the case is in progress,” said an officer. The Hastings police have questioned a few locals near Kidderpore Road. “Local CCTV footage is also being consulted,” said an officer. “We have already approached the civic bodies about the security overhaul and we will conduct night raids,” another officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/security-rejig-plan-after-railing-theft-at-rctc/articleshow/79846165.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Clean Yamuna: Biodiversity park in Delhi gets 1st of 12 artificial wetlands||NEW DELHI: Officials at Delhi Development Authority’s South Delhi Biodiversity Park have successfully been able to create a constructed wetland using just plants and boulders, which will allow the park to naturally purify 15 to 20 million litres per day (MLD) of raw sewage. The constructed wetland is the first of 12 such wetlands, which will be created in the biodiversity park area that is located in the floodplain underneath the DND Flyway and next to Kalindi Kunj, allowing them to prevent 1,500-2,000 MLD or raw sewage from entering the Yamuna. A team led by Professor CR Babu, the head of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), has been working on the project for several months now and says the design created at the park is unique and has not utilised any artificial materials, such as concrete. The constructed wetland consists of 25 different types of plant species, which naturally purify the water through microbes, before it is released into a larger waterbody. “Unlike the constructed wetland we created at Neela Hauz a few years back, earthen bunds have been created here by simply using boulders and wiring around it. There are several levels through which the water flows through and boulders and stones have been placed to create greater turbulence, which leads to biodegradation of organic pollutants. As the water flows down, finer pebbles are used to trap smaller particles and sediments,” said Babu, adding that 25 plant species then work on the water that is standing there, releasing microbes that purify it even further. Babu says the wetland has been built at a cost of Rs 10 lakh and requires no energy. While it is spread across an area of 1 acre, the water being cleaned through it is being released into a wetland spread across 5 acres. The park officials say prior to the constructed wetland being built, raw sewage from the nearby Kilokri drain, which also passes through Kalindi Colony, was coming to the area, also leading to mosquito breeding. “Not only has that problem been solved but this sewage, which was entering the Yamuna, has also been tapped,” said an official. According to Babu, out of the remaining 11 wetlands being built on other major drains in the area, 50% of these are expected to be completed in the next two months. The site was also visited by National Green Tribunal- appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) on Friday, which said not only should this help in reclaiming encroached floodplain land, but also provide a roadmap to revive wetlands and water bodies in the area. “A number of water bodies here were being fed raw sewage and that will immediately change. The constructed wetlands being built should also reduce considerable amount of sewage entering the river from different drains and each drain will be tapped through this,” said YMC member BS Sajwan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/clean-yamuna-biodiversity-park-gets-1st-of-12-artificial-wetlands/articleshow/79846171.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||NHAI disregards own policy, fells 8,000 trees on both sides of NH-161||NAGPUR: At a time greens are striving to save trees by any means, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has felled over 8,000 trees to widen national highway 161 (NH-161) between Akola and Nanded from existing two-lane to four-lane. Green activist Jaydeep Das, who received information under the RTI Act, alleged NHAI did not follow the ministry of road transport & highways (MoRTH) policy decision on acquiring land only on one side, to save trees on the other. “Had this policy been followed then at least 50% of the trees could have been saved. The authority has felled over 8,000 trees on NH-161 in three sections between Akola-Medshi (48km), Medshi-Washim (45km) and Washim-Pangare (42km),” said Das. He adds, this 175km highway is being developed in four stretches at a cost of Rs4,000 crore. While trees remain to be felled in the last section between Pangare-Warangal Fata as DPR is being prepared, over 8,000 trees have been felled till now of the total 15,000 trees, whose environmental value would be 7,500 crores as per the apex court orders. “This value can be arrived at according to the oxygen one tree gives during its lifetime, and its value after it is chopped,” says Das. On February 26, 2018, a MoRTH policy decision said that as the felling of grown-up trees leads to huge environmental damage, this felling can be reduced by 50% by taking up land acquisition on one side of an existing road to the extent of feasibility so that felling can be done on one side of the road only. Das said, “Existing road including pavement shoulders was around 11 metres and right of way (ROW) of 30 metres. NHAI needed another 30 metres to make it a four-lane. Had NHAI acquired 30 metres additional land on one side then trees on one side could have been saved.” NHAI regional officer Rajeev Agrawal said, “The DPR is prepared by private consultants after examining the feasibility. The report is approved by the ministry. Though there is such a policy, I don’t know whether it was followed in this stretch. I joined four months ago.” Even the Supreme Court is concerned over felling of trees for road widening. Recently, CJI Sharad Bobde while hearing an application filed by the UP government to fell 2,940 trees for Krishna-Govardhan project had observed, “Why can’t a road take a turn around the tree? That will only slow the speed and reduce accidents.” Environment activist from Akola Sheikh Mohammed Sheikh Makbul aka Munna, who exposed illegal extraction of murrum near Katepurna sanctuary, said, “There are many loopholes in tree felling on the NH-161 and forest officials are also supporting illegal felling.” From Shirla to Maharajur, Patur RFO had granted permission to fell 1,079 trees on both sides of the road on November 4, 2020. After the deadline to fell trees expired, the RFO granted fresh permission on December 8, 2020, to fell 832 trees. Of this, 344 trees are teak. Munna asks, “There is a difference of 247 trees in both the permissions. So, where have these trees gone? Either these trees were felled illegally or stolen. Tree theft is going on rampantly in entire Akola district.” NHAI project director Rakesh Jawade has lodged a complaint on December 17, 2020, with Akola SP that 11 trees have been cut down illegally by miscreants near Akoli Khurd and Hinga Mhaiskar villages on December 16. However, Munna says, “This is just the tip of the iceberg. The tree theft figure is being shown at a lower side and a nexus between contractor and officials cannot be ruled out. There needs to an audit of existing and proposed tree felling.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nhai-disregards-own-policy-fells-8000-trees-on-both-sides-of-nh-161/articleshow/79847502.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

His resignation was accepted by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. Deputy mayor Manisha Kothe, too, put in her papers. At a press conference, Joshi said that Dayashankar Tiwari would be his successor, making the latter the city’s 54th mayor. “The party would name the new deputy mayor soon,” said city BJP president and MLC Pravin Datke. The names of senior BJP women corporators Varsha Thakre or Divya Dhurde are doing the rounds.Joshi, who had earlier announced his retirement from civic polls, said Tiwari will complete his unfinished development projects in the city.After Nanda Jichkar completed her two-and-a-half-year term as mayor, the BJP split the remaining term of 26 months between Joshi and Tiwari, who were the main contenders since the post was open for the general category.Joshi, a close aide of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, was elected the 53rd mayor for 13 months and assumed charge on November 22 last year. Tiwari will be the second non-Maharashtrian mayor after Atal Bahadur Singh. “I got the opportunity to serve the city as mayor for 13 months. However, nearly eight months were unproductive due to Covid. The last month, November 2 to December 5, came under the model code of conduct due to the graduates’ constituency elections,” said Joshi.The outgoing mayor expressed his gratitude to the party for the various positions given to him — two terms as standing committee chairman, leader of the ruling party, mayor and the ticket to contest the MLC polls. “I will continue to serve the party as a member,” said Joshi.On assembly speaker Nana Patole ordering a probe into NMC’s Orange City 24X7 water project, Joshi said that it is one of the pioneering projects launched during the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s tenure and added that there were no irregularities. In fact, the project was implemented in other cities as well, he claimed. “We are ready to face any probe,” said Joshi.In the 55-year term of the Congress, only 15 overhead water tanks were built in the city. “During the BJP’s 15-year tenure, the party constructed 55 overhead tanks and today, the city has 70 overhead tanks,” said Joshi.Under the AMRUT scheme, 30 more tanks will come up across the city. The investigation into the Sports Authority of India’s regional centre in Nagpur is another ploy of the Congress to stall development projects in the city, alleged Joshi. “Ahead of 2022 civic polls, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government is playing dirty politics,” he said. During his 13-month tenure, Joshi worked with three municipal commissioners and said that the experience of working with them was good. However, he alleged that Tukaram Mundhe tried to create hurdles and also restrained him from using the Mayor Relief Fund (MRF) which was the outcome of public contribution and donations. The project meant to be implemented with the MRF is incomplete because of Munde autocratic style of functioning, alleged Joshi.“After Radhakrishnan B replaced Mundhe, Covid patients of the city were provided better facilities. We increased the number of hospitals from six to 66, ambulances from 20 to 65 and also provided Rs2 crore to both Mayo and AIIMS through CSR funds,” said Joshi.Due to Joshi’s proactive role as a mayor, the NMC distributed food kits and cooked food to thousands of people during the lockdown.By initiating many novel plans for the city’s development like Walk and Talk With The Mayor, Breakfast With Mayor, Janta Darbar and Hello Mahapaur App, Joshi claimed to have solved many pending civic problems. Due to his Mummy-Papa You Too initiative, Joshi helped the city to improve its Swachh Bharat ranking to the 18th position from the earlier 58th.Joshi, however, expressed remorse for not completing projects like Khau Galli and shifting of private buses from city limits to a stop on the outskirts.Meanwhile, the process to elect Dayashankar Tiwari as mayor will take place at the special general body meeting likely to be convened soon.

December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Account siphoned off, police help victims get compensation from bank||Nagpur: Shekhar Sakhre, a worker with a Sonpapdi factory, and his wife Arti were elated after Rs1.16 lakh, which was siphoned off from her bank account, was credited to her account as a compensation by the bank following an intense liasoning of 29 days by cyber police of the city. Earlier, the Geetanjali Talkies branch of State Bank of India, where the money was illegally withdrawn from by some tech fraudsters, was dilly-dallying to compensate the couple. The money was part of their savings to build a house. Shekhar’s wife Arti, who stitches clothes to earn, was left stunned after learning that someone had withdrawn Rs1.16 lakh from her account in March 2020 itself. The couple got to know about the fraud on October 11, 2020. She approached the bank but there was no proper assistance or assurance from the authorities which compelled her to approach the cyber police on November 17, 2020. The police assured Arti to get the compensation amount within 45 days but she got it within 29 days itself. “It was baffling for me to have lost so much amount through bank when neither I visited the branch nor I operated it online or revealed my OTP. The cyber cell guided me to mount pressure on the bank which credited the money to my account under the pressure of an imminent legal action threat,” she said, adding, “I was even facing problem in procuring the bank statement and details of the transactions through which I had lost the amount.”. Cyber cell ACP Ashok Bagul, working under the supervision of additional CP of crime branch Sunil Phulari and CP Amitesh Kumar said in the first part of the investigation police concentrated on addressing the administrative hurdles under which the bank concerned was not extending help to a genuine victim customer. “We guided the victim to take up the issue with Lokpal and then also approached RBI. Logistics support was extended to the victim following which the bank agreed to credit the amount to her account to avoid a direct legal confrontation,” said Bagul. Naik police constable Gajanan Rajulwar and API Punit Kulat too had helped the victim to get the amount credited. Meanwhile, police sources said the illegal transaction has been traced to somewhere in Mumbai. “Soon, a team will leave for Mumbai to arrest the accused,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/account-siphoned-off-police-help-victims-get-compensation-from-bank/articleshow/79845641.cms||Soumitra Bose
December 22, 2020||Bengaluru||Parents don’t teach how to treat empowered women: Karnataka HC||BENGALURU: Empowered women are not treated properly because parents do not teach their sons about this, the Karnataka high court has said. “This is the problem … because we are still a patriarchal society. Despite the talk of empowerment of women, Indian society doesn’t know how to treat an empowered woman,” a division bench headed by Justice BV Nagarathna made an oral observation during the hearing of a divorce petition filed by a couple, who had entered the wedlock just two years ago. The bench said an empowered woman should know how to manage her family. The court did not agree with the submission that the woman in the case could not cope with the situation since she grew as the only child and said the same cannot be a ground to ignore her husband. Granting more time for the couple to rethink their options, it adjourned the hearing to first week of January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/parents-dont-teach-how-to-treat-empowered-women-hc/articleshow/79846153.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Cable mess poses risk to Kolkata's Salt Lake residents||KOLKATA: Overhead cables continue to create a mess in Salt Lake with many of them hanging dangerously. The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation had earlier planned to follow the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) module and set up underground cable ducts like the ones in New Town, but the plan has not been implemented as yet. Cable lines can be seen hanging from street light posts on all major arterial roads of the township. At some places, they are found wrapped around trees. In other places, snapped cable lines can be seen touching the ground. Residents said that the mess has been there for years. “Almost all main road stretches in Salt Lake are marred with these overhead cable tangles which not only create an ugly look but also pose a risk to people. It also does not look good in a township like Salt Lake which is said to have been developed as a green and smart city. The authorities should do something to clear the mess,” said Sankhadeep Roy Chowdhury, a resident of AE Block. Civic officials said that cable operators in the township will be asked to remove the non-functional and damaged overhead wires that are dangling from lampposts. Officials said that the plan to remove the old and non-functional overhead lines and set up underground ducts was taken up a few years ago when Sabyasachi Datta was mayor of the Bidhannnagar civic body, but it could not become a reality. “With the civic body’s board of councillors’ tenure now over, it is practically not possible to take forward this plan till the new board is formed. As of now, we will again ask the cable operators to remove the overhead lines which have become non-functional or damaged,” said an official. . In New Town, all cable lines are in underground ducts. In Sector V, too, the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority has already cleared the overhead cable lines from one stretch and work is on to set up underground ducts and remove overhead lines from other places. A section of civic officials also said there are plans to replace all street lights in Salt Lake with smart LED lights||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cable-mess-poses-risk-to-salt-lake-residents/articleshow/79846184.cms||Suman Chakraborti
December 22, 2020||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: 20 harassment complaints against loan app firms||VIJAYAWADA: In a span of four months, cybercrime sleuths received around 20 harassment complaints against micro-financing applications over repayment of loans across Vijayawada commissionerate. According to cybercrime circle inspector Srinivas, most complainants borrowed small loans ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 2 lakh due to personal financial distress caused by the lockdown. Srinivas said cases have been reported from Penamaluru, Patamata, Krishna Lanka, Satyanarayanapuram and Bhavanipuram police limits. Cops informed that the micro-financing applications lure customers of assuring instant loans to them within five minutes. Many have been taking up these loans which have an exorbitant interest rate of 30% to 50%. Explaining the nature of the harassment, Srinivas said that the details of the defaulters are being forwarded to recovery call centres who then make repeated calls demanding payment. Apart from that, cops explain that when borrowers download the apps, they also inadvertently provide permission to access contacts, photos and other information in their phone. They then forward ‘warning’ messages to all the contacts of the borrower calling them as ‘fraud’ who defaulted their loans. Police said that they had identified 52 micro-financing applications who have been indulging in harassment and have sent mails notifying about the complaint against them. “None of these micro financing businesses have the right to harass anybody. They can give time for repayment or even levy additional interest within their powers but if harassment is being done, action will be taken,” Srinivas said while addressing media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/20-harassment-plaints-against-loan-app-firms/articleshow/79844815.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
December 22, 2020||Vijayawada||Eco-tourism push to attract nature lovers to Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Andhra Pradesh tourism department will be putting special focus on developing nature and eco-tourism. In Visakhpatnam district as well as across the state, trekking and cycling trails will be created alongside other capacity-building activities. The initiative will also include setting up of nature camps and starting wildlife safaris. As per the draft policy, eco-tourism in the state will be developed through creation of experiences which have low-impact on environment, have high-involvement of tourists and benefits for local communities. The tourism department will closely work with the forestry department to create a state-level body for development of eco-tourism. Forest regions of SV national park, Papikondalu Wildlife Sanctuary, Nallamala Wildlife Sanctuary and Araku Valley in the Eastern Ghats will be the focus areas. To cater to a growing number of trekking enthusiasts, safe routes will be identified, created and documented. These routes will have steps, markings, amenity centres and basic tourism infrastructure where necessary. Capacity building activities will be undertaken for training of local youth as tourist guides. Safe routes will be carved out and cycling in groups will be encouraged. Mechanisms will be put in place for ease of obtaining permissions through online application. Since Andhr Pradesh has a tiger reserve, elephant reserve, a biosphere reserve, three national parks and 13 wildlife sanctuaries, safe jungle trails would be created for wildlife safaris. The department of tourism will encourage local entrepreneurship and private players to operate the jungle safaris after they register with the competent authority and operate under their guidelines. Further, the department of tourism will also identify and notify suitable locations for setting up of temporary or tented accommodation for nature camps in collaboration with private players. The private partners may offer services and activities such as trekking and kayaking at nature camps after obtaining the requisite permissions. Visakhapatnam district tourism officer, Poornima Devi, said, “Once the government order (GO) is issued based on the policy, we will take up various tourism activities including nature, wildlife and eco-tourism, especially in Agency areas like Paderu and Araku and start identifying routes and sites for trekking and camping. The DPR sent by the government to Centre for Araku Eco-Tourism Project is pending approval.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/eco-tourism-push-to-attract-nature-lovers-to-ap/articleshow/79850555.cms||Sulogna Mehta

December 22, 2020||Chennai||Highway’s still bad, collect only half toll till January 18, Madras HC tells NHAI||CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Monday extended till January 18 its interim order directing the National Highways Authority of India to collect only 50% of user fee in toll plazas between Maduravoyal and Walajapet on the Chennai-Bengaluru highway. A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha had passed the order on December 9 in view of poor maintenance of the stretch. During a hearing on Monday, the bench extended the order till Pongal after refusing to accept a submission of the NHAI that potholes on the stretch have been filled and patchwork completed. “I personally travelled on the highway on Saturday and Sunday. Patchwork done is not up to standard and breaks off when a truck passes over,” Justice Sathyanarayanan said. “As we used to say, it is not a highway but a hell way,” the bench said. Rejecting the request of advocate G Karthikeyan, counsel for the NHAI, to vacate the interim order and to permit NHAI to collect full user fee, the bench said it wondered which law permits the authority to collect toll fee without providing proper road. To this, Karthikeyan submitted that the stretch has not been relaid since conversion of the highway into a six-lane road is underway. “Relaying the road would not serve any purpose and would be waste of funds,” Karthikeyan said. Recording the submission, the bench pointed out that the court had ordered in 2015 that the road be relaid and nothing had been done in the past five years. “There is an absolute lack of sensitivity and supervision on part of the NHAI. Are the authorities afraid of the concessionaires?” the court said. Pointing out that even the Kolkata highway near Nerkundram is in similar condition, the court wondered as to whether Lonavala and Agra are the only national highways in the country. It also pointed out that the road median on the stretch is not maintained properly. “There is a lake near Kaveripakkam, close to the highway. It is brimming with water now but there is no barricade or even lights on the stretch and someone is definitely going to land straight into the lake,” the court said. The bench also observed that the NHAI should maintain its roads at least to match national standards before making tall claims that the roads laid by it are of international standard. The observations and interim order were passed on a suo motu PIL initiated by the court in view of poor maintenance of the national highway between Maduravoyal and Walajapet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/highways-still-bad-collect-only-half-toll-till-jan-18-hc-tells-nhai/articleshow/79845131.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Rs 7,000-crore fraud: Ex-MP faked companies in name of maids, drivers, says CBI||HYDERABAD: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has said that Hyderabad-based Transstroy India Private Limited, which is embroiled in one of the biggest banking frauds in the country worth Rs 7,296 crore, had created fictitious companies in the name of maids, sweepers and drivers and made them directors to divert funds. Transstroy is owned by former TDP MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao. In its FIR, CBI alleged that Padmavati Enterprises, Unique Engineers, Balaji Enterprises and Ruthwik Associates swindled Rs 6,643 crore. “Nine are non-existing companies, which have been created to run fraudulent operations with the assistance of employees,” the CBI alleged. A KPMG forensic audit revealed that the accused had borrowed Rs 9,394 crore from Canara Bank and 13 other banks. The CBI’s banking fraud and securities cell in Bengaluru issued the FIR against Transstroy, Sambasiva Rao, company’s CMD Cherukuri Sridhar and director Akkineni Satish. A case was booked under IPC sections for criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and falsification of documents and Prevention of Corruption Act. Sambasiva Rao, however, denied any fraud and said the CBI had wrongly filed the FIR. He said he had taken only Rs 700 crore loan. For instance, Padmavati Enterprises had Sudhakar Babu Gorantla, an employee of Transstroy, as director. Later, the firm diverted Rs 1,848 crore. Similarly, Unique Engineers had an invoice associated with M Sambasiva Rao, a former director of Transstroy. The CBI said Rs 7,153 crore was first transferred from Transstroy account to nine vendors — Padmavati Enterprises, Balaji Enterprises, Ruthwik Associates, Unique Engineers, Subhakari Enterprises, Agastya Trade Links Private Ltd, Khanala Trading India, AS Associates and Vijay Engineering Equipment — and Rs 6,202 crore was again brought back to Transstroy account. The amount was later diverted to related parties, special purpose vehicles and others. An amount of Rs 350 crore was transferred into the accounts of promoters. When the accounts of Sridhar and director R Leela Kumar were checked (between 2012 and 2014), it was found that Rs 450 crore was transferred from the accounts of specific vendors. KPMG audit report revealed that only eight excavators were purchased from Volvo and purchase of 16 excavators from Unique Engineers was fabricated. It was also found that five tipper purchases were made from Tata Motors and purchase of another five tippers was fabricated with the same engine number and chassis numbers and operated without registration. The company in its October 10, 2018, statement said that Rs 1,753 crore worth stock was lying at various project sites, including Rs 1,527 crore at Polavaram Irrigation Project. “It is not clear as to how a huge stock like this could be stored at the project site. The company has also indulged in tampering of its balance sheet,” the CBI alleged. The difference in closing and opening of balance sheet was Rs 608 crore for Padmavati Enterprises, Balaji Enterprises and Ruthwik Enterprises. A cash payment of more than Rs 20 crore was made to meet labour payments at the site for Polavaram project, but they were not disclosed, it said. Transstroy’s book of accounts had shown that Rs 719 crore was written off as on April 1, 2016, stating that the unbilled revenue was treated as a sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-7k-cr-fraud-ex-mp-faked-cos-in-name-of-maids-drivers-says-cbi/articleshow/79847547.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
December 22, 2020||Ahmedabad||Management quota at Gujarat govt colleges?||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has been moved with a complaint about wrongful allocation of as many as 677 MBBS seats at government and aided medical colleges to rich students in ‘management quota’.  Last week, advocate K R Koshti made a representation to the government to stop the practice of allocating 677 MBBS seats in the management quota in violation of laws formulated for medical admissions. On Monday, he filed a PIL in this regard in the high court to end this practice and accommodate students on these “government” seats by charging reasonable fees. He is also seeking re-allocation of these seats during the admission process being undertaken by the admissions committee. Koshti submitted that there are 5,508 medical seats available in Gujarat in the state’s quota. Of these, there are only 700 seats at unaided colleges and 175 seats are available in the management quotas of the concerned trusts. The advocate claimed that there are six government colleges, eight GMERS colleges, three municipal corporation-run colleges and eight aided colleges in the state. All these 25 colleges are termed government colleges and all seats available in these colleges should be treated as government seats and there cannot be any allocation for management quota. But the admission committee has allocated 677 seats to the management and NRI quotas. The law makes it very clear that management and NRI quotas are available at unaided colleges only. Koshti claims that by allocating 677 seats to management quota, the rights of students from SC, ST, SEBC and EWS categories are violated. He maintains that aided and GMERS colleges have been wrongly classified as self-financed institutes, whereas they receive government funds.  He also pointed out that by a 2016 government resolution, benefits including financial assistance are provided to brownfield medical colleges at Palanpur, Dahod, Amreli and Bharuch. Hence, these colleges too should not be given the advantage of management quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/management-quota-at-govt-colleges/articleshow/79846472.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Delhi: 12 let off in riot & murder case||NEW DELHI: Acquitting 12 men in a five-year-old case of rioting and murder in northeast Delhi, a city court said that the “lackadaisical attitude” of the investigating officer (IO) “pulled down the curtains” for the “already slippery prosecution case”. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said it was a “material lapse” on the investigating agency’s part as it had failed to prove an important connecting link in the chain of events. The 12 men — Aas Mohd, Rajesh Kumar, Shahzad Ahmad, Mohd Rihan, Azaz, Hanifuddin, Zakir Hussain, Imran, Mohd Farman, Alam Khan, Parvez and Imran — faced trial under IPC sections 302 (murder), 147, 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and Arms Act. In February 2015, during the Delhi assembly polls, 10-11 men, some of them armed with pistols, surrounded the house of Haji Yameen in Khajuri Khas. Yameen, an AAP worker, had an argument with Hanifuddin over casting of bogus votes. The heated exchange escalated into gunfire and one Shukhra Begum succumbed to bullet wounds on her forehead. After the autopsy of the victim on February 8, 2015, the doctor handed over the seized items, including the bullet, to IO inspector Sanwal Mal, who sent it to the lab. “But surprisingly, for the reasons best known to him, he did not prepare a seizure memo. The IO showed the seizure of third pulinda (one sealed bottle containing bullet) vide a memo on February 19, after almost 11 days,” it observed. The court found substance in the submissions of the defence counsel that the deposition of ASI Umesh Singh made it crystal clear that inspector Mal did not conduct any proceedings on February 19, 2015 at the mortuary of GTB Hospital. He manipulated the date of seizure from the actual date (February 8) to February 19 with the sole motive of replacing the actual recovered bullet with another one after firing the same with a pistol and later planting the bullet and pistol on Rajesh. Rajesh was arrested on February 20, 2015 and brought to the PS straightway, where all the writing work was done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/12-let-off-in-riot-murder-case/articleshow/79846226.cms||Aamir Khan
December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata director’s documentary on triple talaq makes it to film fests||KOLKATA: City-based film-maker Farha Khatun’s Urdu documentary on triple talaq, titled ‘Holy Rights’, has been selected for the India International Film Festival’s Indian Panorama’s non-feature film section. Earlier, the 32-year-old film-maker’s documentary was selected for screening at the Short & Documentary Panorama (non-competition section) of the 26th Kolkata International Film Festival. In early 2000, a relative of the director had shared a traumatic experience of her marital life. “Her husband had uttered talaq twice in a fit of rage. Before he could pronounce it the third time, she had hurriedly closed his mouth with her hand. That had saved their marriage, but my relative had lived with the horror for years. She would cry and tell my grandmother that had he uttered this word once more, they would have had to be separated,” Khatun said. That story had continued to haunt Khatun for years. “My journey as a Muslim woman made me focus more on women’s lives, to see the world through their narratives, to interpret everyday realities through their standpoints. Incidents like that of my relative, along with my quest to find whether the Quran really says that uttering the word ‘talaq’ thrice is the way to abandon someone, made me explore this subject through my film,” said Khatun, who has a postgraduate diploma in editing from Roopkala Kendro. In 2018, Khatun had won a National Award for co-directing ‘I am Bonnie’ on the tragedies, aspirations and achievements of a transgender footballer. By then, she had begun work on ‘Holy Rights’ where she has focussed on Safia, a deeply religious Muslim woman from Bhopal who joins a programme for training women as Qazis (judges of Sharia court) and followed the tales of several women who fought against the triple talaq practice. While the documentary deals with a serious subject, Khatun has not made it too heavy and has included lighter moments from Safia’s marital life. “Those moments help to lighten the mood and the incidents of grief that we see in the film. Besides, it also gives a message that all of us can achieve something if we want to,” she said. However, making such a film was not easy. “With rising Islamophobia, growing violence against women and fascist governments that are increasingly curbing basic human rights, any attempt to talk about patriarchy within religion is often dismissed, even by liberals, as providing ammunition to communal forces or is pushed to a later agenda in the call for unity against fascism,” Khatun said. This film, she added, is pertinent as it brings to the fore the voices of women as they “fight” censorship both “within and outside their communities” and tries to capture the desperation that enables women like Safia to risk everything to change an oppressive system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-directors-documentary-on-triple-talaq-makes-it-to-film-fests/articleshow/79846213.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Systemic flaws delaying completion of STPs: Panel||NEW DELHI: In its fifth report submitted to National Green Tribunal, the Yamuna Monitoring Committee, set up by the tribunal to monitor projects related to the river’s rejuvenation, has highlighted systemic flaws that have delayed the setting up of sewage treatment plants. The report states that while the Coronation Pillar STP should have been completed by now, it is 25% behind schedule, while Kondli, Rithala and Okhla STPs are lagging, respectively, by 26%, 43% and 14%. The report cited as such flaws the lackadaisical roles of project management consultants (PMC), delay in permission for tree felling, cash flow constraints and the overall role of Delhi Jal Board and its disinterested approach. It also pointed out that the interceptor sewer project has failed to meet its 2014 deadline due to this casual approach by the various agencies. PMCs were appointed by DJB to assist its engineers and local staff to review the designs, plans and programmes prepared by the contractors. The monitoring panel’s report said PMCs did not highlight the issues relating to delays, as required of them, resulting in no urgency to meet the timelines. “A perusal of the list of inspections and review meetings held with PMCs brings out that from April 2019 as many as 14 site inspections and 27 review meetings were held at different levels,” the report said. “Only one meeting was held with Member (Drainage) and none under the chairmanship of the CEO. During discussion the chief engineer and his SE did not exhibit the sense of ownership, or a detailed knowledge of the obstacles and clearly lacked the persuasive ability needed to garner support from senior officers.” The report also pulled up DJB, saying seven demi-official and 14 minutes-of-the-meeting letters sent to the water utility and Delhi government received ‘nil’ response. “There is reason to believe that the communications from NMCG (National Mission for Clean Ganga) have been handled in a very routine manner at the level of the engineers of different levels and were never re-submitted for intervention on inter-departmental matters,” the report stated. Citing the repeated cases of slippages in project implementation, both in Yamuna Action Plan-III and the interceptor sewer project, the panel said this called for the examination of the decision-making processes within DJB. “Such delays are against the tenets of good governance and financial control. The monitoring of YAP-III projects was expected to be done using modern tools. This needs to be instituted with a sense of urgency considering the impact on the environment due to continued presence of sewage in the River Yamuna and its drains,” the report stated. Manoj Mishra, activist and convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, was happy the panel’s report to NGT strongly argued that unless systemic shortcomings in concerned government agencies like DJB, DDA, etc were rectified, there was little hope of the river’s rejuvenation. “We welcome the report’s recommendations on a performance audit of DJB. Something similar for DDA is also in order,” said Mishra||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/systemic-flaws-delaying-completion-of-stps-panel/articleshow/79846247.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
December 22, 2020||Ahmedabad||Renowned mathematics teacher jumps to death in Ahmedabad's Vasna||AHMEDABAD: A mathematics teacher from the Paldi area of city, who ran coaching classes in various parts of the city, on Monday morning committed suicide by jumping off the terrace of a 14-storey building in Vasna, where he had gone to a health club. The deceased, Parth Tank, a resident of Vrindavan Society in Paldi, is survived by his wife and two children, said a police officer, adding that the exact reason for his suicide was not known but mental health issues are suspected. Tank, who was known for introducing innovative techniques to the study of mathematics, was known as a smiling teacher by his students. He had also produced a Gujarati film, 'Teacher of The Year' which released in September 2019. The investigating officer of the case, sub-inspector P B Jadeja of Vasna police, said Tank left home at around 7.30am on Monday and went to a gym in a 14-storey building, Rajyash Complex in Vasna. “He went straight to the terrace where he walked for around an hour and may have pondered over the extreme step, which he took at around 9am by jumping off the terrace,” said Jadeja. His body was sent for a postmortem to VS Hospital and a case of accidental death was registered with Vasna police. Jadeja said that Tank did not leave any suicide note due to which exact reason for his ending his life was not known. “His family and friends told me that he suffered from some mental health issues and had stayed at a rehabilitation centre in 2013. However, he had progressed very well professionally, but he was disturbed due to his mental illness in his personal life,” said Jadeja. He said Jadeja was well-off, so there was no financial reasons for his suicide. He said family members told police that he had been upset for the past few days. Police gathered CCTV footage of the incident and began further investigation. A security guard of the building said Tank was always smiling and asked about his well being whenever he entered the building. An actor in his film said Tank always had an eye on the future and had introduced various techniques to the study of mathematics and it was difficult to accept that a man like him had committed suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/renowned-maths-teacher-jumps-to-his-death-in-vasna/articleshow/79846456.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Your Aadhaar details are being used to activate SIM cards for others||KOLKATA: Manipulated Aadhaar numbers in KYC details to issue SIM cards purchased in bulk by fake call centre operators has emerged as a major problem with hundreds of SIM cards being confiscated in the past couple of months. This has come to light in four instances involving sale agencies and a fake telephone exch-ange operation. In the cases at Entally, Chitpur, Bhowanipore and Lake Town, the accused used a lacuna in the verification process of a service provider during the lockdown. Around 600 such SIM cards issued with fictitious addresses have been traced by Kolkata Police alone. In all three cases as well as in a fourth case at Lake Town police station, it is the same company who has lodged all the complaints. According to sources, genuine Aadhaar card numbers were misused by the gang. “During lockdown, manual filling up of forms for new connections had been discontinued. Instead, the company that was cheated had left the process to retailers who were provided unique local area payment unit (LAPU) numbers through which they had to send details for new connections. Neeraj Kumar, who was arrested in the Entally case, ran two shops where people could make recharges and get new connections. He received many original Aadhaar card numbers,” said an officer. “According to the company policy, retailers had to freeze photographs of the customers from videos to establish authenticity. The retailer, too, had to uphold his/her photograph. The accused got seven such videos ready and repeated the same photographs on the forms. They then used an app to edit the forms. The accused downloaded a second app to cut, copy and paste photographs from these seven videos with various genuine Aadhaar numbers and ad-dresses collected from Neeraj’s shops. During lockdown, the company only carried out system-driven verification of Aadhaar numbers. Since the numbers were genuine, the accused managed to pass the checks by the company. These SIM cards were then sold to fraudsters at a premium,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/your-aadhaar-details-are-being-used-to-activate-sim-cards-for-others/articleshow/79846255.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

December 22, 2020||Chennai||Court irked with PWD’s pay disparity||Chennai: The state public works department’s disparity in paying wages to domestic help provided to sitting and retired judges of the Madras high court has irked the court administration. Despite a detailed communication from the registrar general, the PWD has not set right the inequality, it said. As per the Retired Judges Domestic Help and Other Benefits Rules, 2018, a retired judge of the court is entitled to engage two domestic help (non-muster roll workers) through PWD, which would pay their salaries. After wages were revised following a January 31, 2019, order of the court’s Madurai bench, workers deputed to the HC’s sitting judges and those engaged on high court campuses are paid Rs 18,369 a month but domestic help of retired judges are paid Rs 10,000 a month. This disparity was not rectified for two years and the in charge of the retired judges cell took the matter to the PWD and when there was no response, a detailed communication was sent to the PWD on February 24. Despite a request to address the issue on ‘most urgent’ basis before 10 months, the PWD has turned a deaf ear, the court said.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/court-irked-with-pwds-pay-disparity/articleshow/79845165.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Seaplane service gone with the wind?||AHMEDABAD: The launch of India’s first seaplane service appears to have jumped the gun. After its grand launch on October 31, the service actually operated for a maximum of 24 days, from Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad to the Statue of Unity in Kevadia and vice versa. Even though SpiceJet, the airline which operates the service, had claimed that bookings were to reopen on December 20, they have not. The website, www.spiceshuttle.com, shows no flight available while the ticketing window is closed. An airline spokesperson had last week said that the service would resume operations on December 27. Bookings for any dates after December 27 were unavailable. SpiceJet did not respond to TOI’s questions on the reasons for bookings not yet resuming. Industry players said that haphazard service and improper booking channels will only add to people’s apprehensions about the service. “Consistency and a good service experience is what any paying traveller expects. The seaplane service was to have a glamour factor to attract tourists to Gujarat. If the service does not operate consistently, people will not trust it and it will not serve the purpose of boosting tourism,” said Manish Sharma, secretary, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI), Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/seaplane-service-gone-with-the-wind/articleshow/79846448.cms||Niyati Parikh
December 22, 2020||Kochi||Kerala: 22-year-old student to head Uzhavoor panchayat||KOTTAYAM: Uzhavoor panchayat in the district is set to be headed by a 22-year-old student. UDF has made an agreement with Johnys P Stephen, who represented One India One Pension (OIOP) movement and won. In the 13-member panchayat, both UDF and LDF got five seats each while BJP got one. OIOP, which had fought against all the political fronts, won two seats. To gain majority, OIOP became a crucial factor and UDF held talks with Stephen and decided to support Stephen for the president post for the first half of the five-year period. OIOP had fielded eight candidates in the panchayat. Anju P Benny won the other seat. Stephen is a post-graduate student of MA English from Christ University in Bengaluru. Presently, he is in the final semester and has three more months to complete the course. Stephen was active in National Service Scheme and ‘malayala samajam’ activities while in school and college. He graduated in BA English from St Stephens College, Uzhavoor. He, however, did not have any political leanings. “I always kept good relations with people and always got involved with their issues,” Stephen said. “People in my ward needed a change and I contested the elections as per their wishes,” he added. Stephen won by 194 votes defeating the candidates of all major political fronts. “I wish to be a president who is accessible to all in the panchayat at any time,” he said. Stephen plans to set up a day care centre for the aged in the panchayat. An information centre to alert people about the various concessions and projects of the state and central government which are beneficial to the people, career placement cell for youngsters, cultural centre for students, are some of the his projects. He hopes to raise funds from NRIs, besides the panchayat’s fund. Besides, he is planning to continue his preparations for civil service examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/22-year-old-student-to-head-uzhavoor-panchayat/articleshow/79845188.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Churches self impose severe restrictions on celebrations||Nagpur: Churches in Nagpur have decided to go well beyond the government safety guidelines and self impose further restrictions during the holiest week in the Christian calendar. From cancelling midnight mass or worship and house-to-house carol singing, to stopping community meets to stringent seating arrangements — churches are all set to ensure that Christmas is celebrated safely. Rev Ramakrishnan, district superintendent of Methodist Church, said safety of members comes first. “We have cancelled the customary and most looked forward to carol singing group’s visit to church member homes. Also, the midnight worship or mass on Christmas eve has been put on hold,” he said. On the holiest day for Christians, Christmas, even the worship at church won’t be done the usual way. Again self imposing stricter rules, Methodist church has decided to allow only 40% of the total seating capacity. “We can seat around 150 members but that will now be around 60,” said Rev Ramakrishnan. At the iconic All Saints Cathedral, similar arrangements are being made. Pastor John George said, “On Christmas day, we will have the English language service at 8am and the Hindi language service at 11am. All other events for the day have been put on hold.” The Catholic church too has cancelled the midnight mass and decided to allow only 200 members inside for Christmas Day mass. Archbishop Elias Gonsalves said, “To chase away the dark clouds of pandemic, Christmas is coming like a shining light. But we have to exercise caution because every citizen is like a family member. Vasudhaiva kutumbakam (the world is one family) is a vision we Indians have inherited from our ancient sages. That all human beings are part of one family is also at the heart of the Christian faith. So while we worship the Lord, it is also our duty to ensure safety of others around us.” The sole Christian residential area in district, Mecosabagh Christian Colony, has also decided to tone down the celebrations. Michael Morde, executive member of Mecosabagh Christian Welfare Association (MCWA), said, “We used to organize a community dinner, sports events for kids and some cultural things. But this year, we will not organize non-religious group events, as safety of people is paramount.” The area will however be decked up with special lighting and a huge Christmas star. All churches will be webcasting either a live or delayed live feed of the most awaited Christmas sermon. This will ensure that those who are unable to attend Church won’t be deprived of the ‘Christmas message’ by the priest, which is the focal point of that day. Almost all churches had shifted to online mode soon after the lockdown was imposed across Maharashtra, in March. INFO GFX WHAT’S DIFFERENT AT CHRISTMAS No home visits by carol singing groups No midnight mass No community get-together Limited seating arrangements inside church Webcasting of priest’s sermon No holy communion||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/churches-self-impose-severe-restrictions-on-celebrations/articleshow/79846315.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
December 22, 2020||Chennai||Ex-MP moves court on theft of Cauvery water||Chennai: A former MP if the DMK has moved the Madras high court seeking direction to the state government to take action against registered ‘Lift Irrigation Societies’ that are unlawfully extracting water from Cauvery river. A K S Vijayan alleged that due to such illegal extraction of river water for non-agricultural commercial purposes, rights of lower riparian regions were affected. “It has led to scarcity of water in and around the lower riparian areas including Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur. This would directly affect the agricultural output of the delta region leading to food security issues across Tamil Nadu,” senior advocate R Shanmugasundaram representing the petitioner said. Admitting the plea, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemelatha directed the state to file its reply by February 19. According to the petitioner, recent media reports have highlighted the modus operandi used by such societies, wherein it is typical for such societies to own land nearby the Cauvery riverbank. “Using this locational advantage, a society is registered. Subsequently, water from Cauvery is extracted using borewells and very powerful (500bhp or 600bhp) electric motors. Water is then transported through giant pipelines for selling it to commercial establishments for a premium price,” the petitioner said. Though the petitioner has sent representation to the authorities concerned, no action has been taken, he alleged. Adding that any diversion of Cauvery river water for non-agricultural purposes using lift irrigation societies would be in breach of the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act, the petitioner wanted the court to interfere. There is a direct link between the proliferation of bogus lift irrigation societies and the decline in the quantity of Cauvery water reaching the lower riparian regions, he added. If the unlawful extraction goes unchecked for even a little longer, delta farmers will be put to irreversible hardship and the agricultural output will suffer drastically, the petitioner added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ex-mp-moves-court-on-theft-of-cauvery-water/articleshow/79845157.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Delhi: Work begins, anti-smog tower at Connaught Place may be ready by next June||NEW DELHI: Delhi could see a functioning anti-smog tower in the heart of the capital at Connaught Place by June 2021, according to timelines drawn for the Rs 20 crore project by government officials. The project, which was approved by the Delhi cabinet in October, will see a 20-metre tall structure set up in order to improve air quality in a radius of around 1 km, officials say. Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) officials say the first instalment to build the anti-smog tower has already been released.  “Soil testing and all necessary clearances were received in October and now site excavation work has begun. The project site was chosen keeping in mind the surroundings and footfall expected in the vicinity. The area has already been barricaded and installation work should begin by March 2020,” said a DPCC official. While Rs 9 crore has been released for the project so far, DPCC says some components will be installed at the site itself, while some will come pre-assembled. “The assembling work is not as complicated as the testing work, which will be carried out later in order to ensure it works smoothly,” said the official. The tower is being built in collaboration with the University of Minnesota and IIT Bombay, which recently signed an MoU with the central government to construct the anti-smog tower. IIT Delhi will also provide expertise. Another tower, which will be built by the central government, is to come up at Anand Vihar in east Delhi, one of the capital’s thirteen pollution hotspots. The University of Minnesota had recently installed an anti-smog tower in China, which is capable of processing 75 million cubic metres of air per day. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had in October said while this tower was being built on the same lines as China, the technology being used was different. “In China, the smog tower sucks the polluted air from down below and releases clean air from above. Our smog tower will suck the polluted air from above, and release the clean air from the bottom. The Delhi cabinet has sanctioned Rs 20 crore for the installation of this first-of-its-kind smog tower, and we hope that the installation work will be completed within the next 10 months,” Kejriwal had said, adding more such towers would come up in Delhi if this became successful. Experts in the past, however, have questioned the impact such a tower will have on Delhi’s air. Neeraj Sharma, an activist who had filed an RTI plea regarding the Delhi’s anti-smog tower, said that no department could produce a scientific study on which the tower was based. “There has to be some scientific backing behind the tower being set up as it is a considerable outlay,” said Sharma. The Supreme Court in January this year had asked for an anti-smog tower to be installed in Delhi by April 2020, however, work had been impacted due to the lockdown. Delhi has recently seen smaller ‘anti-smog towers’, set up by MP Gautam Gambhir, come up in east Delhi markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/work-begins-anti-smog-tower-at-cp-may-be-ready-by-next-june/articleshow/79846284.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Woman held for multiple bike thefts in Kolkata||KOLKATA: A 20-year-old married woman — walking alone with a scooter by her side in the middle of the night in a Karaya bylane — caught the attention of the local cops, who were maintaining watch through CCTV after multiple cases of two-wheeler thefts got reported from the Park Circus-Beniapukur area in the past two months. The cops rushed to the spot, only to realize that she might be part of a gang of intra-state bike thieves, who has managed to steal four two-wheelers with help of a master key. She was finally arrested from her residence at Chhatubabu Lane in Entally this weekend. The accused has been identified as Ashia Bibi. Cops said that while women kepmars are common in the city, it is rare that a young woman would act as a lifter herself. “We are questioning the accused for leads and to identify all those, who actually sold off these vehicles,” said cops. Police said that Ashia’s husband, to whom she got married in 2018, is a private firm employee. “It seems like she was not happy with her financial condition and had met some friends, who lured her into the job,” said a cop. “So far, her direct role has been found in a theft case at Karaya last month and two more this month at Karaya. She is also wanted in an Entally case,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-held-for-multiple-bike-thefts/articleshow/79846305.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
December 22, 2020||Amritsar||Police arrest 2 persons in Dec 14 drone case||Amritsar: Police have arrested two persons Lucky Dhawan and Baldev Singh, both residents of Delhi, in connection with terror-narco drone module busted on December 14. Punjab police chief DGP Dinkar Gupta said on Monday that a raid was conducted on Dhawan’s TRD Enterprises in New Delhi. Dhawan’s questioning revealed that he was involved in the procurement, sale, assembly and repair of drones and drone components without any valid government authorisation or license, the police chief said. Dhawan told that he had supplied the quadcopter drone and the SkyDroid T10 system to Lakhbir Singh without any formal documentation or billing. Lakhbir had also prepared a forged Aadhar card in the name one Arshdeep Singh to fraudulently procure the drone. On December 14, police had arrested Lakhbir and Bachittar Singh from Amritsar and had recovered one quadcopter drone with a full supporter stand and one SkyDroid T10 2.4GHz 10CH FHSS transmitter, along with mini receiver and camera support, a .32 bore revolver and one SUV from their possession Dhawan’s interrogation also revealed that the drone supplied to Lakhbir was assembled by one Baldev Singh, resident of Delhi, who was also arrested. “Search of the workshop further led to the recovery of four drones and drone hardware – one 450 Quadcopter drone, one DJI Phantom drone, two DJI 249 Mavic Mini drones, one video transmitter system, one 650 quadcopter drone repair kit and one mobile phone,” said DGP Gupta, adding that Baldev had disclosed that he had procured the various drone components from different sources, including e–commerce sites. Further probe had revealed the names of three key Pakistan-based entities – Chishti, Malik and Maqsood, who were in contact with the arrested accused. Chishti was also in close contact with the accused arrested in the Akashdeep drone module case busted by Punjab police in September 2019. In addition, Malik was in contact with the alleged accused Ajaypal Singh arrested in the drone module busted by Punjab police in January 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/police-arrest-2-persons-in-dec-14-drone-case/articleshow/79846273.cms||---

Gita teaches us how to grow in all dimensions and live a life of wholeness. Gita teaches us how to counter stress, indecision and lack of happiness caused by the glitter of modern life based on materialism and mad race for money. Gita also teaches us how to rightly conduct ourselves in different contexts of life.” Haryana governor and KU chancellor Satyadeo Narain Arya said, “The message of Lord Krishna delivered in Bhagwad Gita is about selfless action which is the base of all-round growth and welfare of humans, society and the entire world. Bhagwadgita is the kernel of vedic civilization which developed along the Saraswati in Kurukshetra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gita-mahotsava-begins-at-kurukshetra/articleshow/79846324.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Using sexist language against women may be IPC offence: Delhi court||NEW DELHI: Using sexist language against women can attract charges of sexual harassment under the Indian Penal Code, a Delhi court order said while turning down the plea of a man against a magisterial court framing charges of sexual harassment and insulting a woman’s modesty against him. In February, the magistrate’s court had found merit in a police case in which a woman had filed a complaint against her manager using a Hindi word commonly used as a sexist slur against her in January 2016. The man challenged that order in a sessions court, which, however, refused to meddle, considering the woman’s allegations against the man as being “specific”. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said, “At the stage of framing of charge, the court cannot brush aside the statement of the complainant wherein she has levelled specific allegations against the accused.” He noted that just because she didn’t mention the exact date and time of the incident did not mean her complaint could be discarded at the “very outset without testing it upon the anvil of trial”. The woman’s complaint had stated that the incident occurred the “previous” month, when the manager sat at her desk and directed the sexist slang at her. When she brought it to the notice of her reporting manager, he had asked her to ignore it if she wanted to continue working at the company. The man’s counsel urged the sessions court to set aside the magistrate court’s order, arguing that the woman had not filed a complaint with the company but had filed a false case against his client. The counsel highlighted the fact that the complainant did not record her statement before the court under Section 164 of Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the defence, the complainant, on being asked to resign owing to professional incompetence, filed a false complaint against the man, who was the sales manager. The court referred to a judgment of the Supreme Court in Sheoraj Singh Ahlawat v. State of UP and noted that ground for presuming the accused had committed the offence had to be considered, not ground for convicting him. So, said judge Rana, “It is settled in law that at the stage of charge, the court is not required to meticulously weigh the evidence. Discrepancies, if any, in the statement of the complainant are a matter of trial. The complaint is also duly signed by the complainant.” The judge added that the woman not recording her statement in court wasn’t ground to discharge the man. In the court's opinion, the reasons were required to be recorded by the trial court only if it had concluded that the accused deserved to be discharged. “However, when the court decides there is prima facie a case, reasons are not required to be given,” the order noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/using-sexist-language-against-women-may-be-ipc-offence-court/articleshow/79846316.cms||Aamir Khan
December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Telangana urges HC to vacate stay order on Aadhaar||HYDERABAD: Stating that the Supreme Court in both its Puttaswamy-2 judgment and section 7 of the Aadhaar Act allows the state to seek Aadhaar card particulars from people who are beneficiaries of government subsidy, the state government on Monday urged the high court to vacate the stay order issued by the court in respect of agricultural properties. The state was uploading the data of the owners of agricultural land along with the particulars of their Aadhaar, caste, etc on its Dharani portal, when the high court bench, comprising Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy stayed the process on November 3 directing the state to stop collecting Aadhaar and other details from people. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar filed an affidavit urging the court to vacate the stay. The bench was hearing a PIL filed by advocate Saaketh Kasibhatla questioning the collection of Aadhaar details on Dharani. In his affidavit, Somesh Kumar said that the state is implementing Rythu Bandhu, an agricultural investment support scheme, along with Rythu Bima, a group insurance scheme linked to the scheme and crop loan waiver. “All three schemes are welfare schemes and are being funded from the consolidated fund of the government of Telangana. After the Puttaswamy-2 judgment delivered by the Supreme Court, the Centre had amended section 7 of the Aadhaar Act and issued guidelines defining the areas where the authorities can seek Aadhaar details from people,” he said. The CS further said that under the amended Act, the state is very much within its powers to seek the details of Aadhaar while extending financial benefits from the consolidated fund of the state. “In case of sale of agricultural land, the owner who sells the land will cease to get Rythu Bandhu assistance and in his place, the new owner who bought the land will come in. Dharani ensures that both the transfer of title is instant and the flow of Rythu Bandhu too will happen without any hassles,” he said. Advocate General BS Prasad said Rythu Bandhu and other assistance is paid to farmers from the state’s consolidated fund and hence the state can seek details of Aadhaar in respect of agricultural properties. The bench posted the case to December 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-urges-hc-to-vacate-stay-order-on-aadhaar/articleshow/79846230.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Ahmedabad||MIL alleges assault with iron rod||Ahmedabad: A 56-year-old woman from Gota, a heart patient, on Sunday filed a complaint of assault alleging that her daughter-in-law had attacked her with an iron rod over a domestic quarrel in August. Usha Brahmbhatt, a resident of Setu Vatika Society in Gota, stated in her FIR with Sola police that her son Vicky had married a woman from Mehsana, Dhara Brahmbhatt, in 2016. After their wedding, Dhara often quarrelled with her son and left their home for her parents’ place in Mehsana. She had on August 24 overheard Dhara talking to her parents on the phone and abusing Vicky. When Usha told Dhara not to abuse her son, she began arguing with her and threatened to kill her. Dhara allegedly then began hitting her and pulling her hair. She then took an iron rod and began hitting her. Vicky rushed in on hearing her screams. He had called the police at the time, but as Dhara threatened to lodge a false case against them, Usha did not file a complaint. She underwent treatment for around four months and after fully recovering, she filed a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mil-alleges-assault-with-iron-rod/articleshow/79846407.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala police offer support to CBI probe in three cases||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State police sanctioned manpower and vehicle support to CBI to assist investigation in three cases, including the Periya double murder case. State police chief Loknath Behera gave sanction to depute officers from the force to assist the agency in probing Periya double murder case and the custodial deaths of PP Mathai at a forest office in Pathanamthitta and Rajkumar in Nedumkandam police station in Idukki. CBI had sought manpower, office facilities and vehicles in these cases. While police officers for assistance and vehicles have been sanctioned, the sanction for office facilities at PWD rest houses in Kasaragod, Kattappana and Pathanamthitta are soon expected from the government. Though the agency has its own manpower, the assistance from local police force – in the state where it operates – are availed for multiple reasons. Similarly, the agency opens its office in a government facility in the local area where it is probing a case. The government and CBI share a chequered relationship. While the government gave a cold shoulder to the agency when it requested facilities in cases the government had no interest in transferring, the approach was warmer in cases that were handed over to CBI at the behest of the government. In Periya double murder case, CBI had written twice, within a span of a year, to the government to provide necessary logistical support, but government refused to acknowledge the same until it lost its case in the Supreme Court; it was against handing over the case to CBI. CBI had faced similar issues when it took up cases that involved CPM cadres in the past. In 2016, public works department issued an order cancelling the free-accommodation facilities to CBI sleuths with retrospective effect when the agency had taken up cases of Kathiroor Manoj murder in Sept 2014, Payyoli Manoj murder case in Jan 2016 and Ramabhadran murder case in Kollam in Oct 2015, in which CPM activists were the prime accused. But in other cases, like the custodial death in Kattappana – in which the decision was taken by the government to hand over the case to CBI – it was receptive towards the agency’s request for logical support. While CBI sought logistical support for three cases, it had recently returned the manpower and other help extended to it in five cases in which it had completed its investigation. Meanwhile, informed sources said that CBI has taken up the allegations made by a media – that the meeting of CBI SP, who is heading the special crimes branch in state, with state police chief Loknath Behera had cast aspersions on the transparency of investigation – with police and agency higher-ups. Nandakumar Nair, who heads the agency’s SCB in Kerala, had called on state police chief last Wednesday. “CBI SP met me to seek logistical support from the police for probing the cases handed over to it. We have assured them that all possible support will be extended to CBI,” Behera said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-police-offer-support-to-cbi-probe-in-three-cases/articleshow/79845200.cms||KP Saikiran
December 22, 2020||Ahmedabad||Bopal dump set to bloom into eco park||AHMEDABAD: The Bopal dump yard is ready for a transformation with the AMC gearing up to start work on an ecological garden at the site. The merger of the area into the AMC zone has facilitated the metamorphosis plan for the dump yard. Harshad Solanki, the director of the AMC’s solid waste department, said that the site is perhaps the first in the city to be rid of waste and construction debris. The AMC had in July installed a trommel machine at the site that can process 1,000 metric tonnes of waste in eight hours. The process to clear the site began when the Bopal nagarpalika had the responsibility over the area. Soon after the AMC took over, the clearance of the site became its first project. Solanki said that the ecological park will cover a 6.5 acre area. The AMC will deodorize the soil before the park’s establishment. The park is likely to be ready by March-end next year. Solanki said that the site had over 5 lakh metric tonnes of garbage which was processed by the AMC. The site is situated near an ISRO facility and is in a residential area, with a school in the vicinity. The site will now have an open gymnasium and a walkway, among other features.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bopal-dump-set-to-bloom-into-eco-park/articleshow/79846397.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Jaipur||At meet, industry bodies red flag issues that choke biz||Jaipur: In the pre-budget meeting with the finance department, industry bodies in the state drew attention of the government to the difficulties companies are facing due to non-implementation of existing policies by various departments, and absence of policy intervention to overcome fresh hurdles. Giving their suggestions for the Budget 2021-22, CII-Rajasthan said while Purchase Preference Policy mandates government departments to purchase 80% from Rajasthan-based industries, the norms are not followed. Departments like RVPNL, JVVNL, AVVNL, and PHED are doing turnkey projects with large-scale units who purchase from outside Rajasthan units. It said turnkey vendors must purchase from Rajasthan units. “There are around 140 products in Rajasthan which are specifically earmarked to be purchased 100% from Rajasthan-based industries. It is a good time to increase this list to at least 200 items so that Rajasthan industries will take benefit of this,” CII-Rajasthan said in its recommendations. The industry body also said that the government should extend the deadline for competition of various government projects as the vendors have been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. If the deadlines are not extended, they would be required to pay hefty fines. PHDCCI in its recommendations said the government should review the existing high rates of industrial land in Rajasthan and rationalize them to affordable levels after studying the prevailing rates in the neighbouring states to prevent flight of investment. It also said the government should enact a new policy to give hassle-free exit route to industries so that they can transfer assets of the running units to prospective new incumbents who can run the industry with new vigour. It said the benefits under Mukhymantri Laghu Udyog Protsahan Yojana (MLUPY) should be extended to solar sector projects coming up under PM-KUSUM scheme. Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry (FORTI) in its proposals said that DLC rates should be reduced given the difficult situation the sector is in now. “The actual market price in some area is much below the prevailing DLC rates. The rates have a contiguous effect on income tax. The reduction in rates will boost sale of properties,” FORTI said. FORTI also said VAT on petrol and diesel should be reduced to levels in neighbouring states like Delhi, Haryana, and Uttaranchal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/at-meet-industry-bodies-red-flag-issues-that-choke-biz/articleshow/79846272.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
December 22, 2020||Chandigarh||Unable to afford SUV, Rs 5L cash, bride abandoned on wedding day||Karnal: A Karnal woman was allegedly abandoned by her fiancé on the day of their marriage because her father could not arrange the requisite dowry. The bride and her family were waiting for the Baraat when they received word that the groom had refused to marry her because her father could not buy an SUV and pay Rs 5 lakh cash as dowry. On the day of the wedding, the bride’s relatives and family members waited for hours for the groom and his family to show up. Her family members alleged that they were to be married on Sunday but they did not turn up as the groom’s family demanded a luxury car and Rs 5 lakh cash before the ceremony. “Their marriage was fixed around three months ago. They did not make the demand at the time but now, they demanded a luxury car and Rs 5 lakh. All preparations had been made and we tried to negotiate but to no avail,” said the woman’s father. Dressed in bridal finery, the woman said, “He came here to meet me thrice. He took pictures with me and told me he likes me but on the wedding day, he refused to marry me over dowry.” People close to the woman’s family said they were trying to sort out the issue mutually and hesitated to file a police complaint. Karnal superintendent of police Ganga Ram Punia said,” The matter came into my notice through media reports. So far we have not received any formal complaint. Action will be taken after receiving the complaint.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/unable-to-afford-suv-rs-5l-cash-bride-abandoned-on-wedding-day/articleshow/79846309.cms||---

In all, 5,338 challans were generated for registration of properties. The process went off smoothly eexcept minor glitches in generating e-chalans for some time. In this month , the state has so far earned about Rs 60 crore as stamp duty. the state used to earn Rs 60 crore on an average per day with the old system of registration just before lockdown crippled the economy. Realtors and builders had even staged protests before some registration offices seeking registration of properties which have applied for LRS. The state government is yet to take a decision on the29 lakh LRS applications. Experts claims there could be a dent to the registration income to the tune of 30% at least due to lack of clarity on LRS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/slot-gone-state-earns-rs-20-cr-revenue-in-a-day/articleshow/79846268.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Delhi: Smart move by educators helps students join e-classes||NEW DELHI: Believing that one small step can make a huge difference, the principal and vice-principal of a Delhi government school have made a special effort to ensure that none of their students lose out on online education due to lack of devices. With the help of civil society and their acquaintances, they have so far distributed 230 phones to students of classes IX to XII who were having difficulty attending online classes. Principal Awadesh Kumar Jha and vice-principal Bharti Kalra of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Sector 8, Rohini sought the help through three different projects. Interestingly, one of the projects through with around 120 smartphones were distributed was started by a Class X student of The Shri Ram School, Aravali in Gurgaon. On Monday, deputy CM Manish Sisodia distributed these phones to the students. “More than half the students in the school do not have smartphones. In some cases, one phone was being shared by two children. A few children had to wait for their fathers to return from work to be able to attend classes. The vice-principal and I shared this issue with our acquaintances and help poured in,” Jha told TOI. The first set of 50 smartphones was distributed on November 1 as a part of Project Shobhit started by Kavita and Vivek Taneja in the memory of their son, who had died young. “The second project, Time Bank, is run by Suruchi Mittar and Achla Ali and has 60 volunteers who are professionals in different fields. Each of them mentors four Class X students. When they realised that lack of a phone was hampering the studies of the students, they donated it,” said Jha. The largest number of smartphones (around 120) came from Project Empathy started by Avika Diwan, a student of Shri Ram School. “The project was a small idea that came up while I was talking to my aunt. I had heard that many students were not being able to study due to lack of devices. As I study in Class X, I know we have very little time left for the board exams. I had not expected so much support, but my family, relatives and messages circulated to acquaintances made it possible,” she said. Lauding Jha and Kalra, Sisodia said, “The world is full of good people. This morning is a witness to that as we celebrate that goodness. Nobody had thought that studies would shift online, but our teachers stepped up to the challenge despite not being trained for it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/smart-move-by-educators-helps-students-join-e-classes/articleshow/79846332.cms||Shradha Chettri
December 22, 2020||India||Farmer commits suicide, another makes failed bid at protest site||FEROZEPUR/TARN TARAN/BATHINDA: A Ferozepur farmer, who had returned home at Karikalan village after 10 days of protest on the Delhi border against the Centre’s agriculture laws, committed suicide on Sunday night even as another made a failed attempt by consuming some poisonous substance at the Singhu border on Monday. Disturbed by these incidents, coming close on the heels of suicide by a young farmer from Bathinda on Sunday and Sikh preacher Sant Baba Ram Singh last week, farmer organisation BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) has urged farmers not to take such extreme steps and stay involved in the struggle to force the Centre to repeal the agriculture laws. Kulbir Singh (50), had returned to Karikalan on Saturday and his body was found hanging from a tree in his fields on Monday morning. Baljit, a fellow farmer who had accompanied Kulbir from Singhu after 10 days of protest there, said he was upset with the plight of protesting farmers, often breaking down at the dharna site. Niranjan Singh (77), who hails from Bathal Bhaikae village in Tarn Taran district, made a futile suicide attempt by swallowing poison at Singhu border on Monday and was admitted to a hospital in Rohtak. His condition is now stable. In his suicide note, Niranjan wrote that he could not bear to see his fellow brothers, sisters and children braving the winter cold on roads and rail tracks. “Mudatay gujri hai hamay gam sehtaey huae, sharam si aati hai is watan ko watan kehtay (We have braved adversity for long, feel ashamed to call this country my country),” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmer-commits-suicide-another-makes-failed-bid-at-protest-site/articleshow/79848409.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Centre warns states on inadequate plantation data||Nagpur: The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has asked the states and union territories to update correct information regarding compensatory afforestation (CA) on its e-Green Watch portal, failing which their forest land diversion proposals will not be cleared. The e-Green Watch scheme of MoEFCC is being implemented by the states in consultation with the Forest Survey of India (FSI) since 2012. This initiative was conceived with a view to ensure automation, streamlining and effective management of processes related to the utilization of CAMPA and all other funds earmarked by states under various Central or state government schemes for plantation and other forestry-related works. “The success of the above endeavour is based on correct uploading of data on e-Green Watch portal by state forest departments. One of the most critical data is in the form of the digital polygon of the place where work has been undertaken,” MoEFCC officials say. As per the environment ministry, 70% of the data available with it in respect of CA is incorrect, indicating that either it is not being implemented properly or the staff is not trained to upload data. MoEFCC in communication to states on November 20, 2020, has said that non-compliance of its guidelines of Integrated Concurrent Monitoring and Evaluation System (i-CCMES) or e-Green Watch would lead to non-performance and hence annual plan of operations (APOs) and forest diversion proposals will be withheld after January 1, 2021. As reported by TOI, on August 10, 2020, all states were requested to improve the precision of information hosted on e-Green Watch by robust scrutiny of polygons, setting up of an e-green watch cell headed by APCCF (CAMPA), and skill development of field functionaries. However, MoEFCC observed that despite repeated requests from the FSI, a significant percentage of data being uploaded, particularly the polygons, was either incorrect or incomplete. Only 30% of the uploaded polygons were found to be correct. MoEFCC says deficiencies lead to mismatch with topographic features. States are furnishing incomplete quantitative and qualitative detail of plantations and there is non-uniformity of data related to diversion and CA on the portal and also Parivesh (online submission of proposals for clearances). The state CAMPA heads have been asked to review the working of e-Green Watch cell on a weekly basis and also by the executive committee of the state authority of CAMPA in its meetings. MoEFCC robust scrutiny of polygons before these are uploaded could be done by the GIS cell at the headquarters or by the cells established in each forest working plan division by training field functionaries. “Henceforth, no APO/diversion proposals, in respect of particular forest division will be approved without ensuring credibility and correctness of information on various plantation undertaken in forest division is uploaded on e-Green Watch portal,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/centre-warns-states-on-inadequate-plantation-data/articleshow/79846346.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
December 22, 2020||Ahmedabad||HC notice over pollution in Ratna lake||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday issued notice to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and asked them to stop further pollution of the Ratna lake in Ghuma. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice I J Vora has ordered the authorities to immediately stop the flow of drainage water into the lake and to ensure that solid waste is not dumped around the water body. This was in response to a PIL filed by Ghuma residents through advocate Premal Joshi seeking the court’s directions to stop the pollution that is taking place in the water body. The advocate pointed out to the court’s directions issued in the past twice in response to litigations to protect the lake from getting polluted. The high court had ordered to clean the lake, but disposal of solid waste continued around it. The petitioners had earlier sought directions to the civic body, but the high court impleaded GPCB as a party respondent in the litigation and issued notice to it as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-over-pollution-in-ratna-lake/articleshow/79846409.cms||---

The infant was wrapped in a cloth and had been thrown into the drain by her mother. She was discovered almost 12 hours later in a frozen state by Annu, who was on her way to work. She rushed the baby to a nearby hospital, where she is currently out of danger. The child welfare committee (CWC) will soon take custody of the child. Police have registered a case and identified the mother of the infant. Talking to TOI, Annu said, “Around 9.50am last Monday, I was going to work on my scooter when sanitation workers collecting garbage told me about the baby inside the drain. I went close to the drain and saw the infant move one of her feet. I immediately pulled her out, called my sister and rushed her to a nearby hospital. However, the doctors there did not have the facilities for treating her.” “It was a miracle that the child was alive, but she needed immediate attention. The next hospital was 15 minutes away, so I decided to drive on the wrong side to cut short the travelling time to save the child’s life. I reached the hospital within just seven minutes. When I told the doctors that I had found her in a drain, they immediately started her treatment,” added Annu. For the next one week, Annu did not go to work as the infant needed an attendant round the clock. Not just Annu, even her family members took turns in caring for the baby. They grew quite close to the infant, so much so that Annu’s sister wanted to adopt her. “We prayed for her safety and are ready to keep her with us. We waited for a week for the doctors to declare her out of danger. Now, the child welfare committee will take custody according to the norms. We are ready to follow all legalities to adopt her,” added Annu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-day-old-baby-dumped-in-drain-womans-prompt-action-saves-her/articleshow/79846358.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||WCL sees prospects of making methanol from coal||Nagpur: Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) is seeing prospects of generating methanol through surface coal gasification from one of its mines at Chandrapur. Methanol can be used as an alternative fuel. Though long way from commercial production, pre-feasibility report has indicated possibility of producing methanol through gasification of coal from the mine, said WCL’s chairman-cum-managing director (CMD), R R Mishra. WCL is a city-headquartered subsidiary of Coal India Ltd (CIL). He was talking to newspersons at a ‘meet the press’ programme organized by Nagpur Patrakar Club. Mishra is due for retirement on December 31. The present director (technical) of the company Manoj Kumar will be taking over as new CMD. Mishra said coal having ash content within a certain level can be gasified. The grade was found in Bhatadi mine located at Chandrapur. Syngas is the basic product that can be processed into fertilizer, methanol and even petrochemicals depending on the volume. Samples from the mine were sent to PSU Projects and Development India Ltd (PDIL) for testing. The pre-feasibility put up after the tests says that methanol can be generated. “Now as a next step, viability studies will have to be done. Only after it is confirmed, WCL may invite global tenders for methanol production. The company will be providing coal and land for the project,” he said. If it succeeds, it will lead to a major change in the area, Mishra said. Similar projects are happening in other CIL subsidiaries like Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) and Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) too. WCL has also overcome the Covid impact and registered a profit of Rs 234 crore in the second quarter as against loss in the quarter before, he said. The company has opened three new mines during the year with two more set to open by January, said Mishra. Mishra said there were plans to open five mines in each of the coming four years. This will entail a capital expenditure of Rs 13,000 crore which will come from internal accruals. WCL, which has been so far operating mines in Vidarbha and Madhya Pradesh, will be extending its ambit. The company has secured five blocks in the Raigarh district of Odisha and will be entering into a joint venture with the Odisha Mining Development Corporation (OMDC), state government body. The blocks will be operated as a single mine making it the largest opencast mine so far. The peak capacity of the Odisha blocks has been estimated at 75 million tonnes per annum, said Mishra. Among WCL’s new projects, the Badora mine at Chandrapur with an yearly capacity of 8 million tonnes may be the biggest underground mine, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wcl-sees-prospects-of-making-methanol-from-coal/articleshow/79846365.cms||Shishir Arya

The hard-hitting editorial said the CPM is trying to create a communal polarization which the Sangh Parivar failed to achieve in Kerala. “The statement that the IUML is taking control of the UDF and that the IUML will decide as to who will lead the Congress may make happy those sections which helped the CPM in the elections,” the editorial said. “The chief minister’s statement would surpass Kodiyeri’s remark that Amir, Hassan and Kunhalikutty are going to rule the state,” it said. Samastha said there are Muslims outside the IUML and attacking the community in the guise of taking on the IUML would pain the non-IUML sections too. The IUML is registered with the Election Commission as a secular and democratic party. “What is wrong in IUML coming to the leadership of the UDF,” it said, adding that by bringing in the names of Amir, Hassan, Kunhalikutty the CPM is dragging the entire community into the controversy. It went to the extent of insinuating that the accused in the case related to raising the Jai Sree Ram banner at Palakkad municipality are not arrested and the government is still keeping Raman Srivastava as adviser because of the pro-Sangh Parivar stand of the CPM. “The appeal by the CBI against acquitting Pinarayi Vijayan in the Lavalin case has been postponed 20 times. Sangh Parivar may get some help from the government till a final verdict is pronounced in the case,” Samastha said. The editorial alleged that the chief minister’s statement is aimed at drawing maximum benefit from the communal polarization happening in central Kerala. The editorial ends by asking the chief minister to drop the torch that leads light to the BJP in Kerala or else it will set the whole Kerala ablaze. Samastha has been taking a neutral stand towards the government though majority of its members are IUML workers. Political independence of the organization has been reasserted after Syed Muhammad Jiffri Muthukoya Thangal became the president. Samastha was against the IUML striking a deal with Jamaat-e-Islami.

December 22, 2020||Chennai||More medical graduates from abroad clear screening test||CHENNAI: Medical graduates from foreign universities have performed well in the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE), with 19.4% clearing the test conducted in December 2020. That’s 10% more than the previous test held in August. Candidates said the better pass percentage was due to easy question paper and increased awareness among the candidates. Of 19,122 candidates who appeared for the exam, 3,722 of them passed. Results of 1,271 candidates have been cancelled for failing to submit required documents. Students who earn medical degrees abroad need to clear the FMGE to practice in India. Following a single digit pass percentage (9.9%) in the last session, there was much expectation about the latest test. Keerthana Balasundaram from Coimbatore, who completed her MD (MBBS) in Crimea Federal University in Russia, cleared FMGE in the first attempt scoring 192 out of 300. “The first paper was very easy and the second paper had many clinical questions. Of 30 students from the college who appeared for the screening test from Tamil Nadu, 20 cleared this session,” she said. A tough syllabus and coaching in the university helped her to clear the test, she added. A Janani from Madukkur in Thanjavur district studied medicine at Xinjiang Medical University in China and cleared the test scoring 164. “The paper was easy compared to the previous session. There were more clinical questions last time,” she said. She is yet to receive her degree as a four-month internship is still pending. “I had to return to India in February due to Covid-19 pandemic. Whenever travel restrictions are eased, I will go back to China to complete the internship and get the degree.” Increased awareness of the test standards have helped some prepare better. S Sudesraj from Salem completed his MD in Kazan State Medical University in Russia and passed the exam with 169 marks. “The screening test covers only topics covered in the course. If students paid attention to their classes, it is easy to clear the test in the first try,” he said. Through the Covid-19 pandemic, he stayed in Russia to complete his degree. R Sureshkumar, managing director of Truematics Overseas Education Consultancy, Chennai, said only students with poor academic performance who have joined foreign medical universities struggle to clear FMGE. He added that most students who cleared the exams were from the current batch. “There is an increased awareness about the screening test among students and they start preparing for it while in college. In the coming years, students who studied abroad too will clear FMGE easily as clearing NEET is now mandatory for them too,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/more-med-graduates-from-abroad-clear-test/articleshow/79845189.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Nashik||Maharashtra farmers march to Delhi against new agri laws||NASHIK: Hundreds of farmers from various parts of the state joined their counterparts from Nashik district at the Eidgah Maidan in the city to march to Delhi in support of tillers from Punjab and Haryana who have been protesting against the new farm laws passed by Parliament in June. The farmers arrived from districts like Ahmednagar, Thane, Palghar, Solapur and Satara holding flags of All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS). They were to take a halt at Chandwad on Monday night, proceed to Dhule the following day and spend a night there. On Wednesday, the farmers will enter Madhya Pradesh. They hope to reach Delhi on December 24. Leaders including AIKS president Ashok Dhawale and secretary Ajit Nawale, former MLA Narasayya Adam, MP KK Ragesh and Jayant Patil of Shetkari Kamgar Paksha (Peasants and Workers Party of India) and demanded immediate repeal of the new laws and warned that the country would witness unprecedented events if the Centre failed to so. They alleged that the three laws — Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill — were in favour of industrialists and businessmen. “This fight of farmers is against the Union government that has taken an anti-farmer stand. In a democracy, the voice of people counts. If the government believes it can get away with anything, it should be ready to step down as the agitation will end only with repeal of the three laws and nothing less,” said Dhawale. Nawale said, “MSP should be announced for every agriculture produce, not foodgrain alone, based on the calculation of 1.5 times the input costs. If the Kerala government can fix MSP, why can’t other states and the central government do it?” he asked. Kisan Sabha state joint secretary Manik Awghade from Satara said. “One person from every house has joined the agitation. We have come from Satara. We are carrying rations that will be required on our way from Nashik to Delhi. We will not require anybody’s help for food as our brethren from other states on the way will also join and make arrangements for us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/hundreds-of-farmers-from-across-state-march-to-delhi-against-new-laws/articleshow/79844316.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The object in the sky was gas giant Jupiter, shining at its best, along with its celestial neighbour Saturn. The two planets, though millions of kilometres apart, seemed away from each other by a width of a hair. Hundreds of enthusiasts witnessed ‘the great conjunction’ of the two planets with their eyes and through telescope or binoculars. Dhananjay Raval, a city-based science communicator, said that over 150 persons participated in the viewing session. “It was a mass event in true sense with buzz about the event preceding it by days,” he said. Sakshi, a Nirma Vidyavihar student, who was part of the viewing session, said that it was a moment of lifetime and she wanted to witness it. “It takes us closer to the wonders of nature,” she said. Bhakti Shah, a resident of Ambawadi, said that her sister, an astronomy aficionado, had informed the family about the conjunction and thus they were prepared with the telescope. Raval said that the phenomenon will be visible for the next few days and those who could not witness it on Monday can still see it from 6.30pm to 8pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sky-gazers-marvel-at-the-great-conjunction/articleshow/79846468.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Aurangabad||Psychologist to address ‘stress’ among cops||Aurangabad: The city police have roped in a senior psychologist to address the underlying stress-related amongst police personnel aged 50 years or more. As a part of the initiative, a series of sessions would be held for cops in this age group. The initiative has been launched after the city police chief got to know of certain incidents of policemen suffering from stress. Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta said unaddressed stress can lead to depression and take a toll on professional and personal lives. “Our aim is to address this underlying issue, so that there is an improvement in the quality of life of our personnel,” said Gupta. To begin with, police personnel aged 50 years or more have been shortlisted for the “stress management” workshops. “People in the age group of 50 years and above are often worried about post-retirement life, their children’s future etc. These thoughts often add to their stress, said Dr Anagha Patil”, who has been roped in by the city police to addressing this concern. On Monday, she carried out several tests on a group of policemen. “The stress level among some policemen is very high. We made them identify stress through different symptoms and also the sources of stress and how to deal with them,” said Dr Patil. Those present at the workshop, which was even attended by Gupta himself, said learning about various techniques of stress management was a first for them. Those suffering from high stress have been advised to try imagery, self-talk, positive thinking apart from following other cognitive techniques.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/psychologist-to-address-stress-among-cops/articleshow/79844307.cms||Mohammed Akhef
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Miscreant attacks Koka RFO over entry to restricted road||Nagpur: Even as the dust is yet to settle over the attack on foresters in Bor Tiger Reserve (BTR), range forest officer (RFO) Sachin Jadhav of Koka wildlife sanctuary in Bhandara district was attacked by a miscreant on Sunday night. The Kardha police station has registered an FIR against one Rahul Chourasia, who had stayed beyond the restricted timing on Koka sanctuary road, and wanted to move out towards Bhandara during the night. Being a wildlife zone, Bhandara district collector had in December 2019 restricted entry to outsiders on three roads — Sakoli-Tumsar state highway, Bhandara-Kardi via Paladi, and Bhandara-Kardi via Saleheti. However, emergency vehicles and locals are exempted from this restriction. As all these roads pass through the sanctuary compartments, there is entry and exit restriction between 6pm and 6am. “Accused Chourasia had entered the area at 3pm and after having drinks and dinner at a dhaba set up by locals, wanted to move out at 6.45pm,” said Jadhav. As the forest staff at the Chandrapur protection chowky stopped Chourasia, he was angry. At the same time, a four-wheeler of a local Amar Waghade arrived from Bhandara and was allowed inside. This made Chourasia furious and he attacked Amar and also abused the forest staff. When Jadhav learnt about the fight he came out to intervene but was also assaulted by the accused. Seeing tempers running high, Chourasia fled from the spot taking a U-turn. The RFO filed a police complaint on the basis of which an FIR was registered against Chourasia. This is the second attack on foresters in the last five days. On December 16, Bor RFO Nilesh Gawande and forest guard Premdas Bhakre were attacked by eight rowdy tourists. Wardha police have failed to nab the main accused. The two accused who have been arrested actually surrendered on police request. The Forest Rangers Association, Maharashtra, has condemned frequent attacks on foresters and demanded immediate arrest of the culprits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/miscreant-attacks-koka-rfo-over-entry-to-restricted-road/articleshow/79846383.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
December 22, 2020||Surat||Three accused of copying textile design get anticipatory bail||Surat: It’s unreasonable that just within two days, a new design awaiting official registration is copied, goods are made using it and they are even sold in the market, a local court wondered while allowing anticipatory bail to three people accused of copying the property mark.The additional sessions court in the city was hearing the bail plea of the trio against whom a textile unit owner lodged a complaint of cheating and counterfeiting his design.

Garg’s company makes saris and dress material.The accused were booked under IPC sections 485 (making or possession of any instrument for counterfeiting a property mark), 486 (selling goods marked with a counterfeit property mark) and sections 20 and 22 of Design Act 2000, on November 28. “How within two days of the application for the registration for new design of textile goods, other people copied it, started production of the textile goods using this new design and sold them in the market? Prima facie it is unreasonable,” the court observed.KS Panwala, the advocate for the three, submitted, "Garg's firm had applied for registration of its new design on November 23, and to copy the same design within two days, manufacturing the same products and same goods that came into market for sale is just not possible under any circumstances.”Moreover, the design has not been registered yet and Garg has no legal right on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/three-accused-of-copying-textile-design-get-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/79845231.cms||Vijaysinh Parmar

December 22, 2020||Chennai||Anti-graft NGO lists out poll promises for parties to adopt||Chennai: Better implementation of the RTI Act, making all tenders completely electronic, ensuring agencies such as DVAC are independent, and strengthening ward and area sabhas should among top agendas of political parties for the 2021 assembly elections, city-based anti-corruption NGO has demanded. Arappor Iyakkam, which has been at the forefront of civic issues and exposed many scams in governance, on Monday released an ‘anti-corruption election manifesto’, which they said would be taken to all political parties so they can promise people and deliver them once elected. The NGO’s convenor Jayaram Venkatesan said instances worldwide have shown that there were three fundamental ways to curb corruption — transparency and accountability in governance, independence to institutions probing corruption, and ensuring people’s participation in governance. “We have recommended various measures in the manifesto ensuring these three principles,” he said. Among the promises, to ensure transparency and accountability, the parties should disclose public records on their websites under section 4 of the Right To Information Act, implement online RTI services and improve performance of the information commission, Arappor said. The Tamil Nadu Tender Transparency Act should be amended to ensure all tenders are electronic eliminating all physical points of contact and to define, prohibit and penalise collusive bidding, bid rigging, fraudulent bids and conflicts of interest, Arappor said. Arappor also suggested having a Right to Services Act for ensuring time-bound commitment to citizen services and an independent appellate authority to monitor, address grievances and penalise violating public servants. Political players should also promise action involving granite, illegal beach sand mining and illegal sand mining scams in Tamil Nadu, Arappor stated. Another assurance sought was that vacancies in agencies such as DVAC should be filled to ensure their smooth functioning, while Tamil Nadu Lokayukta Act and Tamil Nadu Local Bodies Ombudsman Act are amended to make them independent and strong. The parties should also promise to implement ward and area sabha as per the 2010 amendment to Urban Local Bodies Act to strengthen the powerful democratic structures. Further, all drafts and Acts should be placed before members of the public for consultation before passing it in the assembly, Arappor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/anti-graft-ngo-lists-out-poll-promises-for-parties-to-adopt/articleshow/79845222.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Youth Cong says Khau-Galli a scam||Nagpur: The All India Youth Congress on Monday staged a demonstration at Khau Galli, the first dedicated food street of the city created by NMC at the Gandhisagar Lake area. According to Youth Congress activists, the Khau-Galli project of BJP was supposed to provide employment and curb the anti-social elements in the area. “But it remained non-starter even after four years and spending Rs 25 crore and is nothing but a scam,” alleged Youth Congress secretary Sagar Chavan during the demonstration. Shouting anti-BJP slogans, YC office-bearers wondered how Gadkari could inaugurate the facility without NMC providing basic amenities. Even a year later, NMC is yet to provide basic amenities required for eating joint owners depriving them of their earnings. The activists also demanded a high-level inquiry into corruption of crores of rupees spent in creating Khau Galli and demanded action against those found guilty in carrying out substandard work. Due to shoddy works, tiles have been damaged. NMC should immediately carry out the repair works and provide amenities like drainage, drinking water and toilet at the site, they said. TOI too had recently reported that NMC’s apathy in providing essential amenities has left ‘Khau Galli’ a non-starter. YC city general secretary Nayan Tarwatkar and central Nagpur president Swapnil Dhoke were among those present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/youth-cong-says-khau-galli-a-scam/articleshow/79846493.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Jaipur||Raj govt offers tax sops to woo film industry||Jaipur: From rolling deserts to scenic landscapes, living traditions to colourful cultural heritage, Rajasthan offers many frames to filmmakers. But to make it a compelling locale, the tourism department is working on a slew of sweeteners and facilities to woo the film industry. While, in the recently launched tourism policy, the department offered customised packages under Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme-2019 to any investor who wants develop a film city in the state, it now wants to create a new website to facilitate all clearances and approvals for film shooting under one roof. “To facilitate film productions in the state, we are developing an online portal to give permissions for film shooting. The portal, which will be launched very soon, would connect all related departments like archaeology and museums, forest, local self-government and all districts of the state for speedy disposal of applications,” said Alok Gupta, principal secretary, at a PHDCCI-Rajasthan event. Similarly, Gupta said, Rajasthan Film Tourism Incentive Scheme is being formulated with up to 15% subsidy of the total production cost of any film shot in Rajasthan. “This would ensure exemptions of all fees and charges for film shooting at the monuments under the administrative control of the state government,” explained Gupta. To incentivize film shootings in the state, the regulations were amended in June 2016 by waiving off application fee and all types of security deposits. Film shooting permissions are now granted under single window clearance system in a time-bound manner. In the last four years, the department has issued 93 permissions for shootings. Digvijay Dhabriya, chairman of PHDCCI-Rajasthan, said the talk of setting up a film city in Rajasthan has been there for the past 20 years. “Time has come to act now. A film city in Rajasthan is the missing link. We need to have it to tap vast potential the segment offers. It will boost tourism and generate large-scale economic activities in the state,” said Dhabriya. Gupta also said that one of the priorities of the department now is to create awareness about lesser known destinations, promote new locations and make an inclusive digital database, which would also cater as one-stop solution for filmmakers and line producers both. “The ultimate goal is to provide a seamless experience to the filmmakers. The department intends to simplify and encourage filming in the state, promote the setting up of film-based theme park or film city like concepts, such as Universal Studios, Disney etc,” added Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-govt-offers-tax-sops-to-woo-film-industry/articleshow/79846394.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
December 22, 2020||Goa||Kamat: Loss at zilla election collective responsibility||Margao: After senior congress leader and Lok Sabha member Francisco Sardinha blamed local party leadership for the party’s defeat in the Zilla Panchayat elections, former chief minister and leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said that it is the “collective responsibility of all to accept victory and defeat”. He said that “Congress leadership collectively owns responsibility for the results of the ZP polls”. “I am sitting with the winner as well as the losers of the Zilla Panchayat Elections from North Goa. Our candidates will continue to be the voice of the people and we all are committed to protect the identity of Goa. The people of Goa should not get influenced with the divisive politics of BJP in association with their A, B and C teams and allies,” he said. Congress has accepted the election results as “motivation” to reach out to the people of Goa more aggressively. “We have accepted the results of the recently concluded Zilla Panchayat elections with humility and we will work hard to ensure that we regain the confidence of Goans,” Kamat said. He was addressing reporters via a video telecast at the Congress house in Panaji where Congress general secretary Amarnath Panjikar and North Goa district Congress president Vijay Bhike were also present.

The NGO, which works in the field of education, has already set up around 20 taps at one of the schools in Kamatwade area of the city. Students will not have to touch the taps with their hands and will be able to operate them with their elbows. “Such taps will help prevent the spread of Covid-19 as the students will operate the taps with their elbow,” said Vijay Pawar, an official from the NGO. He said, “We have already identified 20 schools, which will be provided with elbow-operated taps. We have already given demonstrations to these schools about its usages.” “Initially, we set up such taps at one of the NMC schools. We will set up taps at other municipal schools around a week before the schools reopen. Around 20 taps will be installed at each of the 20 schools,” said Pawar. When contacted, Chhaya Sonawane, the principal of the Kamatwade school, said, “This NGO has taken an initiative and set up elbow-operated taps at its own cost at our school. This is helpful for the students especially at a time when we are living through a pandemic.” NMC has 90 schools across its six divisions in the city with a total 27,587 students, including 13,277 boys and 14,310 girls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/20-nmc-schools-to-get-elbow-operated-taps/articleshow/79844415.cms||Tushar Pawar

December 22, 2020||Aurangabad||Beed zilla parishad employee gets HC relief||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, in a rare exercise of its inherent powers “in the interest of justice”, has quashed and set aside a November 30, 2018 order by Aurangabad’s then additional divisional commissioner that dismissed a Beed zilla parishad (ZP) employee’s appeal against his reversion as a peon (a group D post) in November 2015, after putting in two years of service as a Cluster Head (a group C post). In a ruling on December 16, the bench of justice Mangesh Patil found no fault with the reversion order in the wake of a government resolution (GR) of August 23, 1996, but “considering peculiar facts and circumstances” of the case, directed the Beed ZP chief executive officer to accommodate petitioner Bhalchandra Kulkarni — a person with disability — as Cluster Head or on an equivalent post. In 2004, the Beed ZP appointed Kulkarni, who then held a BA degree, as peon on compassionate grounds. Kulkarni later went on to complete his B.Ed and M.Ed and staked his claim for a group C post. The ZP appointed him as Cluster Head on October 25, 2013 following an HC directive to consider his representation. However, in September 2015 the ZP initiated the process for reverting Kulkarni to the group D post, citing the August 23, 1996 government resolution (GR) which mandates absorption of a person to group C post only in the case where such a person had the requisite qualification i.e. a B.Ed degree at the time of his appointment to group D post on compassionate grounds. Kulkarni held a BA degree when he was appointed on compassionate grounds in 2004. On November 24, 2015, the ZP cancelled his group C appointment as contrary to the GR and reverted him to the peon’s post. Kulkarni then moved an appeal in a quasi-judicial proceeding before the additional divisional commissioner of Aurangabad. The latter dismissed his appeal on November 30, 2018 and Kulkarni’s lawyer S D Tawshikar then filed a writ petition in the HC. Justice Patil said there was no dispute that the petitioner, possessing a BA qualification at the time of his initial appointment on compassionate grounds to a group D post, was not eligible for a group C post. Also, there was no dispute about the petitioner having completed his B.Ed and M.Ed degrees and about the provisions of the GR of August 23, 1996. As such, the petitioner’s case was not covered by the GR. The bench said, “True it is that appointment to a public office to a public office would depend upon the qualification possessed. The petitioner having been appointed on a compassionate ground which, as description suggests, is a concession and not a right, once having been appointed, he is justified in having a legitimate expectation that his case to the higher post is considered in due course.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-zilla-parishad-employee-gets-hc-relief/articleshow/79844345.cms||Mohammed Akhef

While he drowned on Sunday night, his body was retrieved on Monday morning. The deceased was identified as 15-year-old Vishwas Gurjar. “The teenager had gone to the Sambar salt lake area for grazing his cattle when he accidentally stepped into wet mud. He slipped into the pit which was full of water and had been dug by the villagers.

We do not even think that it was a case of suicide. We conducted the search operation the whole night, but no one could have survived falling into the water in this weather and surviving. It appears that he did not know to swim well, but even if he did chances of survival are slim.” The body was handed over to the victim’s family after post-mortem. 2 kids drown in water tank in Pokhran Jaisalmer: Two children of a family drowned in a water tank at Selvi village in Pokhran area of Jaisalmer district on Sunday evening. Police reached the spot and handed over the bodies after necessary action. The incident occurred during a wedding programme.

Tatkare got a demo ticket and she took the first boat ride here, said Jagdish Chavan, the regional manager of Maharashtra State Tourism Development Corporation’s (MTDC) Nashik division. “We have started online bookings for the boat rides, which range from Rs 200 to Rs 1,000 each across various categories. The boat rides will be operational between 10 am and 6 pm daily,” said Chavan. “In the first phase, 11 boats will be operational, while more boats will be deployed on the backwater of the Gangapur dam,” he said. Chavan said Tatkare held a review meeting of all the ongoing projects in the divisions. The boat club project is the brainchild of district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal and it was brought to effect by him during his earlier stint between 2009 and 2014. The MTDC had purchased the boats at that time. The project, however, could not see the light of the day as a section of nature lovers objected to it and thereafter BJP came to power in the state. After Bhujbal became the guardian minister again, he promised that opening the boat club would be among his top priorities. Tatkare told the media that the district has great potential for religious tourism and the government is taking efforts to promote the same along with providing facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/boat-rides-on-gangapur-dam-backwaters-begin-today/articleshow/79844463.cms||Tushar Pawar

December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Singed by ‘first UK strain’, Kolkata wary of 2nd transmission||KOLKATA: The state government is keeping a close watch on the emergence of the new strain of coronavirus that has put London under lockdown yet again. Sources in the health department indicated that experts will meet at Swasthya Bhawan on Tuesday to guide the state in its precautionary measures against the new strain. A good number of students from Kolkata studies in the UK. And around this time, most tend to travel back home. In fact, the first confirmed Covid-19 case in Bengal was a UK-returned student. The second and third cases, too, were students who flew back from the UK. “What we know so far is that this new strain is more infectious than the current one. We do not know yet about how differently it affects patients clinically. The new strain was expected,” said infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray of Beliaghata ID Hospital. An earlier study conducted jointly by the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics Kalyani, ICMR-NICED Kolkata and Bangalore-based Indian Institute of Science had found that most nCov strain found in Bengal was a mutated sub-type found in Europe. Experts believe that this new virus is 70% more infectious that other strains of coronavirus. “Even as we know that this new strain is more infectious, its virulence vis-à-vis the existing variant has not been confirmed. So we need to take all possible guards,” said Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor at the Institute of Child Health. “There is a reason to be concerned but no need to press the panic button at this point of time. Initiatives like banning of flights from the UK is highly recommended. We have to give stress on more stringent quarantine policy even for those who come from other countries,” said public health expert Anirban Dalui. Another concern is whether those already infected by the existing strain are vulnerable to infection by the new strain. “The mutant variant is spreading fast, rapidly replacing the existing strain. The viral genome is getting mutated and mutants have increased ability to transmit. Though it is not yet known if the mutant is new, there could also be cases of re-infection,” said infectious diseases control specialist Debkishore Gupta. Both Ray and Gupta questioned if the vaccines that were being developed could have the kind of expected efficacy if this new strain replaces the existing one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/singed-by-first-uk-strain-kol-wary-of-2nd-transmission/articleshow/79845343.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
December 22, 2020||Nashik||Yeola taluka tops chart in use of micro-irrigation||Nashik: Farmers in Yeola taluka in Nashik district top the chart in the extensive use of micro-irrigation processes for crops such as onion, groundnut followed by Niphad taluka where the same processes are used for growing grapes. According to superintendent of agriculture A G Padwal, “While sprinklers are in demand in Yeola taluka, the drip irrigation facility is sought after in Niphad taluka.” A review meeting of the irrigation facilities was conducted on Monday that was chaired by additional collector Dattaprasad Nade. There has been a demand for the micro-irrigation facilities from 17,157 farmers in the district. While micro-irrigation units have been sanctioned for 10,530 farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), subsidy has been paid to 8,156 farmers so far. The demand for the micro-irrigation systems was highest in Yeola taluka where 4,197 farmers had applied for sprinklers and drip while 2,405 farmers applied for the same facilities from Niphad taluka. With regard to the farmers who have received the subsidies for setting up the micro-irrigation facilities, 1,655 farmers in Yeola taluka have received the subsidy for sprinklers while 325 have used the same for setting up the infrastructure for drip irrigation. “The drip is used for onion while the sprinklers are used for soyabean, onion and other rabi crops in the parched regions of the taluka,” said an officer from the agriculture department. In Niphad taluka, around 1,201 farmers received the subsidy for drip while 66 have used the subsidy for setting up sprinklers. A majority of the farmers in Niphad taluka are into grape cultivation and few in the remote areas produce onions. There has been quite a demand for the micro-irrigation facilities in Baglan, Chandwad, Dindori, Sinnar and other talukas. The demand is very low in Surgana, Peth, Trimbakeshwar, which are in the hilly areas where mainly paddy is cultivated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/yeola-taluka-tops-chart-in-use-of-micro-irrigation/articleshow/79844435.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Utility projects under FRA to need wildlife nod in PAs||Nagpur: The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has made it clear to the tribal ministry that wildlife clearance would be mandatory for public utility projects inside sanctuaries and national parks though Scheduled Tribes & Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights Act) 2006 provides diversion of land for such activities. As per the definition of forest land given under the FRA, 2006, it is clear that Section 3(2) of the Act is applicable in sanctuaries and national parks. Under this Section, certain utilities are exempted under the Forest Conservation Act (FCA), 1980. These utilities include school, hospitals, dispensaries, anganwadi, fair price shops, electric and telecommunication lines, tanks and water bodies, drinking water supply, minor irrigation canals, non-conventional energy resources, roads, skill upgradation, vocational training, and community centres. Coming clear on a clarification sought by the tribal ministry, the MoEFCC has said for the above projects, provisions of Wildlife Protection Act (WPA) 1972 will be applicable. The ministry has further clarified that provisions of WPA will not be affected by Section 3(2) of FRA 2006 under Section 13. Section 13 of FRA 2006 says, “If any other law is in force in the said areas, it will be in addition to it and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force.” Therefore, provisions of WPA 1972 will not be affected by Section 3 (2) of FRA 2006 as opined by the MoEFCC. Maharashtra state wildlife board (SWBL) member Kishor Rithe said, “This clarification from DIG forests (wildlife) will definitely help in stopping further violations inside protected areas (PAs). There are instances recorded in some sanctuaries and national parks where infrastructure development like roads and bridges has been taken place without wildlife clearance under the garb of FRA, 2006. Now, as the MoEFCC has cleared the stand, offences must be registered against the violators.” Environment protection lawyer Manish Jeswani welcomed MoEFCC clarification. “If WPA provisions are not implied then there may be more chances of huge encroachments in protected areas, which may certainly increase man-animal conflict and poaching. It will also affect important wildlife corridors and lead to disforestation under the garb of public utilities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/utility-projects-under-fra-to-need-wildlife-nod-in-pas/articleshow/79846507.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Christmas plans hit turbulence||Kolkata: The outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in south England has forced the Bengali community residing there to suspend the much-anticipated get-together plans during the Christmas-New Year break. Also, many NRIs from Kolkata who had travelled to the city to catch up with family are now stranded here while those who were visiting the UK are unsure when they will be able to return. Roshni Mukherjee, a bank executive in the UK, was finishing Christmas shopping at a mall in Kent when the public announcement on complete lockdown was made. “It was a manic situation, desperate shoppers crammed into the shopping centre to grab last-minute presents and supplies. All our plans for the Christmas weekend were cancelled,” she recounted. The UK recorded close to 36,000 cases on Sunday, the highest ever daily rise since March. Ranadip Chatterjee, an engineer at Google, UK, who lives in Redbridge that is right at the epicentre of the fresh outbreak, said the London winter that is usually dark and wet has become even more depressing. “I was hoping to get back to the office after 10 months at home. Christmas week was expected to be more relaxed. The new strain has changed all that overnight,” said Chatterjee. Since the news about the new strain hit global headlines, it has triggered anxiety and concern among relatives in Kolkata. Chatterjee’s parents in Kaikhali have called him multiple times since Sunday. Shankha Narayan Biswas, a bank manager based in East London’s Barking, too, has received anxious calls from parents in Hooghly. “I have tried to assure them that all is fine. But the situation here is grim,” he said. IT professional Eklabya Ghosh, who lives in London, wanted to travel to Kolkata to be with his parents in Tollygunge, but had to postpone the trip that has been long overdue. On the other hand, Dibyendu Pal, who flew down to Kolkata with his wife to visit his parents and attend to his ailing in-laws, is now stranded here till flights resume. “Thankfully, I had come prepared to work from home. However, I don’t know if I will be allowed to work from India due to security concerns,” the software engineer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/christmas-plans-hit-turbulence/articleshow/79845356.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Ludhiana||Finance & contracts committee okays nearly 200 development projects||Ludhiana: The members of finance and contracts committee conducted a meeting on Monday evenin and discussed 200 of the 495 resolutions tabled. Rest of the resolutions will be tabled in the next meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Of the 200 discussed, most were given nod, as these were associated with general development works. However, in the meeting it was brought to notice that despite fixation of councillor quota for the outer and inner wards, some of the councillors had put up development works so those works which were beyond limit were held back. For the last few months, the opposition councillors are raising hue and cry over approval to the development works despite fixation of councillor quota. For inner wards, it is Rs 1 crore and for outer wards it is Rs 1.5 crore and opposition councillors have been alleging that ruling party councillors were getting approvals for development beyond their fixed quota, while in their wards works were not taking place. Senior deputy mayor Shyam Sunder Malhotra said most of the resolutions were given nod as these were related with various development works. He said some of the proposals were kept pending as these were related to wards where development works took place as per their fixed quota. He said they have asked the MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal to renovate the zone A building and get the lift, which is s pending demand for a long time, installed in the building. He said people who come to the MC office find it difficult to climb the stairs, especially the senior citizens or physically disabled. Malhotra assured that in the coming days, this will be taken up on priority. He said even in zone B building lift has been proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/finance-contracts-committee-okays-nearly-200-development-projects/articleshow/79846508.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
December 22, 2020||Goa||Nearly 800 years later, Jupiter and Saturn catch up for celestial rendezvous||PANAJI: On December 21, astronomically, the first day of winter this year, the two gas giants in the solar system Jupiter and Saturn put up a spectacular display in the evening sky. They were so close that they appeared, from our perspective, to overlap completely, creating a never before seen by human eyes “double planet” effect. This celestial synchronization, also referred to as the “Christmas Star,” has not occurred in nearly 800 years. Last time they were observed so close together was on March 4, 1226. Astronomers call the moment of overtaking Great Conjunction. “The spectacle is an effect of Jupiter and Saturn’s orbits around the Sun. Since Jupiter takes 11.9 years to circle the Sun and Saturn 29.5 years, the faster moving Jupiter catches up with the slower moving Saturn and overtakes it roughly every 20 years,” president of the association of the friends of astronomy, Satish Nayak said. After sunset on Monday, Jupiter and Saturn appeared as a single bright object low in the southwestern sky. This dazzling display of two celestial objects touching each other on the longest night of the year was seen from Goa and other parts of the world. Great conjunctions are rare though because often, Earth is not aligned along a straight line with Saturn and Jupiter when they are at conjunction. The duo will then appear to be separated by a fewer more degrees. Furthermore, the event can happen while the Sun is up blocking the conjunction from view. Indeed, during the last great conjunction on May 31, 2000, the planets never came anywhere as close together as they did on Monday. People who missed the spectacle this year, will not see it in 2040 or 2060. The next great conjunction, with a separation of about 0.2 degree, will occur on March 15, 2080. After that, it will be 2417 and 2477.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nearly-800-years-later-jupiter-and-saturn-catch-up-for-celestial-rendezvous/articleshow/79846510.cms||Nida Sayed
December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Telangana races to meet 10 lakh/day vaccine shot target||HYDERABAD: With the Union health ministry indicating that the Covid-19 vaccination programme will be unfurled from next month, Telangana is gearing up to inoculate 10 lakh people per day. So far, 2.87 lakh healthcare personnel out of three lakh have registered themselves on coWin software. To start with, Telangana would vaccinate one lakh people per day and would ramp it up to 10 lakh. But the registration process for vulnerable persons is expected to begin only in the second week of January. “We have set up an effective system in place with storage and cold chains. The vaccine will reach the primary health centres (PHC) as well. Two vaccine doses will be given in a four-week period,” said Dr Srinivas Rao, director, health department. The government is setting up 10,000 vaccination centres all over the state. The vaccination for healthcare and frontline warriors is expected to be completed within three days. People would be required to submit an identity card apart from Aadhaar (due to court ruling) to get registered. PAN card, driving license, employee identity card, voter ID are likely to be accepted. To gather the data of people above 50 years of age, the government is planning to rely on the voters list. Meanwhile, people have to go through a questionnaire to establish their credentials. After healthcare staff, people with comorbidities and those over 50 years will be inoculated. This process is expected to be completed within three to four months. “Between the two doses, people have to follow several guidelines by medical authorities,” an official said. Apart from health department, women and child welfare, revenue, rural development, municipal administration and urban development program will be roped in for this massive exercise. Indian Medical Association (IMA) will pursue this issue with private hospitals. While the World Health Organization will give technical assistance, United Nations Development Fund offers logistical support.  It is learnt that some private hospitals refused to participate in this programme. Sources said that nearly 100 private hospitals declined to divulge information about their medical staff. Government authorities denied these reports and said that the process of registration of private health staff is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-to-inoculate-10-lakh-people-per-day/articleshow/79846512.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
December 22, 2020||India||Leopards grow from 8000 to 13000 in just four years||NEW DELHI: The leopard population in India recorded an encouraging increase of 62% in four years – from 7,910 in 2014 to 12,852 in 2018 -- according to the latest estimates of the big cat numbers released on Monday. Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of leopards (3,421), followed by Karnataka (1,783) and Maharashtra (1,690). These three states together account for more than 50% of leopards in the country’s tiger habitats which serve as a common ecosystem for different species of wild animals. The numbers have increased despite leopards often falling victim to human-animal conflict as they stray into human habitations or even become road-kills. “Increase in tiger, lion and leopard population over the last few years is a testimony to conservation efforts and of the fledgling wildlife and biodiversity of the country,” said Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar while releasing the ‘Status of Leopards in India, 2018’ report. The increase in big cat numbers over the past decade and a half indicates their resilience and ability to bounce back if provided secure environs. Though leopards are also found in non-forested habitats (coffee and tea plantations), higher elevations in the Himalayas, arid landscapes and most northeast states, the enumeration was done by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in association with state forest departments only in tiger habitats as the big cat serves as an umbrella species for other wild species like leopard in protected areas. Since non-forested habitats are not taken into account for the enumeration, the population estimation can be considered as minimum number of leopards in each of the landscapes. Estimates show that leopards have occupied nearly 1.86 lakh sq km of forest area in the country. The population estimate of leopards was done in three steps – walking in the forests looking for animal signs and prey species; using satellite data for habitat features and human influence and camera traps to capture leopard pictures. The camera traps were placed at 26,838 locations spread across 141 sites for mark recapture analysis. A total of 51,337 leopard photographs were obtained from camera traps, resulting in photo-capturing of 5,298 individuals including 825 adult and sub-adult animals. An artificial intelligence (AI) based image processing tool was used to automatically geo-tag and segregate the camera trap images into species.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/leopards-grow-from-8000-to-13000-in-just-four-years/articleshow/79848414.cms||Vishwa Mohan
December 22, 2020||Nashik||Father among 3 held for killing alcohol addict son||Nashik: A man, along with his two sons, from Yeola taluka was arrested on Sunday for allegedly killing his 19-year-old son three months ago. The arrested accused have been identified as Somnath Asaram Varhe (50), his two sons Bhimraj (24) and Kiran (20) — all residents of Nagarsul in Yeola taluka. The trio have been remanded in police custody till December 26. Anil Bhavari, inspector at Yeola taluka police station, said an unidentified person recently sent them a letter stating Amol Varhe was missing from his residence at Nagarsul in Yeola taluka since the last three to four months. The anonymous person also stated that he suspected Amol was killed by his father, brothers and his relatives and his body was buried at Lohshingve village. Bhavari said that the information was brought to the notice of superintendent of Nashik rural police Sachin Patil and additional SP Chandrakant Khandvi, following which the Yeola taluka police took up the case. During the course of the investigation, police verified the information and also inquired from Amol’s friends, who told them they last seen him on August 30. Police then detained Amol’s father and his two brothers and interrogated them separately and found that they were giving vague answers. When grilled further, they told police that on the night of August 30, they had choked Amol to death with the help of a rope after which they tied a stone to his body and dumped it in the river at Malegaon in Kopargaon taluka. According to Somnath, Amol used to drink excessively and would often beat up his parents. On August 30, he beat his parents under the influence of alcohol following which he was murdered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/father-among-3-held-for-killing-alcohol-addict-son/articleshow/79844469.cms||Santosh Sonawane
December 22, 2020||Goa||Union mantri assures thrust for tourism, commerce in Goa||Panaji/Vasco: Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale said on Monday the Centre would provide all assistance to the state government to boost tourism in Goa. Athawale said that CM Pramod Sawant has assured him that reservation would be given to persons belonging to SC who converted to Buddhism. Athawale said the Centre passed a law in 1991 under which those from SC who changed their religion are entitled to reservations. He added that Sawant assured him that a bill in this regard would be brought up in the next assembly session. Athawale promised a scheme under which Goa can construct old-age homes, hostels, and an Ambedkar bhavan. Sawant, too, said that an Ambedkar bhavan would come up in the state. Sawant has agreed to give 5,000 sqm ofland to build it, Athawale said He also said that there’s a need to get more industries in the state so that youth get employment. “We will support the state government to get industries in the state,” he said. “I will speak to industrialists in Mumbai to get industries to Goa.” Athawale said that regional parties can join the NDA, but even if they don’t, his government “will continue at the Centre” and in 2024, too, NDA will win. He said that the people are disillusioned by Congress. On West Bengal, the minister said that BJP would form the next government, and win over 200 of the 294 seats. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is getting agitated,” he said. He said that his party, the Republican Party of India, would join forces with BJP in Bengal and ask for four seats. Commenting on the farmers’ protests, Athawale said that their emands are “unwanted”, and that the agitation is turning political. “Farmers should agree with the government’s compromise formula, and the government wouldn’t take the bills back,” he said.  Speaking on the Maharashtra government, Athawale said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should have not formed the government. “This government has completed one year, but it will be difficult for them to run the government in its second year,” he said. “We will not topple the government, but if the government falls, we will try to form the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/union-mantri-assures-thrust-for-tourism-commerce-in-goa/articleshow/79846521.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Wings clipped just when things started looking up||KOLKATA: When Air India flight AI 1149 took off for Heathrow from Kolkata airport on Sunday morning, few had realized the Dreamliner aircraft that helped realize the dream of a direct London flight would not return next Sunday. Or the following Sunday. However, health officials attending to the UK flight on Sunday were wary about reports of a different strain of the virus surfacing in the UK. When two of the 25 passengers who underwent Covid-19 test on arrival reported positive, it sparked fears of the new strain entering India. Of the 1,488 passengers who have arrived on the flight since October 22, when the test-on-arrival facility was introduced at Kolkata airport, 342 got themselves tested for Covid on arrival. Of them, six tested positive, including the two who arrived on Sunday. When the civil aviation ministry announced the ban on flights originating from the UK to India on Monday afternoon, health officials here were relieved. But it left flyers and the travel trade community who have been calling for a direct flight to Europe for a decade distraught. When the twice-a-week flight between London and Kolkata was announced in August, it was one hugely positive development amidst the Covid gloom. Though the flight didn’t perform well initially and drew very poor loads, primarily due to difficulties in getting the RT-PCR test done in the UK, once tests-on-arrival were introduced at Kolkata airport, the load increased. “In the past couple of weeks, the incoming flights have been full with NRIs and students arriving to spend the winter with family in Kolkata. Post Christmas, even the London-bound flights were getting filled to capacity. Some of us were even thinking of requesting the reinstatement of the second flight. Hence, the timing of the flight suspension is really unfortunate,” an Air India official said. While the flight has been suspended till the end of the month for now, sources said the embargo would be extended and continued till the rest of Europe restored flight connections with the UK. Among those held up in the UK is Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. “The main problem is in the port area in south England. This belt and London is in tier IV category with strict lockdown,” said Soni. The flight may not return If the flight remains suspended for long, felt Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. And that would be the end of the direct connection to Europe that had happened after eight years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wings-clipped-just-when-things-started-looking-up/articleshow/79845367.cms||Subhro Niyogi
December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Tight security at vaccination centres in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Right from identifying and setting up Covid vaccination sites in the state and ensuring that there is no theft of the vaccine, heavy police deployment has been planned. Cops will be responsible for security and maintaining law and order at the cold chain points, during transportation of the vaccine and at the vaccine sites. This is part of the microplan laid down by the district task force for the roll-out of the vaccine. As per the plan, government health facilities, private health facilities having more than 100 healthcare staff, schools, community halls, gram panchayat and municipality buildings will be vaccination sites for the rollout of the Covid vaccine in the state. The district task force has laid stress on the need for having a stringent vigilance mechanism. “State and District administrations need to ensure adequate safety and security arrangements for the vaccines at the following sites — all cold chain points, during vaccine transport at all levels, at session sites. Stringent vigilance mechanism to be in place to prevent pilferage and theft. Any such activity to be immediately officially reported and prompt action initiated with clear accountability,” the plan document says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tight-security-at-vaccination-centres-in-state/articleshow/79846516.cms||Amrita Didyala

In a PIL filed on Monday though advocate K R Koshti, the Ahmedabad Railway Station Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union has demanded the authorities should allow them to enter the railway station premise the way the vehicles of Ahmedabad Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) and private cabs are allowed in the parking area and at pick-up points. “The railway authorities as well as the police authorities are allowing the buses of BRTS and private taxis like OLA, Uber etc., but not permitting the auto rickshaws drivers is violative of Article 14 Constitution of India,” the PIL reads. The PIL said that the city of Ahmedabad has more than 2 lakh autos and there is insufficient space for parking. The authorities promised to allocate parking slots and pick-up points for autos during the proceedings of a PIL in the high court. Accordingly, only 45 such pick-up points were allotted in the city. There is no parking space for autos and they are not allowed to enter the railway station premise and this has made earning a bit more difficult for the drivers, who are already reeling from the pressure of Covid-19 pandemic and measures like the night curfew as initiated by the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/autorickshaw-drivers-move-hc-for-rly-station-entry/articleshow/79846536.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Pune||Senior citizens queue up for life certificate work||Pune: The failure of an easy Aadhaar-based authentication and the lack of dedicated staff in banks to attend to pensioners have intensified their ordeal as they wait in long queues at banks to generate the life certificate to receive their pensions.During the pandemic, the Union government guidelines advise that senior citizens must not venture out. The promise of a seamless digital experience for the life certificates has proved to be a myth as pensioners are unable to operate these services to ensure continuity of their pension.Many complained that they have to pack meals and wait for long hours for verification.“We hope the government and all agencies involved will make a note of these hassles and address them so that senior citizens need not step out during this pandemic,” 67-year-old A Natrajan said. He has made several rounds to his bank as his online form submission was rejected because his finger prints did not match. Age factors are responsible for this mismatch.There are online and offline solutions for the submission of life certificate, but pensioners said there are practical hurdles in both. This year, the postal department launched a doorstep delivery service for a digital life certificate which can be submitted till February 2021. A postman can visit with an Aadhaar-based biometric fingerprint scanner to complete the process.However, if that does not match, the entire process is pointless, says B Kurup, a senior citizen who went with his wife and submitted the details to the bank to avoid any glitches. An 80-year-old senior citizen had to depend on her son to ensure that the family pension is renewed through the bank officials as her Aadhaar details did not match. Her son told TOI that senior citizens are in a pitiable state when it comes to technology and there should be a more simplified process to ensure that their pension process is streamlined.“I decided to go digital this year. Even then, I had to get to the citizens’ facilitation centre for authentication. There, my fingerprints did not match. Ultimately, I had to make a trip to my hometown to go to the provident fund office to submit the certificate,” another citizen from Kondhwa said. An employee of a nationalised bank weighed in on the issues they faced. He said they were overwhelmed by the number of requests. “Sometimes, there is a machine failure or connectivity issue in verifying biometrics. Many aged persons are facing fingerprint authentication issues as well, which is beyond our control, and needs to be sorted by UID,” he said.UID officials said citizens have to re-check their finger print data with the citizen facilitation centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/senior-citizens-queue-up-for-life-certificate-work/articleshow/79846550.cms||Nisha Nambiar
December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Air travel to Oman, Saudi suspended||HYDERABAD: Apart from the United Kingdom, air travel to Oman and Saudi Arabia too was temporarily suspended, on Monday, in view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation in these countries. In its order, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), stated that the ban on flight operations between India and the UK will be in force from 11.59 pm on December 22 to December 31. In case of Oman and Saudi Arabia, airline operators said, the operations will be suspended for a week beginning 1 am on Tuesday, as per a directive issued by the Sultanate. The move is likely to impact scores of travellers from Hyderabad as the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport supports multiple operations to Muscat and Jeddah through the week. The city has one direct service to the UK that is operated five times a week. “No flights from the United Kingdom will land in India after 2359 hrs on December 22. However, this restriction shall not apply to international all-cargo operations and flights approved by the DGCA,” the order issued by the competent authority stated. It also instructed all airlines operating flights to/from India, from other countries, to ensure that they do not board any passenger from the UK for any destination in India — either directly or indirectly. During the period before the complete ban kicks in on Tuesday night, the DGCA said, all passengers travelling from the UK will to have to compulsorily undergo a RT-PCR test at the arrival port in India. “Passengers found Covid positive shall be quarantined as per guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare. All medical costs incurred shall be borne by the passengers,” the order added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/air-travel-to-oman-saudi-suspended/articleshow/79846540.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Dehradun||Hanging power wire in elephant corridor kills jumbo||DEHRADUN: Two days ago, those living in the small Nainital village of Dharma flagged what has been a recurring concern. Elephants, possibly running out of food in the forests, had been meandering into their fields. But what they were worried about, gram pradhan Rukmani Negi had written to the forest and power departments, were the neglected overhead high tension wires. On Monday, that is what killed an elephant passing through farms in the village. “For two years, we have been bringing this up,” Negi said on Monday. “What happened today was because of their (government officials’) callousness.” In fact, the elephant died in an area that’s part of the Gaula elephant corridor. But with industries dotting what is supposed to be a protected passage, conservationists said human-wildlife conflict and fatal accidents are unavoidable. “So many committees give recommendations against this over and over, but nothing changes,” Sandeep Kumar Tiwari, deputy director of the Wildlife Trust of India and programme manager of IUCN Asian Elephant Special Group, told TOI. According to state forest department data accessed by TOI, Uttarakhand has lost 42 elephants to electrocution since it was carved out in 2020. It’s one of the biggest causes of the elephant deaths in the state (450). It is in keeping with the national trend. Of the 510 elephants that have been killed across the country since 2014, most died of electrocution, by a large margin — 333. That’s more than four times the second biggest cause of death, train accidents (77 deaths), or the third, poaching (71). Just a month ago, after a radio-collared elephant died of electrocution in Haridwar, chief wildlife warden JS Suhag had asked forest staff to sort out the placement of high power electricity wires and transformers near elephant corridors or areas elephants frequent. On Monday, Suhag said there’s more being done: “I have asked all divisional forest officers to map elephant corridors and identify electricitywires and transformers. The director of Rajaji (National Park) has also been asked to get in touch with the railways to make sure trains slow down between Kansro and Motichur (an elephant corridor stretch).” This mapping, Tiwari said, is something states have been told repeatedly to complete. “The problem is all over — Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam. Identifying power lines and monitoring them is a basic thing which should already have started. It is sheer negligence on the part of both forest and power departments that allows this,” he added. Uttarakhand, meanwhile, has shifted focus to villagers.

December 22, 2020||Chandigarh||Outstanding debt of Punjab rose by nearly 170% in last 8 years||Chandigarh: The outstanding debt of the fund crunched Punjab government now stands around Rs 2.5 lakh crore and with the fall in the state gross domestic product (SGDP), the revenue to the SGDP ratio is anticipated to reach nearly 46% by this fiscal year end. As the agrarian state’s outstanding debt was at Rs 92,081 crore in financial year 2012-13, it has witnessed nearly 170% increase. At the same time, the public expenditure is expected to increase with a higher percentage of state population falling below the poverty line with the decline in opportunities for livelihood because of the adverse impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Much of Punjab’s borrowing goes into debt servicing as it had spent over Rs 17,567 crore to clear loan interest in the financial year 2019-20. Revenue receipts of the Punjab government, like the Centre and other states, also witnessed a steep fall owing to the Covid-19. However, the worrisome part is exploration of almost negligible new avenues to generate state’s own revenue and the laxity in arresting revenue loss caused mainly due to illegal mining and illicit liquor trade. The state government is definitely not going to meet Rs 88,004-crore budgeted revenue receipt targets this fiscal, just like previous years. As per the available monthly key indicators, the state government could hardly achieve 31% target of its Rs 49,845-crore budgeted tax revenue and just 13% of its Rs 8,045 crore non-tax revenue budget estimates in the first two quarters of this financial year. It has had a direct negative impact on the capital expenditure in the first two quarters as the state could gather the courage to spend just Rs 648 crore on this account out of the total budget estimates of Rs 10,279 crore for the fiscal and this is a worrisome trend for the health of an economy. As the state government spent Rs 4,412 crore on developing income generating capital assets in the fiscal year 2016-17, it hardly shelled out Rs 2,224 crore in 2019-20 as it aimed at bringing the state economy back on track. Professor of economics at the Institute for Development and Communication (IDC) Chandigarh, Jatinder Singh Bedi, who has been closely monitoring the Punjab economy, says: “If one look at the budget estimates of the Punjab government over the years, it becomes clear that there is candid admission by various governments that the state wishes to withdraw and leave everything to the market forces.” He says though the fall in collection of the non-tax revenue was still acceptable as there were limited opportunities to expand it but the slowdown in state’s own tax revenue was the cause of major worry and required careful analysis. Decline in own tax revenue The share of Punjab’s own tax revenue, excluding the Goods and Services Tax (GST), declined from 27.4% in financial year 2019-2020 (revised estimate) to 22.7% in financial year 2020-2021 (budget estimate). Whereas the share of state’s own non-tax revenue in total tax revenue declined from 10.8% in financial year 2019-2020 (revised estimate) to 9.9% in financial year 2020-2021 (budget estimate). Professor Bedi points out that the GST implementation has eroded Punjab’s fiscal autonomy by 18.1 percentage points. In the absence of GST, the Punjab government would have enjoyed autonomy on 56.4% of its revenue resources during FY 2020 as against 49.9% during FY 2021. “Despite inflated revenue receipts in budget estimates, it falls short of Rs 19,000 crore compared to the committed expenditures of the state,” he added. As state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal had highlighted in April, the state government was suffering Rs 1,700 crore per day loss of gross state domestic product (GSDP) due to Covid-19 induced curfew, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had ordered cut in expenditure by all government departments so that urgent expenses could be met to deal the crisis.

December 22, 2020||Ahmedabad||HC notice on PIL demanding live telecast of assembly proceedings, updation of website||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday issued notice to the state legislative secretary in response to a PIL demanding that the house proceedings should be disclosed and details be updated on assembly’s web portal under the RTI Act. The PIL was filed by social activists including Neeta Hardikar contending that under the Right to Information laws , the state assembly is bound to disclose on its website in Gujarati and English the proceedings that take place on the house. The petitioners have submitted that the website of the Parliament and some other state assemblies have been regularly disclosing details about the house proceedings. The state assembly has got its website, but the details are not posted on it the way other state assemblies have been doing. The PIL has asked for live telecast of proceedings and regular posting of transcripts, papers that are to be laid, private member’s business, zero-hour, list of questions and their answers, text of debates. It is demanding posting of text of legislations that are passed, pending, assented, lapsed, withdrawn and negatived by the assembly. The PIL is demanding information on the committees and summary of their work and reports. It wants the website updated with the rules, regulations, instructions, manuals and records, held by it or under its control or used by the assembly for discharging its functions. The petitioners contended that section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act requires the public authority to proactively disclose the procedure followed in the decision-making process, including channels of supervision and accountability among many other things for the purpose of transparency that was envisaged in the legislation. Non availability of this information violates democratic and constitutional rights of the people of Gujarat to view and understand the work undertaken by their elected representatives, the PIL said. The PIL asserted that the information mandated to be published under RTI norms is not disclosed proactively on the website of the Gujarat legislative assembly. It has demanded live telecast of the proceedings at the earliest. The HC has issued notice and posted further hearing beyond the winter vacation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-on-pil-demanding-live-telecast-of-assembly-proceedings-updation-of-website/articleshow/79846545.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Ludhiana||Basketball Foundation Day celebrated at Guru Nanak Stadium, Ludhiana||Ludhiana: The District Basketball Association, Ludhiana celebrated the 129th anniversary of basketball, which was started on December 21, 1891. To honour the day, Ludhiana Basketball Academy (LBA) held matches in the city’s Guru Nanak stadium. Teja Singh Dhaliwal, general secretary of Punjab Basketball Association said James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor invented basket ball for his trainees to keep them hooked to physical activity so that they did not become inert in the winter chill there. “Today, this game is played in every nook and corner of the world and is also recognised as an important sport in Olympic Games,” he added. Also present on the occasion were Rajinder Singh, chief coach LBA, Saloni, women’s team coach, Narinder Pal, Vijay Chopra of PBA and Brij Bhushan Goyal, treasurer of LBA. Goyal urged the players to never take recourse of stamina boosting health supplements for showing their performances in matches. He said when players are caught in dope tests, this not only mars their sporting and job career, but also earns bad name for the parents and sports bodies. Coach Rajinder Singh thanked the management of LBA and PBA for popularising the sport in every district of Punjab. He said already many players trained at LBA are drafted in NBA and are playing FIBA matches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/basketball-foundation-day-celebrated-at-guru-nanak-stadium-ludhiana/articleshow/79846544.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
December 22, 2020||Pune||Carol singers take virtual route to spread Xmas cheer this year||Pune: It’s that time of the year again when groups of enthusiastic singers perform Christmas carols to spread some festive cheer. This year, due to the social distancing norms in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the carol singers are spreading the message of peace and harmony via online performances. Luv Mahtani, a ukulele player and teacher, has been conducting online carol sessions with his pupils. “This entire year has been about online events. For our carol sessions, we give the online audience the chords and lyrics of the carols beforehand, so they can join in and sing along. We also give a small demo for the chords,” he said. “Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas is the perfect carol for 2020, as it talks about the hope that all our troubles will be out of sight,” he added. Ryan Bangera, the head of music at Furtados School of Music, said, “ Amid the current Covid-19 challenges, to have the heart, mind and sound coming together on a screen is difficult to capture, but we made sure we continued this annual ritual. Families log in on online platforms to hear the good news of salvation from the carol singers. The dress code and the mandates remain the same, except for exchange of pleasantries in person.” Anurag Datta, a student who goes carolling with his church youth group every year, said, “We will be performing online every evening till Christmas Day, and have invited all church members to join the event. The more the merrier aptly applies to carol singing. It isn’t possible to go singing with masks on, but we are visiting people’s homes via video conferences.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/carol-singers-take-virtual-route-to-spread-xmas-cheer-this-year/articleshow/79846562.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Harassment, threats driving instant app loan victims to take extreme steps||HYDERABAD: A woman, who went to the rescue of her husband, a government teacher, pledged all her gold ornaments and raised Rs 2 lakh to avoid harassment from tele-callers, representing instant financing loan apps from whom he took a loan. As the callers continued to demand more money, she decided to even pledge her mangalsutra. Finally, after her panic-stricken husband decided to fight the financiers’ exploitation, she gave up her plan and the couple approached Cyberabad police. For many loanees, life has become a living hell due to the harassment of these finance companies. “About 10 days ago, I had suicidal tendencies as I felt it was better to hang myself rather than getting humiliated as the financiers called all the members in my contacts and defamed me. They called my dad and threatened they will upload my private photos on social media and shame me if we do not repay the money,’’ a woman software engineer said. She took a loan of Rs 1 lakh over time and she was asked to repay Rs 2.5 lakh. She and several others like her started to take loans during the lockdown when their salaries were slashed by nearly 50% or they lost their job. She had to convince persons on her call list, including colleagues, as they too were being terrorised. In the case of another loanee, as a fallout of harassment from financiers, his family life got disturbed and his employer sacked him as his female co-employees complained of receiving threatening calls as callers asked them to repay loan on his behalf. He moved to Chennai after his family started distancing themselves. A standard WhatsApp text messages to defaulters says: “The FIR was registered as New Delhi PS. Case No. 146/2020 under Section 420/405 of IPC. I am forwarding you FIR today by SpeedPost to your local police station. You can resolve your matter by your local police or court proceeding. On completion of investigation, New Delhi PS led down the charge-sheet against the accused person under Section 420/406 of IPC’’. When the loanees verified, they found no such FIR. The message was fake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/harassment-threats-driving-instant-app-loan-victims-to-take-extreme-steps/articleshow/79846559.cms||Srinath Vudali
December 22, 2020||Pune||Himachal bizman & driver in net on charge of possessing charas worth Rs 1cr||Pune: A businessman and his driver from Himachal Pradesh were arrested on Sunday night in the city on the charge of possessing 34.5kg charas, valued at Rs1.03 crore in the international market.Superintendent of police (railways) Sadanand Wayse-Patil said, “Lalitkumar Dayanand Sharma (49), who rents out bungalows and vehicles in Himachal Pradesh, and his driver, Kaulsingh Rupsingh Singh (40), will be in police custody till January 2 as per a court order.”He said, “Our team nabbed the duo from a spot under the railway overbridge near Wadia College after they got down from a train with the contraband to avoid police.”An FIR under sections 8 (C), 20 (B), (2) and 29 (related to possessing drugs) of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered.One of Wayse-Patil’s IPS batchmates from Himachal Pradesh had tipped him off about the movement of charas consignment.

December 22, 2020||Amritsar||Pakistan gives permission for construction of Hindu temple||AMRITSAR: The Pakistan government has finally given permission for the construction of Krishna temple in Islamabad after its state-run Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) ruled that Islamic laws allowed minorities to have their own religious place. CII had earlier issued a ‘fatwa’ against the construction of any new Hindu temple in Pakistan. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) Hindu member National Assembly (MNA) Lal Chand Malhi, who headed the temple construction drive, told TOI that the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Islamabad, on Monday gave permission to the Islamabad Hindu Panchayat (IHP) to construct the boundary wall around the temple, a community centre and a cremation ground for Hindu community in Islamabad. “After CII cleared the way for the construction of the temple, crematorium and community hall, the CDA has issued first permission to erect the boundary wall,” he said. Earlier, after issuing a ‘fatwa’ against the construction of new Hindu temple and usage of government funds, the CII in the recent past had announced that Hindus and other minority communities in Pakistan had the constitutional right to construct new places of worship. Giving reference to Pakistan’s tradition, the CII had objected on the allocation of funds from the government for a non-government religious place. The IHP had demanded Rs 100 million from Pakistan government for Rs 500 million projects of the construction of Hindu temple, community hall and crematorium which was objected by CII following which the Pakistan government sought advice from CII. According to reports, as many as 3,000 Hindu families live in Islamabad and its surrounding and they didn’t have sufficient facilities for performing religious as well as last rites of their dead ones. Notably, the CDA had in 2017 allotted a 20,000 square feet plot to IHP and three years later on June 23, 2020, the ground breaking ceremony of the Krishna temple was held which was however stalled after CII issued the fatwa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/pak-gives-permission-for-construction-of-hindu-temple/articleshow/79846551.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Opened by a teacher couple — Darshandeep Singh Gill, who is block mentor for English and English teacher at Government Senior Secondary School Uksi and his wife Ravinder Kaur an elementary teacher trainer at Government School Jargari. The library has a collection of over 2,000 books, painstakingly collected by the couple over the years. It also has other attractions like a reading room, a well, a pond, and painted trees to attract the people. The porch of the library has been covered with a thatched roof. In order to enhance green cover, the couple has planted saplings and created a pond around the library. Darshandeep said, “I have converted the land given by my father and made the one-room quarter in the field into a library. In any village, town or city in Punjab, one can easily spot a theka, sharab angrezi and desi. We wanted to pun on that. As we also had a collection of both English and Punjabi books, so we decided to name the library as Theka Kitab Desi te Angerzi.” Ravinder Kaur said, “As we both are working in the education field, our life revolves around books.

December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Steady decline of active Covid cases in Telangana||HYDERABAD: The state is not only witnessing a steady decline of active Covid-19 cases — 6,590 now — but also a substantial drop in the post-Covid complications, mostly stroke and fibrosis-related respiratory distress. A month back there were nearly 350 cases related to post-Covid complications, but now the state-run Gandhi Hospital has less than 50. With the reduction of severity and number of complicated cases, these are no longer being treated as post-Covid cases, say hospital authorities. As of Monday, the hospital has around 130 Covid patients requiring tertiary care. Post-Covid complications are referred to cases of patients coming back with severe and often irreversible damage to lungs, heart and kidney, after recovering from coronavirus infection. In fact, state health department had involved multi-disciplinary teams to look into such cases, including mental health. “Around two months back, post-Covid infections had become a huge concern and we were getting cases in hundreds and also losing many patients who were coming with post-Covid complications. This has now come down substantially,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi Hospital. A senior official from a corporate hospital said, “Although we are still getting some post-Covid cases, these are less than 10 a day. At one point in time, these numbers had gone up to 30 a day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/steady-decline-of-active-cases-in-state/articleshow/79846552.cms||Amrita Didyala

It will go a long way in strengthening fish farm infrastructure in the state. Himachal Pradesh has become a stronghold for mahseer fish production in the country which was fast approaching genetic extinction worldwide. An estimated 10,000-12,000 record highest hatching are expected during this year out of 41,450 eggs produced in this year so far. Animal husbandry and fisheries minister Virender Kanwar said golden mahseer was one of the finest sports-fish and a source of recreation to innumerable sportsmen throughout the world. To promote mahseer production, the state government is taking effective steps, like release of 15% of water discharge from hydroelectricity power during lean season, conservation of fish through regular patrolling and implementation of close season. He said the fisheries department was emphasising on artificial breeding of fish and by conserving and ranching of the river system with Mahseer seed would also promote eco-tourism in the state. He said that state recorded 20,900, 28,700 and 41,450 golden mahseer egg production in the year 2017-18 year 2018-19 and year 2019-20 (till today) respectively. He said that there are many natural Mahseer sanctuaries called “Machhial” in the state water where Golden Mahseer is being conserved spiritually by the people and department of fisheries also doing commendable work in this direction by strictly implementing fisheries Act and Rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/golden-mahseer-hatchery-cum-carp-breeding-unit-at-sunni/articleshow/79846560.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Chennai||AIADMK bats for Tamil Nadu poll in April; most parties for 1-phase election||CHENNAI: The AIADMK on Monday urged the Election Commission of India to hold the Tamil Nadu assembly election in the third or fourth week of April. Most of the political parties, including the AIADMK, the DMK, the Congress, and the Left parties, urged the election commission to hold a single-phase election in the state. The parties put forth the suggestions to a high-level delegation led by election commission secretary general Umesh Sinha who is on a two-day visit to Chennai to assess poll preparedness and hold discussions with parties and officials. The commission invited representatives of 10 recognized political parties for discussions separately. “Due to the peak summer in May, we wanted the commission to hold the election in April. We suggested that it be held in a single phase. Each village should have booths and the booths with more than 1,000 votes should be split due to the pandemic,” deputy speaker Pollachi V Jayaraman said. The Congress and the CPI strongly rejected the election commission’s proposal to provide the option of postal ballots to absentee voters and senior citizens aged over 80. The Congress and the CPI rejected the commission’s proposal to provide the option of postal ballots to those with disabilities and Covid patients too, fearing malpractices, including distribution of cash, to lure the voters. The AIADMK demanded that the commission conduct one or two special camps for inclusion of voters, deletions and corrections. The parties sought stringent action against voter bribing besides flagging issues like clean electoral rolls, limiting voters in each booth, shutting down TASMAC outlets till polling process ends, deployment of more Central security forces and observers to conduct a free and fair election, free transport of voters by commission, besides implementing strict Covid protocols in booths. The DMK demanded that fresh guidelines be issued for postal ballots, alleging the recent guidelines lacked any security mechanism and that they were silent about secrecy of voting. “The guidelines are silent about ensuring that ballots safely reach the returning officer after they are collected from the voters by the polling official,” party organising secretary R S Bharathi said. The DMDK demanded postal ballots for 65 years and above, and The DMDK urged the commission to commence counting of votes the day after polling day. The Congress raised the issue of maximum number of applications received for deletion (56,300) and inclusion of voters (90,479) in Salem district during the recent month-long summary revision. “We request the commission to issue instructions about being cautious while deleting the names of voters. We have already experienced and seen in the previous elections how thousands of genuine voters were deleted and how affected voters returned with great disappointment,” TNCC vice president R Dhamotharan said. To prove negligence on the part of the officials, the CPI leaders brought to the notice of the commission the names of four district collectors posted in Thanjavur and which found a place in the electoral roll despite years after their transfer. The BJP state unit demanded a mechanism to ensure uninterrupted voting in the event of power outage. The election commission delegation also held a meeting with district collectors and superintendents of police and other senior police officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-bats-for-poll-in-april-most-parties-for-1-phase-election/articleshow/79846572.cms||Julie Mariappan

December 22, 2020||Pune||Pune: Man found bludgeoned to death, cops cuff roommate at Triveninagar||PUNE: The Chikhali police on Sunday took a 22-year-old man into custody in connection with the murder of a worker (25) at Triveninagar on December 17, after inspecting footage from 125 CCTV cameras and questioning over 200 families in the Chakan and Mhalunge areas. Jeevan Sharma’s body was found on December 18 at his rented accommodation. Sharma hailed from Assam and had been working in Triveninagar for the last nine months. The Chikhali police team, led by senior inspector Satish Mane, took suspect Ranjeshkumar Ram (22) into custody from Vasoli Phata in Khed taluka. During the questioning, Ram told the police that he and his friend were working in Bhosari and Mhalunge but they lost their jobs a few days ago. They were staying with Sharma as they did not have money to pay rent. “They had planned to go to Rajasthan for work. The suspect had told his sister to transfer Rs 3,000 to his friend’s bank account. But the suspect’s friend and the victim gave him only Rs500 and kicked him out of the room. Furious over this, the suspect bludgeoned Sharma to death with a small LPG cylinder,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-found-bludgeoned-to-death-cops-cuff-roommate/articleshow/79846579.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Kind-hearted souls show the way to 18-year-old visually impaired||For a journalist, the high point is always when a story makes an impact. Some stories ‘wake up’ the administration to act, whereas some make a positive impact on the lives about whom we write. It was the latter for the diarist this year. It was a humid July afternoon when Std XII state board results were announced, and the diarist received a call from principal Tejinder Venugopal about a student, 18 year-old Bhumika Chawre. She had been through a lot in the last five years, right from losing her eyesight completely due to medical complications, to her rickshaw puller father passing away, to her housemaid mother suffering 35% burns during a catering stint. Having a younger brother meant that her mother’s role as the only breadwinner in the family had become more demanding. Bhumika had scored almost 70% in the science stream and had adapted amazingly well to a life without vision. Her grit, resolve and never-say-die attitude saw her through the tough times. Bhumika’s immediate concern was funding her higher education, paying for commute to college and buying books. TOI Nagpur published her story the next day and what followed was something none of us had expected. Almost an avalanche of offers came from readers to lend a helping hand to Bhumika. But it was not a matter of just parachuting a bagful of money into her bank account, but to ensure that she was guided properly through her graduation, post graduation with every phase being funded properly. Those who knew me and had my contact details were able to reach out faster and chalk out a proper plan for Bhumika. First off, the priority was to see that her mother’s income is supplemented in some way so that they are not always struggling to make ends meet. Khushroo Poacha, who helps many through his food/provisions supply ecosystem, immediately committed to provide basic groceries. The family was now assured of a monthly supply of a ration kit thus freeing up the scarcely available funds for Bhumika’s family. Many other groups, individuals and associations wanted to give money. But her ‘self respect’ did not allow Bhumika to accept a hand-out. She was rather looking for a helping hand. So, in consultation with Bhumika, it was decided to allow benefactors to directly pay her fees, send her books rather than give her lump sum cash. Businessman Nimish Sutaria was someone who had helped out struggling students and was keen on doing the same for Bhumika. Once she chose Hislop College for graduation, Sutaria contacted the college’s alumni association. With their help, all requisite fees were paid to secure the admission. Some off shoots of SFS School alumni association committed to paying for a dedicated autorickshaw which will daily drop and pick her from college. This could not fructify as till date colleges have not reopened. Poacha also gifted a branded tab to Bhumika for online classes. Her brother helped in downloading software for visually impaired persons. Bhumika one day called up and broke down, saying she had no idea that so many good people exist in the world. “After my father’s death we thought there’s no one take care of us. But God has sent so many devdoots to take care of me,” said Bhumika.

December 22, 2020||Chandigarh||Row over ‘Akhand Path’ in name of excommunicated Akali leader||FATEHGARH SAHIB: Ahead of three-day Shaheedi Sahba in Fatehgarh Sahib, a row erupted over allowing ‘Akhand Path’ in Gurdwara Shri Fatehgarh Sahib by former Shiromani Akali Dal minister Sucha Singh Langah, who was excommunicated by Akal Takht in October 2017. Langah was excommunicated from Sikh panth after an objectionable video of him had gone viral just before the Gurdaspur Lok Sabhb bypoll three years ago. Raising objections over allowing Langah to hold Akhand Path in the Bhora Sahib of Gurdwara Shri Fatehgarh Sahib on Monday, some Sikh leaders said it was “serious disregard and brazen violation” of hukamnama (edict) of the supreme temporal authority of the Sikhs by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC). Langah was also allowed the curtsey of holding ‘Chawar Sahib’ (the fly whisk) during the time the ardaas was being performed by one of the granthis (priest) of the gurdwara. He was allegedly even bestowed a siropa after the completion of the Akhand Path. Gurudwara Shri Fatehgarh Sahib manager Karam Singh claimed, “The Akhand Path in Langah’s name was booked in 2015. It did not occur to us that he was excommunicated, otherwise we would have discussed the matter with our seniors. Langah himself picked the ‘chawar’ when the granthi was busy in reciting prayers.” Seeking immediate intervention of the Akal Takht , SAD (Democratic) chief spokesperson Bir Devinder Singh said, “SGPC has brazenly allowed an excommunicated Sikh, a former minister Sucha Singh Langah to hold an Akhand Path in his name, in the Bhora Sahib, at Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib (Sirhind) where two younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh were bricked alive. The SGPC has not only deliberately violated the sanctity of the edict of the Akal Takhat with impunity but also unashamedly extended every possible VVIP treatment to him. The matter has been brought to the notice of the Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh ji by me at Damdama Sahib, along with the entire irrefutable documentary proof.” Bir Devinder said the Sikh Sangat of the area had demanded immediate stern action against all the employees of the SGPC, including the gurdwara manager. SGPC takes action After the issue came to light, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur suspended manager and granthi of Gurdwara Sri Fatehgarh Sahib for having social contact with excommunicated Sucha Singh Langah, former minister in Parkash Singh Badal government. She said she had suspended manager Karam Singh and the concerned granthi for bestowing siropa (robe of honour) upon Langah. She said she had also directed to investigate the incident and warned to take strict action against anyone violating Akal Takht edict against Langah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/row-over-akhand-path-in-name-of-excommunicated-akali-leader/articleshow/79846573.cms||Bharat Khanna

December 22, 2020||India||A first since July 1: Daily Covid cases fall below 20000||For the first time since July 1, India’s daily count of Covid-19 cases fell below 20,000 on Monday even as the country’s shrinking tally of active cases went under the 3-lakh mark after 163 days. India recorded 18,588 fresh cases on Monday, the lowest single-day count since June 30, as per data collated from state governments. In another significant development, Maharashtra no longer has the most number of active cases in the country. The active case count in India’s worst-hit state fell below 60,000 on Monday, and was overtaken by Kerala, which has more than 60,500 people currently infected with the virus. Kerala also logged the highest number of fresh cases, at 36,539, in the week gone by (December 14-20). It was the only major state in the country to register a week-on-week rise in Covid cases, recording an increase of 3,370 cases over the previous week. Only five other states and Union territories recorded a rise in cases as compared with the previous week. In all these states/UTs, the rise was marginal. These include Jharkhand (283 cases higher than last week) and Sikkim (+97). As many as 29 out of 35 states/UTs recorded a drop in cases, week on week. The biggest dips were recorded in Maharashtra (-12,048), Delhi (-5,653), Bengal (-3,922) and Haryana (-3,244). In absolute terms, after Kerala, Maharashtra reported the second highest number of cases at 16,102, followed by Bengal (15,033), Chhattisgarh (10,199) and Delhi (9,551). Monday’s all-India case count of 18,588 mainly came out of a sharply lower number of tests done in the country on the previous day. Testing on Sunday had come down to 9 lakh, a drop of more than 2 lakh from the previous day. This was in keeping with the trend of lower testing on Sundays which results in a drop in cases every Monday. There were 302 deaths reported from the virus on Monday. Mumbai and Maharashtra registered a sharp drop in daily detection of cases. The state recorded below 3,000 cases (2,834) after a week, while the city’s daily caseload dipped below 500 (463). Health officials admitted that fewer tests done on Sunday due to manpower crunch over weekends could have resulted in the lower numbers but added that the Covid curve has been dipping since October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-first-since-july-1-daily-covid-cases-fall-below-20000/articleshow/79848462.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad cop suspended for beating mask-less man||AHMEDABAD: An assistant police constable (APC), Bharat Kalubhai, who hit a resident of Narol, Gopal Sathwara, with his baton for not wearing a mask, was on Monday suspended by Zone 5 deputy commissioner of police Achal Tyagi. After a video of the constable’s brutality went viral on social media one day after the incident, an inquiry into the incident was handed over to assistant commissioner of police, H Division, P M Prajapati. His report was handed to Tyagi on Saturday. “The APC was found to be at fault for hitting the man with his lathi for not wearing a mask. He was suspended because his act has tarnished the image of the police department,” said Tyagi. The incident took place near Swaminarayan Apartments in Narol, where the APC had gone in a government vehicle to his house, without permission. There he saw Sathwara beside the road, talking on his mobile phone, without a mask. Tyagi said, “The APC deployed in Khokhra did go out of his jurisdiction to Narol and beat up the man with his lathi. He should have informed the police control room and let Narol police take action against Sathwara for not wearing a mask in public. There was no need for him to beat up the man.” Tyagi also mentioned another case, from of Ramol, which occurred on December 18, and a video of which went viral on social media. A woman police official is seen in the video catching a youth for not wearing a mask, while her own mask has slipped below her nose. “While another person tried to film the cop with her mask below her nose, Ramol police intervened and tried to stop the man from filming. She and other women constables are seen pushing the man taking the video into a police vehicle. The inquiry in this case was also handed over to P M Prajapati, and the report is pending. It will most likely be complete by Tuesday as only a few statements are yet to be recorded,” said Tyagi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/constable-who-hit-man-with-lathi-suspended/articleshow/79846589.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Jaipur||Rural dvpt and panchayati raj engrs boycott work||Jaipur: Around 375 engineers and nearly 2,000 junior technical assistants (JTAs) of rural and panchayati raj department boycotted all departmental work on Monday, including work on MGNREGA projects – like ‘Pura Kaam, Pura Daam campaign’- in protest against delay in their promotion. The engineers say, the boycott will continue till their demands are fulfilled.They were given assurance by the government in the month of September last year (2019) that the promotion of the engineers will be done soon.They have submitted a representation in this regard to chief secretary Niranjan Arya and additional chief secretary rural development and panchayati raj Rohit Kumar Singh. Singh said, “We have regularised the 2012-13 DPC (departmental promotion committee) and sent it to the finance department. They are considering it positively.” Rajesh Sharma, president of rural development and panchayati raj engineers association said, “No DPC meeting had taken place in the department from 2012-13 to 2019-20 as there were no permanent posts of engineers. In March 2020, the posts under deputation were turned into permanent posts.” Currently, there are 284 posts of assistant engineers, 70 posts of executive engineers and 4 posts of superintendent engineers in the department. “However, RPSC refused to give clearance for promotion to these permanent posts on December 15. It raised an objection and sought to know from rural development department about the consent given by finance department on DPCs done up to 2012-13 for the posts. Now, the rural development department has to get it cleared by the finance department. Hence, the process got delayed further,” he added.“Out of these permanent posts, some posts were allocated to watershed department as well. The agriculture department, meanwhile, has already got the DPC done on these posts on December 10. It’s been 8 months since the permanent posts have been created, but nothing has been done so far,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rural-dvpt-and-panchayati-raj-engrs-boycott-work/articleshow/79846574.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Local resident Vishal Ohal said, “We have time and again submitted video grabs and photographs to the Kondhwa police relating to nuisance created by miscreants in various lanes.

The Lullanagar resident’s welfare association has made numerous complaints and sought better security. We want police to start a chowkey in the area.” Senior inspector Sardar Patil from Kondhwa police said, “Patrolling by beat marshals and mobile vans has been intensified. We have sought suggestions from the residents to identify four-five fixed points for conducting patrolling and installing QR codes. We have told them to construct gates at four entry and exit points and appoint trained security guards at 180 apartments.”PMC corporator Sainath Babar said,“I had a meeting with senior inspector Sardar Patil and requested him to consider the residents’ long-pending demands.

December 22, 2020||Pune||Number of vacant nCoV beds soars in region as cases drop||Pune: A steady drop in the number of new Covid-19 infections in Pune has led to a massive increase in the number of available beds for those sickened by the virus.On Monday, data showed that bed vacancy was at 72% within PMC and 86% in PCMC limits. The bed availability dashboard showed there were 6,620 vacant beds from a total of 9,145 beds allocated for Covid treatment within PMC limits. In Pimpri Chinchwad, there were 4,089 vacant units from a total of 4,751.The Pimpri jumbo unit, which had high patient intake during the first week of September, had as much as 78% (627) of its beds vacant on Monday. The CoEP jumbo unit — under the PMC’s jurisdiction — had 71% (428) of its beds available. As for critical care beds, 44% of the units (183 beds) were available for patients in PMC limits. In PCMC areas, there were 115 beds available (an 80% vacancy). Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner of the PMC, said bed availability can start to vary as hospitals make more space for non-Covid patients. Avinash Bhondwe, state president for the Indian Medical Association, said the 80:20 bed reservation policy will continue until February 28. The rule states that hospitals have to reserve 80% of their bed capacity to treat those with SARS-CoV-2. Santosh Patil, the outgoing additional commissioner of the PCMC, said with Covid bed vacancies now at an all-time high, hospitals can now start focusing on regular treatments again. Scores had missed out on essential care due to the pandemic. Members of the state Covid task force said that district collectors will have to carry out assessments to ensure non-Covid patients get the appropriate care within their jurisdictions. In an earlier interview, task force member Subhash Salunke said current preparedness levels should continue until the end of February. He said, “The vaccine will be given to healthcare workers first. So, we cannot drop our guard. Collectors should ensure non-Covid patients have access to treatment even with the 80:20 rule on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/number-of-vacant-ncov-beds-soars-in-region-as-cases-drop/articleshow/79846594.cms||Piyush Bhusari

G-SER is set to compete with other top education clusters around the world.  As a part of this endeavour, the state government has established an MoU with M/s Cerestra Managers Private Limited. Cerestra Ventures, India’s largest education infrastructure fund, in association with the state government, will develop the Special Education Region (SER) at Dholera. The Hyderabad-based private equity firm is engaged in investment, development and management of real assets in the field of education and life sciences. Under its education vertical, Cerestra is focused on setting up “First in Class” quality-centric education hubs which includes schools and student housing and has implemented projects in Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore. DSIR, a flagship project of the state government, is being developed on the concept of “greenfield industrial city” under the domain of Delhi – Mumbai Industrial Corridor. DSIR is ready for business with its activation area equipped with utility embedded serviced plots and planned strategic regional connectivity such as Ahmedabad-Dholera Expressway, Dholera International Airport and Bhimnath – Dholera Rail Line. Timely development of social infrastructure along with physical infrastructure is an important element for developing the city of tomorrow. CM Vijay Rupani said that Dholera is the first modern greenfield industrial city developed for supporting industrial 4.0 manufacturing. The SER will further boost overall development of the region and will support in achieving the aim of Gujarat being a knowledge-driven economy, the CM said. M K Das (IAS), chairman, Dholera Industrial City Development Limited, said, “Gujarat has a track record of implementing many innovative socio-economic and dynamic models of inclusive growth and development. The SER in Dholera will be bringing global education learning systems in India.” “Cerestra is an end-to-end integrated education investment platform, with student housing edu-infra and school operations. Cerestra aims to create a sustainable and well diversified portfolio of edu-infra and plans India’s maiden edu-infra InvIT (Infrastructure Investment Trust). G-SER MoU is another milestone in that direction” said Jasmeet Chhabra, managing partner of Cerestra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-inks-mou-with-cerestra-to-set-up-g-ser-at-dholera/articleshow/79846611.cms||---

The negative test report could be an antigen test report or RT-PCR. The order said those not following the standard operating procedure will be booked under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Disaster Management Act, 2005.A senior official from the department said they have released a standard operating procedure for business to business (B2B) trade exhibitions, mandating that the negative test report be taken from government approved laboratories. “Based on health and safety analysis of visitors’ cities of origin, organizers have been told to avoid promoting their events to visitors from Covid-19 affected areas,” he added. The number of participants should also be limited. Organisers should keep the activity at a moderate level and go slow and steady, he further said.The SOP said organizers must monitor the number of business visitors and delegates in a particular hall by technology-enabled or other means. As soon as the hall reaches saturation as per the occupancy load notified by government agencies, inflow may be restricted, it added.The venue provider must set up health/first-aid kiosks manned by optimal staff with thermal guns and hand sanitizers at all entry/ exit gates. The SOP said B2B arrangements will be permitted only outside containment zones. Trade exhibition organizers, venue providers, service providers, exhibitors and business visitors from containment zones will not be permitted.“The organizer should maintain a record of all the entrants and participants. They should be able to provide traceability support of suspected Covid-19 cases to local health authorities,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/negative-test-report-must-for-trade-show-participants/articleshow/79846631.cms||Neha Madaan

December 22, 2020||Rajkot||Gujarat seeks GOI push for ceramics||GANDHINAGAR: As Gujarat’s ceramics industry continues to grow and make its mark in the international market, the state government has requested the Centre to extend special support to the sector. The Gujarat government has sought the establishment of a dedicated ceramics export promotion council and a new research & development centre of international repute for the Morbi-based cluster. “The development of an international convention centre for the ceramics industry in Morbi will provide a platform for the industries to display goods to global customers,” said a source in the state industries and mines department. “The state government has approved more than 100 new ceramics plants in Morbi and surrounding areas which will attract investments to the tune of Rs 12,000 crore in the next two years,” the source said. “To boost further development, the state government is looking to extend maximum support to the cluster and has requested the Centre to approve a separate export promotion council for the ceramics industry.” Currently, the ceramics cluster is subsumed under CAPEXIL (Chemical and Allied Export Promotion Council). The EPCG (Export Promotion Capital Goods) scheme is due to expire on March 31, 2021. “We have sought an extension of this scheme by the Government of India as it will significantly benefit small exporters and positively impact export volumes,” the source said. “If we want to become a globally competitive cluster, we need to undertake research in terms of new product development and design. We also need to bring down production costs,” said Nilesh Jetpariya, president, wall tiles division, Morbi Ceramics Association (MCA). Jetpariya added: “Hence, the industry has demanded that a resource centre and a common facility be set up in Morbi.” Morbi-based companies have started reaching out to newer markets such as Europe and South America. Through their initiative of using locally made machine tools for shaping, cutting, and calibration of products, Morbi units have reduced import dependency. Many companies are undergoing expansion as well. Currently, Gujarat’s ceramics industry accounts for 8% of the world’s export market; the figure is set to double in the coming few years.

The rescued bears were safely put in cages and shifted to Warangal zoo to treat their injuries. Forest officials tried to get the bears climb out of the well by lowering ladders smeared with honey and by using nets, but after their initial efforts did not succeed, they had to call a wildlife rescue team from Warangal who tranquilized the wild animals and pulled them out using nets. “Forest department officials were informed about the bears by the owner of the well who first heard growls emanating from the well and later found these two animals inside. As it was an open well, they might have accidently slipped into it on Sunday night,” a release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-sloth-bears-slip-into-well-rescued-after-7-hr-long-op/articleshow/79846638.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Nagpur||1L solar farm pumps to be installed per yr under state, centre schemes: Raut||Nagpur: Energy minister Nitin Raut has come out with a renewable energy policy that aims to increase the installed capacity by over 17,000MW in coming five years. He had earlier announced that henceforth no more thermal power units would be commissioned in the state. TOI talked to him about his green initiative. The excerpts ...Your policy aims to install one lakh solar agricultural pumps per year. How will you do this?The pumps will be installed under two schemes — the state government’s Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Pump Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthan Mahabhiyan. The total expenditure for one lakh pumps is Rs1,950 crore per year of which Rs585 crore is central grant. Under the state scheme, a farmer belonging to SC or ST communities has to pay 5% cost of the pump while remaining money comes from special component plan and tribal funds. Other farmers have to pay 10% of the cost, government contribution is 10% while 80% money comes from tax on sale of electricity. Under the central scheme, the beneficiary has to pay 40% cost of the pump while state and centre contribute 30% each. In this case implementing agency is Maharashtra Energy Development Agency.You have set a target of adding 10,000MW solar capacity in the next five years. How will this be done?This will be done by private players. The minimum capacity of the solar plant should be 1MW. For a solar park it is 5MW. The developer can sell power to MSEDCL through competitive or through open access to consumers. It can also use it for captive purposes. We will soon come out with a standard operating procedure for grid connectivity of such projects. Such projects will get industry status. In case the developer wants government land, we will make it available but he will have to share 5% of its profit with the government. The developer can also get local body land. Gram panchayats will be given rights to lease land up to 15 acres, panchayat samitis between 15 and 25 acre and zilla parishads for above 25 acre. Government will acquire land for the transmission system on priority basis. The rate of the land will be as per ready reckoner.In next five years, 2,000MW capacity is to be added through grid connected solar rooftop. Is this to be done by individual consumers?Yes, the individual consumers can install solar rooftop on their premises.You have set a target of generating 200MW from municipal solid waste. Will the local bodies get any help for such projects?State discom MSEDCL will sign a power purchase agreement with the local body at rates decided by Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. The state government will provide a subsidy of Rs4.50 per unit. In next four years an expenditure of Rs504.5 crore is expected on this account. The power evacuation system will, however, have to be erected by the local body or its concessionaire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1l-solar-farm-pumps-to-be-installed-per-yr-under-state-centre-schemes-raut/articleshow/79844564.cms||Ashish Roy

December 22, 2020||Jaipur||Covid casualty: Popular desert festival likely to be called off||JAISALMER: Another major state event might fall casualty to the corona pandemic as the district administration is likely to call off the world famous desert festival in the beginning of next year. The cancellation of the event might cause heavy damage to tourism business. The possibility of running Palace on Wheels also looks grim although tour operators have requested to reduce the package costs of the train. Tourism department, principal secretary, Alok Gupta said it would be too soon to tell if the desert festival will be called off, but chances of organising it looks grim. Every month the state government issues guidelines looking at the Covid situation and as per the guidelines all fairs organised in December have been cancelled. Decision will be taken according to the guidelines to be issued in January and February. If the government gives green signal, then it can be organised at small level, he added. Discussing about Palace on Wheels, he said efforts are being made to lure domestic tourists. Operators have demanded that the rates of the packages be reduced, but the department will have to bear heavy losses. In such a scenario, it is better not to run the train, he added. He said foreign tourists have booked their tickets on Palace on Wheels for this tourist season, but international flights have not resumed. Their tickets are being shifted to next tourist season without cost escalation and other charges. Notably, if the desert festival is cancelled, then it would be for the second time in the history of 42 years of the festival. Earlier, it was cancelled in 2001 due to earthquake in Gujarat. The three-day desert festival is being organised since 1979. Jaisalmer collector Ashish Modi said it appears that desert festival will not be organised in 2021, but no official decision has been taken in this regard so far, but till now preparations have not begun in this regard, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-casualty-popular-desert-festival-likely-to-be-called-off/articleshow/79846632.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Pune||Maharashtra: Cabbie-turned-farmer back behind the wheel after nine-month struggle||PUNE: Ravindra Birajdar spent nine months on the farm back in his village in Latur after the lockdown was announced and he couldn’t run his cab anymore. But the 30-year-old is now back in the city to resume the profession he took up 12 years ago. “I feel excited to be back in the city but I am scared as well. Though the business has not revived fully, the opening of religious places and tourist locations has resulted in people booking cabs, which is a good sign. I am slowly getting bookings but I have a long way to go,” said Birajdar. He said once the lockdown started in March, he and his wife moved from Pune to his village Dongergaon in Latur district. “I knew the worst was coming. I have a three-acre farm there and we planned to get into farming full time. I thought that we would somehow be able to brave through the tough times. However, I failed miserably as a farmer,” he added. The heavy rainfall and floods in Latur disrupted Birajdar’s plans. “Our farm was inundated and the crops were completely destroyed. Our home was flooded too. The last few months have been extremely hard on us,” Birajdar shared. With his crops destroyed, he decided to work for other big farmers on daily wages — between Rs 150 to Rs 200 per day. The state government allowed religious places to re-open with riders in mid-November. “As soon as I learnt about it, I hurried back to the city. Since I don’t have much money left, I have had to leave my wife behind in the village. I let travel companies know that I was available for trips. In the last month, I have been able to get three to four trips. I hope things get better soon and I can bring my wife to the city so life becomes as it was again,” Birajdar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cabbie-turned-farmer-back-behind-the-wheel-after-nine-month-struggle/articleshow/79846671.cms||Joy Sengupta

The elections are expected to be held in March 2021. Sinne the bypolls results can be used as a midterm mandate against the government, the BJP is not leaving any stone unturned to win all the three seats. The seats fell vacant after the death of three MLAs – Kailesh Trivedi from Sahara, Bhanwar Lal Meghwal from Sujangarh and Kiran Maheshwari from Rajsamand. Sources said the BJP is holding deliberations from division level leaders to respective district presidents and taking feedback from grassroots workers to veteran leaders. The party’s performance in the gram panchayat and municipal polls held in the last two months remained below expectations. Party incharge Arun Singh in his maiden visit last week has asked the party leaders to be ready for all forms of polls and is visiting in January to hold a meeting with the core state committee members relating to the bypolls. Finding winnable candidates in all the three seats is subject to the probable list of candidates the Congress willfield on these seats, said a BJP leader, who is working on issues, aspirartions and trend on one of three seats. Meanwhile, the BJP is finalizing its 21 committees and sub-committees to strengthen its state team. Party state president Satish Poonia has divided its existing committees to adjust more members and to diversify the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/post-municipal-board-poll-flop-bjp-gears-up-for-by-elections/articleshow/79846654.cms||---

The drone will be used by the railway protection force (RPF) for surveillance activities and to keep an eye on developments along the railway tracks. This is first of the three drones that will be in use in the Bhusawal division.“We have one drone and a pilot survey was carried out in the Bhusawal yard recently. This drone will be used for various purposes including protection of assets and safety of passengers,” said senior divisional commercial manager Yuvraj Patil. Divisional security commissioner Kshitij Gurav listed other uses of the drone. He said: “Apart from day and night surveillance, the drone will be used for crowd management, monitoring of engineering projects and other activities especially in case of an accident or emergency.”The drone has a visibility range of 2km on either side and can soar to a height of 200m. In case of rail roko agitations, the drone will be able to give a clearer picture of the situation, help the administration deploy forces accordingly, and aid in crowd management during events like the Kumbh Mela in Nashik. When applied for engineering purposes, the drone will help understand the details of a bridge, or gauge alignment issues. The most important use would be at times of disasters when the drones could be used in rescue and relief operations as well as relaying information back to the headquarters. The RPF personnel are being trained in the operation and maintenance of the drones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhusawal-rail-division-gets-first-drone-for-surveillance/articleshow/79997520.cms||Abhilash Botekar
December 22, 2020||Chandigarh||Haryana villages ensure supplies||ROHTAK/JIND: Villages in the vicinity of Tikri on the Haryana-Delhi border have come out to help farmers from Punjab who have been camping against the three farm laws for the past 25 days. Residents of Noona Majra village, located 3km from the state border, have made elaborate arrangements of stay, warm clothes, hot water and cooked meals for the protesters. Nirmal Singh from Jalandhar, also a member of BKU (Ugrahan), said the Haryana brethren had come as a saviour for them in the cold. “They don’t even let us cook meals and do all things for us,” he said. He described the hospitalitly from Haryanavis as “an amazing experience”. “They are spoiling us with their hospitality and warmth,” he laughed. Similar arrangements for Punjab farmers travelling on Delhi-Rohtak route have been made at Kharawar village. Residents of Kharwar village in Rohtak district have set up kitchens at two points on the highway and made arrangements for night accommodation at the village temple. Capt Jagvir Malik, who is overseeing arrangements, said Kharwar had been doing ‘langar sewa’ since November 26, when farmers first entered the state to reach Tikri border.

December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Hanuman Nagar residents allege misuse of open space for commercial purpose||Nagpur: Residents of ward number 31 under Hanuman Nagar zone are protesting against six different organizations for allegedly usurping a playground in their locality.According to the residents, Hanuman Nagar in ward number 31 has six grounds which were demarcated by the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT). “One of the open spaces was used for opening an NMC school, while another one was developed into a park,” said a vigilant resident Damodar Dharmale. The NIT, which has handed over all open spaces in this part of the city to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), allegedly allotted one of the open spaces to one Grihani Samaj Mandal which later constructed a huge hall.“The mandal later extended parts of the open space to different organizations including Savitribai Phule Cooperative Society, a private public library, Miratai Dasture Hall and Basketball Kridangan Sansthan,” alleged Dharmale.He also claimed that all these organizations are earning in lakhs every month by renting out the premises for commercial use.According to the residents, despite lodging complaints since 2016, no effort was being taken by either NIT or NMC’s Hanuman Nagar zone to remove the encroachments.“Sports can keep our children away from getting into bad habits. So, the government should secure the play area,” said Savita Sakhare, a local resident.A resident with good political connections allegedly managed to take a major portion of the road adjoining the ground on lease to extend his house.Hanuman Nagar zone’s assistant municipal commissioner Sushma Mandge confirmed the development. “The Hanuman Nagar layout was developed by NIT. But we are not sure whether the ground has been handed over to the NMC or not as there was no document pertaining to it,” said Mandge.Mandge said the town planning map shows the place as reserved for open space. “Following complaints from residents, the zone office had once sought information from the NIT to know whether it had allotted the land to any organization, but in vain. Later, we sent two reminders to the NIT seeking details, but are yet to get any information,” she claimed.The assistant municipal commissioner claimed to have also sought information from organizations operating from the open space to submit documents including sanction plans, permissions etc taken for using the land. “Only Grihani Samaj Mandal has submitted reply but it only said about following all terms and conditions laid down by the NIT. It has not shared any document which can prove that NIT had allotted the ground to it,” she said. “Now, the zone office has sought help of town planning department to know for what purpose the land has been kept and whether there is any document related to it,” she said.NIT chairman Sheetal Ugale did not respond to TOI’s call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hanuman-nagar-residents-allege-misuse-of-open-space-for-commercial-purpose/articleshow/79844580.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

December 22, 2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Zonal meeting for better coordination||HYDERABAD: In a bid to improve coordination between various departments and prevent wastage of taxpayer’s money, the government has decided to conduct a weekly zone-wise convergence every Wednesday. Henceforth, before executing any work, GHMC will ensure that the police, water board, electricity and HMRL are informed well in advance. For instance, Banjara Hills road number 1 (near Banjara Hills traffic police station) and the road in front of Babukhan Solitaire (Gachibowli) laid by GHMC were dug within a month by the water board to attend to sewage issues. In the future, the weekly convergence meetings will avoid such wastage of government resources. “Whenever proposals for works like white topping of roads, Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) project works are taken up, the information should be shared with the line departments so the under duct ground cable, laying of pipelines and providing CC camera cable works can be taken up by the respective departments,” read a statement issued by GHMC.  “Only heads of departments, like GHMC commissioner, police commissioner, water board MD etc, used to attend the meeting every Saturday. But still, there was no proper coordination. That’s why we have decided to conduct the meeting at the zonal level,” said a GHMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/zonal-meeting-for-better-coordination/articleshow/79846708.cms||Nabinder Bommala

December 22, 2020||Surat||Court shows mercy to beef sellers, junks their jail term||Surat: Observing that their crime did not ‘affect the society at large,’ the district court in Valsad has shown leniency to two beef sellers by exempting them from serving the the two-year jail term awarded by the trial court. Additional sessions judge M K Dave also observed that as the crime does not affect the society at large, court should be enthusiastic in handing down a punishment in such cases. The court granted benefit of probation to Mahmad Taiyab Abdul Ansari and Jameer Salim Masudi, who were punished with two years in jail by a magisterial court in 2017 after they were caught selling beef in 2016. Both got two years’ jail term and fined with Rs 5,000 before the laws preventing cow slaughter were made more stringent and life imprisonment was prescribed as a punishment. Ansari and Masudi had challenged the lower court’s order, but later they decided to accept the conviction. However, they pleaded for court’s mercy in the punishment in the Probation of Offenders Act by citing their good behaviour and an opportunity to improve themselves. The court called for the probation officer’s report on behaviour of the convicts. The court was informed that after they were booked and convicted, both were working as painters and their behaviour was found satisfactory. The probation officer also recommended leniency in this case. The court accepted the request as well as the probation officer’s report and exempted the convicts from serving the sentence. “It appears that the offence committed by the accused is not punishable with death or imprisonment of life and such offenses have no bearing on the society at large. Therefore, the court should have to be purposive while imposing the punishment, and not to be pedantic,” the court stated in its order. In the same breath, the court also noted that if the the offence committed affects society at large, it should be handled with the iron hand and no leniency or mercy should be considered while imposing the sentence. “But if such offence having no motive to injure the society at large and committed in a peculiar facts and circumstances, prevailing at the time of committing the offence and at the time of deciding imposition of imprisonment are considered and if they are so mitigating then instead of sending the accused behind the bar, he may be given benefit of probation” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/court-shows-mercy-to-beef-sellers-junks-their-jail-term/articleshow/79844629.cms||Vijaysinh Parmar

Chandrapur district and civic authorities have to file a reply about how they will take care of the lacunae highlighted in the PIL.”In the first week of October, the HC had asked both Chandrapur collector and civic chief to file a reply. Though the reply from the civic body came, it was signed by the deputy municipal commissioner (DMC). Later, it came to fore that even the Chandrapur DMC was not authorized to reply on behalf of the civic body.

In the process, the dreams of several sitting corporators, who were looking to get nominated from their respective wards, have been dashed as their wards have now been reserved for candidates of other categories. The existing wards of Satyajeet Kadam of Tararani Aghadi and Sharangdhar Deshmukh of Congress have now been reserved for other categories.

Kadam, who is a two-time corporator, had won in Bhosalewadi-Kadamwadi ward in 2015. Now the ward is reserved for the scheduled category. “I am going to contest from Kadamwadi ward, which is now open.” Deshmukh, also a two-time corporator, had earlier won from the Rankala Lake ward. He said he is now going to contest from Sane Guruji Vasahat, from where he won in 2010. At many wards, the sitting corporators are going to field their female relatives (wife, mother etc.) as their wards are now reserved for women. BJP’s Ajit Thanekar, who had earlier won from Tatakadil Talim ward, is now trying to get a ticket for one his family members. He may himself contest from Mahalaxmi Temple ward.

AAP Punjab co-incharge Raghav Chadha and state president Bhagwant Mann alleged that Capt Amarinder had “made a settlement with the Centre regarding his son’s ED cases” instead of supporting the farmers. “Why a secret meeting was held between Capt and Amit Shah? What had happened in the meeting? The people of Punjab want to know whether he had made a settlement with the Modi government for his son’s ED cases,” Chadha asked. He alleged that as part of a deal with PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, Capt Amarinder was “playing tricks to undermine the farmers’ movement in every way possible”. “After harassing farmers, the Centre is now troubling Punjab businessmen with income-tax raids at their offices and residences, because their only fault was supporting the farmers’ movement and providing them every possible help to make it more powerful,” he said.:||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/deal-between-capt-and-bjp-over-ed-cases-aap/articleshow/79846788.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Pune||Maharashtra: Real estate agent held on charge of stabbing friend, trying to burn body||PUNE: A piece of paper with a cellphone number written on it and a bluetooth device found near a half-burnt body of a man (50) close to a dargah in Baner on November 24 helped the Pimpri Chinchwad police crack the murder case and arrest his friend. “Mehboob Dastagir Shaikh (50), a debt-ridden real estate agent and Kalewadi resident, had stabbed Sandip Mainkar and set him ablaze to fake his own death and setting himself free of creditors,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash told reporters on Monday, citing a joint investigation by the crime branch and the Hinjewadi police. “Shaikh has admitted to the crime plot during questioning by the police,” he added. The cellphone number on the paper helped the police to establish Mainkar’s identity and the bluetooth device belonged to Shaikh. Crime branch inspector Ambarish Deshmukh said, “Mainkar and Shaikh were working together with a pharmaceutical firm in Pimpri Chinchwad about 15 years ago. Shaikh knew that Mainkar was jobless, an alcoholic and not staying with his family. Shaikh probably thought that no one would bother to trace Mainkar and, hence, chose him for his criminal plot.” He said, “We also recovered an affidavit from Shaikh’s possession. It stated that he was ending his life due to heavy debts and his body would be found in the Baner area. It further mentioned names of three persons, including a woman, who were allegedly harassing him for money.” Senior inspector Balkrishna Sawant of the Hinjewadi police said, “We examined the CCTV footage near the crime scene and found that Shaikh and Mankar had reached the spot in the early hours of November 24 on a scooter. But their clothes were different from what we found on the victim’s body.” Deshmuk said, “We were also checking the missing person’s complaints when we realized that Shaikh’s first of his two wives had on November 25 reported him missing and lodged a complaint with the Wakad police. The following day, a cheating complaint was filed against Shaikh with the same police station.” He said, “Our team then visited Shaikh’s house and realised that Shaikh and his second wife were missing. We found the case of the bluetooth device, which was found near the body, from the house of Shaikh’s first wife. Shaikh had kept his cellphone switched off. But his wife had kept her cellphone on and it showed them travelling to Osmaband, Ajmer and Delhi. She was throughout frequently calling a cellphone number, which was traced as Shaikh’s old number he had reactivated." A police team went to Delhi, but Shaikh and his wife had by then left for Pune by Jhelum Express. The officer said, “Another police team was then sent to the Daund railway station in anticipation that Shaikh may get down there, and its members took him into custody from the train.” Deshmukh said, “A CCTV footage showed that on November 23 Shaikh and Mainkar arrived at his second wife’s home and they left after sometime. Shaikh was carrying a backpack with him. The two travelled to different parts of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad and Shaikh constantly gave alcohol to Mainkar. They reached the murder spot in the early hours. Though Mainkar was sozzled, Shaikh gave him more liquor before stabbing him to death. He then changed Mainkar’s clothes and set the body on fire.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/real-estate-agent-held-on-charge-of-stabbing-friend-trying-to-burn-body/articleshow/79846768.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Nagpur||Tiger sighted on overburden of Neeljai Coal Mine||Chandrapur: Tiger sighting in WCL Neeljai coal mine, located at the district border on Ghugus-Wani road, has terrorized miners. As there is no forest nearby, experts suspect the tiger might be one that has migrated out of urban habitat of Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station or WCL shrubby forests in Chandrapur. Sources said the tiger was sighted on the overburden dump near coal handling plant of Neeljai mine, which falls under Wani North area of WCL. Many WCL employees were witness to the tiger prowling over the OB hill and many caught it in their mobile cameras. CCF Chandrapur NR Pravin claimed they have no clue from where this tiger migrated to the Neeljai mine. He informed that there is regular presence of tigress with cubs near Ghugus, which live in shrubby forests on the overburden dumps of WCL mines. As foresters are not able to monitor the tigers in CSTPS properly due to lack of access in the shrubby forest in plant premises, they are not certain whether the tiger in Neeljai has migrated from here. State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre claimed that presence of tigers in urban habitats like CSTPS and WCL shrubby forest is booming in Chandrapur. “It is certainly one of the tigers that has migrated from urban habitat, as tigers from natural forest cannot adapt to this shrubby jungle on WCL overburdens,” he explained.Dhotre informed that there is similar tiger presence in mining areas close to Bhadrawati, Ghugus, Majri, Sasti and Wani. This phenomenon of urban tigers needs to be addressed in focused manner, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-sighted-on-overburden-of-neeljai-coal-mine/articleshow/79844626.cms||Mazhar Ali

December 22, 2020||Goa||If zilla panchayat members perform, they can be future MLAs: Goa CM||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said that if zilla panchayat (ZP) members perform well during their tenure, they have a bright chance of becoming future legislators. “There is scope for them to become MLAs,” he said. Sawant also said that the state government will construct two new zilla bhavans in the next five years for zilla panchayats. The chief minister, who was present at the oath-taking ceremony for ZP members, said that the process to devolve more powers to zilla panchayats in the state has already begun. TOI had first reported that the government has decided to give more powers to ZPs. In the past couple of years, ZP members have been demanding additional powers and increase in funds to take up development works in the state. In recently-concluded zilla polls, BJP won 19 of the 25 seats in North Goa and 14 of the 24 seats of the South Goa zilla panchayat, with election to one seat being countermanded following the death of a Congress candidate. “People of the state have elected you due to your popularity,” Sawant told the new zilla members. Sawant said that in the three-tier system of governance, zilla panchayats are between village panchayats and MLAs, and even though there are limitations for ZP members, that does not prevent them from performing. The chief minister said that the panchayats minister and panchayats director have begun discussions on granting additional powers to zilla panchayats. Sawant said that from January 12 to 15, Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development (GIPARD) will provide training to newly-elected zilla members. “It is important for all the ZP members to attend the training to know how one can work in rural areas,” he said. Sawant told the newly-elected members that he has no intention of playing politics with them, and rather he is focussed on working for the development of rural areas. “My government will fully support ZP members,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-zp-members-perform-they-can-be-future-mlas-cm/articleshow/79846833.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Pune||Winter crops’ water release begins from Khadakwasla||Pune: The first winter rotation of water discharge from Khadakwasla reservoir began on Monday.The state water resources (formerly irrigation) department initiated release of water into the Mutha canal at 1,000 cusec. Officials said the extended monsoon this year delayed water release by nearly two months. Water is likely to be continuously released over the next month. Each year, during the winter rotation, around 4 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water is released from Khadakwasla. Officials expect less water to be released this year. “The overall water availability in the rural areas has been fairly good due to the late withdrawal of the monsoon. Some water sources in these areas — wells, ponds and the like — are well-stocked. The water saved during these rotations will be utilized in the summer,” an official said.Water for irrigation is released from Khadakwasla in two rotations in winter and two during the summer.The collective stock in four reservoirs — Khadakwasla, Varasgaon, Panshet and Temghar — currently stands at 91% of the total capacity of 29.14 TMC, which is a little more than the 88% storage this time last year. The department said the winter rotation will not affect water supply to Pune, and that PMC will continue to receive its daily quota through the closed pipeline. “We have received demand for water release (from the rural areas) in the past few days. It will be supplied under the head-to-tail method from Indapur to Haveli,” an official said. The water resources department further said repairs to the canal have been carried out at most locations in advance of the release. “Now, the remainder of the work will be completed after the end of the first rotation,” he added.Meanwhile, the canal committee, which was supposed to meet this month under the chairmanship of guardian minister Ajit Pawar, is likely to meet next month due to the gram panchayat elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/winter-crops-water-release-begins-from-khadakwasla/articleshow/79846760.cms||---

The Badi river originates from Anasagar Lake here and Rs 5.29 crore will be spent on the initiative under smart city project.

It will also develop forest and green cover and will provide a walking track to the locals. The project will be taken up under two stages, wherein in the first stage, the river front from Pushkar Road to RK Puram will be developed, and in the later stage, there will be fencing on the border of Badi River so that there will be a walking trail for people. During these two stages, there will be forestation as well. Sources said that at present, there are encroachments in the catchment area of the river and the fencing will curb the encroachments. The second stage includes development from RK Puram to Foy Sagar, under NREGA and other projects. Official said that the motive is to save the river from encroachments and to bring back the ecological system back on track.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-5-29-crore-badi-riverfront-project-in-ajmer-kicks-off/articleshow/79846763.cms||---

He said that the Centre has reduced the state’s share in drinking water at every doorstep from 90% to 45%. Choudhary said that Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has made the scheme of ‘drinking water at every doorstep’ in an unjustified manner. Choudhary added that instead of helping Rajasthan with water problem the state government has been accused of spending less amount from its share on the issue. Talking on political appointments and election for organisational posts he said it will all be done at the right time. “Ashok Gehlot is our chief minister and will remain so for the next three years. There is no faction in Congress. About infighting in the party during panchayat elections the organisation is taking cognisance of it,” he said. He also said that Rahul Gandhi had earlier resigned as party president on moral grounds but today’s situation (farmers’ bill, economy) demands a leader like Rahul. “Everyone feels that Rahul should lead Congress and the country,” said Choudhary.Choudhary also spoke about RLP leader Hanuman Beniwal’s stand on the farmers’ bill. He said, “What is it that he (Beniwal) wants? On one hand he supports farmers’ protest, on the other his party is BJP’s ally. Why does he want time till December 26, a decision in farmers’ favour should be taken immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-is-our-cm-and-will-remain-so-for-3-yrs/articleshow/79846778.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An official statement from the sugar commissionerate stated that 165 sugar factories in the state have undertaken crushing and have crushed around 186 lakh tonne cane in the current season. The total value of the crushed cane in Maharashtra is around Rs 4,148 crore but the factories have paid only Rs 2,169 till December 15. The statement further states that 48 factories in Maharashtra have made full payment to the farmers, while 14 had made 80% to 99% payment. Last year, around 213 lakh tonne cane was crushed till December, while it was 186 lakh tonne crushing has been done till now this year. The factories already have arrears of Rs 356 crore from last year. The number of sugar factories, which were in operation in the previous season was only 67, while it was much higher this year. Sugar expert P G Medhe said that with a higher number of factories in operation this year, they were expecting more sugar production. However, the sugar factories have seen arrival of as many cane cutters from Marathwada region. Jayprakash Dandegaonkar, chairman of Maharashtra state cooperative sugar factories federation ltd, had earleir told TOI that there had been a drop in the number of migrant cane cutters arriving in western Maharashtra. This has impacted the overall crushing. The three districts of western Maharashtra — Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur — have around 57 private and cooperative sugar factories and almost all of them have commenced operations this season. The cane crushed from these districts has a higher recovery rate and bring more money. Usually, thousands of workers involved in cane cutting move to these parts of western Maharashtra for work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/one-month-into-season-sugar-factories-owe-nearly-rs-2k-cr-to-cane-farmers/articleshow/79844633.cms||---

Carrying a plastic net on his shoulder, he marched towards the river. Just like him, hundreds of others involved in the illegal fishing reach the Ganga bank every evening, get on to their rickety boats and cast the empty nets into the water. Only to pull them out the next morning, loaded with fish some of which would have otherwise ended in the stomach of endangered dolphins and gharials which populate the 40-km river stretch between Balawali and Ganj area.Several fish markets are thriving in villages close to the Ganga river.The rampant illegal fishing is threatening the biodiversity of the region, and derailing the attempts to save the endangered species, officials say.During the recent counting of dolphins in the Ganga stretch, the teams of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) seized five such nests in Bijnor.Uttar Pradesh’s chief wildlife warden Sunil Pandey had recently pointed out the menace in Muzaffarnagar and Bijnor and had even directed divisional forest officers (DFOs) of the two districts to constitute a task force to curb the illegal fishing activity.Muzaffarnagar police took the initiative and used recently-launched Jal Safari boats to increase patrolling in Haiderpur wetland, but Bijnor is yet to take a step.“The illegal fishing is eating up the main food source of dolphin, gharial as well as of the endangered turtles,” a forest official said. Officials say that dolphins are generally not killed for meat, but the possibility of their getting trapped in these nets is high.“And often, the turtles caught in the net are dumped on the bank of the river near the barrage by the fishermen,” he said.When contacted, Bijnor DFO M Semmaran said, “We are planning raids to check fishing in the sanctuary area. Strict action will be taken against those found indulged in fishing. Besides, I have already written a letter to authorities for the cancellation of licence of fish market at Navalpur.”This year, 41 freshwater Gangetic dolphins were spotted in the region, six more than last year's tally of 35.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/illegal-fishing-in-gangas-protected-stretch-posing-threat-to-dolphin-gharial-turtles/articleshow/79844640.cms||Harveer Dabas
December 22, 2020||Meerut||Hastinapur to showcase Mahabharata for Ayodhya-like revival||Meerut: If Ayodhya is associated with “Ram rajya”, then Hastinapur is considered to be Krishna’s “karmbhoomi”. Both cities have a special place in the Indian psyche. But while Ayodhya has been the centre of political and legal attention since 1992 following the Babri masjid demolition, Hastinapur is just a dot on the map. Post-2019 Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhya dispute, both Centre and state governments have pulled out all the stops to rejuvenate this town with an aim to make it a major pilgrimage and cultural centre. Hastinapur, on the other hand, continues to be a small sleepy town glorified in movie sets. Now, a group of historians, bureaucrats, politicians and tinsel town producers have come together to work out a strategy to catapult Hastinapur into the limelight to match “the Mahabharata days”. "Efforts are on to position the capital of the Kauravas and centre of action in Mahabharata, at the national level,” said Mukhiya Gujjar, president of the Hastinapur Sanskritik Foundation, an NGO that has roped in region's historians to look into the historical aspects of the neglected town. Kulwinder Singh, district board chairman, said, "Four months from now, a huge audio-visual of Mahabharata scenes will be organized on the lines of what we witnessed in Ayodhya earlier. Renowned stage actors will play as Mahabharata characters with a focus on Hastinapur. It will be televised on Doordarshan. The script is being written and a production company from Mumbai has also been engaged. Pankaj Sharma, organizer of Ram Leela in Delhi, has also been roped in.” A member of the organizing committee, Amit Pathak, said, "This will be the first time ever when episodes associated with the Mahabharat will be performed on stage in Hastinapur. The focus will also be on enacting legendary incidents associated with west UP sites like Lakshagrah and Parikshitgarh -- all within 40-km radius of Hastinapur.” Another member KK Sharma, a professor of history at Multanimal Modi College in Modinagar, said, "Apart from being a site of religious importance for Hindus, Hastinapur is a significant archaeological site. The only major excavation that has taken place here was in the early 50s. Now, with Meerut being an ASI circle, we hope to draw government attention towards it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hastinapur-to-showcase-mahabharata-for-ayodhya-like-revival/articleshow/79844638.cms||Sandeep Rai
December 22, 2020||Chandigarh||I-T notice for Panipat arhtiya assn head||Chandigarh: After 14 commission agents in Punjab, Panipat Arhtiyas Association president too has been served with a notice by the income tax (I-T) department. Other commission agents in Haryana have come out in support of the Panipat body chief, calling it a pressure tactic of the Centre. “This is to suppress our voice. However, what the central government doesn’t understand is that it’s only due to the farmers that arhtiyas can exist,” claimed Panipat Arhtiyas Association head Dharambir Singh Malik, who got the notice on Monday. He alleged that he had received the notice for supporting farmers’ protest. “I have come out in open, but there could be other commission agents who got such notices too. We shall respond to the notices,” he added. Jind Arhtiya Association president Rajpal Singh echoed Malik. “What else can you expect from this government? They will do their best to break the agitation, but we shall continue to support it to ensure it ends in the favour of farmers,” said Singh. Similarly, Ambala Arhtiya Association president Duni Chand said, “Instead of harassing us or the farmers, the government should accept their demands.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/i-t-notice-for-panipat-arhtiya-assn-head/articleshow/79846861.cms||Manvir Saini

December 22, 2020||Pune||PMC plans to utilise Covid care staffers||PUNE: Private paramedical staffers appointed at the Covid-19 care centres might soon be part of the civic health services. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is contemplating to utilize the services of the nurses, ward boys and other support staffers in its hospitals and extend the contract of their services, even after the closure of Covid-19 care centres. The civic body has tabled a proposal on the arrangement to the standing committee. The proposal stated, “The civic administration needs their service. An extension of six more months should be given to them. They are currently attached with PMC hospitals.” Dr Sanjeev Wavare, a senior official in the PMC’s health department, said, “The decision about contract extension will be taken by the standing committee. If approved, the proposal will be implemented through the labour department.” The PMC had started 21 Covid-19 care centres. Of these, only two facilities are currently operating following the steady decline in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-to-utilize-covid-care-staffers/articleshow/79846831.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Pune||My mother played a big role in my life: Paranjpye||PUNE: Veteran screenwriter and filmmaker Sai Paranjpye reminisced about the role her mother Shakuntala played in her life and career and her unique and often challenging childhood at an interaction organised by the Pune International Centre. “Everything creative that I do in life begins with her. You can find her footprints in every little creations of mine. I was brought up in very strict atmosphere, and I would receive a spanking almost daily for every small misdemeanour,” Paranjpye told writer and editor Latika Padgaonkar. The interaction was organised to mark the launch of Paranjpye’s book A Patchwork Quilt, which captures her journey in television and film. Shakuntala, the Cambridge-educated writer, social activist, and later Rajya Sabha MP, raised Paranjpye alone, after her divorce from Russian painter Youra Sleptzoff. “My mother had focused all her energy and creativity on me -- her only child. I had to learn to dance, I used to learn painting, I was thrown into the Tilak tank for an hour-and-a-half every day for me to learn swimming, and I had to learn horse riding,” she said. She even sent me to Mirashi Buwa to learn classical music, and we never got past Raga Asawari because I could not sing. Much to my sorrow, she discovered that I could write. So, I was made to write three pages a day,” she said, calling her mother a “benevolent tyrant”. She also recalled her mother’s “over-the-top arrangements” for her doll’s wedding. “But she didn’t turn up for my wedding,” Paranjpye said. Paranjpye also spoke about her time at the National School of Drama and being influenced in art and theatre by playwright Ebrahim Alkazi. She also spoke about her work at the All India Radio as well as her work in children’s film, television, and theatre. She served twice as chair of the Children’s Film Society of India and made four films for the organisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/my-mother-played-a-big-role-in-my-life-paranjpye/articleshow/79846814.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
December 22, 2020||Chennai||Why bigger storms are brewing in the bay||CHENNAI: When very severe cyclonic storm Nivar made landfall last month, meteorologists and authorities heaved a sigh of relief, as the storm was not as intense as anticipated. But climate scientists observed that it left a recurrent pattern which could lead to something more sinister. The weather system moved two stages up from depression to deep depression and later into a cyclonic storm in about 24 hours. Scientists term this development rapid intensification, driven by climate change and ocean warming. This trend can be deadly as it gives very little time for authorities to prepare for the worst.Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, (IITM), said researchers have observed rapid intensification of cyclones in recent years, such as cyclones Amphan and Ockhi, which strengthened within 24 hours. And with global warming not slowing, there could be more cyclones rapidly intensifying in the future. A cyclone has rapidly intensified if wind speeds increase by 55kmph in 24 hours. “These storms intensify faster than what we expect or the models forecast, so we have less time to be prepared for it. Ockhi didn’t give us the time to respond in terms of disaster management,” Koll said. “Ocean warming may not stop and all climate models show that Indian Ocean is going to warm at the same rate or more in the coming years. There are high chances of rapid intensification of cyclones in future,” he said. As cyclones draw energy from warm waters, Koll said rapid warming of Indian Ocean in recent decades due to climate change is making the region conducive to cyclones and rapid intensification. Studies have shown that Indian Ocean has experienced rapid warming with an average rise of 1ºC in sea surface temperature during 1951-2015 when the global sea surface temperature warmed about 0.7 ºC. Bay of Bengal is already in the warm pool region with sea surface temperatures around 28-29 ºC and at times touching 30 ºC. In May 2020, a few days before Amphan, data buoys in north Bay of Bengal measured record high surface temperatures between 32-34 ºC. “A warm ocean is like a heat engine for these cyclones. As soon as they make landfall, they lose their source of energy and with friction, they die. When we have warmer than usual waters, it keeps feeding that heat for the cyclones to intensify faster,” Koll said. While the Bay of Bengal may have seen changes in the intensity of storms, Arabian Sea, cooler than the Bay, is brewing more number of cyclones because parts of the sea are getting warmer. Its western parts are getting as warm as Bay of Bengal. Cyclones formed particularly in November-end or December, have more chances of hitting Tamil Nadu coast due to the movement of equatorial trough or a belt of low pressure from near the Bengal coast to closer to the equator. “The track of cyclones can be everywhere during the northeast monsoon. As the equatorial trough makes its southward journey, storms could move towards Tamil Nadu, AP, Odisha, Bengal, Bangladesh or Myanmar during October. But when the northeast monsoon advances, systems form in lower latitudes of the east coast which means they could move towards south AP or TN,” said Y E A Raj, former deputy director general, IMD. Researchers said incorporating data on ocean sub-surface temperatures in the existing models and strengthening the existing ocean observation systems across the Indian Ocean region could help forecast rapid intensification. M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, said the present models occasionally pick up rapid intensification as they are run only with data on atmospheric conditions. Forecasting rapid intensification of cyclones requires incorporating data on ocean conditions into the models. “We now have a regional coupled model called Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting, which uses both atmospheric and ocean parameters, developed with the help of the US. It is operational in IMD. But doing a detailed analysis on rapid intensification and to check if the models are picking it up may take some time. IMD is already on the job,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-bigger-storms-are-brewing-in-the-bay/articleshow/79845568.cms||U Tejonmayam

Mentioning that the central government was resorting to scare tactics, a five-member delegation of arhtiyas will leave for Singhu border to decide about the future course of action in consultation with the farmers. Several questions have been raised on this action by the commission agents of the state, in addition to terming this to be an act to scare them to back out of farmers’ agitation. Some of the businessmen are of the view that use of CRPF raises suspicion that this action was conducted at the behest of the central government. Meanwhile, the farmers protesting at the borders of Delhi have extended full support to the arhtiyas and termed the action unjustified. They have warned the IT department and the central government that if any further action or any other raid is conducted on arhityas of Punjab, then farmers will not let this happen and gherao the department officials. Meanwhile, the commission agents have decided to go on strike from December 22 till December 25 at some mandis. Ever since Monday morning, the shops and offices of arhtiyas located in various mandis of the district remained closed. Though the local commission agents and office-bearers of the associations of arhtiyas refused to say anything on their agitation, while speaking to TOI, Amarjit Singh Brar, senior vice president, Federation of Arhitya Associations, Punjab, said, “The farmers’ agitation has turned into a ‘jan andolan’ and every Punjabi is making his contribution for this cause. In same way the arhtiyas are supporting this agitation, so that the farmers can get back their rights. The recent action by the income tax department on the arhtiyas seems to have been planned to deter us from supporting the farmers as there is no point conducting raids on us since all of us file income tax returns and comply with the law.” Brar added that, “But in spite of this, the IT department and the central government indulged in pick-and-choose policy and after pin-pointing some prominent arhtiya leaders of every mandi they indulged in scaring tactics by conducting raids on us by sending more than 150 officers and para-military force personnel to each arhtiya’s office. The Centre cannot deny its involvement in this as the IT department use CRPF personnel were involved in this action when otherwise they usually use local police force if required.” He further said, “Moreover, the CRPF personnel had come in vehicles with UP numbers, whereas normally the vehicles should have Delhi number if the forces were called all of sudden. This clearly shows that this was a planned operation, which had full backing of the Centre and was only aimed at terrorising us. But both arhtiyas and farmers are brothers in arms and we will not withdraw our support to the farmers. All major farmer associations too have been calling us ever since they heard about this misadventure of the IT department. Along with declaring that any further IT action on arhtiyas will be met with full resistance by farmers, they have also called our delegation to decide our future course of action and a five-member team of ours will be going to Singhu border to finalise it after consulting the farmer associations. Meanwhile, arhtiyas all over Punjab will be on strike till December 25.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/arhtiyas-strike-work-against-recent-raids-claim-it-ac-act-to-scare/articleshow/79845575.cms||Mohit Behl
December 22, 2020||Goa||Godinho tells ZP members to work unitedly for devpt||Panaji: Panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho on Monday said that the state government will give more powers to zilla panchayats to take up development work. Godinho said that the government will continue to support ZPs through schemes and funds. “I am of the opinion that zilla panchayats' powers have to be increased, and we will increase them,” he said and added that the government has already increased the funds allocated to ZP bodies. He said that most ZP members also become MLAs. Godinho said that he will continue support ZP members. There is a debate whether the three-tier system is required in the state, but it is a reality and all ZP members should work together for development in their respective ZP constituencies, the minister said at the oath taking ceremony of newly-elected ZP members. “Panchayats will do their work, but ZP members also should take up development work. If an MLA, panchayat and ZP members work together then one can imagine what kind of development Goa can see,” he said. Godinho asked the members to continue doing good work so that people recognise you. There is always a discussion whether ZPs should be given more powers, but in reality, it is up to you to get it, the minister said. “If you work then people will talk that ZPs are doing a good job. We had given the previous ZP, the task of lifting garbage and the members have done good work,” he said. Godinho said that the 15th Finance Commission had sanctioned Rs 75 crore for panchayat bodies and 15% of Rs 75 crore will be given directly to the ZPs.  “People have spoken through each elected member and people have recognised the work of the BJP-led government,” the minister said. Godinho said that while campaigning, he found that people had various objections. “However, when we gave them satisfactory explanations, they realised what is right and they voted accordingly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/godinho-tells-zp-members-to-work-unitedly-for-devpt/articleshow/79846899.cms||---

December 22, 2020||Meerut||Register to extract groundwater, Bijnor industrial units told||BIJNOR: With groundwater levels rapidly depleting in Nahtaur, Noorpur, Jaleelpur and Seohara in Bijnor district, the authorities have directed all industrial units to register online if they wish to extract water. They have been warned of stern action if caught drawing groundwater without registering. Ramakant Pandey, Bijnor district magistrate, said uncontrolled and rapid extraction of groundwater has resulted in water levels in many parts of the state to drop drastically. Now, under the Uttar Pradesh groundwater (management and regulation) Act, 2019, aimed at ensuring continuous management of quantitative and qualitative groundwater in critical areas of the state, it would be mandatory for existing commercial, industrial and infrastructural units to register on a portal prescribed for the use of groundwater. The Act would not be applicable to domestic and agricultural users of groundwater, he added. Under the Act, applicants would have to deposit a fixed fee of Rs 5,000 for registration for commercial use of groundwater. Anyone found extracting water without registration would be penalized, he warned. Citing government data, officials said around one-third districts in UP have been declared as “dark zone” areas with extremely low groundwater level. A total of 271 development blocks in 22 districts of the state have been identified with fast depleting groundwater level. Of the total blocks in the “dark zone”, 113 are placed in “over exploited” category, 59 in “critical” and 99 in “semi critical” category. In west UP, groundwater table is dipping by 25cm to 30cm every year because of over-exploitation, the officials said. “Over-exploited” refers to groundwater being extracted more than what’s recharged, “critical”, where the groundwater taken out is 90-100% of what's recharged and “semi-critical”, where extraction rate is 70%-90%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/register-to-extract-groundwater-bijnor-industrial-units-told/articleshow/79844646.cms||Harveer Dabas

December 22, 2020||Ludhiana||Cong leaders join strike with Hindu bodies||Ludhiana: In a unique show of bonhomie, Congress leaders led by joint coordinator of Kisan Congress Gursimran Singh Mand sat on a 24-hour strike, along with representatives of several Hindu organisations like Shiv Sena Hindustan, Mahadev Sena, etc. The main agenda of this hunger strike, which is being organised at Jagraon bridge, is to show solidarity with the farmers protesting near Delhi against the central government’s farmer laws. Speaking on the occasion, Mand said, “We have started this hunger strike against the BJP government’s anti-farmer laws, which have been passed to benefit corporates and destroy the farmers of the country. By organising this hunger strike we want to let the farmers of the country know that the Congress and people of Punjab stand shoulder to shoulder with the farmers who are our ‘anndatas’. Come what may, we will oppose any attempt by the central government to go ahead with its forced decision on the farmers.” Replying to the question on why he was protesting alongside the organisations which were often seen as the right wing, Mand said, “The cause for which we are on a hunger strike is a very noble cause and every citizen of India should stand for it alongside the farmers. So, as far as any organisation which is in support of farmers, I have no hesitation in joining them in the protest. Moreover, this should not be made an issue at this point of time when farmers of our country are suffering. Instead, people from all walks of life should come together to get these anti-farmer laws repealed at the earliest, so that our farmers, who are battling against all odds should return back to their homes.” Others who joined this agitation include Shiv Sena Hindustan’s Chaderkant Chadda, former Youth Congress president, Ludhiana, Komal Khanna, Mahadev Sena’s, Punjab, Lucky Kapoor, Shiv Sena Hind’s Yogesh Bhakshi and Janta di Awaaz’s Rajeev Saggar and Raman Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cong-leaders-join-strike-with-hindu-bodies/articleshow/79845576.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Pune||Crowd chaos led to gaur’s death: Limaye||Pune: State additional principal chief conservator of forest Sunil Limaye on Monday said effective crowd management could have saved the life of a gaur that died due to overexertion caused by continuous running after straying into a housing society in the city. The gaur had on December 11 strayed into a housing society in Kothrud and ran over 3km for more than four hours before it was tranquillized and captured by forest officials with hundreds of people around. The animal could not be revived and it died. “The most challenging aspect during the rescue operation was crowd management. We could have captured the animal early and probably saved it, if the crowd had been handled properly,” Limaye told TOI.  On the recent killing of the “man-eater” leopard in Solapur, Limaye said the forest officials had tried their best to capture the animal alive, but it evaded all traps. “Gunning down the animal was our last option,” he said. Limaye was the chief guest at a day-long training session on wildlife conflict management programme organized by RESQ, an NGO, at Bhukum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crowd-chaos-led-to-gaurs-death-limaye/articleshow/79846836.cms||Sandip Dighe
December 22, 2020||Patna||Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad asks banks in Bihar to accelerate loaning activities||PATNA: Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad on Monday asked the banks to improve their performance and achieve the target by accelerating loaning activities in the state. Addressing the state level bankers’ committee (SLBC) meeting to review the current position of the loaning activities against the target set under the annual credit plan (ACP) for the 2020-21 financial year, he noted with concern that the achievements made by various banks under the ACP for the current fiscal has been only 34% against the target, while 18 banks had underperformed as a result of which the credit-deposit (CD) ratio remained only around 43%. Further, he said the loaning activities in as many as 10 districts have been less than the average, Prasad added. The representative of the RBI and several other banks also participated in the meeting. The DMs and managers of the lead banks were connected through videoconferencing. Earlier, finance department principal secretary S Siddharth presented the detailed update on the actual position with respect to the loaning activities under the ACP 2020-21, status of CD ratio and loan disbursement under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC). Prasad, who is also the state’s finance minister, asked the bankers to accelerate loaning activities during the remaining period of the current financial year, so that the targets set against various heads of loan disbursement are achieved. He also pointed to the ambitious programme of the state government that has been defined under atmnirbhar Bihar and seven resolves-2, noting that they would require active cooperation of the bankers. Further, the state government has also planned to set up separate skill development and entrepreneurship promotion department to give a proper thrust to the implementation of the programme, he said. Addressing the concerns of the bankers with regard to the delay in loan repayment, Prasad said persons who applied for and received loans, in many cases, were ignorant of the technical aspects and, therefore, a mechanism should be set up to give training to the loanees and inform them about the issues related to repayment. He said the state and district level bankers’ committee meetings were being held, but the block level meetings were not being organized, as a result of which the problems remained unresolved. Among those who participated in the deliberations of the SLBC meet was animal and fisheries resources development minister Mukesh Sahani, finance department principal secretary S Siddharth, additional chief secretary for the industries department Brajesh Mehrotra and heads of other departments, including agriculture, minority welfare and rural development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dy-cm-asks-banks-in-state-to-accelerate-loaning-activities/articleshow/79844824.cms||Abhay Singh

December 22, 2020||Surat||Uterine fibroids is not infertility: Court||Surat: Pulling up the insurer for rejecting a mediclaim based on theoretical assumptions, the Navsari District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission ordered the insurance firm to pay the claimant the full amount of medical bill along with seven percent interest. Besides the full amount of Rs 98,624 with 7% interest since April 25, 2019, the court ordered the insurer to pay the policy holder Rs 3000 as compensation.According to the case, Yatin Khatri, 24, a resident of Navsari town lodged a complaint with Navsari district dispute redressal commission against Ifco-Tokio General Insurance Co Ltd. He had purchased ‘Winder plan’ a mediclaim policy for Rs 5.5 lakh with sum assured of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 50,000 cumulative bonus for the period of one year between October 18, 2017 and October 17, 2018.During the policy period, Khatri’s wife suffered severe stomach pain and bleeding due to irregular periods and had to be admitted to Ramaben hospital in Navsari town on March 26, 2018. She was operated upon for ‘uterine fibroids; right gartner’s cyst’ and three days later was discharged from hospital on March 28. Khatri paid the hospital Rs 98,824 as medical expenses.Later, Khatri submitted his claim to the insurance co for reimbursement. But the firm denied the claim with the argument that the policy holder’s wife had taken ‘infertility’ treatment which is not permitted as per the clause.“As per the medical record, the woman had ‘uterine fibroids; right gartner’s cyst’ for which she was operated upon and discharged on March 28. The couple had married three years ago and she had to undergo medical treatment due to infertility. Therefore, as per the insurance policy’s clause, expenses on treatment arising from or traceable to pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage, abortion, or complications of any of these including caesarean section and any infertility, sub fertility or assisted conception treatment, cannot be entertained,” the insurance co stated.However, Khatri’s lawyer argued that his claim should be reimbursed as the wife had taken medical treatment for ‘pelvic pain and painful periods’ and not for infertility. Therefore, it was deficiency in services and unfair trade practices on part of the insurer.Hearing both the arguments, the court observed, “Even if someone is suffering from uterine fibroids, right gartner’s cyst’, one can still conceive a child. Therefore, the argument on basis of an assumption that she had taken a medical treatment for infertility can’t be believed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/uterine-fibroids-is-not-infertility-court/articleshow/79844730.cms||Vijaysinh Parmar

December 22, 2020||India||Central govt’s big plans to celebrate Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary||NEW DELHI: The Modi government on Monday decided to constitute a high-level committee headed by home minister Amit Shah to commemorate the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The panel will work out activities for year-long commemoration starting on January 23 next year. “Netaji Subhas Bose’s bravery is well known. A scholar, soldier and statesman par excellence, we are soon to commence his 125th Jayanti celebrations. For that, a high-level committee has been formed. Come, let us mark this special occasion in a grand manner,” PM Narendra Modi tweeted. The kick-off will coincide with the build-up for West Bengal polls which will see CM Mamata Banerjee having to fend off a determined challenge from BJP which she has dubbed as “outsider”. The authorship of the celebrations of 125th birth anniversary of Bose, whose heroic resistance to British rule continues to dominate the imagination of people in Bengal as well as elsewhere, is sure to be seen as meant to facilitate BJP’s effort in the state.  Home minister had on Saturday paid glowing tributes to Khudiram Bose, another iconic freedom fighter from West Bengal who was hanged when he was just 18. The members of the high level commemoration committee will include experts, historians, authors, family members of Netaji as well as eminent people associated with Azad Hind Fauj/INA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/central-govts-big-plans-to-celebrate-netajis-125th-birth-anniversary/articleshow/79848479.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Kolhapur||Shower facilities for Dudh Katta owners on cards||Kolhapur: Dudh Katta owners will soon get shower facilities to clean their bovines after the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), in order to keep the Panchaganga river clean, has strictly asked the cattle owners to refrain from venturing near the waterbody. Most of the cattle owners run Dudh Katta — places at crossroads in old city areas where they milch cows and buffaloes and sell the fresh, warm milk to the tourists and wrestlers. Over 350 cattle owners run several Dudh Kattas in the city for the past several decades and take their cattle to the river to wash. However, the Bombay high court in 2005 banned all washing activities in the river way back. But the authorities have however overlooked such activities. Now, civic chief Kadambari Balkawade has ordered not to allow any activity — washing cattle, clothes and vehicles along river bank — that causes pollution of the waterbody. After cattle owners opposed the directions, the civic body has installed barricades and security men are deployed along the routes heading to the river. City MLA Chandrakant Jadhav met the cattle owners on Sunday.“I have spoken to civic chief and soon a meeting will be called to resolve the issue. We are going to install shower facilty for the cattle owners. Since cows and buffaloes are used to give milk to the tourists and wrestlers, they need to be washed and kept clean regularly,” he said. The KMC has formed four teams to keep a watch on any pollution causing activities. The teams also have a cop from nearest police station. The teams will regularly visit Panchganga river ghats, Kotitirth Lake, Rankala Lake and Rajaram Talav. The citizens have also been asked not to throw waste in the water bodies and if found violating the order, they will be penalised along with police action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shower-facilities-for-dudh-katta-owners-on-cards/articleshow/79844683.cms||---

When we caught him, he said the bird was injured and was dying. We don’t believe it because people don’t cook dead birds.”Crow pheasant, also called greater coucal, is a member of the cuckoo family. It is one of the many birds that visit the Pallipalayam lake in winter, along with painted stork, cormorants and coots.A team led by an assistant conservator of forests is heading the investigation, district forest officer Venkatesh Durairaj said. “Since the lake is owned by the public works department, we can’t keep monitoring the area. But if we find a schedule species is poached, we will take action,” he said.The bund area became polluted after the Tasmac outlet was set up there two years ago, urban conservationist Shobhana T J said. “Broken glass bottles are everywhere, so are plastic food packets and bags.”The number of birds visiting the lake has come down drastically, said a Vilankurichi resident, who regularly visits the lake.“The liquor outlet should be closed and the forest department should depute anti-poaching watchers on the bund. They can at least get Friends of Police or some volunteers to keep watch on the bund to stop poaching,” Shobhana said. To check such incidents, wetlands that see large numbers of migratory birds must be handed over to the forest department, said N I Jalaluddin, president of Nature Conservation Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/curb-poaching-on-pallipalayam-lake-bund-say-conservationists/articleshow/79846933.cms||---

Carrying placards and shouting slogans, the party leaders, including former Baharagora MLA Kunal Sarangi, accused the hospital authorities of indulging in corrupt practices. The party claimed that cardiac magnetic resonance machine, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine and computed tomography scanning machine are lying defunct for several weeks. “Most of these machines cost around Rs 5 crore and they have been bought with public money. Top officials in the hospital procure these high-end machines to earn a commission but they end up compromising on their quality, resulting in their break down,” BJP leader Vikas Singh said. When asked, MGMMCH superintendent Sanjay Kumar said the agency which was responsible for the maintenance of the machines left the job mid-way and the defunct ones could not be repaired. “We have contacted a new agency and hopefully the machines will be restored soon,” he added. A senior MGMMCH doctor preferring anonymity said that they had approached the health department for funds in order to repair the machines but they haven’t been sanctioned yet.

December 22, 2020||Ranchi||Schools reopen, but attendance dismal||RANCHI: The state government’s decision to reopen schools for Classes IX to XII after almost nine months got a poor response on the first day (Monday) as a large number of students gave schools a miss due to the fear of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government had allowed reopening of the schools with proper safety measures considering the upcoming board examinations. It had also asked the students to attend offline classes only after taking consent a consent from their parents. Delhi Public School (Ranchi), which had called only two sections of Class XII for practical classes, witnessed 80% attendance. Two sections of Class X and XII each will be called on Tuesday. Principal Dr Ram Singh, said, “The attendance was encouraging. All students acted in a disciplined manner and followed safety norms. The first day was also a rehearsal to test whether our plans for conducting classes were adequate.” He said the school will shut for the winter vacation after a few days and theory classes and mock tests will be held after it reopens on January 4. Don Bosco School authorities said around 100 of 120 its students attended classes on the first day. The school has also been closed now for Christmas vacation. Ashutosh Kumar Singh, principal of the government-run Amar Sahid Thakur Vishwanath Sahdeo District School, however said the attendance on the first day was far below expectations. “Only 12 of 70 Class X students and 51 students of 267 Class XII students turned up. A few students were sent back as they did not have the consent form signed by their parents,” he said. Singh said the students maintained social distancing and added that his school would be shut for Christmas from Wednesday. He was hopeful of better attendance when the school reopens on January 2. Meanwhile, Guru Nanak Senior Secondary School principal Manohar Lal said his school will reopen for a day on Tuesday and only 40% of the parents have given consent to send their children. He said, “All precautionary measures to protect the students from the virus are in place. The response of the parents has been modest so far. Let’s see how many of them actually turn up.” DAV Kapildeo also said the response of parents to send their children was poor. Oxford Public School in Ranchi has introduced the "odd even system" to maintain social distancing following which students having odd roll numbers will be allowed to attend the class on Monday, Wednesday and Friday while students having even roll numbers will be allowed to come on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. "If all the students attend classes together, it will become difficult to follow social distancing and ensure other rules. So, we have introduced the odd-even system and the parents have also been informed about the same," said principal Suraj Sharma. "No assembly will take place at the school," he added. Other online classes will continue as they were during lockdown for all other classes. Though students are excited to attend the school after a long span, at the same time they will be experiencing a total change in the classes that will be held from now onwards amid the pandemic. "Everything has changed. We are used to online classes now, but we are ready to attend the regular classes after a long period," said a student.

December 22, 2020||Ranchi||As the biting cold persists, East Singhbhum admin sets up bonfires across urban, rural areas||Jamshedpur: As a cold wave grips the entire state, East Singhbhum administration has decided to set up bonfires across 30 public places in urban as well as rural areas. Railway stations, bus terminus, parking stands for autorickshaws and pavements in areas like Kadma, Sakchi, Mango, Dimna and Bagbera, to name a few, have been identified for this purpose. Deputy commissioner Suraj Kumar has asked the officials of all the three urban municipal bodies — Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee, Mango Notified Area Committee and Jugsalai Municipality — to conduct inspections and increase the number of bonfires, if required. Rural areas like Beltand and Katin will see bonfires being set up by the administration while the BDOs of Ghatshila sub-division have been asked to make bonfire arrangements in their respective block areas. The administration’s decision was hailed by the pavement-dwellers who have been huddling around bonfires, made of wood and garbage collected from the streets, for the past few days. “The administration has done the right thing by arranging the bonfires as the cold is getting harsher with each passing day,” Sanjay Kumar, an auto-rickshaw driver at Maa Sheetla Temple Chowk in Kadma, said. “Mostly the pavement-dwellers, rickshaw-pullers and hawkers warm themselves by a bonfire,” food vendor Sahadev said. With the minimum temperature hovering around 8 degree Celsius for the past three days, people are staying indoors. “Markets are deserted in the evening as people are not stepping out because of the cold wave,” Ankit Agarwal, who owns a toy shop in Sakchi market, said. The prediction by India Meteorological Department, Ranchi indicated that the minimum temperature will not change on Tuesday and it hover around 8 degree Celsius. Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association president (Jamshedpur), Dr Umesh Khan, has appealed to everyone to maintain the safety norms pertaining to Covid-19 and take sufficient precautions to avoid viral infections in the biting cold. “People should comply with the safety guidelines even when they huddle around the bonfire,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/as-the-biting-cold-persists-east-singhbhum-admin-sets-up-bonfires-across-urban-rural-areas/articleshow/79845061.cms||B Sridhar
December 22, 2020||Ranchi||PLFI No. 2 commander Jiden killed in Khunti encounter||Ranchi: A senior rebel belonging to the outlawed People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI), a splinter group of the CPI (Maoist) was killed in an encounter with a joint team of the Jharkhand Police and the CRPF near Kyongsar village under Murhu police station area in Khunti district on Monday morning. Considered second in the PLFI rank, Jiden Gudia was active as an extremist for 15 years and carried a bounty of Rs 15 lakh on his head. An AK-47 rifle, dozens of cartridges, two walkie-talkies and other material were recovered from the spot. Inspector general (operation) Saket Singh said, “After receiving inputs regarding movement of PLFI chief Dinesh Gope and Jiden, a police team was sent to the area for conducting search operations. On seeing the police, PLFI cadres opened fire and Gudia was killed in retaliatory fire while his accomplices managed to escape.” Khunti SP Ashutosh Shekhar said the police team led by ASP Ramesh Kumar had an intense encounter with 250 rounds being fired by both sides. Gudia himself fired around 30 rounds on the police before he was hit. The members of extremist squad were positioned at different points in an area around 200 metres, which enabled them to escape into nearby forest. He added “Gudia was considered second in the PLFI ranking after Gope. The organisation will be weakened considerably with his death.” Police said Gudia was active in the Torpa, Bandhgaon, Murhu, Rania and Sonua police station areas in Khunti and Chaibasa and had registered around 100 cases against him at different police stations. Over 30 cases were lodged against him with the Torpa police station alone. He was an accused in around two dozen cases related to murder. He was arrested by the police in August 2007 in a case related to Torpa police station, but had managed to escape from custody in September 2009. Jharkhand DGP M V Rao said that the elimination of Gudia is partial success and police aims to eliminate the entire organisation. He said that the extremists should return to the social mainstream or they would be arrested or killed. Notably, the success comes days after government released posters of top PLFI members along with the reward money and sought information regarding them from the common people. Sources said that police are getting frequent information from people after the step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/plfi-no-2-commander-jiden-killed-in-khunti-encounter/articleshow/79845360.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Hemant was interacting with reporters at his residence in Dumka before leaving for Sahebganj when hundreds of aggrieved people from different districts, who had waited for hours to see him, asked him to resolve their grievances. “My government has been working to create job opportunities thousands of people belonging to urban and rural pockets in light of the acute crisis caused by the shutting down of many establishments due to the pandemic,” Hemant said, adding that different schemes were introduced under MNREGA during the lockdown to ensure workers could tide over the crisis emerging out of the pandemic. “We will ensure that the pace of development gains momentum by introducing stimulus packages with suitable economic and fiscal policies,” he said. About the ongoing battle between BJP and Trinamool Congress ahead of the coming elections in West Bengal, Hemant said the way the saffron party resorts to “unconstitutional tactics” was not a secret anymore. “There is no doubt that BJP will adopt the same tactics in Bengal, making the picture even hazy as to who will lose and who will gain,” he said, adding, “The saffron party leadership has become frustrated after losing in Jharkhand, where the electorate experienced the miseries of its misrule and taught them a lesson.” On the recent announcement of his Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee to call a meeting with likeminded non-BJP leaders, Hemant said he will definitely take part in the same if invited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-soren-promises-jobs-for-15k-youths-by-early-next-year/articleshow/79844971.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
December 22, 2020||Ranchi||Ramgarh farmers ignore govt agencies, sell paddy to traders||Ramgarh: Most farmers here seem reluctant to sell their produce to the Primary Agriculture Cooperative Society ( Pacs) set up by the food and civil supply department to collect paddy, in spite of the government agreeing to pay Rs 2,050 for a quintal. The farmers are instead selling their paddy to visiting traders, including those from neighbouring West Bengal, at just Rs 1,200 per quintal. Fifteen Pacs have been set up in the six blocks of the district with an aim to procure at least 35,000 quintal of paddy. “Not a single farmer from villages under Barlanga police station — including the ones from chief minister Hemant Soren’s native village of Nemra — has turned up at the Pacs set up at Gola block headquarters. It seems that farmers don’t want to travel to Gola, which is nearly 30 kms from Barlanga. There is, therefore, a need to start a Pacs in Barlanga,” Gola Pacs head Kamaal Sahjada said. Abid Hussain, the district supply officer (DSO), seconded Sahjada and said that the proposal of setting up a separate Pacs should be given a serious thought. Puran Rajwar, a farmer in Sutharpur village under Barlanga police station, said he and other villagers have sold their paddy to visiting traders from Jhalda and Jaipur in West Bengal’s Purulia district at a cheaper rate as none of them wanted to travel nearly 30km with sacks of paddy to Gola. “Traders from West Bengal make cash payment at the door step, so most farmers prefer to sell paddy to them,” he said. Jageshwar Nagvandhi, the head of Bhuchungdih Pacs, said: “Farmers are told that full payment would be made within seven days of paddy procurement, but in reality they have to make multiple trips of the Pacs to get even 50% of the amount. This is the reason why they don’t like to sell their produce to government agencies.” Till Monday evening, Ramgarh district has been able to collect only 5,000 quintal of paddy against the target of 35,000 quintal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ramgarh-farmers-ignore-govt-agencies-sell-paddy-to-traders/articleshow/79845185.cms||N K Agarwal

District education officer Upender Narain said the magistrate and the personnel were sent to the school to help a senior school teacher take charge as principal. He said while K S Tiwari, who was recently transferred from a school in Garhwa, staked claim for the principal’s post, the principal-in-charge, Ram Dayal Kushwaha, was reluctant to hand over the charge by claiming that he is the seniormost teacher and hence entitled to the post. Narain further said the education department verified Tiwari’s claims. The magistrate and the police made sure that the locked principal’s chamber was also reopened. The school will now resume classes for Standard X, Narain added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/power-tussle-in-daltonganj-school-on-first-day-of-reopening/articleshow/79845105.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic body, however, said they keys were not returned since the accounts were not clear. The BJP MP met the special officer of Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC), Krishna Kumar, at his office and questioned the officer why no initiative was being taken to hand over the keys to locals so that the buildings can be used for marriages and other social gatherings by the residents concerned. The keys were taken by the JNAC during the Covid-19 lockdown period so that no social gatherings are organised there. The civic body official informed that the keys were not returned since the committees were yet to pay the amounts for use of the halls before the lockdown period and because of non-transparency in their accounts. Other JNAC officials said a set of guidelines would be framed before handing over of the keys to the committees to plug the loopholes. Mahato, however, informed Kumar that since the keys were not with the locals, the halls are not being cleaned and maintained properly. The community halls were constructed during the tenure of former BJP chief minister Raghubar Das after demands were made by the residents to organise social functions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/return-keys-of-community-halls-to-local-committees-steel-city-mp-to-civic-body/articleshow/79845219.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

Other commission agents in Haryana have come out in support of the Panipat body chief, calling it “pressure tactic” by the Centre. “This is to suppress our voice. But, what the central government doesn’t understand is that it’s only due to farmers that arhtiyas exist,” claimed Panipat arhtiyas association head Dharambir Singh Malik, who was served the notice on Monday. He alleged that he got the notice for supporting farmers’ protest. “I have come out in open but there could be other commission agents who got such notices too. We shall respond to the notices,” he added. Jind arhtiya association president Rajpal Singh said: “What else can you expect from this government? They will do their best to break the agitation but we shall continue to support to ensure it ends in favour of farmers,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-punjab-agents-haryana-arhtiya-leader-gets-i-t-notice/articleshow/79848395.cms||Manvir Saini

Under the initiative, residents will be able to gather information as well as avail government services. Departments that will be integrated in the first phase are revenue department (at tehsil level for income, caste, solvency, domicile certificates etc), Ghaziabad Development Authority, municipal corporation, social welfare departments (scholarship, pension), police, electricity, agriculture, railways, roadways, jal nigam, transport, medical services and pollution among others. Under the initiative, three to five landline numbers would be set up in the control room and an equal number of staff will be posted to attend calls. At the same time, a landline number will be in place at every department and staff will provide requisite information to the control room, which will be further passed on to the caller. The administration plans to announce the numbers in a few days and advertise them through the district website, social media and other mediums. Notably, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had appreciated Ghaziabad’s integrated control room and sought a report on best practices. This prompted the district to launch the “one-district-one-control-room” initiative. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that after the Covid-19 outbreak, Ghaziabad was one of the first districts to establish an integrated control room in the state. “It did a good job in reaching out to the migrant labourers and also solved the problems faced by the people during the lockdown. We want to continue with a similar system where residents can get all relevant information from one place.” For example, if a person wants information related to the railways, then he or she can call the control room. After listening to the query, the information will either be provided by the control room staff or divert the call to the railway staff, the DM added. Apart from this, Ghaziabad municipal commissioner has submitted a proposal for an integrated traffic management system, which will focus on developing a collaborative framework of stakeholders such as traffic police, civil police department and civic bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/services-of-23-departments-in-ghaziabad-to-come-under-1-platform/articleshow/79847000.cms||Aditya Dev
December 22, 2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sexually abused and stuffed in gunny bag, 4-year-old girl survives||MUMBAI: A 34-year-old driver who transports employees of a private company from Vasai to Andheri has been arrested for sexually abusing a four-year-old girl inside a luxury bus, stuffing her in a gunny bag after mistaking her to be dead and leaving the bag on a road in Vasai on Sunday evening. While the girl survived after being rescued by locals, the driver was arrested from Manickpur in Vasai (west) hours later. He has been charged with rape, abduction and attempt to murder. The accused, a Santacruz resident, drives employees of an Andheri-based private firm. He picks them up from Vasai. The bus, belonging to a private operator, is usually parked illegally alongside the road near the Subhash Chandra Bose ground in Bhayander (west). Police said that on Sunday afternoon, children from a nearby slum in Bhayander were playing inside the parked bus. The driver and his friends (co-drivers) were having drinks. At around 1 pm, the driver got behind the wheels of the bus. He was headed to Vasai, where he had to park the vehicle and pick up the employees on Monday morning. As the bus was about the start, the children alighted from the bus. The four-year-old girl, however, could not alight. The driver took off with the child even as the other children raised an alarm. Even as the child's mother rushed to the Bhayander police, who got down to the task of tracking down the driver, he parked the bus at an isolated spot and sexually abused the girl. As she was crying and screaming, he strangulated her with his hand, police said. Mistaking her to be dead, he put her in a polythene gunny bag (lying inside the bus) and dumped the bag near a petrol pump at Fatherwadi, Vasai (East) and fled at around 6.30 pm, police added. Despite it being dark, some passersby spotted the bag and found some movement inside it. They opened the bag to find the girl inside. The Valiv police reached the spot and rushed the girl to the civic-run D M Petit hospital in Vasai (West). She is now recuperating at JJ Hospital and is out of danger, police said. The Bhayander police, who had filed an abduction case, arrested the driver, with the help of Valiv police, from Vasai, where he was hiding. He confessed to having sexually abused the girl. Police said the driver was drunk. Though the driver did not know the girl, he had lived in the same slum for about six months before moving to Santacruz. The driver has been booked under IPC sections 376(2)(i), 376(3) (rape), 307 (attempt to murder), 363 (kidnapping) and sections 4,8 and 12 of the Pocso Act. He has been remanded in police custody till December 28. Residents of the Bhayander locality from where the abduction happened have been complaining about illegal parking of luxury buses on the road. The buses, the local residents said, were being used for consumption of drinks and drugs.

December 22, 2020||Business||New strain: Cargo, special flights exempt from 9-day UK curbs||NEW DELHI: Maharashtra has imposed night curfew from 11pm to 6am in view of the new coronavirus strain due to which Christmas and New Year celebrations, large gatherings, parties, functions, shops, hotels and theatres will have to wind up at 11pm. People have been advised to reach home before 11pm and not step out till 6am unless there is an emergency. Karnataka has made Covid tests mandatory for passengers arriving from Denmark and the Netherlands, too. Everyone with a history of travel from the UK since December 7 will be traced and tested, the state health department said. In a circular to all airlines, aviation regulator DGCA asked them to strictly adhere to the arrival deadline of 11.59pm on Tuesday for flights from the UK. Air India and Vistara have advanced their Tuesday departures from Mumbai and Delhi by five and 10 hours, respectively, so that these flights can return ahead of the shutdown. Airlines operating between India and other countries are barred from allowing any flyer arriving from the UK to board another flight “either directly or indirectly”, the DGCA said. Cargo and special flights are exempt from the nine-day suspension for now. India has had an air-bubble agreement with the UK since international travel resumed, under which four airlines currently operate 67 weekly flights — British Airways (29), Air India (23), Virgin Atlantic (8) and Vistara (7) — between various Indian cities and London. Since all these airlines have flexible Covid-specific booking policies, affected passengers will get the option of refunds or rebooking, sources said. “We are mainly seeing traffic to India on these flights, and not so much on UK-bound ones. The flyers are mostly expats and Indian students coming home for the holidays,” said a senior official of an international airline. The decision to suspend flights was taken after Union health secretary Rajesh Bhu- shan wrote to his aviation ministry counterpart P S Kharola on Monday about the new coronavirus strain in the UK. “India has been seeing a sustained decline in the number of fresh Covid cases for over 2.5 months now, accompanied by a decline in the number of deaths. In this scenario, any interjection of (the new virus strain) thro- ugh passengers with air travel history could pose a risk to pandemic management here,” the health secretary wrote. Accordingly, the joint monitoring group headed by the director general of health services recommended flight suspension to and from the UK, besides mandatory RT-PCR testing for those arriving from there. Globally, the list of countries halting travel to and from the UK for varying periods lengthened to over 30 as speculation raged about the mutant coronavirus strain going “out of control” in Britain. As concerns in India mou- nted over the new virus strain, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan reassured people that there was no reason to panic. Responding to a question at a presser, he said, “I would say this to all, that all these imaginary situations, imaginary talks, imaginary panic... don’t involve yourself in this,” he was quoted by PTI as saying. “The government is fully alert about everything. If you ask me, there is no reason to panic...,” Vardhan said. He said the government had done everything that was important to handle the Covid-19 situation in the last one year. The scientific community, Vardhan added, had very ably risen to the occasion, continuously striving and contributing to whatever was needed to combat Covid-19, PTI reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-strain-cargo-special-flights-exempt-from-9-day-uk-curbs/articleshow/79848489.cms||---

The curfew, from 11pm to 6am, will come into force from December 22 (Tuesday) and be effective till January 6. The CM’s move has been prompted by the emergence of the ‘UK Covid mutation’. The night curfew will cover establishments as well as movement of people and vehicles on roads However, emergency services such as transportation and supply of milk and vegetables will be allowed Christmas and New Year celebrations, large gatherings, parties, functions, shops, hotels and theatres will have to mandatorily end or down shutters by 11pm People have been advised by the state government to reach home before 11pm and not step out till 6am, except in case of an emergency State chief secretary Sanjay Kumar told TOI, “Curfew means curfew. It is better that people avoid getting out of their homes between 11pm and 6am except in an emergency.” We need to be more vigilant for the next 15 days, says CMCM Uddhav Thackeray on Monday announced the decision to impose a night curfew after a meeting with senior bureaucrats to discuss measures to be taken after the emergence of the mutation in the Covid-19-causing coronavirus in the UK. “More precautions are being taken in the state and we have to be more vigilant for the next 15 days,” said Thackeray after chairing the meeting with state health officials and BMC chief I S Chahal. Thackeray has appealed to people to follow Covid norms during weddings and Christmas and New Year-eve parties. While the BMC notification on night curfew will be released early on Tuesday, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “People must adjust their travel to ensure they reach home by 11pm or have a strong reason for travelling.” Shivanand Shetty, president of the Indian Hotels and Restaurants Association, said that despite sharing the state’s concerns about the new virus strain, more stringent measures would push the industry into severe hardships.

December 22, 2020||India||B’deshi killed, BSF trooper injured in skirmish at border||KOLKATA: A 45-year-old illegal woman immigrant from Bangladesh was killed and a BSF trooper injured after a skirmish between the force and a group of infiltrators along the Indo-Bangladesh border in Pakhuira, Nadia, on Monday, reports Jayanta Gupta. The infiltrators were attempting to cross border into Bangladesh when BSF’s 8Bn challenged them. “There are two roads from Pakhuira towards border fence. They were trying to breach it while others attacked our troops,” a BSF official said. Outnumbered, the BSF party first fired a warning shot that failed to deter the mob which then tried to encircle the personnel. Constable Samir Ghosh was hit on the head with a stone and collapsed. BSF then fired two more rounds aiming below the criminals’ knees to minimise damage, following which the infiltrators fled. Sahrun Halder of Morelganj village in Bangladesh’s Khulna was probably on her knees trying to breach the fence when she was hit by one of the bullets. She was rushed to Bagula rural hospital and then to Krishnanagar but could not be saved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bdeshi-killed-bsf-trooper-injured-in-skirmish-at-border/articleshow/79848585.cms||Jayanta Gupta
December 22, 2020||Mumbai||No biodiversity survey for Vadhavan port: Maharashtra govt||MUMBAI: The Maha Vikas Aghadi government will not allow a biodiversity survey for Vadhavan port in Dahanu taluka, state fisheries minister Aslam Shaikh said on Monday. The state also accused the Centre of trying to usurp all the ports in Maharashtra, thereby curtailing its rights and powers on the sea and the coast. "The state government is with locals protesting the Vadhavan port project and will not allow the project to take off in the face of opposition from local residents," said Shaikh, who is from the Congress. On December 2 and 3, fisherfolk, tribals, farmers, and residents of Vadhavan and nearby villages formed a human chain and did not allow the biodiversity survey commissioned by Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) was being carried out by scientists of the National Institute of Oceanography. The port is being jointly developed by JNPT and Maharashtra Maritime Board. On December 15, all coastal villages from Cuffe Parade to Dahanu had observed a stringent bandh against construction of the port. Shaikh said in 1996 Dahanu was declared an ecologically fragile area. "If the environment is threatened by the project, its biodiversity is likely to be destroyed and the traditional fisherfolk set to lose their livelihood, then we are with the sons of the soil in their fight against the project," he said. Shaikh said in March, the Centre had sent a draft of a policy that would result in all ports being taken over by the Union government. "We had then opposed the draft policy. We are not the only ones to oppose it, even Gujarat has opposed it. Ten days ago, we received a revised draft which again proposes to take over all the ports in the state. We are strongly opposed to it," he said. While JNPT and Mumbai Port Trust are centrally controlled, all the other ports in the state are controlled by the state government. There are 48 intermediate and minor ports along Maharashtra's coast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-biodiversity-survey-for-vadhavan-port-maharashtra-govt/articleshow/79848596.cms||Clara Lewis
December 22, 2020||India||Breadwinner killed in road crash, 1cr to kin after 7 yrs||MUMBAI: Seven years after a 37-year-old accountant died after being knocked off his bike and run over by a dumper truck at Powai, the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal has granted his family a compensation of around Rs1.1crore. The tribunal said the fact that the dumper truck driver fled the spot without providing medical aid to the victim, Santosh More, showed he was guilty. More had an annual income of Rs 3.5 lakh. The compensation was calculated under various heads, including loss of future prospects, losses suffered by family members, hospital and funeral expenses, etc. More’s wife Rupali and two daughters, one of whom was 18 months old at the time of his death, had submitted the claim in September 2013. Santosh’s mother, Madhuri, too, was part of the claim. His father died during its pendency and his name was deleted. The total compensation will have to be paid jointly by the owner of the offending vehicle, Bawa Earth Movers and the insurer, Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd. The tribunal clarified that while Rupali would be given Rs 29 lakh, Madhuri would get Rs 10 lakh. The remaining amount would be divided between Rupali and her daughters and would be invested in fixed deposits. While the compensation to Rupali will be invested for six years,the children’s money will be in the FDs until they attain majority. “The applicants will be entitled to collect quarterly interest,” the tribunal said. Rupali told the tribunal the accident took place on February 10, 2013, when the truck came from the rear side of the motorcycle and dashed it. More passed away on March 12. Rupali alleged the mishap occurred due to negligent driving of the dumper. The dumper owner did not respond to the claim. The insurance firm attempted to pin the blame on More.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/breadwinner-killed-in-road-crash-1cr-to-kin-after-7-yrs/articleshow/79848611.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A police officer said Likhit and Ashish — from Bulandshahr and Bijnor, respectively — arrived at the spot and asked for vegetables when Rohit’s cart scraped the bike they were seated on. Boy repeatedly hit with stick on headThis resulted in some vegetables falling to the ground. The incident was followed by an argument between the vegetable vendors and the accused. As the two accused resorted to abuses and threats, the vendors told them they will file a police complaint against them. After this, the accused left the spot,” a police officer told TOI. It turns out, they only left to come back armed with sticks. Rohit and the other vendors had started moving towards the local vegetable mandi when Likhit and Ashish accosted them. They targeted Rohit and rained blows on him with the sticks. “Rohit was hit with a stick on his head repeatedly resulting in a serious head injury,” the police officer said.

December 22, 2020||World||EU regulator OKs use of Pfizer vax, inoculation to start from Dec 27||AMSTERDAM: Europe's medicines regulator on Monday approved the use of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by U.S. company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech , putting the EU on course to start inoculations within a week. European Union countries including Germany, France, Austria and Italy have said they plan to start vaccinations from Dec. 27 as Europe tries to catch up with the United States and Britain, where inoculations began earlier this month. Having gained the green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the final step is approval by the European Commission, which is expected later on Monday. "Now we will act fast. I expect a European Commission decision by this evening," Commission head Ursula von der Leyen wrote on Twitter. Von der Leyen had already targeted the start of vaccinations over the Dec. 27-29 period. Preparations for the vaccine rollout come as the identification of a highly infectious new strain of the coronavirus in Britain caused chaos across the region, with countries shutting off travel ties with the UK and disrupting trade ahead of the Christmas holiday. EMA executive director Emer Cooke said it would still take a long time to inoculate the 450 million people of the 27 EU countries. "Vaccines alone will not be the silver bullet that will allow us to return to normal live, but the authorisation of this first vaccine is definitely a major step in the right direction and an indication that 2021 can be brighter than 2020," she told a news briefing. EMA officials said it was highly likely the vaccine would work against the new variant of the coronavirus. "We think that even if we don't have yet full confirmation, it is very likely that the vaccine will retain protection also against this new variant," said Marco Cavaleri, head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy. VACCINATION DRIVE The pandemic has killed about 470,000 Europeans and is picking up pace in the winter months, crushing economies in the process. Many governments have imposed tighter restrictions on households to try to curb a second wave of infections and avoid overwhelming healthcare systems. Student medics, retired doctors, pharmacists and soldiers are being drafted into a European vaccination campaign of unprecedented scale. A phased-in approach means frontline healthcare workers and elderly residents of care homes are being prioritised, with most national schemes not reaching the general public until the end of the first quarter of 2021 at the earliest. The goal of the 27-member EU is to reach coverage of 70% of its 450 million people. The drugs regulator in Switzerland on Saturday authorised the vaccine for use in people aged over 16. The EMA had started a rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer trials on Oct. 6 in an effort to speed an approval process that usually takes at least seven months. The EMA clearance, initially granted as conditional marketing approval (CMA), is valid for one year and can be renewed annually. It can be converted into a standard marketing authorisation after further data checks. This would be valid for five years but can be renewed for unlimited validity. The process took longer than the ultra-fast emergency authorisation given by Britain, the first western country to endorse a Covid-19 shot. EUROPE'S DRUG TEST The roll-out will be a test for Brussels' ability to unify Europe amid political pressure to speed up the process and tame the pandemic which has killed more than 1.6 million people globally. Last week, Germany, France, Italy and five other European states agreed to coordinate the start of their vaccination campaigns. The EU has ordered 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, enough to vaccinate 100 million people, paying 15.50 euros ($18.90) per dose. It will also buy an extra 100 million with a timetable for delivery still to be negotiated. EMA officials denied any political interference and defended the speed of the approval process. "The focus was exclusively on the science, there were too many involved of the member states who would look into the science as to allow any political whitewashing or adaption," said Harald Enzmann, chair of EMA's Human Medicines Committee (CHMP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/eu-regulator-oks-use-of-pfizer-vax-inoculation-to-start-from-dec-27/articleshow/79848622.cms||---

The minimum temperature was recorded at 8 degrees Celsius. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to the IMD official, due to slowing of winds in the region, the maximum and minimum temperature is likely to increase in the next few days. The maximum temperature will hover around 21 degrees Celsius on Tuesday with shallow fog in the morning and mainly clear sky throughout the day. The minimum temperature will fall to 3 degrees Celsius, as per the IMD weekly forecast. In Delhi, the minimum temperature rose to 5.5 degrees Celsius, giving slight respite to the residents. However, cold wave, along with dense fog, are forecast to return from Wednesday, according to IMD officials stated. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist, IMD, and head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, Delhi, said a western disturbance was influencing the region leading to an increase in mercury levels over the past 48 hours. “Day-time temperature has increased and conditions are warmer than last week. Delhi was also recording cold wave conditions with minimum temperature hovering around 4 degrees, but this, too, has risen slightly. It is expected to drop to around 4 degrees again by December 23,” said Srivastava. Meanwhile, the Gurugram’s air quality deteriorated marginally on Monday but remained in the poor category. The air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 271, slightly up from Sunday’ 262. The pollution level in the city is likely to increase in the next few days due to unfavourable meteorological conditions. Two of the four monitoring stations, including Vikas Sadan and Gwalpahari recorded the AQI in the ‘very poor’ category, while AQI at Sector 51 was in the ‘poor’ category and at Teri Gram it was in the ‘moderate’ category.

December 22, 2020||World||Shaken by new virus strain, world shuts the door on UK||A slew of countries closed their borders to Britain on Monday over fears of a highly infectious new coronavirus strain, heightening global panic, causing travel chaos and raising the prospect of UK food shortages days before the Brexit cliff edge. India, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Russia, Jordan and Hong Kong suspended travel for Britons after PM Boris Johnson warned that a mutated variant of the virus, up to 70% more transmissible, had been identified in the country. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman closed their borders completely. Several other nations have suspended travel from Britain including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, Israel and Canada — although scientists said the strain may already be circulating in countries with less advanced detection methods than the UK. The discovery of the new strain came just months before vaccines are expected to be widely available, sowed fresh panic in a pandemic that has killed about 1.7 million people worldwide and more than 67,000 in Britain. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo urged the US government to take steps to prevent the new strain entering the country, which has been worst hit by Covid-19 with almost 3,18,000 deaths. “It’s high time the federal government takes swift action, because today that variant is getting on a plane and landing in JFK, and all it takes is one person,” he said. US assistant health secretary Brett Giroir said nothing had yet been decided. The new variant, which scientists said was 40%-70% more transmissible, is rapidly become the dominant strain in parts of southern England, including London. Cases of the new strain have also been in detected in some other countries, including Italy and the Netherlands. Australia said two people who travelled from the UK to New South Wales, its most populous state, were found to be carrying the mutated virus. It axed dozens of domestic flights while New South Wales locked down more than 250,000 people. “2020 is not done with us yet,” PM Scott Morrison said. Some scientists said the prevalence discovered in Britain might be down to detection. “Britain is simply the country which finds these mutations the most because they are looking for them more. There are countries that hardly search or do not search at all,” Belgian virologist Marc Van Ranst said. EU officials met via video to coordinate their response to the new strain of the virus. The bloc is on course to start vaccinations within a week after its medicines regulator approved the use of a shot from Pfizer and BioNTech on Monday. France shut its border to arrivals of people and trucks from Britain, closing off one of the most important trade arteries with mainland Europe. As families and truck drivers tried to navigate the travel bans to get back home in time for Christmas, British supermarket chain Sainsbury’s said shortages would start to appear within days if transport ties were not quickly restored. The new variant and curbs in Britain compound the chaos as the nation prepares to finally part ways with the EU, possibly without a trade deal, when the Brexit transition period at 2300 GMT on December 31. The global alarm was reflected in financial markets. European shares slumped, with travel and leisure stocks bearing the brunt of the pain. The pound tumbled 2.5% against the dollar, and was on course for its biggest one-day drop since March. Britain’s tabloids bemoaned the crisis. “Sick Man of Europe”, the Daily Mirror said on its front page.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/shaken-by-new-virus-strain-world-shuts-the-door-on-uk/articleshow/79848629.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Mumbai||NCB questions Arjun Rampal on painkillers seized from his flat||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau questioned actor Arjun Rampal for nearly five hours on Monday as part of its probe into seizure of certain painkillers from his flat last month. During a raid at his flat, NCB had seized two strips of painkillers Clonazepam and Tramadol which are opiates (contain opium). They have to be specifically prescribed by doctors for pain relief. NCB officials said Rampal had submitted two prescriptions from two doctors in Mumbai and Delhi. "There is some discrepancy in a prescription submitted to us from a doctor in Delhi. The doctor is reputed but there are some discrepancies, including the date. This prescription appears to be backdated, hence we have sought a clarification. We are investigating it," he said. Officials said they have found some discrepancy in his statement too. "This is all part of the probe," an official said. NCB had earlier questioned Arjun Rampal's partner Gabriella Demetriades. The agency had arrested Gabriella's brother Agisilaos from a resort in Lonavala in October for alleged possession of drugs. The resort was raided and 0.8gm of charas was allegedly recovered from him. He was placed under arrest under the NDPS Act. The special NDPS court granted him bail recently and directed him to deposit his passport to the NCB and submit Rs 50,000 in cash. He was also asked not to leave the country without prior permission from the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ncb-questions-arjun-rampal-on-painkillers-seized-from-his-flat/articleshow/79848634.cms||Ahmed Ali

Police believe the killers are close to the family, but aren’t sure of the motive yet. The murders have shaken the state. DGP DM Awasthi drove down to Khudmuda village on Monday to inspect the crime scene, along with Durg SP Prashant Singh Thakur. He has set up special teams to probe the murders. The victims lived on the outskirts of Khudmuda. On Monday morning, when villagers were up and about, they saw Kirti Sonkar, 28, lying in a pool of blood at the doorstep of her house, with her head bashed in with a large stone. The alarm went out and villagers rushed to the house. Police were called in. They broke down the door to find Kirti’s son lying unconscious in bed, with injuries all over his body. The body of her mother-in-law, Dulari, 60, was found floating in an open water tank in the backyard of the house. The husbands of both women were nowhere to be found until a sniffer dog led police to another water tank where the bodies of Balraj 62, and his son Rohit, 30, were found. Investigators suspect the involvement of a relative and a family dispute as there isn’t any evidence of loot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/four-of-a-family-killed-11-yr-old-critical-panic-in-cgarh-village/articleshow/79848638.cms||---

Over 2,000 workers were rendered jobless after the authorities of Titagarh Empire Jute Mill closed the factory. The workers, who had come to join their duty on Monday morning as usual, were taken aback by the “suspension of work” notice on the mill gate. The authorities cited “low rate of productivity” as grounds for the move. The mill workers staged an agitation in front of the closed mill gates and blocked BT Road for over an hour to protest against the sudden closure of the jute mill while a police team from Titagarh police tried to pacify them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/titagarh-empire-jute-mill-suspends-work/articleshow/79847550.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
December 22, 2020||Delhi||Ensure shrines don’t come up on public land, observes Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Civic agencies, such as the municipal corporations and Delhi Development Authority (DDA), are under an obligation to ensure places of worship are not created on public land by unscrupulous people through encroachment, Delhi High Court recently observed. Justice Prathiba M Singh, in a recent order, expressed “grave concern" over encroachment of public land “under the shelter of a place of worship”, saying it has been seen in a large number of cases that people claim rights over government land under the garb of temples or other places of worship. “Such attempts by unscrupulous parties ought to be discouraged, inasmuch as the occupants, under the garb of a place of worship, turn the land into a completely unplanned encroachment by hundreds of people...The authorities have an obligation to ensure that in public land, places of worship are not created in this manner. Moreover, in the present case, an infrastructure project is being completely crippled due to the pendency of this litigation. This would be contrary to even public interest,” the court said, while clearing the decks for DDA to take back land given for the rehabilitation of Kathputli Colony dwellers decades ago. “This trend has been repeatedly frowned upon by the Supreme Court and other courts,” the high court further said, while dismissing a suit seeking to permanently restrain Delhi Development Authority from demolishing four temples located at New Patel Nagar. Justice Singh held that the land in question was public land and the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief. It also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on him to be deposited with the High Court of Delhi (Middle Income Group) Legal Aid Society. The suit was filed by a person claiming to be the “chela” of late Swami Onkara Nand who was managing the four temples situated on the land in question. He said the temples had been there since 1960s and the places of worship were in his possession after the death of Swami Onkara Nand in 1982. DDA, on the other hand, had claimed that the entire land belonged to the government and the plaintiff was in its illegal occupation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-shrines-dont-come-up-on-public-land-observes-delhi-hc/articleshow/79848689.cms||---
December 22, 2020||India||Ram Temple construction committee to approve building technique soon||NEW DELHI: The construction committee of Ram Temple at Ayodhya is set to approve the building technique to be used for the project soon for quick commencement of the work. The Ram Temple is scheduled for completion in 2023. Sources said the committee under Nripendra Misra, former principal secretary to PM Narendra Modi, will choose between two options suggested by a panel of experts from top technical institutions. The panel of experts, led by professor V S Raju, former director of IIT, Delhi, is learnt to have recommended two options. One is for use of vibro stone columns to support rafts on which stones can be placed. Vibro stone columns or aggregate piers are an array of crushed stone pillars placed with a vibrating tool into the soil below a proposed structure. This method of ground improvement is also called vibro replacement. This construction methodology has been used in several iconic buildings. The other option is for enhancing the quality of soil by using an engineering mix after excavating the site up to a prescribed depth. Stones can be placed on the rafts to be set up on the enhanced soil. Sources said the excavation could go up to 15 meters. “The best option would be finalised to ensure quality construction that can stand for several years. The focus will be also to adopt faster construction methodologies,” said a source. Sources said in the second method, the engineering mix of stones can be given the desired shape and these will look like the actual stone work. Experts have finalised their recommendation in the light of the brief given to them by the construction committee, which also has Acharya Govind Deo Giri and VHP general secretary Champat Rai, to suggest a methodology which will be suitable for the temple to be constructed in accordance with the architecture of temples of ancient India. The eight-member expert committee included professor Raju. director of Central Building Research Institute in Roorkee, N Gopal Kkrishnan, NIT Surat director SR Gandhi, IIT Guwahati director TG Sitharam, emeritus professor at IIT Delhi B Bhatacharjee, TCE consultant AP Mull, Prof Manu Samthanam of IIT Madras and Prof Pradipta Banerji of IIT Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ram-temple-construction-committee-to-approve-building-technique-soon/articleshow/79848690.cms||---

He had contracted Covid-19 infection in October and was hospitalised but recovered and was sent home. On Saturday, he suddenly complained of pulmonary complications and was rushed to hospital again. Condolences and tributes, cutting across party lines, poured in for the him who was described as “Ajatshatru” (one who has no enemy) by his political rivals. PM Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences: “Shri Motilal Vora ji was among the senior-most Congress members, who had vast administrative and organisational experience in a political career that spanned decades. Saddened by his demise. Condolences to his family and well-wishers. Om Shanti.” AICC chief Sonia Gandhi said: “Motilal Vora’s demise has left a huge void that will be difficult to fill. His life is a shining example of public service and unparalleled commitment to the Congress family.” Senior Congress functionaries Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh said it’s an irreparable loss for Congress. “I received the sad news of the death of Motilal Vora. He served Congress in various capacities and worked to strengthen the organization. Condolences to the family,” Nath, his long-time party colleague, tweeted. MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said: “Vora ji was from a generation that fought for India’s freedom and served the country. He was gentle, polite and was Ajatshatru (had no enemies).” MP and Chhattisgarh have declared three days of mourning. Vora’s mortal remains will be taken to Durg, his native place, for last rites on Tuesday. Vora, a native of Durg, was the 13th CM of MP and later governor of UP. “He was one of the most trusted persons of the Gandhi family Vora believed and remained steadfast to Congress ideology. He worked all his life for the party,” Congress Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya said.

The developments indicate that the Nepal Communist Party may formally split soon as Oli said, “The elected government was pushed to a corner and picketed against and was not allowed to work so I decided to dissolve the House.” The main opposition Nepali Congress in a meeting with the Prachanda faction of NCP and Janata Samajbadi Party also decided to intensify opposition to Oli’s Sunday move, describing it as an “assault” on democracy. Pushpa Kamal Dahal "Prachanda" has been leading the opposition to Oli within NCP. In a speech where he also dwelt on his achievements, Oli highlighted the “boundary issues” with India and a “trade treaty” with China, signalling the very different relationships with the two neighbours. "We have initiated talks to resolve the boundary issues and attempts are under way to implement the trade and transit deal with China,” he said. Defending his decision, he said, “Against the people's mandate and their will, national politics was dragged into an endless and goalless direction by creating controversy, making Parliament meaningless as the elected government could not receive its support." “Though the move to dissolve the House is seen as a sudden step, the situation was created by some leaders of Nepal Communist Party for long due to their non-cooperation with my government and their opposition.” “When the prime minister of the majority government was not allowed to work, I did not want to indulge in unfair practices behind closed doors and reach a compromise with them,” said Oli. “Giving a chance to the people for a fresh mandate is the best democratic alternative.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/nepal-crisis-deepens-oli-rejects-partys-censure-justifies-dissolution-of-parliament/articleshow/79848732.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra daily tally dips below 3,000, Mumbai sees fewer than 500 cases||MUMBAI: Amidst worries of the new highly infectious 'UK Covid mutation,' both Mumbai and Maharashtra registered a sharp drop in the daily detection of cases. The state recorded below 3,000 cases (2,834) after a week, while the city's daily caseload dipped below 500 (463). Health officials admitted that fewer tests done on Sunday due to manpower crunch over the weekend could have resulted in lower detections on Monday, but added that the Covid curve has been dipping since October. On December 14, the state had registered 2,949 cases while Mumbai saw 477 additions. The number of Covid-related deaths, too, dropped on Monday, with 55 deaths in Maharashtra and 12 in Mumbai. However, as a reminder of the large number of deaths recorded in the May-September period, the Covid toll in Mumbai breached the 11,000 mark on Monday (11,008). The overall toll in Maharashtra stands at 48,801 so far. On Monday, both the state and city saw more recoveries that led to a drop in the number of active cases. In the last 24 hours, 6,053 persons recovered across the state, including 693 in Mumbai. State public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the recovery rate now reached to 94.24%. Earlier in the day, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with senior bureaucrats in the backdrop of a mutation in the coronavirus in the UK. He announced night curfew as a precautionary measure from Tuesday. He also scheduled an online meeting with district collectors on Tuesday to take stock of the Covid situation. BMC municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the BMC has ensured that all precautions are taken to check any surge in case. The BMC will, for one, continue with 14,000-15,000 Covid-19 tests daily. However, a senior doctor from a government hospital said that active tracing needs to be stepped up across the state in light of the UK variant. "The mutated virus has been in circulation since September. While stopping flights to the UK will cut down future transmission, we also need to focus on tracing those passengers who arrived in Mumbai/Maharashtra in the last 15 days," he said. Meanwhile, Thane city saw 77 new cases, taking the tally to 54,228. With two Covid deaths, the virus toll in Thane city stands at 1228. The recovery rate in Thane city is 95.9%, with 52,168 recoveries and only 959 active cases. In Navi Mumbai, 82 cases were registered on Monday, taking the total count there to 50,291. Of these, 96% patients have recovered so far. Two deaths were also reported on Monday, taking the total toll to 1,033. PCMC areas reported 30 fresh cases on Monday, taking the total case tally there to 27,157. With one death reported on Monday, the death toll there reached 593.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-maharashtra-daily-tally-dips-below-3000-mumbai-sees-fewer-than-500-cases/articleshow/79848747.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
December 22, 2020||World||Pakistan government grants permission for construction of Hindu temple in Islamabad||AMRITSAR: The Pakistan government has finally permitted the construction of a Krishna temple in Islamabad after its state-run Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) ruled that Islamic laws allowed minorities to have their own religious place. CII had earlier issued a ‘fatwa’ against the construction of any new Hindu temple in Pakistan and the allocation of government funds for a non-government religious place. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) Hindu member National Assembly (MNA) Lal Chand Malhi, who headed the temple construction drive, told TOI that the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Islamabad, on Monday gave permission to the Islamabad Hindu Panchayat (IHP) to construct the boundary wall around the temple, a community centre and cremation ground for the Hindu community in Islamabad. The fatwa was issued after IHP demanded 100 million Pakistani rupees from the government for the project, estimated worth Rs 500 million. Following this, the government sought CII’s advice on how to resolve the issue. According to reports, as many as 3,000 Hindu families live in Islamabad and its surroundings who didn’t have sufficient facilities for performing religious as well as last rites of their dead ones. Notably, the CDA had in 2017 allotted a 20,000sqft plot to IHP and three years later on June 23, 2020, the groundbreaking ceremony of the Krishna temple was held, which was, however, stalled after CII issued the fatwa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-government-grants-permission-for-construction-of-hindu-temple-in-islamabad/articleshow/79848760.cms||Yudhvir Rana
December 22, 2020||India||Approve vaccine cautiously: House panel||NEW DELHI: The parliamentary standing committee on home, headed by Congress member Anand Sharma, has said the Centre took several steps much ahead of other countries to screen incoming traffic from abroad as the Covid pandemic broke but in-bound travellers were screened only for high temperature through March. The panel said with no testing facility at airports, asymptomatic patients could escape detection “when they could practically be the only source of infection of Covid-19 in the country”. Stating that migrant labour, factory workers and daily wage earners were worst affected by imposition of the lockdown, the panel blamed the lack of timely dissemination of information at the district level about the arrangements made by the civil administration for food, shelter and other facilities, for the anxiety that drove a large number of migrants back to their home states. The report related to the government’s handling of the pandemic said the exodus of migrants stopped only when effective mitigating measures were taken by central and state governments. The panel in its report presented to the Rajya Sabha chairman on Monday, recommended that an Aadhaar-linked national database of vulnerable sections of the society be prepared on priority so that in case of such a crisis in future, the government can reach out to them and provide ration and other facilities. The panel recommended that the government draw up a national plan and guidelines under NDMA, 2005 and Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. Stating that the Epidemic Diseases Act helped in managing Covid-19 but was outdated, the panel recommended that the Act be revisited to equip it to respond to the challenges posed by the unanticipated onset of pandemics in future. The panel underlined the need for a comprehensive Public Health Act, preferably at the national level, with suitable legal provisions to support the government in keeping checks on overcharging by private hospitals and black marketing of medicines. It was also of the view that patients’ feedback regarding treatment should be made essential in all public and private hospitals. On impact of Covid on education facilities, the committee recommended a mix of online and classroom teaching for the higher classes, but advised against reopening of pre-primary and primary classes until a vaccine was available or the situation was under control. On development of vaccine, the panel said if at all emergency authorisation is given, it should be done with proper consideration and caution and invoked in rarest of rare cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/approve-vaccine-cautiously-house-panel/articleshow/79848733.cms||Bharti Jain
December 22, 2020||Visakhapatnam||849 unauthorised layouts identified in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) has identified 849 unauthorised layouts in Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts as of Monday evening. Of all these unapproved layouts, only 342 layout owners have come forward to regularise their layouts under the layout regularisation scheme (LRS). On the other hand, the VMRDA has drawn in a total of 4,364 applications under the scheme. The VMRDA carried out the exercise by deploying 42 ward planning and regularisation (WPRS) secretaries. According to VMRDA officials, the major objectives of the LRS scheme are to bring all unauthorised layouts into planning framework, regulate the development, and facilitate the implementation of the VMRDA master plan. As per the guidelines of the LRS-2020, those individual plot owners or layout developers, who have executed their registered sale deed before August 31, 2019, can only apply for this scheme. The penalisation charges are fixed based on plot size and value of the land. The charges will be calculated based on the prevailing market value as of August 31, 2019. The scrutiny of single plot regularisation will be done based on the in-principle layout pattern approved by the competent authority concerned. VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said that the deadline for the LRS applications is December 31. “We would initiate action against those unapproved layouts, who have failed to apply under the scheme, after December 31. The VMRDA conducted awareness meets on the scheme in several mandals. Regularisation of the unapproved layouts will entitle the applicant to get building permission from the competent authority,” said Koteswara Rao. The unapproved layouts, which have not been covered under the scheme, would be treated as continuing offence and penalty would be levied as per the existing Municipal laws. Such sites would also be recorded in the prohibited register of the state registration department to prevent the sale, disposal or transaction of such sites. Copy of registered sale deed/title deed, location plan, detailed layout plan, etc. are necessary to get the un-regularised layouts regularised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/849-unauthorised-layouts-identified-in-vizag-vzm/articleshow/79844566.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Cold wave, along with dense fog, are forecast to return from Wednesday, IMD stated. Track the pollution level in your cityKuldeep Srivastava, scientist, IMD, and head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, Delhi, said a western disturbance was influencing the region leading to an increase in mercury levels over the past 48 hours. “Daytime temperature has increased and conditions are warmer than last week. Delhi was also recording cold wave conditions with minimum temperature hovering around 4 degrees, but this, too, has risen slightly. It is expected to drop to around 4 degrees again by December 23,” said Srivastava. On Monday, the maximum temperature was 23.5° Celsius at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station— one degree above normal. IMD stated that it could hover around 24 degrees for the next two days. The minimum temperature, which had plummeted below 4 degrees, was 5.5 degrees at Safdarjung, 5.2 degrees at Lodhi Road, while Palam, Ridge and Aya Nagar recorded 8.5, 8.5 and 8.0 degrees, respectively. IMD has a “yellow” alert in place from December 23 to December 26, warning that cold wave conditions may prevail in isolated parts of Delhi, while dense fog may also be a factor in the mornings. With an Air Quality Index at 332, up from Sunday’s 321, the air quality in the capital remained in the “very poor” range.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-5-5c-slight-relief-for-delhi-from-cold-but-only-till-today/articleshow/79848796.cms||---
December 22, 2020||Vijayawada||Vijayawada’s transport business struggles to restart||VIJAYAWADA: Hike in fuel price and the Covid-19 lockdown have taken a toll on automobile and truck transport business in the city, Andhra Pradesh’s biggest Industrial Area Local Authority (IALA) in Jawahar Auto Nagar. Vijayawada is a transport hub and 35,000 trucks used to operate from the city. Jawahar Autonagar is a hub for automobile industries where around 800 truck building and repair units function. Around 2.5 lakh workers are directly or indirectly dependent on the automobile industry in the city. Transport operators said that 2020 was the worst year for them in this decade and many operators exited the field after incurring huge losses. “I owned five trucks before May 2020 and I’m in this business for the last 31 years. But sudden fall in business after Covid-19 forced me to sell two of my trucks. Fuel price also increased and there is no chance for survival,” said Mutham Venkateswara Rao, a truck operator in the city. The Covid-19 lockdown and restrictions on transport for around 30 days crippled Jawahar Autonagar and motor mechanical sector. Many truck service and maintenance units couldn’t resume work even after the unlock process started. “Truck operators come for maintenance and repair works if they have good trips and business. We depend on them. No operator is showing interest on maintenance after the lockdown. Around 12 mechanics work in my shed and I’m not in a position to give salaries to them. We never imagined such a situation,” said SK Shareef, who runs a truck clutch repair unit in the city. “The government should consider our issues and help us by reimbursing fuel charges,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vijayawadas-transport-biz-struggles-to-restart/articleshow/79844588.cms||Venu Lanka
