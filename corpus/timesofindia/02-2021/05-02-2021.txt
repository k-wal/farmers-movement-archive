Fifteen MPs from these parties including SAD, DMK, NCP and Trinamool Congress were stopped by police from meeting the protesting farmers at Ghazipur border in the morning. According to SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal who coordinated the visit, the leaders were not allowed to cross the barricades and reach the protest site. .@Akali_Dal_ joins hands with like minded parties & MPs who are visiting #ghazipurborder to condemn atrocities bein… https://t.co/xx257GF3sB— Harsimrat Kaur Badal (@HarsimratBadal_) 1612417097000Besides Badal, Supriya Sule from NCP, Kanimozhi and Tiruchi Siva from DMK and Saugata Roy from TMC were part of the delegation besides members of National Conference, RSP and IUML. After Lok Sabha adjourned for the day, Opposition MPs including Sule and Roy met Birla and gave him the letter claiming they were not allowed to meet protesting farmers by police. "The impression we got at the Delhi Ghazipur border is like the border between India and Pakistan. The condition of farmers resemble that of prisoners in jail," they said in the letter. Asking whether they are living in a "police state", the MPs said despite elected representatives, they were not allowed to meet farmers' representatives. During a discussion in Parliament on Thursday, several opposition parties asked the government to withdraw the three contentious farm laws without making it a prestige issue and not to treat the agitating farmers as "enemies". Stringent security continued at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, one of the key protest sites where thousands of farmers are camping with a demand that the Centre repeal the new agri-marketing laws enacted last September. The protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture. Eleven rounds of formal talks between the government and the protesting farmer unions have failed to break the deadlock. While unions have stuck to their main demand of repeal of the laws and legal guarantee of MSP, the government has offered some concessions including keeping these laws on hold for 1-1.5 years. Even the Supreme Court has stayed the laws for two months and set up a panel to look into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/werent-allowed-to-meet-farmers-at-ghazipur-border-opposition-mps-write-to-lok-sabha-speaker/articleshow/80694624.cms||---

Singh said as the largest nation in IOR — with a vast coastline of 7,500km — India has an active role to play for peaceful and prosperous co-existence of all countries. “Indian Ocean is a shared asset and a lifeline for international trade and transport due to its control of major sea lanes carrying half of the world’s container ships, one-third of its bulk cargo traffic and two-third oil shipments,” he said. He added the conclave is reflective of the importance India attaches to the vision of common growth and stability, and engagements with partner countries. Many IOR countries are becoming globally competitive and are developing new technologies, including defence shipyards for design and shipbuilding, which can be jointly harnessed through regional cooperation efforts, as per the minister’s address, which was telecast on Doordarshan.  He said India is ready to supply missile systems, helicopters, warships, patrol vessels, guns, tanks etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rajnath-india-ready-to-supply-weapons-to-ior-countries/articleshow/80694760.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Bengaluru||HAL hopes to bag orders for 106 HTT-40 planes in a year||BENGALURU: Six months after the Defence Acquisition Council cleared the procurement of 106 HTT-40 basic trainer aircraft developed by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the request for proposal (RPF) was handed over by Indian Air Force on Thursday. IAF also sought a quotation (price). This means HTT-40 is one step closer to the formal process of a production contract. Having received the RFP, HAL is expected to submit its proposal along with a quotation to IAF in the next few months. HAL chairman and managing director R Madhavan said the firm is confident of getting the orders in a year or so, as he projected the company’s order book position for the coming year. Sources in HAL told TOI: “We are expecting certification this year. The RFP will include delivery schedule — to begin from two years of the contract signing. It will also come with PSQRS (preliminary staff qualitative air requirements).” With HAL having already developed flying prototypes that have completed multiple mandatory tests, the certification process is under way. Of 106 HTT-40s — which will address the basic training requirements of IAF — 70 will be procured post-certification and the remaining after IAF operationalises the aircraft. Sources said after initial production, manufacturing of the aircraft will be shifted to Nashik given that the plant there will soon run out of production orders with HAL nearing completion of the 222 Su-30 fighter plane orders. V Seshagiri Rao, CEO, HAL MiG Complex, confirmed the same and said: “We have completed production of 221 Su-30s and acceptance tests are ongoing for the 222nd plane. After this, there are no orders for the plant in Nashik, but we have drawn up plans to keep it functional.” Pointing out that the plant also does repair work, Rao said overhauling capacity would soon be enhanced from 15 to 20 planes annually. “Also, we will be moving the production of HTT-40 there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hal-hopes-to-bag-orders-for-106-htt-40-planes-in-a-year/articleshow/80694761.cms||Chethan Kumar
February 5, 2021||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Auto driver earns Rs 8,000 for returning bag with Rs 2.6 lakh||BENGALURU: A 54-year-old autorickshaw driver was on Thursday felicitated by Sanjeev M Patil, deputy commissioner of police (west), for promptly returning a bag containing cash worth Rs 2.6 lakh belonging to a passenger. Kumar D, from Anandapura near KR Puram, had picked a passenger, later identified as Mumbai-based Amit Kumar Pandey, 33, at Cottonpet and dropped him near Eidgah ground in Chamarajpet. He left the spot and found a woman passenger within a few minutes. She asked him to drop her to Srinagar and he readily agreed. The woman found a bag on the seat and informed Kumar. “I realised the previous passenger might have left it behind in a hurry. I did not want to lose a passenger and hence dropped the woman at Srinagar. I returned to the place where the bag owner had alighted. I remembered he had entered a shop. I met the shopkeeper and enquired about the man, and the former informed the bag owner over the phone. Within a few minutes, he arrived with police and I returned his bag,” Kumar recalled. According to Chamarajpet police, Pandey, a manager with a Mumbai-based photo frame works chain, had come to Bengaluru to collect money from clients. “Pandey collected cash from several shops on Wednesday and kept it in a bag. He packed his belongings in another bag and hired Kumar’s auto in the morning. He reached Chamarajpet around 10am but forgot to take the cash bag with him. He later realised he had forgotten the bag in the auto and headed straight to Chamarajpet police station,” an officer said. Pandey was at the station when he received the call about auto driver Kumar waiting for him with the bag at the shop he had visited earlier. “We rushed to the spot along with Pandey. The driver asked him to check his belongings in front of us. Pandey found the cash intact. He gave Kumar Rs 3,000 as reward for his honesty. We brought both of them to the station and returned the cash to Pandey,” a police officer said. DCP Patil said he felicitated Kumar for his honest act. He was given Rs 5,000 and a certificate of appreciation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/auto-driver-earns-8k-for-returning-bag-with-2-6l/articleshow/80694821.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Stepmom arrested in youth’s murder case||BENGALURU: The stepmother of 28-year-old Siddarth Devender Singh — former chief minister Dharam Singh’s relative who was found murdered — has been arrested in connection with the case. Indu Chauhan, who is from Chennai, was picked up from Siddharth’s apartment in Dasarahalli, from where he went missing last month. Amruthahalli police suspect Chauhan, in her late 40s, played a vital role in the kidnap and murder of Siddarth, who had an MBA-finance degree from New York. Siddharth’s decomposed body was exhumed from Rapore forest in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh. One of the suspected assailants, Shaym Sundar Reddy, was found hanging, while another suspect, Vinod, was saved by the public when he tried to jump before a train in Tirupati, police said. Now, Siddharth’s father Devender Singh has filed another complaint with Amruthahalli police, saying two youths kidnapped his son during the intervening night of January 19 and January 20. “First, I had filed a missing person’s complaint. After enquiring with the security guard of our apartment, I found two youths kidnapped my son by forcibly pushing him inside a car,” he told police. Siddharth lived in Stay Aboda Coleman apartment in Dasarahalli. “Recently, Chauhan visited the apartment and wished to live there. Siddharth opposed her plans and they fought over the issue. Devender intervened and pacified them. Latest investigation reports show Chauhan was in touch with Reddy and his associate Vinod. She gave them huge amounts of money. More details will emerge in a day or two,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/stepmom-arrested-in-youths-murder-case/articleshow/80694823.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Smuggled gold worth Rs 51 lakh found in aircraft seat||BENGALURU: Smuggled gold worth Rs 51 lakh was found hidden inside the seat of a flight that landed at Kempegowda International Airport from Dubai. The yellow metal was seized by sleuths of the Bengaluru unit of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, who are now probing the passenger who smuggled in the gold. KIA officials said a DRI team reached the airport early on Wednesday and entered an IndiGo Airlines flight that landed on Tuesday night. They searched the plane after passengers had disembarked and found gold hidden inside a packet under the passenger’s seat in the economy section. The smuggled gold weighed 1 kg and 100 grams. Investigators suspect the passenger had hidden the gold for an accomplice to retrieve it once the flight switched to domestic sector. In such a situation, the accomplice can carry the gold as a domestic passenger and there won’t be a customs inspection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/smuggled-gold-worth-51l-found-in-aircraft-seat/articleshow/80694826.cms||---

The seven-day average of daily cases dropped to 11,815 on Thursday, the lowest since 11,757 cases on June 17 last year. The rolling average takes into account fresh cases on a particular day as well as the past six days, to give a clearer picture of which direction a particular dataset was moving. There were 12,431 fresh cases recorded across the country on Thursday. Nearly half of these were reported from Kerala, where the day's case count was 6,102. On the previous day, the country had reported 12,948 fresh cases. Maharashtra continued to record the second highest count of fresh cases, with 2,736 new infections detected in the state. In no other state did the day's case count exceed 500. Tamil Nadu reported 494 new cases, the tally dropping below 500 for the first time since at least the month of June. Karnataka recorded the next highest count of 474 fresh cases, followed by Chhattisgarh (373) The day's death toll from the virus was 121, a slight incrase from the previous day's count of 112. Maharashtra again recorded the highest number of deaths at 46, followed by Kerala (17), Delhi and Punjab (both seven).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-7-day-average-of-daily-covid-cases-falls-below-12000/articleshow/80696763.cms||---
February 5, 2021||India||1 in every 5 adults had Covid by mid-Dec, says ICMR survey||NEW DELHI: More than one-fifth of the country's adult population had at some point been infected by Covid-19 by mid-December, the third serological survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research shows. The separate data released on seroprevalence among those aged 10-18 was found to be 25.3%. The data released reflect the prevalence of antibodies, read as evidence that the person has had Covid-19. "Delhi was not a part of the survey. We have made statistical extrapolations so we can say that 21.4% of Indians were seropositive," ICMR director general Balram Bhargava said. The third survey found a significant increase in prevalence among adults at 21.4%, up from 7.1% during the second survey in August. In the first survey conducted in April, only 0.7% prevalence was detected. It was conducted between December 17 and January 8. The latest survey was conducted between December 17 and January 8 in the same 700 villages in 70 districts across 21 states where the first and second rounds were conducted in April and August. Among healthcare workers, seroprevalence was 25.7%, with 26.6% among doctors and nurses. The government emphasised that a large proportion of the population is still vulnerable and there is no scope to lower the guard as herd immunity could not be assumed and added that following Covid-appropriate behaviour is needed. Currently, India’s total active caseload has dropped to 1.6 lakh. In the last three weeks, 47 districts across the country have not reported any new case, 251 had no deaths during that period. The survey covered 28,589 people aged over 10, and 7,171 healthcare workers. The prevalence in urban slums was found to be the highest at 31.7%, followed by 26.2% in other urban areas and 19.1% in rural areas. The prevalence was slightly higher among women at 22.7%, as against 20.3% in men.

February 5, 2021||Goa||Council has its way as Costa is moved out of GFDC||PANAJI: Brajesh Manerkar, state land acquisition officer for Economic Development Corporation, has been handed additional charge of member secretary of Goa Football Development Council (GFDC). The order from the state government – issued late on Wednesday – puts an end to the battle between former GFDC member secretary Aleixo da Costa and chairman Brahmanand Shankhwalkar. It is no secret that Shankhwalkar and Costa didn’t see eye to eye. In fact, since taking charge on August 3, Goa’s first Arjuna Award winner has not been able to do much, largely due to administrative hurdles. Interestingly, the GFDC official website still shows Dr Rufino Monteiro as chairman, even though he quit more than two years ago. The ouster of Costa comes at a time when the GFDC executive council had passed a resolution on December 23, 2020 to replace the member secretary and revoke all his powers. “The Council after thorough discussion unanimously resolves to report to the government that the current member secretary, Aleixo da Costa, is replaced with immediate effect and all his powers be revoked and he asked to report to his parent department. “The Council further resolves that all staff of the GFDC report and send all correspondence and reporting’s directly to chairman and vice-chairman, until further orders from the chairman or government,” states the resolution, a copy of which is with TOI. The resolution was signed by seven members and it included chairman Shankhwalkar and vice-chairman Dr Shrikant Ajgaonkar, brother of sports minister Manohar Ajgaonkar. Since the two resolutions were passed at the meeting, there has been plenty of churning within the GFDC, all of which is now expected to end, with the appointment of a new member secretary. “Lot of work is pending. We could not take any major decision because the member secretary is a mandatory second signatory. Covid-19 also hampered our work,” said Shankhwalkar. Earlier, Costa was pulled up by the Goa Human Rights Commission (GHRC) in December. The commission recommended paying of Rs 29,000 as compensation for mental harassment caused to a senior accountant while on contract at GFDC by the member secretary who withheld his salary for half a year. The rights commission recommended that the compensation be recovered from Costa, who was the member secretary. Costa, state director of craftsmen training, was appointed as member secretary in July, 2015 and has since then held on to his post. He had succeeded former GFA president and bureaucrat Elvis Gomes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/council-has-its-way-as-costa-is-moved-out-of-gfdc/articleshow/80697487.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
February 5, 2021||Goa||FC Goa drop points, again, as NorthEast United fight back||FC Goa are sitting third on the Indian Super League (ISL) table, but it almost looks like a chair with three legs. It isn’t pretty, and it surely isn’t comfortable. The league champions played their fourth consecutive draw. Unlike the previous two games when they surrendered the lead, this time they did that twice as NorthEast United fought back for a crucial point in a 2-2 draw at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Thursday. With 22 points from 15 matches, the same as Hyderabad FC and NorthEast, there isn’t much to choose between the three teams jostling for two playoff slots. Those below – Bengaluru FC, Jamshedpur FC and even Chennaiyin FC -- will all fancy their chances of taking this at least till the last two rounds. Goa could have earned themselves some breathing space. Alexander Romario gave Goa the lead in the 21st minute only for NorthEast to equalise from a Federico Gallego penalty. NorthEast then conceded an own goal through Gurjinder Kumar (80th), but three minutes later, and with just seven left to be played, Gallego converted his second spot-kick of the night. Gallego deserved the goals and his Man-of-the-Match award. He was outstanding for NorthEast and difficult to track. For Goa, without the suspended Edu Bedia in the middle and James Donachie on the bench, this was a performance so unlike them. If there was any positives, it should be Glan Martins. Joining Goa three days ago with experienced midfielder Lenny Rodrigues going the other way, he got his chance in the 35th minute after Princeton Rebello had to be stretchered out injured. By that time, Goa had already taken the lead. Jorge Ortiz shaped the goal. The Spanish winger got to the byline and his cutback found Alberto Noguera just outside the box. He played the ball towards Romario, who scored with a simple tap-in, while NorthEast protested that the ball had earlier gone out of play. As television replays showed, it didn’t. NorthEast took that setback in their stride and started calling the shots. Goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh’s mistake with the ball at his feet was almost capitalised by Deshorn Brown and Glan made a goalline save to deny VP Suhair. Goa couldn’t survive for long as Luis Machado won a penalty after being brought down by Noguera. Gallego sent Dheeraj the wrong way from the spot. In the second half, NorthEast forced two good saved from the goalkeeper around the hour mark and it was not until the last 10 minutes that there were more goals in the game. Goa surged ahead from a corner-kick curled in by Ortiz where Amarjit Singh, another debutant, managed to put off Khassa Camara and defender Gurjinder, despite his best effort, turned it into his own goal. Three points then for Goa, after a long wait? Not really. There was another twist in the tale as Ashutosh Mehta won a late penalty which Gallego converted, again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-drop-points-again-as-northeast-united-fight-back/articleshow/80697499.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
February 5, 2021||India||After warning, Twitter suspends stir-linked accounts||BATHINDA: Twitter has once again suspended or withheld the accounts of some users associated with the farmers' agitation. At least three accounts - Sanyukt Kisan Morcha's official IT cell Kisan Ekta Morcha, Tractor2Twitter and BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) - are among those which have been suspended. Tractor2Twitter and BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) have activated other accounts with similar names but limited activity. Twitter had suspended some of the accounts on February 1, six days after the January 26 violence, but they were restored after a few hours on the same day. However, the fresh round of suspension comes after the IT ministry warned the microblogging service company on Wednesday to remove inflammatory content or be ready to face jail and financial penalty. BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said: "The central government got Twitter to suspend farmers' accounts and yet our protest is gaining ground." IT executive Bhavjit Singh, who manages Tractor2Twitter, said: "We got mail from Twitter about objections to running multiple accounts with similar or identical names and asking for clarification. We have clarified but are yet to get any reply."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-warning-twitter-suspends-stir-linked-accounts/articleshow/80697556.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Business||Top 20 HNIs have Rs 825 crore in their PF accounts: Govt||NEW DELHI: Amid criticism over the proposed tax changes for those contributing over Rs 2.5 lakh annually towards provident fund (PF), the government on Thursday said 1.2 lakh subscribers - which is less than 0.3% of the 4.5-crore base - were contributing "huge sums". Official sources suggested the benefit of high tax-free returns was accruing to high net worth individuals (HNIs) although PF was meant for workers. Among the HNIs, one individual with a balance of Rs 103 crore in his PF account has the highest corpus, followed by one holding Rs 86 crore. Sources said that the top 20 HNIs have about Rs 825 crore in their accounts, while the top 100 have a balance of over Rs 2,000 crore. Overall, HNI account holders had an average corpus of Rs 5.9 crore. They had average earnings of Rs 50.3 lakh annually - and tax-free under the current dispensation. In all, there are around 4.5 crore employees provident fund contributors and the high net worth individuals chip in with about Rs 62,500 crore to the provident fund kitty, a finance ministry source said. "The government has done away with this disparity of paying huge sum of tax-free interest to HNIs at the cost of honest average salaried class contributor and taxpayers," an official argued, justifying the tax proposal in the Budget. The government has argued that a normal subscriber of EPF or General PF for government employees will not be affected by the removal of "anomaly" in the system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/top-20-hnis-have-rs-825cr-in-their-pf-accounts-govt/articleshow/80697562.cms||---
February 5, 2021||India||TMC got 70% of funds via poll bonds in FY20||NEW DELHI: All India Trinamool Congress received over Rs 100 crore, constituting nearly 70% of its total income for the year 2019-20, via electoral bonds. Even regional parties received a major chunk of their income last fiscal through electoral bonds, questioned by some for being a non-transparent mode of funding, with Telugu Desam Party's share at about Rs 81 crore, Biju Janata Dal's at Rs 50 crore, JD(U)'s at Rs 13 crore, JD(S)'s at Rs 7.5 crore, Shiromani Akali Dal's at almost Rs 7 crore and AIADMK's at Rs 6 crore. As per the annual audit reports for 2019-20 already submitted by various parties to the Election Commission, TMC's total receipts stood at Rs 143.7 crore, down from 191.6 crore in 2018-19, and total expenditure at Rs 107.2 crore, a manifold increase over Rs 10.4 crore in 2018-19. Of the Rs 144 crore income of TMC in the last fiscal, Rs 100 crore came from electoral bonds alone, higher than Rs 97 crore received through this route in 2018-19. Among TMC's donations apart from bonds, Rs 21 lakh (down from 1.2 crore in 2018-19) came from MPs/MLAs and Rs 8 crore from others (down from Rs 43 crore in 2018-19). As per BSP's audit report for 2019-20, its receipts totalled around 58 crore, down from 70 crore in 2018-19, while the expenditure was Rs 95 crore, up from Rs 49 crore in 2018-19. No donation to BSP was in excess of Rs 20,000 crore and its income from electoral bonds was nil. Other national parties, including BJP and Congress, are yet to submit their annual audit reports for 2019-20 in view of the extended timelines by the income tax authorities. As for regional parties, TDP receipts for 2019-20 totalled Rs 91.5 crore, of which almost Rs 82 crore (90%) came from electoral bonds, while its total expenditure was Rs 109 crore. The party's income from electoral bonds in 2018-19 was Rs 27.5 crore. JD(U) earned over Rs 23 crore and spent Rs 11 crore in 2019-20. Its income from electoral bonds was Rs 13 crore, comprising 56% of its total income. Shiromani Akali Dal's receipts totalled over Rs 16 crore in 2019-20, including almost Rs 7 crore from bonds, while its total expenditure was Rs 13 crore. BJD's receipts and expenditure for 2019-20 were Rs 90 crore and Rs 186 crore respectively. Of its Rs 90 crore income, Rs 50.5 crore (56%) came via electoral bonds. Electoral bonds contributed Rs 6 crore to AIADMK's total income of Rs 89 crore, while its total expenditure was close to Rs 29 crore. JD(S), which earned a total income of Rs 20 crore, received Rs 7.5 crore via electoral bonds (37.9%), down from Rs 35 crore received in 2018-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmc-got-70-of-funds-via-poll-bonds-in-fy20/articleshow/80697610.cms||Bharti Jain

February 5, 2021||India||Vaccine shots for those over 50 yrs to begin soon: Govt||NEW DELHI: The government plans to start inoculating people above 50 years against Covid-19 as soon as vaccine supplies start improving. "Vaccination of frontline workers started from February 3. Once this stabilises, people above 50 years will be immunised too very soon," health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. "Within that group, there is a sub-group of people above 60," he added, indicating that the first priority may be given to those above 60 years. So far, over 44.49 lakh people have been vaccinated against Covid-19. The government plans to vaccinate around 3 crore health and frontline workers by April, followed by the 'priority' population group of those above 50 years and those younger but with severe co-morbidities. However, with adequate supplies of vaccines, it is possible that multiple priority groups may be covered simultaneously. India has been the fastest country to achieve 4 million Covid-19 vaccinations in just 18 days, even as many countries had a headstart of almost 65 days. India launched the countrywide inoculation drive on January 16. “We have been doing well and I can confidently say that by tomorrow, 50% of our healthcare workers would have been covered. This means our health services can go ahead without any fear. This also shows that we have made great strides in ensuring acceptability of made-in-India vaccines and have tackled hesitancy very well,” Niti Aayog memberhealth Dr V K Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccine-shots-for-those-over-50-yrs-to-begin-soon-govt/articleshow/80697690.cms||Sushmi Dey

The incident occurred around 2am when all members of the family of Jaglal Manjhi were fast asleep. A spark from a fire pot (borsi) is said to be the reason behind the fire. Jaglal, who works at a brick kiln, was first to wake up. He tried to save his wife, Devanti Devi (55) and mother-in-law Moongiya Devi (80), but failed. Ultimately, Jaglal, Devanti and Moongiya were charred alive in the flames. Only a differently-abled son of Jaglal has survived. He was rescued by the villagers. The bodies were for postmortem to Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital by the police. As there is no electric wire near the house, it is being assumed that the fire broke out from the spark emitting from the fire pot. Atri block development officer Kranti Kumar said an unnatural death case was registered in connection with the case. As per provision of the government under disaster management, a compensation of Rs four lakh would be provided to the kin of the deceased. “The compensation amount will be given to the only survivor in the family, the differently-abled boy,” the BDO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-of-a-family-charred-to-death/articleshow/80692752.cms||---

Addressing the workers at the party office at Rajendra Ashram, he said Bihar has been a land of revolution. “Even Mahatma Gandhi had organised Kisan Satyagraha against British rule from West Champaran. The path shown by Mahatma Gandhi would be followed by farmers of Bihar. Criticising CM Nitish Kumar, he said there was massive unemployment in the state and the law and order was also poor. Das said, “I have travelled across Bihar and talked to the farmers. The farmers are not even getting minimum support price in the state.” Addressing media persons at the party office, Das questioned the Centre for its “silence” over insult caused to the tricolour. “The government has the law enforcement and other investigation agencies with it. I want to ask under what circumstances those involved in insulting the tricolour have been allowed to remain free. The government should have ordered probe into the matter,” he said. Regarding the farmers’ agitation seeking repeal of the controversial farm laws, he said, “The government is adopting repressive measures to crush the agitation. I have travelled across 13 districts in the district and farmers have narrated their ordeal at all places. The farmers are even forced to sell paddy for just Rs 1,100 per quintal against MSP of Rs 2,500. Congress will extend support to farmers in all 38 districts of the state,” he said. Das was accompanied by party state president Madan Mohan Jha and other senior leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-state-farmers-too-not-getting-msp/articleshow/80692704.cms||---

Deputy election officer (DEO) Anirudh Prasad Yadav said the beneficiaries can seek help from the people manning the kiosk in downloading their cards. “Those failing to download digital ID cards from the Election Commission portal can approach the operators manning the kiosk for proper help. The operators will also help people in completing their KYC (know your customer) formalities,” Yadav added. He said, “Earlier, we used to provide polyvinyl chloride-coated EPIC to people. The electoral roll officer used to hand over the cards to assistant electoral roll officer and thereafter it was being given to booth level officer. But, on several occasions, this supply chain of transferring EPIC broke. Therefore, a decision was taken by the chief election commissioner of India to provide digital voter ID cards to people.” Prasad said of 39,278 applicants in the district, 36,862 will receive voter ID cards. “Around 1,745 voters’ names were deleted from the electoral roll and names of 927 others were corrected out of 938,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/digital-voter-id-cards-kiosk-set-up-in-purnia/articleshow/80692714.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Business||SBI posts Rs 5,191cr profit in Dec qtr||Mumbai: The country’s largest lender SBI reported a net profit of Rs 5,191 crore for the quarter ended December 2020, a drop of 7% from Rs 5,583 crore in the previous year, which was driven by a one-time recovery of Rs 11,000 crore from Essar Steel. The bank’s net profit was up nearly 14% from Rs 4,754 crore in Q2FY21. SBI’s stock jumped by 6% after the bank’s chairman Dinesh Khara said that loan slippage (into default category) could be lower than the Rs 60,000 crore projected earlier and that the lender was expecting to hit double-digit credit growth as early as Q2FY22. Khara said SBI had received restructuring requests for loans worth Rs 18,125 crore and that it had made adequate provisioning for bad loans. He said the bank would support a national asset reconstruction company (bad bank), which will take over non-performing loans from lenders. SBI would not have to make additional provisions on loans that are transferred to the bad bank as they have already been provided for, he said. The bank’s deposit grew 14% year-on-year, of which current accounts grew by 11% and savings accounts 16%. Loans grew 7% driven by retail advances, which rose 16%. Corporate advances grew just over 2%. However, if investments in commercial paper and corporate bonds of Rs 44,161 crores were included, the growth in the corporate loan book works out to 8%. Home loans, which constitute 23% of the bank’s domestic advances, grew by 10% year-on-year. “SBI’s asset quality picture within the guidance is a positive surprise. Third-quarter slippages of around Rs 2,073 crore and new restructuring in Q3 stood at Rs 18,125 crore. This brings stressed assets status as of December at Rs 41,000 crore within the guided Rs 60,000 crore (i.e. 2.5% of loans as total stress including slippages). Total provisioning for the quarter stood at Rs 10,342 crore, which includes Covid-19 provisioning of Rs 5,885 crore. Overall, Covid provision now stands at Rs 12,976 crore,” said ICICI Securities in a note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-posts-rs-5191cr-profit-in-dec-qtr/articleshow/80696950.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Business||RBI likely to hold rates in monetary policy today||MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das is widely expected to announce a status quo in his statement on Friday after the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting. However, the market is keenly awaiting the RBI’s road map for normalising liquidity in the wake of the government’s oversized borrowing programme, which has pushed up bond yields. “The notable decline in retail inflation in December 2020 does provide the RBI headroom to ease monetary policy going forward. However, we do not expect a policy rate cut at the forthcoming monetary policy owing to the concerns around core inflation coupled with widening fiscal deficit and normalisation of economic activities, which could weigh on the inflation outlook,” said Care Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis. “We expect the accommodative monetary policy to continue,” he added. The RBI had last month said that it had entered the phase of normalising liquidity. The use of this term was seen as a signal that the central bank would be draining out the surplus funds that it had flooded the markets amid the pandemic. Many in the markets see this liquidity normalisation like the US Federal Reserve’s comments in 2013 that it was “tapering” off its monetary easing. Those comments led to extreme volatility in money markets worldwide, pushing up bond yields and crashing emerging market currencies. The policy has to be growth-supportive as the economy is in a recession, having shrunk for two successive quarters. Das has a tough job of ensuring that the policy supports growth without fuelling inflation at a time when the fiscal deficit is expected to hit 9.5%. He has to ensure that the government borrowing does not crowd out private investments and that bond yields remain low despite an oversupply of government paper. A new challenge is managing the oversupply of dollars as any purchase of the greenback would result in an equivalent release of rupees, which goes against its objective of normalising liquidity. According to a note by Bank of America Securities, the RBI is expected to balance these objectives by allowing banks to hold more bonds without marking them to market, combining bond purchases with long-term reverse repos (where the RBI borrows money from banks) and buying foreign currency in the forward markets, which will help turn sentiment without affecting the liquidity. “On the liquidity management front, we maintain that the policy intent was to tackle the liquidity asymmetry than to tighten its state, and to fix misplaced risk bets in money markets. Thus, the (mis)communication loop between the central bank and markets needs to be broken,” said Madhavi Arora of Emkay Global in a report.

It finally closed 359 points up at 50,614 — also an all-time closing high. Investors’ wealth crossed the Rs 200-lakh-crore mark for the first time in history with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 200.3 lakh crore, exchange data showed. Since the Budget day, the sensex has gained over 4,300 points, or 9.4%, in four sessions. SBI, IndusInd Bank and ICICI Bank were the top three gainers. The strong market rally has also added nearly Rs 15 lakh crore to BSE’s market capitalisation. In Thursday’s market, ITC was the biggest sensex gainer, closing 6.1% higher, while SBI closed 5.7% up and Bajaj Finance closed with 4.9% gains. Among the stocks that closed lower were Asian Paints, down 2.1%, IndusInd Bank down 1.7% and Bharti Airtel, down 1.4%. Of the 30 sensex stocks, 18 closed higher. As the local market scales new highs on a regular basis, brokers here are looking at global bourses too for cues. According to HDFC Securities head (retail research) Deepak Jasani, Asian shares mostly fell on Thursday as caution set in over companies’ earnings reports. Also, the “recent choppy trading in technology stocks, prospects for more economic stimulus for a world battling a pandemic and, as a spike in short-term Chinese interest rates fanned worries about policy tightening in the world’s second-largest economy”, weighed on Asian markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-hits-high-of-50688-bse-mcap-crosses-rs-200l-cr/articleshow/80696959.cms||---

Now we are expecting the election announcements and the board exams will start in May and end in June. So we have no earlier date than July,” said Guild president Tridib Chatterjee. TimesViewThe situation may have changed for the better when we finally have the fair. But we must be prepared for different scenarios. How quickly we can adapt to situations will hold the key to how soon we can return to an old normal.However, two smaller book events will be held in the city by the Guild — one in February for Bhasha Divas and the other during the Bengali New Year. Though the details of the events starting on February 21 are yet to be announced, it was said that this “book festival” will be held in a park in South Kolkata. It will likely coincide with the Bangla Bhasha Divas celebrations at Deshapriya Park. “We are yet to finalize the details, though it will definitely be about the celebration of Bengali language and literature through books. This is the first time that the Guild will be officially celebrating the book festival on Bhasha Divas,” said Sudhangshu Dey, general secretary of the Guild. The festival during the Bengali New Year will be held around College Square and will have book stalls and theme decorations around boipara. This year’s book fair will have Bangladesh as the theme country. Deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh Toufique Hasan was present during the announcements made by the Guild. He said this time it will be possible for a large number of Bangladeshi publishers to participate since they will not be busy with their own Bhasha Divas-related festivals. “I urge the Guild to give us more space this time,” he said. The book fair will be dedicated to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, since his birth centenary is being celebrated this year, along with the golden jubilee of the independence of Bangladesh. The 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the birth centenary of Satyajit Ray will be other focal areas of the fair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/book-fair-set-to-be-held-in-july/articleshow/80694703.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

February 5, 2021||Kolkata||Kolkata clubs gear up to let swimmers in, but SOP may spike expenses||KOLKATA: After staying out of the water for a year due to the pandemic, over 10,000 swimmers are gearing up to jump back into some of the city’s major pools owned by Kolkata Municipal Corporation, and run by different swimming clubs. However, their wait may get longer if these clubs do not adhere to an SOP prescribed by the ministry of youth affairs and sports. According to the SOP, swimmers, trainers and divers will need to submit an undertaking to the clubs that run the pools stating that they are neither suffering from any symptom suggestive of Covid-19 nor have come in close contact with a person who has tested positive. They will also have to ensure they don’t live in an active containment zone. Copies of the undertaking will be sent to the KMC parks and square department before the civic body gives a go-ahead to begin the swimming session. However, swimmers, coaches, staffers and visitors who are at higher risk — 65 years old or more — pregnant women, children under 10 and those who have co-morbidity factors must avoid swimming pools. The clubs will need to nominate a nodal Covid-19 officer from among their coaches to look after the protocols. Keeping in mind the large number of swimmers, strict vigil has to be maintained when it comes to physical distance. Physical distancing of 6ft on pool premises will be a must and staggering of swimmers for different events/training sessions will be enforced. CCTV monitoring has been made mandatory to keep watch on crowding at the pool, gallery and common areas. In addition to these measures, keeping the pools safe for swimmers will also be a must for the clubs. “Chlorination of the entire pool at prescribed intervals has been made mandatory for the clubs. Disinfection of the entire complex regularly will also be required,” said a KMC parks and square department senior official. However, officials of a section of the clubs felt that adhering to the SOP could be an expensive affair and they would need more space to comply with the protocols. Gautam Mullick, the general secretary of College Square swimming pool said they had received the SOP. However, he felt it would be difficult for them to create space for physical distancing among its 1,500 swimmers. There are six swimming clubs at College Square, which train around 4,000 swimmers every year. Besides College Square, the parks and square department oversees functioning of several other pools, including Hedua, Tallah, Padmapukur (Sarat Bose Road) and Padmapukur (Kidderpore).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/clubs-gear-up-to-let-swimmers-in-but-sop-may-spike-expenses/articleshow/80694583.cms||Saikat Ray

February 5, 2021||Patna||Juvenile court acquits minor boy in petty case||BIHARSHARIF: Nalanda Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) principal judge Manvendra Mishra on Thursday absolved a minor boy of charges filed against him in a petty case last year. The judge also expressed his willingness to financially help the minor to pursue education. Additional public prosecutor (APP) Rajesh Pathak said the minor, resident of a village under Noorsarai police station area, was made an accused in a case of minor altercation on February 29, 2020. He said the minor’s brother had an altercation with a person, in which several people from both sides were named in the FIRs. The minor boy told the court that his parents were daily wagers and he used to sell eggs before Covid-induced lockdown last year to support his education. However, as his Board examinations are getting closer, he could not afford to work. He wished to attend English and science classes at two coaching institutes. In his observation, Justice Mishra said, “The statement of the minor seems to be true.

February 5, 2021||Patna||Drug racket: 3 excise police personnel, 4 smugglers held||PATNA: Sleuths of Economic Offences Unit (EOU) raided the rented accommodation of an excise police sub-inspector near civil lines in Gaya on Wednesday night and arrested him along with two excise constables on charges of negotiating with drug smugglers for releasing a consignment of 253kg ganja being smuggled from Odhisa to Bihar in a pickup van. The sub-inspector, Mukesh Sharma of Malsar under Bithan police station area in Samastipur, and constables Ranjeet Kumar of Koili under Mukhdumpur police station area and Avanish Kumar of Madhopur village under Ghosi police station area in Jehanabad district were posted at integrated check post in Dobhi, Gaya. The SI is still on probation as he had joined service last year. Six others, including drug smugglers Munna Singh, Santosh Paswan, Somnath Singh and Neeraj Singh from Masarh in Bhojpur, were also arrested. Two other arrested people were pickup van’s driver and co-driver. The EOU also seized ganja consignment from a secluded place at Dobhi. The police personnel were allegedly demanding Rs 5 lakh from smugglers to release the consignment. ADG (EOU) Nayyar Hasnain Khan told TOI over phone on Thursday that calls of excise police personnel negotiating with four drug smugglers through the pickup van driver were earlier intercepted by EOU. “The consignment was loaded at Berhampur in Odisha. It was being carried to Bhojpur. The excise personnel had intercepted the vehicle at Dobhi, but let it to go. However, they then chased the vehicle and asked the driver to take it to a secluded place,” he said. The ADG added an EOU team from Patna intercepted a car near cement factory on G T Road in Aurangabad and arrested the four drug smugglers who were on way to Dobhi to get their consignment released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/drug-racket-3-excise-police-personnel-4-smugglers-held/articleshow/80692693.cms||Debashish Karmakar
February 5, 2021||Patna||Youths kill friend for hacking ID of online game||PATNA: A 16-year-old boy was allegedly killed in Gopalganj by three of his friends as he had hacked one of their IDs of an online game, police said on Thursday. The boy’s body, which was thrown into the Gandak by the trio, is yet to be fished out. Gopalganj sadar SDPO Naresh Paswan said the incident took place on the banks of the Gandak at Kala Matihania village under the Vishambharpur police station area in Gopalganj around 4pm on Monday, but it came to light on Wednesday when all three friends of Roushan were arrested by police. “NDRF divers are trying to fish out the boy’s body,” the SDPO said, adding the victim was identified as Mohammad Roushan. “He is a resident of Sirasiya village under the Kuchaikot police station area in the district,” he said. He said the arrested youths, in the age group of 18-19 years, were identified as Vishal Kushwaha of Rampur Madho village, Mohammad Chand of Sirasia village (both under the Kuchaikot police station area) and Tej Pratap from Kailgar village under the Barharia police station area in the district. The SDPO said preliminary investigations revealed that Roushan had hacked the online game ID of Chand around two months back. “He was not giving the ID back due to which they were unable to play the game together. The three finally throttled him to death and threw his body into the Gandak,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/youths-kill-friend-for-hacking-id-of-online-game/articleshow/80692783.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Business||Cognizant’s net drops for first time ever||Chennai: For the first time in its history, tech titan Cognizant Technology Solutions saw its profits contract both, on a quarterly by 2.3% and annually by 0.8%, as a one time impairment cost of nearly $140 million towards settling a customer exit resulted in its poor performance. This comes at a time when its comparable Indian peers have seen a bumper performance for the December quarter, who beat street estimates and also revised guidance upwards. Net income or profits were down to $316 million in the December quarter from $395 million. Cognizant follows the calendar year fiscal. For the whole year, profits were down 24% at $1.33 billion over 2019. It has guided to a 4% to 7% growth in 2021 in constant currency. Margins dropped to 11.1% from 14.6%. Quarterly employee attrition rise to 16% from 10% on a sequential basis. Cognizant made an offer in the fourth quarter to settle and exit a large customer engagement in the financial services segment in Continental Europe. The offer includes, among other terms, a proposed one-time payment and forgiveness of certain receivables. As a result of this offer, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a reduction of revenue of $107 million and additional expenses of $33 million, primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets.“We accomplished a great deal in the past year whilst keeping our clients and our talented associates foremost in mind,” said Brian Humphries, CEO of the company. “Having strengthened our portfolio, and anticipating the exit of a large financial services engagement, we enter 2021 reinvigorated by our growing commercial momentum, investments in our future, and our vision to become the pre-eminent technology services partner to clients globally.”While the performance stumped many employees who haven’t seen a growth dip ever, some analysts were upbeat. “Considering a ransomware attack, Covid impact and significant organizational restructuring, it's pretty impressive how Cognizant has kept chugging along. While the numbers have stayed pretty flat, the prolific string of recent acquisitions, a new leadership team, impressive resilience and some notable deal wins have raised Cognizant’s brand in recent months,” said Phil Fersht, analyst at HFS Research. He also said that 2021 will be crucial for Brian Humphries, the company’s chief executive officer (CEO) who took control nearly 21 months ago and announced a ‘fit for growth’ programme to make Cognizant an industry bellwether again. For the December quarter, financial services revenue decreased 11.1% YoY driven by declines in both banking and insurance. Growth in regional banks and retail banking was offset by the anticipated exit from a customer engagement, which negatively impacted our revenues in this segment by 730 basis points (100 basis points = 1%). Healthcare revenue grew 4% YoY, products and resources revenues decreased 1.6% YoY driven by retail, consumer goods, travel and hospitality clients that were particularly adversely affected by the pandemic, partially offset by double-digit constant currency growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Communications, Media and Technology increased 4.6% YoY including a negative 790 basis point impact from our exit of certain content-related services, driven by double-digit constant currency growth in both technology and communications and media, which benefited from our recent acquisitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cognizants-net-drops-for-first-time-ever/articleshow/80694551.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Patna||Schools buckle up for resuming more classes||PATNA: Most private schools in the city have claimed that they are taking all necessary precautions before resuming more senior level classes from Monday. According to the orders issued by the state government, schools will be reopened for the students of classes VI to IX from February 8. Talking to this reporter, Don Bosco Academy principal Mary Alphonsa said, “Only 50% of the students will attend offline classes so that we can ensure physical distancing, guide children properly and sanitize the campus frequently. We will, however, conduct online exams to avoid crowding.” At St Karen’s High School, there are no assemblies or physical training classes and students undergo thermal screening. Principal Seema Singh said, “The asymptomatic students have already signed a consent letter.” Bishop Scott-Patna chairman Shailesh Prasad Singh told this newspaper about frequent hand sanitization, isolation and classes on alternate days. “We do not permit students to roam on the campus unnecessarily. Thankfully, no Covid-19 cases have been reported here,” he said. Gyan Niketan School, on the other hand, has different entrances for students of different classes. “We have made arrangements for masks. The railings and gates are sanitized properly and parents are told to provide homemade lunch for students,” the school’s vice principal Shailendra Mohan Jha claimed. Students, however, are comfortable attending offline classes after remaining indoors for nearly eight months due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Prashasti Prakash, a class VI student, said, “I will take all precautions while attending classes. It is a boon to finally get back to school after such a long time.” Class X student Vaishnavi Kumari said, “The canteen has been closed to avoid unnecessary meetings during the lunch break. We have also been instructed to bring homemade food.” Parents, on the other hand, are still concerned about their children. Homemaker Ritu Prasad said, “Being a parent, I am not sure if proper precautions are being taken in schools. Offline classes should have begun after common people got shots of the Covid vaccines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schools-buckle-up-for-resuming-more-classes/articleshow/80694062.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Chandigarh||Cong MLAs march to Raj Bhawan in solidarity with farmers||Chandigarh: Congress MLAs led by former chief minister and leader of opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, marched on foot to Raj Bhawan. The police had put up barricades to stop the march near the Raj Bhawan. Congress MLAs stood in the rain at barricading near Raj Bhawan, waiting for the governor to give them an appointment. Speaking to reporters, Hooda said he has been constantly seeking an appointment with the governor as both, the ruling and the opposition have their own importance in democracy. “It is the constitutional right of the opposition to convey the voice of the people to the governor and it is the duty of the governor to listen to the opposition. But by not giving the opposition time to meet, the governor is not discharging his constitutional obligation,” he said. Hooda said the Congress is demanding the governor to convene a special session of the assembly so that the issue of farmers can be discussed. “Congress will bring amendments to the MSP guarantee in the APMC Act and a no-confidence motion against the government because the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) coalition government has lost public confidence. The situation has become such that due to opposition from the people, the chief minister, ministers and MLAs backing the government are also avoiding going to their constituencies,” he claimed. “Some legislators are opposing the government in public but support the government in Chandigarh. The motion of no confidence will make it clear which MLA is with the public and which MLA is with the government. The government is scared of this no-confidence motion because if this motion comes in the assembly, the people will pressurise the ruling legislators to vote against the anti-people government,” he claimed. Hooda added that if the government falls in the motion of no confidence then it will put pressure on the central government and it will be forced to withdraw the three anti-farmer laws. It was with this fear that the assembly speaker cancelled the membership of Congress MLA Pradeep Chaudhary from Kalka, without giving him notice or time, he claimed. Answering a question on Abhay Chautala’s resignation, he said Chautala should have not resigned and voted against them. “Why did he not resign when farmers were being shot in Kandela during the INLD government in 2000. This no-confidence motion will reveal the truth of those who are merely playing political games under the guise of the peasant movement and running indirect alliances with the government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-mlas-march-to-raj-bhawan-in-solidarity-with-farmers/articleshow/80696240.cms||---

SFL’s net profit tally is up 20.6% but given that its last Q3 net profit included a one-time deferred tax reversal of Rs 42 crore, the real jump is higher said Arathi Krishna, MD, Sundram Fasteners. The company, which had cut its capex by 50% to Rs 150 crore in the current year, will invest more than Rs 300 crore in the new fiscal, 10% of it on its aerospace and defence business, added Krishna.

February 5, 2021||Patna||Not happy with probe, netas meet governor||PATNA: Not satisfied with the police’s road rage theory in the IndiGo airlines station manager Rupesh Singh’s murder case, a delegation of politicians cutting across party lines met governor Phagu Chauhan on Thursday and submitted a memorandum requesting a CBI inquiry into the case. Opposition leaders also criticized the state government accusing it of protecting "real culprits" and making a scapegoat of petty criminals. Among those who met the governor were former MP Arun Kumar, former ministers Suresh Sharma and Ajeet Kumar and former MLAs Ram Jatan Sinha, Veena Shahi and Awnish Kumar Singh. This delegate had met the deceased’s family on Wednesday. Arun told TOI that the theory presented by the police was shocking. “Earlier, DGP had said that a contract killer was involved and they had raided over 200 places. But what police told on Wednesday about road rage is surprising. There is a psychology that if any brawl occurs in the road rage, it is immediate, unlike this one in which police is saying that Rupesh was murdered after two months,” said Arun. BJP leader and former minister Suresh Sharma said the governor has given assurance on their demand. Sharma said they met the governor under the umbrella of Bhumihar Brahmashi Samaj and not as members of any political party. Congress Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Singh reiterated his earlier demand of judicial probe into the high-profile murder. Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, had made a series of tweet lashing out at the government and the police for the theory is presented in the high-profile murder. In one of his tweet, Tejashwi said this murder case was being suppressed like Navruna murder case. Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) leader Rajesh Ranjan, alias Pappu Yadav also raised questions on Ritu Raj who the police had said had shot Rupesh. “Ritu Raj is from a well to do family. Even if he has killed Rupesh, that means he is a professional shooter hired by someone. Then who had hired him for murder? Also, police are talking about the road rage, where are the recordings of CCTV cameras put on the road. To save big fish, smaller ones are being trapped.” Politicians throng Rupesh’s village: Expressing discontent over the police theory of road rage behind Rupesh’s murder, several political leaders visited his village Sawari Buxi under Jalalpur police station in Saran district on Wednesday. Former Bihar Congress president Ram Jatan Sinha and former minister Veena Shahi consoled Rupesh’s mother. Former BJP Minister Suresh Sharma demanded CBI investigation in the case. Father of Rupesh, Sheo Ji Singh, wife Nitu Singh and many others have rejected the theory given by the police and have demanded justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/not-happy-with-probe-netas-meet-governor/articleshow/80694486.cms||Sheezan Nezami
February 5, 2021||Business||‘Fit for Growth’ strategy has been executed: Cognizant CEO||Chennai: After taking control of the corner room in April 2019, Brian Humphries set out on a strategy to make Cognizant an industry bellwether again. The resultant impact is several thousand of old timers quit, some business verticals were shut. In a chat with TOI, Humphries says his work is done and now the company will start galloping. Excerpts:Are you disappointed or do you feel that you’re on track to achieve what you set out to do 21 months ago?The numbers were solid. We are ultimately turning the corner and are very excited for the year ahead. The numbers may have been somewhat confusing because we had a one-time impact in the quarter as we anticipated an early exit from a certain financial services contract in Europe. But that is a one-time hit. If you exclude that, we actually beat our guidance on revenue and margin. In fact, we exceeded Wall Street’s expectations on revenue and margin. We expect growth in high single digits in the coming year. It could even hit double digits, subject to what we do with mergers and acquisitions.Did you envisage a situation where you will see a revenue contraction, ever?We had two major elementis that impacted our revenue growth in the quarter. One was the exit of content moderation services. That is something we talked about five quarters ago. As we refined our strategy, we adjusted our portfolio in light of that strategy. We had decided to exit content moderation services. Now, that hurt us by 1.2 (percentage) points in the quarter. Then, there was a negative 2.5 (percentage) points impact related to the anticipated exit of the large financial services engagement. If you normalise for those and Covid, we’re actually doing well.The leading indicator of the future is bookings. And, bookings growth was in the mid-teens. Ultimately, the way you need to think about this is that — it is a company under a transformation. We’re investing over $500 million dollars in our talent, brand, systems and tools. We would invest over a billion dollars in mergers and acquisitions in the coming year.What are your views on voluntary attrition being high?Voluntary attrition had fallen for five quarters in a row to 10% leading into this quarter. One needs to understand that every company’s definition of attrition differs. Ours had come down five quarters in a row. In Q3 earnings, we mentioned that we anticipated a sequential increase as we went through a merit-based promotion and salary increase cycle. And that has happened.Your peers in India have guided to strong numbers, but your guidance seems very tepid. Why is that?I don’t necessarily just compare Cognizant to those companies. Our revenue growth of 5.5% to 8.5% is actually quite strong. It’s a meaningful acceleration from where we were in 2020 and 2019. Our stock has doubled in the last nine months. We’ve had six or seven upgrades in the last six months. And I think we will once again become a magnet for talent, because people see us as a company that’s on the attack. We think we’ve got a winning strategy.Your margins have nearly halved since your heyday. Is that a problem?It is important to recognize that the 11% that you refer actually includes a three-point (3%) hit from that one-time financial services exit. So, margins for the year, were about 15.1%. Next year, we have guided to margins of 15.2%-16.2%. We’re doing that margin expansion whilst accelerating revenue growth, meaningfully investing into a portfolio via mergers and acquisitions, which can be dilutive to the margin in the short term, and also investing close to half a billion dollars in promotions, and salary increases.At what stage can you say that the ‘Fit for Growth’ strategy is operationalised? I think we’re at that stage now. ‘Fit for Growth’ has been executed. We’ve done a large part of the heavy lifting of the transformation. We’re now at the moment where we continue to invest in growth as opposed to taking out costs and we are expecting to see in the coming year, meaningful hiring and meaningful growth acceleration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fit-for-growth-strategy-has-been-executed-cognizant-ceo/articleshow/80694571.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
February 5, 2021||Nashik||Bhusawal division gets Rs 600 crore for infrastructure devpt||NASHIK: The Bhusawal division of the Central Railways has received Rs 600 crore for completing infrastructure works like laying additional railway tracks, construction of road-over-bridges and improving the signals and telecommunication network, said divisional railway manager (DRM) Vivek Kumar Gupta. A Mainline Electrical Multiple Unit (MEMU) train will also start running Bhusawal and Deoali (Nashik Road) soon. The third rake between Bhusawal and Jalgaon is likely to be commissioned by March this year. This will be followed by a third line between Jalgaon and Manmad and a fourth line connecting Jalgaon with Bhusawal by March 2022. On being asked about the Manmad- Godavari Superfast Express, which has still not been started despite Railways starting about 70% of the trains under ‘special’ category, Gupta said, “About 70% of the passengers of the train travel short distances from Manmad to Nashik Road or Manmad to Igatpuri with ‘unreserved’ tickets. So far, there is no decision to start services for people who travel on unreserved tickets. The train will be started only after the Railway board takes a decision.” The DRM further said that Railways is concerned about connecting the rural population to the major towns in the division and as part of it, the division had experimented by running a MEMU train between Bhusawal and Badnera and from Badnera to Amravati, which received an overwhelming response. “We had only four rakes last year. Now, we have eight more MEMU rakes. The day the Railway board allows starting trains for unreserved passengers, we will be in position to launch the Bhusawal – Deolali MEMU services,” he said. Gupta further added that the Railways had allotted Rs 5 crore for setting up workshop for overhauling and repairing of wheels at Traction Machine Workshop (TMC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhusawal-division-gets-rs-600-crore-for-infrastructure-devpt/articleshow/80696253.cms||Abhilash Botekar
February 5, 2021||Patna||Met predicts light rain for two days from today||PATNA: People can expect some wintry showers as the weathermen have predicted light rain along with thundershowers at a few places in the state over the next couple of days. Cloudy conditions are most likely on Friday and probability of showers is more on Saturday. The expected rainy conditions have been attributed to a trough line passing across Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, and the system is likely to be more impactful in south and central Bihar. “The trough line along with moisture incursion from Bay of Bengal in south Bihar and rest of the state is likely to lead to thundershowers and light rain at one or two places in the state,” Dinesh Kumar Bharti, an officer at Patna Meteorological Centre said. Private weather agency Skymetweather had reported on Wednesday that eastern parts of the country, including Bihar, will receive rain activities on February 5 and 6. The intensity of rain will be comparatively less, it said. Shower apart, a gradual upward movement in mercury column is being witnessed at most places in the state. “Apart from slight rise in night temperature, day temperature has also increased by one to two notches in the last 24 hours. Despite the surge in night temperature, it is still being recorded two to three notches lower than normal,” Bharti said. Sheikhpura remained the coldest place in the state on Thursday with a minimum temperature of 5.6 degrees C. The minimum temperature in Patna on Thursday was recorded at 7.6 degrees C, three notches lower than normal. Maximum temperature in Patna, on the other hand, witnessed a sharp rise of four notches in the last 24 hours as it surged from 23.8 degrees C on Wednesday to 27.8 degrees C on Thursday, four notches higher than normal for the day. “An anti-cyclonic circulation is prevailing over Madhya Pradesh, which is likely to push the day as well as night temperatures by one or two degrees C,” Bharti said. India Meteorological Department (IMD) also stated in its bulletin on Thursday that minimum temperature is expected to rise by 2-3 degrees C in many parts of eastern India during the next 2-3 days and it would fall by 2-3 degrees C thereafter. Skymet reported on Wednesday that reversal of winds from dry and cold northwesterly to warm and humid easterly and southeasterly would lead to an increase in minimum temperatures and abatement of cold wave conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-predicts-light-rain-for-two-days-from-today/articleshow/80694023.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Kolkata||No business boost despite 100% hall-occupancy order||KOLKATA: Footfall at cinemas did not show any appreciable change after the state released an order allowing 100% occupancy. While the cinema-viewing habit might return only with big-ticket releases, the worry is for makers of non-big-ticket movies. In the new-normal world, OTT seems to be the best bet for such movies before they get any opportunity for making some impact on the big screen. While the likes of Nandan and Navina are waiting for this Friday to implement the order, the rest are already following the new SOP. On Tuesday afternoon, the booking counter outside Priya wore a deserted look. Dhiraj Singh, who was manning the booth, told TOI that there was only a handful of people who had come to watch the 1pm show of ‘Battle Ground’. The seating capacity at Priya is 541. “Some 16-17 people came for the 1pm show. Since there were no takers for the Hindi show of ‘Battle Ground’ at 3.30pm, we cancelled it,” Singh said. A couple who had walked in late had to return because the show was cancelled. The story was similar at the 16 screens in nine properties of SVF Cinemas across Bengal. With ‘Cheeni’, ‘Tumi Ashbe Bole’ and ‘Vijay The Master’ being screened following the government order from Tuesday, the footfall hasn’t been anything to write home about. “Only 107 tickets were sold in all the SVF Cinemas properties on Tuesday,” said a spokesperson. From exhibitors to audience, the wait now is for big-ticket movies. Viewers are willing to go to cinemas and pay for movies only if they get value for money. “In the new-normal world, cinemas have to be made for the big screen. Larger-than-life movies that need a big canvas will draw viewers. The rest will have to shift to OTT and television,” said Arijit Dutta, the owner of Priya, adding that a lot of small films that released after the cinemas opened would perhaps have never got a big-screen release otherwise. However, none really performed well. The blame can’t completely be attributed to the fear of going to cinemas, however. Had that been the case, such large numbers of viewers wouldn’t have turned up to watch movies at the 26th Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF). According to a section in Tollywood, small films will have it even more difficult now. With the governm-ent all set to release new norms to regulate OTT content, it will be a tight-rope walk for many who need to produce non-controversial gripping content.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-business-boost-despite-100-hall-occupancy-order/articleshow/80694724.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
February 5, 2021||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bank employee arrested for Rs 3.2 crore fraud||KOLKATA: The Bidhannagar cyber cell on Wednesday nabbed an employee of a private bank for allegedly siphoning Rs 3.2 crore from a Baguiati-based customer and redirecting the money into eight accounts. The accused had changed the phone number and email ID of the victim, then residing in Chennai, before committing the crime. Cops said the Calcutta High Court had rejected Bappaditya Biswas’s anticipatory bail and the accused was sent to police custody for two weeks. According to special public prosecutor and cyber expert Bivas Chatterjee, when the victim stopped receiving alerts after Biswas changed the contact details linked with her Kaikhali branch account, Biswas teamed up with Samiran Saha and stole the money. When the bank found out, Biswas was suspended. The first arrest in this case was Saha who was caught in Sodepur last September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bank-employee-arrested-for-rs-3-2cr-fraud/articleshow/80694742.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
February 5, 2021||Patna||‘Cancer cases high due to lack of awareness’||PATNA: Lack of awareness about cancer and its symptoms and delay in screening are among the major reasons for death due to cancer across the country. As per the state government’s data, every year in Bihar nearly 1.40 lakh cancer cases are registered, out of which two-third are those who have entered the advanced stage. Among the cancer cases in Bihar, oral, breast and cervical cancers are the most common. Mahavir Cancer Institute medical superintendent Dr LB Singh said not only people, but even healthcare workers in rural areas are not aware of the symptoms of cancer. “In case of ulcer or boil which is not getting treated, rural practitioners give antibiotics instead of sending them for screening. At our institute, almost 99% of the cases are those which have reached the advanced stage,” said Dr Singh. He further said obstructive jaundice also leads to gallbladder cancer and many people keep delaying, thinking jaundice will get cured with time. Giving the break-up of the cases at the hospital, Dr Singh said every day nearly 150 new cancer patients come for a check-up, excluding over 600 old cases. “Over 50% of patients come with oral cancer and nearly 20% of cases are gallbladder cancer. In males, prostate cancer is common and in females breast and cervical cancer. If treated at the right stage, lives can be saved,” he said, adding, the use of tobacco and its products were the main causes of oral cancer in Bihar. The health department also stated that lack of awareness among common people about cancer, deficiency of cancer screening facility at community level, large scale use of tobacco and its products and delay in detection leads to delay in the treatment process. “At the national level, oral, breast and cervical cancer are the common ones and comprise a total of 34% of the cases. There are high chances of survival in such cases, but only if they are screened on time and treatment starts,” read a statement by the health department. It further stated that if detected in the early stage then 60% of oral, 73% of cervical and 76% of breast cancer patients can survive. Doctors at AIIMS-Patna also emphasized the need for awareness regarding cancer among common people and started a campaign ‘I am and I will’. Hospital’s director Dr PK Singh said, “Awareness is the biggest way to protect from cancer.” Govt launches cancer screening initiative: Union minister Raj Kumar Singh and state health minister Mangal Pandey on Thursday launched a cancer screening-cum-awareness programme on the occasion of the World Cancer Day. This will be done initially in 14 districts in collaboration with Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Muzaffarpur. Singh, who was present through video conference congratulated the health minister and department officials for this initiative. Fourteen districts where these facilities will be provided are Aurangabad, Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Bhojpur, Darbhanga, Gaya, Madhubani, Nalanda, Patna, Samastipur, Siwan, Supaul, Vaishali and Muzaffarpur. “Detection of cancer and its timely treatment will help in reducing fatalities. This programme will prove to be a milestone in curbing cancer cases,” said Pandey. Health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said with the help of Rural Electrification Corporation and Tata Memorial Hospital, they will be able to detect cancer patients and get them registered for treatment. “With the help of a population-based cancer registry, we will be able to get important data,” Amrit added. For the initial stage, which will continue for three years, the health department has targeted to screen 1.50 to 1.80 lakh people in a year. There will be four screening camps in each district in a week and awareness programmes will be conducted in education institutes too, highlighting the negative impact of tobacco and other products.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cancer-cases-high-due-to-lack-of-awareness/articleshow/80694489.cms||Sheezan Nezami

While IG (central range) Sanjay Singh ordered Nishi’s suspension, Rakesh and Arun Kumar were placed under suspension by Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma. Nishi was presently posted as SHO of Buddha Colony police station. Several audio recordings of Mishra with these police personnel and liquor smugglers had surfaced in public domain recently in which he could be heard negotiating with both sides for getting arrested persons, seized smuggled liquor consignment and vehicle released. The IG said he has recommended to police headquarters to shift Nishi out of central range. “I have also ordered departmental proceedings against him,” he said. “Mishra used to live on the Kadamkuan police station premises. This could not have been possible without Nishi’s connivance. Several photographs of Mishra with these police personnel had surfaced,” the IG said. Incumbent Kadamkuan SHO Vimlendu had lodged an FIR against Mishra on January 30 and arrested him the next day. However, none of the police personnel were made accused in the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-cops-suspended-in-patna-on-extortion-charge/articleshow/80694434.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Patna||Traders hopeful as Nepal border reopens||PATNA: As movement of people from India to Nepal and vice versa has started, though with restrictions on private vehicles, almost after 11 months following Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown in March last year, people from both sides are hopeful that the local markets would start humming with activities soon. “The wait seems to be over now,” said Ramesh Bhai, a trader of Gaur Bazar, close to India-Nepal border in Sitamarhi district, on Thursday. He said people on foot can cross the border with their luggage. Travelling by bicycles has been kept out from the purview of restrictions. However, neither four wheelers nor motorbikes can enter the limits of the two neighbouring countries due to restrictions at the international borders. The local authorities said commercial vehicles used to cross the internal borders through integrated check posts even during lockdown imposed in Nepal on March 23 last year. However, people’s movement was restricted to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. Traders of Gaur Bazar said the main gate at the border has not been opened, but people go inside Nepal through a small gate. “People’s movement started since 7am on Wednesday,” said Pawan Kumar, a local resident. Residents of Raxaul on India-Nepal border in East Champaran district said the restrictions put up on the movement of people from India to Nepal were very strict, making the task more difficult. People have to apply for e-pass on ccmc.gov.np. The applicants have to be tested negative for Covid nearly 72 hours before the submission of the application. Moreover, they have to explain the purpose of their visit to that country. Most importantly, people can be quarantined after entering Nepal if found Covid positive and will have to pay for the facility. Asman Tamang, the chief district officer of Parsa in Nepal, told this newspaper over the phone that the situation would become normal within a week. “The only border in the district with India has been opened for people on the directive of the ministry of home affairs,” he said. Ashok Vaidya, president of Bharat-Nepal Maitri Sangh, expressed his delight over the opening of the country’s borders with Nepal. “The senior officers of the two countries should consider the problems faced by the people from both sides due to the restrictions,” he said. The traders of Jainagar in Madhubani district said they suffered a huge loss due to the lockdown and ban on entry of people from India to Nepal and vice versa due to Covid pandemic. “It’s a matter of delight that the borders have been opened and business activities will resume,” said Hare Krishna Mandal, a local businessman. Initially, borders have been opened at 28 points. Rajendra Bhardwaj, commandant of 21th battalion of the SSB deployed at India-Nepal border under Bagaha in West district, said they have not received any communication about reopening of the border, leaving the local residents in disarray. Ashok Trivedi, an automobile dealer of Tanki Bazar near Valmikinagar, said the residents from Nepal earlier frequently visited the local market before the lockdown. “Our business activities came to a standstill due to lockdown. We hope the situation will become normal soon,” he added. Meanwhile, locals were jubilant at Bairgania, Sonbarsa and Bhittha Mor border posts in Sitamarhi district. Brisk border trade is underway at all the three entry points. Marriage negotiations have also resumed between people in the bordering areas in both countries. Malahi resident Upendra Singh said he visited the holy shrine at Janakpur Dham a few days ago after long closure of Nepal borders.

February 5, 2021||Kochi||Kerala leads in student attendance||KOCHI: Kerala leads Indian states in terms of attendance rate of students studying in schools and colleges. According to the economic survey (2020-21) released by the Centre, Kerala has the highest age-specific attendance ratio (ASAR) in the 6 to 23 age-group, which includes all levels between primary and higher education. ASAR is the attendance rate that indicates the proportion of children, of a particular age-group, attending schools/colleges, irrespective of the level or class of study. While Kerala is the only state to have achieved 100% attendance rate in the age-groups 6 to 10 and 11 to 13, the state also topped in 14 to 17 age-group with 98.3% attendance rate compared to national ASAR of 78.5%. In the 18-23 age bracket, which comprises students pursuing higher education, Kerala reported the highest attendance rate with 47.4% compared to the national average of 28.8%. While Punjab reported the highest attendance rate of 61.6% among children in the age-group of 3-5 years, Kerala came second with 58.3%. The survey stated that children in the age-group of 6-13 have reported almost over 95% attendance across states. “But, attendance rate in early childhood education, which National Education Policy emphasizes on, is low and diverging irrespective of the achievement in education status of states concerned. Karnataka reported the lowest attendance rate of 18.3% in 3-5 age-group. In 14-17 age-group, which covers the secondary and higher secondary education level, the attendance rates are low, compared to national average, in Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Assam, Gujarat, and Rajasthan,” said the survey.

February 5, 2021||Rajkot||Jamnagar’s tryst with wholesome quinoa||RAJKOT: It’s truly a wonder grain — packing in its little self all the right punches from nutrients and proteins to fibre, iron, magnesium, manganese, calcium, B vitamins to beauty-enhancing essentials! No wonder then, that the rich and crunchy edible seed, which has taken palates by storm across the world, has also tickled a motley group of some 20-odd enterprising farmers of Jamnagar district to test their farming skills by raising the earthy versatile food in their own land. In search of an alternate rabi crop, these farmers learnt about this crop from a research station of Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU) based in Jamnagar. And so, South American quinoa (pronounced ‘keen-wa’) was sown alongside the regular rabi staples as an alternative crop. The Gujarati tillers are hopeful of a getting a good yield from their efforts in the coming days. Quinoa attracted the attention of health conscious urban Indians in metro cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru during the past decade or so. Thanks to its high nutritional value, farming crusader in Jamanagar, Payal Kantariya, a woman farmer of Aarblush village in Lalpur taluka, motivated the other farmers to experiment with the wonder crop this year. Talking to TOI, head of Krushi Vigyan Kendra of JAU research station, K P Baraiya said, “I have given quinoa seeds to 20 farmers of Jamnagar, Lalpur and Khambhalia taluka. We had got these seeds from the central government in the millet research centre.” Bariya further said that quinoa, which takes 105 days to mature from sowing is a one-season rabi crop sown in October-November. While its cultivation requires more care, the advantages of the crop include less use of fertilizer, water and only as much as investment required for millets. This crop can grow in dry soil and has been successfully sown in parts of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Rajasthan for the past few years. “I tried last year but wasn’t successful. With JAU guidance I am again experimenting with this crop this year and have enlisted 20 other farmers to join me. I sowed the crop in one Bigha farmland and the plants have gained four to five feet of height. I am hoping for a good yield,” Kantariya told TOI. According to agriculture scientists, this crop gives yield of nearly 2,500 kg per hectare. Quinoa is sold between Rs 200 and Rs 300 per kilo in the retail market. Kishor Pedhadiya, an organic farmer of Sumri Dhutarpur village of Jamnagar taluka has sown quinoa for the first time this year. “Looking at the health benefits and good prices in metro cities I have decided to experiment with it this year. I am yet to explore the crop’s market and as this is the first time, I will utilize my first yield for my family and friends. Next year I will try commercially,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/jamnagars-tryst-with-wholesome-quinoa/articleshow/80693903.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
February 5, 2021||Surat||Toy chopper creates flutter at Surat airport||SURAT: A remote-controlled toy helicopter was found close to the runway area which created a flutter at the Surat international airport on Wednesday morning. So much so that flight operations were also halted for sometime. The toy, around 10 cm in length, was recovered by the security agencies from the operational area to the runway on Wednesday. The airport authorities have filed a complaint with the city police seeking investigation into the source of the helicopter. An incident report has also been sent to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Airports Authority of India (AAI). RN Patel, police inspector, Dumas police station said, “The helicopter seems to be damaged. Prima facie it looks like someone was flying it from a high-rise building and due to heavy wind, it might have come inside the operational area.” Sources said that the helicopter was sighted by a construction labourer working at the site of the terminal expansion project in the morning. The site is located close to the runway and Air Traffic Control (ATC) was immediately informed. Airport director Aman Saini told TOI, “On Wednesday morning, the ATC got a message that some drone was sighted in the operational area, but when it was checked, it was found to be a small helicopter toy. Police was informed about the recovery and investigations are on” Saini added, “ATC took all actions as per the standard operating procedure (SOP). Nobody has seen the helicopter flying in the operational area. It is a small regular toy and is about 10 cm in length.” ATC officials immediately sent the security jeep for inspection as per procedures and after getting clearance, the flight operations were resumed normally. There was no arrival at that time, some departure flights were ready which were cleared after security jeep completed the runway inspection and gave clearance that took about 8-10 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/toy-chopper-creates-flutter-at-surat-airport/articleshow/80693366.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Kolkata||Kolkata: House doors set ablaze, car gutted||KOLKATA: Residents of Sodepur’s HB Town, a posh locality on the northern fringes of the city, on Thursday were gripped by panic after a gang went on a rampage, setting ablaze a car and the doors of at least three houses. The goons also hurled stones at some houses and damaged the window panes. The families in the damaged houses had a narrow escape as they managed to douse the fire just in time. The car was gutted. A local CPI(M) office was ransacked and the party flags were set on fire. Police are looking for the culprits, no arrest had been made till late night. Residents of the area said the goons attacked the Pallishry area of HB Town under Ward 31 of Panihati Municipality. Pradip Dutta, owner of one of the damaged houses, said, “I was woken up around 2.40am by the smell of something burning. I rushed out of my room to find smoke billowing from the ground floor of my two-storey house. I ran down and saw the doors in flames. The door to my neighbour’s house was also set on fire. I immediately raised an alarm and started pouring water to douse the flames.” The window panes of at least three houses were also broken by the miscreants. They also locked the doors of some houses from outside. “A bicycle and a katari were seized from the spot. A search is on to nab the culprits. We suspect that some local criminals were involved,” a cop from the Barrackpore commissionerate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/house-doors-set-ablaze-car-gutted/articleshow/80696287.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
February 5, 2021||Pune||Pune: Vaccination turnout drops on poor response from rural parts||PUNE: The mega vaccination drive against Covid-19 recorded just 63% turnout in the Pune Metropolitan region (PMR) on Thursday, which health officials attributed to the fact that most immunisation sites were done inoculating their own staffers and those coming from other hospitals did not turn up for various reasons like long distance and prior commitment. Areas in the Pune municipal limits recorded a maximum of 89% turnout on Thursday. The region’s other two administrative segments — Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and rural parts — reported the lowest turnout at 48% and 47%, respectively. A total of 3,392 beneficiaries, including 3,311 healthcare workers and 81 frontliners, took the Covid shot against the day’s target of vaccinating 5,400 beneficiaries. After rural Pune, Talera hospital in the PCMC limits began vaccination of frontline workers from Thursday. A health official said, "Most of the vaccination centres have inoculated a sizable number of their staffers and that was the reason why the turnout exceeded the day's target at most centres initially as it was easier for the staff to get the shot and report back to the duty. Now, healthcare workers from other hospitals have also started reaching out to the vaccination centres for the shot. Some of them may have found the distance too long to cover from their own workplace or some of them may be too much occupied to find time to get the shot.” The region's turnout was 98% on Monday and dipped to 94% on Wednesday. “Most of the registered healthcare workers in Pimpri Chinchwad had already received their first shot. Hence, the numbers are dwindling now,” a PCMC health official said. Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director, Pune region, said, “The response is bound to fluctuate. There are prevailing CoWin app issues, which also create some hindrance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-turnout-drops-on-poor-response-from-rural-parts/articleshow/80696276.cms||Umesh Isalkar
February 5, 2021||Goa||Goa hikes VAT as fuel costs hit all-time high||PANAJI: At a time when fuel prices are already at an all-time high, the state government has decided to levy higher taxes on the commodity. The BJP government has hiked the VAT on petrol to 27% and on diesel to 23%. This will make petrol dearer by Rs 1.3 and diesel by 60 paise. The price of petrol in North Goa currently hovers around Rs 83.13 per litre while diesel costs around Rs 80.13 per litre, depending on the distance from the oil marketing company’s tanks. The move to increase taxes on petrol and diesel at a time when the prices of both the fuels are close to triple digits suggests that the Pramod Sawant government is desperate to shore up its revenues. “The decision was taken at the chief minister’s level,” a senior government official said when asked about the price hike. This is the second time during this financial year that Sawant, who is also the finance minister, has hiked VAT on fuel. Since the time he was sworn in as chief minister in March 2019, VAT has been increased on four occasions, the first being on June 14, when VAT on petrol was hiked from 15% to 20% and VAT on diesel was increased from 15% to 18%. “Sawant doesn’t realise the daily struggles of Goans. At a time when fuel prices are at an all-time high, this incompetent & inconsiderate chief minister has decided to hurt Goenkars even more. Instead of VAT, why don’t you offer subsidies? Wasn’t Rs 300 crore enough?,” said GFP president and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai. According to data tabled in the recently concluded winter assembly session, Goa earned just Rs 625 crore in 2020-21 (till December) against Rs 1,124 crore in 2019-20. While presenting his budget last year, Sawant had estimated VAT collections at Rs 1,220 crore. GST collections for the current fiscal have also dropped drastically because of the Covid pandemic and the close to 80-day stringent lockdown. “An insensitive central government watches fuel hikes with cruel silence along with state governments. The opposition is also not holding any bullock cart rallies while the perennially suffering common man’s woes keep multiplying proportionally with repeated fuel price hikes,” said Porvorim independent MLA Rohan Khaunte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-hikes-vat-as-fuel-costs-hit-all-time-high/articleshow/80697138.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Kolkata||Rs 10 crore hope for East-West Metro extension||KOLKATA: Budget 2021-22 has revived hopes for East-West Metro’s 6.6km extension till Haldiram’s on VIP Road. On one hand, the project has been allocated a token Rs 10 crore, on the other, implementing agency Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) recently submitted the detailed project report (DPR) and an estimated cost of Rs 2,365 crore for it to Railway Board. “The allocation has rekindled aspirations of the city commuters who can be zip all the way from Howrah to VIP Road, via Hooghly river,” a Railway official said. The existing route covers 16km from Salt Lake Sector V to Howrah Maidan. Currently, the last 800m tunnel gap is being bridged. The Sector V-Phoolbagan run may extend till Sealdah by the year-end. The entire 16km is likely to be operational next fiscal. A KMRC official said, “The DPR and cost estimate have been sent to Railway Board. The alignment has been finalized. From Sector V station, the mostly elevated route crosses over to VIP Road via Salt Lake’s Kestopur canal, running along VIP Road’s left flank to end at Haldiram’s, around 7km short of the integrated Metro terminal coming up at Airport.” There will be four stations. The one at Haldiram’s will be underground. After Railway Board’s approval, the cost-sharing will be worked out. Railways and the state will split the cost since the proposal came from the latter. Japan International Cooperation Agency is the principal funding agency of the current project, lending 48% of the total Rs 8,575-crore expenditure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rs-10cr-hope-for-metro-extension/articleshow/80696270.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
February 5, 2021||Pune||Plans afoot for appointment system to inoculate people aged above 50||PUNE: The health ministry is planning to put in place an appointment-based system to vaccinate the target beneficiaries aged above 50 years under the nationwide inoculation programme for the priority groups. The authorities have been sending SMS alerts for the vaccination of the healthcare beneficiaries. Plans are afoot to develop a mechanism to help the people aged above 50 seek appointments and check the nearest vaccination site. Ram Sewak Sharma, chairman of the empowered group of technology and member of the national expert group on vaccine administration, told TOI that the government was readying an additional software that would enable people aged above 50 to fix appointments for the shots. “The system will be on the lines of booking in railways. This will be the model for the vaccination to be carried out for the common people aged above 50 years. The registration will be done using help of the Common Service Centres across the country. The system will help them seek an appointment, for which a separate software using Arogya Setu app will be enabled. The mechanism will be ready before the government rolls out the vaccination drive for this target group,” said Sharma, who has recently also taken over as the chief executive of the National Health Authority. On being asked if Aadhaar details would be used to authenticate the identity of the 50-plus group, he said, “The Aadhaar coverage is above 95%. There should not be an issue and the authentication will make the process simpler. However, the government will have to issue guidelines,” he said. At present, the Aadhaar verification process is being carried out for the healthcare and frontline workers. Besides, there’s a provision of a unique health ID card that is being issued. “We have directed all the states to issue a digital certificate after the vaccination and the data have to be stored in the personal digilocker for further checks. We are also generating digital unique health identification numbers for citizens who have linked their Aadhaar cards for the vaccination programme to eliminate proxies,” Sharma said. On CoWIN glitches leading to delays in the vaccination process, he said new features were being introduced to make the app more citizen-friendly. “All other issues are being ironed out,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plans-afoot-for-appointment-system-to-inoculate-people-aged-above-50/articleshow/80696299.cms||Nisha Nambiar
February 5, 2021||Goa||‘External forces trying to create unrest in Goa’||PANAJI: Catching on to the ‘IndiaAgainstPropaganda’ hashtag that has been trending on Twitter in wake of comments by international personalities on the farmers’ protests, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday said that over the past few months, Goa has become a victim of propaganda which has been significantly fuelled by external forces. Sawant was referring to the sustained opposition to the three contentious linear projects that will cut through the biodiversity hotspot at Mollem. “Some of the opposition parties in Goa have also been motivating such external forces to create an unrest in the state. No propaganda shall derail our sincere efforts towards building a progressive state,” the chief minister tweeted, even as he claimed that some people have sought to catapult the issue surrounding the three projects to the international platform. “The same type of strategy is being used by some people the way Congress leaders did with regard to the Kashmir issue, by taking it to the international level and damaging the issue,” he said. Sawant suggested that the opposition refrain from raising such issues internationally, keeping in mind the development and the interests of the state. Goa has been witnessing large-scale agitations over the past couple of months against the Tamnar power transmission line, railway double-tracking and widening of the national highway. Citizens have been demanding that these three linear projects be scrapped to protect the state’s environment and ecology. A private members’ resolution was moved by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai and Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco at the recently concluded assembly session strongly recommending that the government scrap the three projects traversing the protected areas of Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park in the interest of the public. The resolution was put for voting and was defeated by the ruling dispensation despite some BJP MLAs voicing their opposition to coal-handling and double-tracking while addressing the private members’ resolution. Citizens have been coming out in large numbers at various places to stop the South Western Railway’s track doubling project. They fear that the project is being executed to facilitate the transportation of coal. Children, students, advocates, doctors and teachers have also been making representations to various authorities highlighting the detrimental effects of the projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/external-forces-trying-to-create-unrest-in-goa/articleshow/80697083.cms||---

Ticlo was speaking to reporters after inaugurating the work for road-widening and building a footpath and protection wall from Tarikode to the Moira bridge. “Most of the countries like UK and Italy are still under lockdown due to rising Covid cases, but the situation in Goa and our country under the leadership of our Prime Minister and chief minister is still under control,” Ticlo said, adding, “EDC is ready to fully support the youth and there are a lot of schemes for men as well as women in agriculture. ” The MLA also said that renovation works of Corjuem fort will be taken up soon. “The technical sanction for the renovation works of the fort has already been givena couple of days back and it is in the tendering process. The work of the renovation will start during my tenure.” he said.

February 5, 2021||Goa||Poll panel for urban civic polls in Goa in March-end||PANAJI: The state election commission (SEC) has proposed that municipal elections in the state should be held in the last week of March. A senior officer said that the final decision will be taken in consultation with the state government. Elections to 11 municipalities, except Ponda and Sakhali, and the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) are now likely to be held along with by-elections to village panchayats and ZPs. The SEC has moved a file to the state government and is waiting for discussions to announce the date. A senior BJP functionary said that they are in favour of holding municipal polls mid March. State BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade on Saturday said that the party has told chief minister Pramod Sawant not to hold the municipal elections, scheduled in April, on party lines. Last month, the SEC postponed the upcoming elections by three months due to the Covid vaccination drive. The SEC said that it is aware that the officials responsible for holding elections are those working as deputy collectors, mamlatdars, etc, who would also be engaged in the management of the vaccination drive. So, it wouldn’t be appropriate to burden them with the additional responsibility of holding elections and it was deferred by three months. On January 12, the urban development department sent the SEC a letter raising concerns about crowds during the campaign period, which may have implications for Covid management. The government also requested the SEC to conduct municipal and CCP elections together to avoid a prolonged code of conduct period, which could halt development works The SEC said that the election process involves holding public meetings, rallies and processions during the campaign period, and enforcing health protocols and regulating the number of participants at these gatherings would be a serious issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poll-panel-for-urban-civic-polls-in-march-end/articleshow/80697172.cms||Murari Shetye

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has formed a committee of senior health officials to decide how to distribute the health equipment, such as beds, ventilators and oxygen cylinders lying unused at the jumbo Covid centres at the College of Engineering Pune (CoEP), Baner, and the Annasaheb Magar stadium in Pimpri, a civic official said. The three centres are expected to be dismantled by February-end. According to the PMC data, around 1,500 beds, including 500 oxygen beds and 100 ventilators, would be available for civic hospitals once the jumbo hospitals are dismantled. PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said the infrastructure transfer would be done after taking into account the proximity of the jumbo units to hospitals. “The equipment from the CoEP centre would likely be transferred to the PMC, while those at Baner or Magar hospital might be given to hospitals in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits,” Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/assessment-of-medical-infrastructure-on-for-allotting-jumbo-care-units-equipment/articleshow/80696305.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Kozhikode||Beef merchants feel the pinch of Karnataka law||KOZHIKODE: Cattle traders and meat merchants in Kerala have started to feel the pinch of stringent anti-cattle slaughter law, passed recently by Karnataka, as it has cut their supply line of livestock from the neighbouring state. The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020 – which came into force on Jan 18 – outlaws the transport of cattle outside the state for the purpose of slaughter. Also, it has widened the definition of cattle to include cow, calf of a cow and bull, bullock and he or she buffalo aged below 13. Meat merchants in Kerala, one of the largest beef consuming states in the country, say that Karnataka used to account for 30-40% of their supply and now they are forced to solely depend on cattle from Tamil Nadu. "Supply of cattle from Karnataka has stopped as officials intensified checks at the border and blocking cattle trucks. The move has hit the cattle markets in Malabar including the ones at Koduvally, Manjeri and Chelari as Karnataka was the main source of live animals in the region. We have written to the government to take up the matter with Karnataka and find a way out," said PV Kunhayeen Koya, president of All Kerala Meat Merchants Association. He said that though the sector is managing with supply from Tamil Nadu along domestically-raised cattle, the supply disruption from Karnataka would cause issues during Eid in May. "Also, cattle markets in TN, which were closed following Covid-19, have not opened and we are now arranging supply of live animals through brokers. We have urged the government to take up the matter with TN government as well," he added. Haneefa KK, a beef merchant at Vellayil in Kozhikode, said cattle suppliers from TN are exploiting this new dependency as they increased the wholesale prices of livestock. Animal Husbandry Department figures showed that meat production in state stood at 2.5 lakh tonnes, comprising both cattle and buffalo in 2018-19. The estimated number of animals slaughtered stood at 13 lakh cattle and 8.5 lakh buffalos during 2018-19. The beef market of state is valued at Rs 6,500 crore. The new anti-cattle slaughter law in Karnataka also says that no person shall purchase, sell or offer to purchase cattle for slaughter. It also imposes stringent punishment for violation of the legislation including imprisonment between three years and five years with a fine not less than Rs 50,000 which may be extended up to Rs five lakh for offences like transport of cattle outside the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/beef-merchants-feel-the-pinch-of-ktaka-law/articleshow/80694533.cms||K R Rajeev
February 5, 2021||Pune||Jab sessions set to rise to 6 days a week across Maharashtra||PUNE: The state health department will increase the number of vaccination days in a week to six by starting sessions on Tuesdays in private hospitals following the inoculation of frontline workers in Maharashtra, deputy director of health services (Pune region) Dr Sanjay Deshmukh said on Thursday. The drive is currently held on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. The district authorities will also increase the number of target beneficiaries at each session site to 200 per day from the existing 100 a day by next week. “The aim is to maximize the vaccination of beneficiaries and meet the targets as the inoculation of frontline workers has also started along with healthcare workers. Tuesdays are usually the days when children’s immunization programme is carried out in government hospitals. Keeping this in mind, Tuesday was earlier excluded from the list of vaccination days. But such programmes are not undertaken in private hospitals. Tuesdays’ vaccination sessions will be limited to private hospitals,” said Deshmukh. An official circular recently stated that the number of session sites in Pune circle would be increased to 135 from the existing 85 in Pune, Satara and Solapur districts. In Pune district, the number of session sites would be increased to 80 from 53. Deshmukh said all the districts in the state have been given the authority to increase the session sites as per their need. Besides, in cases where more than 100 beneficiaries are called at a site, then the number of vaccinators could also be increased, i.e. one vaccinator per hundred beneficiaries. He added that the districts and the municipal corporations have been told that it was binding to organize vaccination sessions on minimum five days a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jab-sessions-set-to-rise-to-6-days-a-week-across-state/articleshow/80696368.cms||Neha Madaan

February 5, 2021||Goa||Retiring an instructor two years early illegal, pay dues: HC to govt||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has held that retiring a clinical instructor at age 60 in 2018 was not legal and has directed the health department to pay her all financial benefits like differential salary, increments. The court stated that the post of clinical instructor in the institute of nursing education is a teaching post and the petitioner holding the post from 2012 was always regarded as a member of the teaching staff of the institute which is affiliated to Goa University. “Accordingly, we hold that retiring the petitioner with effect from from April 30, 2018, consequent upon her attaining age of 60 years was not proper because, the petitioner was entitled to continue in service as a clinical instructor until April 30, 2020, by which date she would have attained the enhanced age of superannuation of 62 years,” the court noted. Mansavi Vadiekar was appointed as staff nurse at GMC on regular basis in April 2010. In 2012 she was promoted to post of clinical instructor in the instate on ad hoc basis. She also claimed that she was denied promotion to the post of tutor and pointed out that she was retired at the age of 60. During the hearing of the case, senior advocate S D Lotlikar submitted that irrespective of the issue of regularisation as clinical instructor, the petitioner was entitled to continue in services until she attains the age of 62 years, and her retirement at the age of 60 years was quite arbitrary and in breach of the provisions of Section 15A of the Goa University Act, 1984. Advocate general Devidas Pangam argued that the provisions of Section 15A of the act would apply only in case of a member of the teaching staff, holding the post on a substantive basis and not on ad hoc basis. Denial of such benefit of enhanced retirement age to the petitioner was contrary to law, besides being discriminatory and consequently violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, the court held Since it is not possible at this stage to reinstate her since she has already attained the enhanced age of superannuation of 62 years, the court directed that all her financial benefits as well as retiral benefits will have to be reworked and paid to her based on this. “All this exercise will have to be completed within three months, failing which the respondents will have to pay interest on these amounts to the petitioner at the rate of 9% per annum,” the division bench comprising Mahesh Sonak and Bharati H Dangre stated. The court did not grant relief on her plea of denial of promotion to the post of tutor while in service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/retiring-an-instructor-two-years-early-illegal-pay-dues-hc-to-govt/articleshow/80697165.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Pune||Pune: Beneficiaries from other hubs to get Covaxin at Aundh hospital||PUNE: Healthcare workers of other facilities are in line to get Covaxin at the District Hospital, Aundh, as most of its staffers have been covered under the vaccination drive. According to the vaccination officers, the response to Covaxin has been steadily increasing. They claimed that the word of mouth publicity played a key role in creating trust in the vaccine. Besides, hardly any side-effects among recipients also helped in boosting confidence among health workers. One of the beneficiaries, Pallavi Gagare (27), a supervisor at Maharashtra Emergency Medical Services (MEMS) at Aundh Chest Hospital, said she had doubts when told about the vaccination drive and that she was eligible for inoculation. “The medical practitioners in our institution helped me clear doubts. Also, many of our colleagues were vaccinated and had good experience,” she said. A medical practitioner from a private hospital on the condition of anonymity said discussions were on among their colleagues about the vaccination from the past few days and when their names appeared in Wednesday’s list, they got vaccinated. Pranita Joshi (25), an emergency response officer at MEMS, said she got the courage to get inoculated from her mother — an Asha worker. “She was administered the vaccine in the last week of January. After the shot, she has been doing fine and following her encouragement, I also decided to get vaccinated,” said Joshi. Apeksha Rathod (24), another emergency response officer at MEMS, said she was initially confused because many false news about the vaccine were doing the rounds on social media. After many of her colleagues got vaccinated, she was convinced that it was safe. According the district health office’s report, around 558 beneficiaries have been vaccinated at the District Hospital, Aundh, till Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/beneficiaries-from-other-hubs-to-get-covaxin-at-aundh-hosp/articleshow/80696338.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Goa||At 40% more, GFP calls new medical waste contract dubious||Panaji: Goa Forward Party (GFP) claimed that the contract awarded to a Gurugram-based firm to collect and treat biomedical waste is a scam in the making as the rates are nearly 40% more than that being charged by the current firm. Using government documents, copies of which TOI has in its possession, GFP pointed out that the Goa Health Monitoring Services currently collects biomedical waste from private hospitals and other medical practitioners at the rate of Rs 700-Rs 900 per month. In comparison, Biotic Waste Solutions Pvt Ltd, which has been appointed by Goa Waste Managment Corporation (GWMC) plans to charge Rs 900-Rs 1,800. GFP also claimed that the firm, Biotic Waste Solutions, plans to take over the operations of Goa Medical College’s 100 kg per hour incinerator. Describing the government’s move as “dubious and fishy”, GFP said that the higher rates could prompt some medical practitioners to violate bio-waste treatment norms. GWMC awarded the contract to Biotic Waste Solutions Pvt Ltd on February 4 to design, build and operate a common biomedical waste treatment plant at Kundaim industrial estate. The Gurugram-based firm will be responsible for collection, transportation and treatment of biomedical waste in Goa. The letter says that the “negotiations and discussions” were conducted with the approval of GWMC chairman. Chief minister Pramod Sawant is the chairman of GWMC. What has alarmed GFP is the move by Biotic Waste Solutions to take over the incinerator installed at GMC as a stop-gap arrangement till the biomedical waste treatment facility comes up at Kundaim. “We are exploring legal options because it clearly looks that there is a middleman involved and the chief minister should come clean because the government said that the rates were negotiated with the chairman,” GFP vice-president Durgadas Kamat said. Former Margao Municipal Council chairperson Babita Angle, who is a member of the Indian Medical Association’s Goa branch, said that private medical practitioners were in discussions with the state government to send biomedical waste to Karwar for treatment as GMC was unable to process all waste generated in Goa. On February 3, TOI had reported on its frontpage that healthcare facilities in the state generate up to 3,000kg of bio-medical waste daily, but due to a lack of a common treatment facility, most of it is left untreated “These charges are almost 40% more than what we were paying,” Angle said. Angle also said that the increase in waste collection rates could encourage medical practitioners to cut corners while disposing medical waste. “These rates are quite ridiculous especially when we had a facility where we were paying much lesser,” said Angle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-40-more-gfp-calls-new-medical-waste-contract-dubious/articleshow/80697200.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Goa||IPB seeks social media agency to build brand Goa||Panaji: In a bid to improve Goa’s image as an investment destination, Goa Investment Promotion Board (IPB) plans to appoint a social media marketing agency for a period of three months. The agency will have to create a buzz on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter that it is easy to do business in Goa. The social media agency will also have to create awareness about new services introduced by government departments along with reforms undertaken by the state. Goa Investment Promotion & Facilitation Board has floated a tender to appoint the agency which will have to develop a “brand identity for Ease of Doing Business” and manage Goa’s brand image, said IPB chief executive officer Vandana Rao. “Agency will be appointed for a period of three months initially, with a provision to extend for additional two months if required,” said Rao in the tender document. On January 9, TOI had reported that disappointed with previous ease of doing business rankings, the Goa government planned to initiate a media blitz to change the perception of Goa. IPB has has been tasked with implementing the Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 to improve the state’s ranking in the Ease of Doing Business index. The agency, which should have five years work experience, needs to create content on social media, designing simple yet captivating graphic designs and publish them across all social media platforms The agency will have to publish at least five social media posts every week based on the instructions provided by IPB and use appropriate hashtags and other parameters to maximise reach. Though the government will also seek user feedback and suggestions, “inappropriate comments” will have to be taken down immediately, IPB said. The agency will also be responsible for conducting data analysis and developing a strategy to increase Goa’s visibility on social media pages through “organic and paid channels”. IPB hopes to have the agency on board by the end of February. A government circular issued in January by the industries department to heads of all departments and secretaries had also said that awareness needs to be created about the government’s online services for which extensive newspaper advertisements may be published over a period of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ipb-seeks-social-media-agency-to-build-brand-goa/articleshow/80697202.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

February 5, 2021||Goa||Goa: Court raps cops for murder charges on anti-IIT protesters||PANAJI: While granting anticipatory bail to anti-IIT protesters at Melauli in Sattari against whom FIRs were filed, a district court stated that although Section 307 of attempt to murder has been applied by police, it was not spelt out whom the protesters wanted to murder. “Specific role of applicant is also not spelt out. The reply filed by the respondents is also very vague and does not spell out why custody is required. Bail cannot be denied as punishment and person cannot be sent to jail as punishment. Offence of attempt to murder is applied, but it is not spelt out as to whom the applicant wanted to kill,” district judge Irshad Agha observed. Several persons, including policemen, were injured in the clash between locals and policemen early last month. After the violence, the government decided not to go ahead with the IIT project in Melauli The court stated that in the event of arrest protesters be released on furnishing bail bond of Rs 10,000. The court ordered that they “shall not enter within a range of 200m from the spot of agitation in the village of Melauli for a period of two months from today”. The court directed them to appear before the crime branch, Ribandar, for a period of five days and as and when requiredfor investigation. Advocate Caroline Collasso, representing the protesters, submitted that police inspector Sagar Ekoskar acted brutally by stamping on an aged lady, which triggered the situation causing it to spiral out of control. Public prosecutor Poonam Bharne stated that the police had to take some action because the situation went out of control. Ekoskar filed a complaint stating that the protesters and other villagers formed an unlawful assembly and were armed with deadly weapons like stones, dandas and coitas, among others. He also stated that the protesters restricted the movements of police, civil administration staff, SDM Sattari and the survey team. The accused also pelted stones on public staff, survey team and civil staff and assaulted them with dandas and coitas thereby causing simple and grievous injuries to police staff and damaging their protective shields and helmets, Ekoskar stated. The prosecution stated that the assault had been planned ahead, on January 5. Protesters began marching to Valpoi police station and threatened to damage government property and also to cause injury to the staff and blocked the main road restricting vehicular traffic. The protesters stated that they are farmers and along with their families have been growing rice, vegetables and plucking cashew fruit/seeds from the cashew plantation in the village. They submitted that the government had given its clearance for setting up of the IIT campus and that according to the NGT order dated August 4, 2018, “no activity adversely impacting eco-sensitive areas be permitted in the area covered by the draft notification February 27, 2017, till the matter is finalised”. The protesters submitted that the Melauli village is entirely within the area covered by the draft notification and that they are concerned about the takeover of forests land in the village for the IIT and joined the hundreds of villagers sitting in protest merely to protect their lands and livelihood. They stated that they in no way instigated or lead the local people and were merely protecting against the forcible takeover of their lands and erupted in anger only when the PI stepped on the stomach/chest of women lying down on the ground in protest. Public prosecutor Bharne submitted that deadly weapons were found from the place, which shows that they had gathered at the spot to commit some crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/court-raps-cops-for-murder-charges-on-anti-iit-protesters/articleshow/80697212.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Ahmedabad||Mevani’s discharge pleas rejected||AHMEDABAD: In a setback for Dalit rights activist and Vadgam MLA, Jignesh Mevani, a city sessions court has refused to discharge him in two cases registered against him. He has been charged allegedly for obstructing a train at Kalupur railway station and for holding an unauthorized demonstration at Income-Tax Circle which led to damage of public property. Mevani and his supporters had protested against the state government’s policies during the Vibrant Gujarat Summit on January 11, 2017 and had declared a ‘rail roko’ andolan. He and other protestors allegedly stopped the Rajdhani Express for 20 minutes at Kalupur railway station. A female RPF constable also complained of being manhandled. The protestors along with Mevani were booked and arrested for rioting, criminal conspiracy as well as under section 153 of the Indian Railway Act. Criminal prosecution was initiated in the metropolitan court, which refused to discharge him on November 13, 2020. The rejection of his discharge application brought Mevani to the city sessions court, reiterating that he was not involved in any unauthorised gathering and he had not obstructed passengers of the train. He claimed there was no evidence against him. The state government opposed his revision application for discharge. After hearing the case, additional sessions judge Ashok Sharma last week said that the stage of framing of charges cannot be turned into a mini trial with detailed scrutiny of evidence. "It becomes clear from the statement of prosecution witnesses and as per the allegations in the chargesheet, the identity and role of the revisionist/accused (Mevani) is prima facie established," the court observed while rejecting the application. On the same day, the city sessions court also rejected Mevani’s other discharge plea with regard to a case of violation of public notification and charges of damaging public property, when he along with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation workers had staged a protest at the Income-Tax Circle on September 27, 2016. The Navrangpura police had filed an FIR against Mevani and others. The metropolitan court and the sessions court have rejected his request to drop charges in this case as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mevanis-discharge-pleas-rejected/articleshow/80694445.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Goa||Sawant reworks seniority list for cabinet ministers||Panaji: The state government on Monday issued a fresh notification to define the seniority of ministers in the chief minister Pramod Sawant led administration. In the seniority list, waste management minister Michael Lobo has been placed at the last spot from the earlier seventh position. Sources said that a few ministers demanded to the chief minister that they are senior ministers, but this was not reflecting in the seniority list.

As per the new list, only deputy chief ministers Chandrakant Kavlekar and Manohar Ajgaonkar, and art and culture minister Govind Gaude continue to be in the same position.

February 5, 2021||Pune||Herd immunity can’t be taken for granted as yet, say experts||PUNE: The Covid task force experts cautioned against taking the herd immunity for granted despite some sero-surveillance reports showing 50-60% of the people tested had antibodies. Niti Aayog member Dr Vinod Paul, also a member of the national task force, told TOI, “The cautious approach should be maintained despite these reports.” The national serosurvey report released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Thursday stated that only 21% of the population showed evidence of past exposure to Covid-19. Paul said it meant that a large proportion of people were still vulnerable to the infection. Scientists estimate that 70-85% of people should develop antibodies before Covid-19 waned through the process called herd immunity. Dr Paul said the overall picture of the current serosurvey showed that the infection could spread to more than 75% population even now and so it was crucial to follow the Covid-appropriate behaviours. “The national mission of vaccination will help overcome the pandemic in a better way,” he said. State technical expert Dr Subhash Salunkhe stated that the herd immunity might be there in certain pockets, but it was still not at large. He said the cautious approach should be followed as the vaccination picked pace. Salunkhe said, “The only thing the country can do now is aim to vaccinate 30-40 crore of the population in the coming two to three months to ensure that the pandemic becomes endemic,” he said. ICMR’s chief epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda said there was still a lot more time to achieve the herd immunity in India. “While states may have independent surveys, the country survey shows only 21% people had antibodies. So, it is obvious that one needs to be cautious and the Covid-appropriate behaviour needs to continue,” he said. Another public health expert, Dr Giridhara Babu, said it was implausible to infer that the entire country had reached the herd immunity because of the diverse nature of regions and population within India. “At the most, we can infer that dense pockets of urban areas have reached the threshold for population immunity. A corollary in support of this hypothesis is the absence of widespread outbreaks of the newer variants in metros given the unrestricted travel since September until recently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/herd-immunity-cant-be-taken-for-granted-as-yet-say-experts/articleshow/80696425.cms||Nisha Nambiar
February 5, 2021||Goa||Goa: Speaker to begin disqualification hearings||PANAJI: Speaker of Goa legislative assembly Rajesh Patnekar will begin hearings in the two disqualification petitions filed by Congress and MGP against their MLAs who joined BJP in mid-2019. The speaker has scheduled the hearing for February Speaking to TOI, Patnekar said that he has issued notices to the parties. Congress has been demanding early hearings saying there are strong grounds for the disqualification of their former members In May 2019, senior MGP functionary and former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar filed a petition before the speaker seeking disqualification of deputy CM Manohar Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar, who quit MGP to join BJP in March 2019. The MGP challenged their claim that two-thirds of MGP legislature party has merged with BJP. MGP had three MLAs in the 40-member House, and it has now been reduced to one. Dhavalikar had said that the 10th schedule of the Constitution does not postulate such a merger, by which the members of the legislature party would meet at midnight and claim that a merger has taken place. In August 2019, Congress filed a disqualification petition against their 10 rebel MLAs who joined BJP in July 2019. State Congress president Girish Chodankar had sought that the 10 MLAs be restrained from attending assembly proceedings and holding constitutional posts till the case is decided by the speaker. On July 10, rebel Congress MLAs led by then opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar joined BJP claiming that the Congress Legislature Party had split. The remaining nine MLAs were WRD minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate, Isidore Fernandes, Nilkanth Halarnkar, Antonio Fernandes, Francisco Silveira, Wilfred Dsa, Clafasio Dias, and Atanasio Monserrate. Kavalekar is the deputy chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/speaker-to-begin-disqualification-hearings/articleshow/80697209.cms||---

Moreover, a number of investors sold off gold in the past few days for profit-booking and therefore, price of the yellow metal drastically fell settling below the Rs 50k mark,” said a city-based analyst. Industry players said that low price of gold will help revive demand in the gems and jewellery sector provide great benefit at a time of need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-price-plunges-below-rs-50k-mark-after-65-days/articleshow/80694469.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Ahmedabad||190 pigeons dead in Ahmedabad, bird flu suspected||AHMEDABAD: The fear of bird flu took flight in Narol gam after the number of dead pigeons in the area doubled to 190 in just two days. This is the highest number of bird deaths that have taken place in one area following an outbreak of bird flu in the state, said officials. Dead pigeons began raining down near Akruti Township in Narol early on Wednesday. By afternoon, the number of dead birds touched 95 and rose to 190 on Thursday. Dr Rajendra Patel, assistant director of animal husbandry department handling Ahmedabad district, said, “Around 190 pigeons were found dead in Narol in a suspected case of bird flu. We have discarded the carcasses as per protocols and sanitized the area. We have sent samples from two carcasses to Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory to ascertain the cause of death.” The officials said that avian flu is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused in birds by the influenza virus. “We have not conducted a post-mortem examination yet. We will do so only if the samples sent to Bhopal test negative for bird flu,” he said. Gujarat first reported a bird flu outbreak in January after samples taken from dead birds in Batva in Junagadh tested positive.

The helpline officials said that the woman was threatened by her boyfriend of dire consequences once she gets down from the hospital.“The woman was in relationship with an Ahmedabad-based man who had promised her marriage. They had developed physical relationship through which the woman had got pregnant. The man had stopped taking her calls afterwards,” said a helpline official.As the woman’s parents did not know about her pregnancy, the woman reached Ahmedabad in desperation. She contacted the man who asked her to meet. But before that, the woman decided to conduct tests on her pregnancy.“When the man got to know about it, he reached the spot and slapped her. As she went to the clinic for sonography, the man threatened to stab her once she gets down. The woman then called the helpline and sought protection,” said the counsellor.A team reached the spot along with police and took the woman to the bus depot from where she returned to Surat.In another incident on Wednesday, the Abhayam team united a woman with her child in Changodar area. “The woman’s estranged husband had allegedly took the three-month-old kid with him when the couple had a tiff. The woman attempted several times to get the child back, but every time her in-laws claimed that they did not have the child and did not allow her to meet her husband. A team reached the spot and told the family that it was a case of kidnapping, and the child should stay with mother,” said a counsellor, adding that they asked both the families to take legal recourse for long-term solution of the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pregnant-before-wedding-woman-from-surat-rescued-in-city/articleshow/80694450.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Thiruvananthapuram||It is prudent to repay infra cost over its lifetime: KIIFB CEO||Thiruvananthapuram: Annuity financing of infrastructure is based on the ‘pay-as-you-enjoy principle’, ie, citizens in the future years repay the cost of creating an infrastructure asset as they are the ones who reap the benefits of the asset, said KIIFB CEO K M Abraham. Defending the long-tenure repayment of borrowings taken from various sources, including masala bonds, Abraham said it is prudent to defray the cost of borrowing and repay for the assets over its life rather than over a short, truncated period as infrastructure assets typically have a long life. In a detailed response to the article on the spending of fund sourced through masala bonds by KIIFB in these columns on Wednesday, Abraham said the higher interest rate – 9.723% – of masala bonds is justifiable as at the time of borrowing, the rate obtained was the best that a state government entity like KIIFB could hope to obtain in the international market. He said Andhra Pradesh Finance Corporation issued domestic bonds in April 2019 with a coupon of up to 10.32%. KIIFB raised Rs 2,150 crore from masala bonds in May 2019. “The reason why KIIFB holds funds in the bank is that it has to avoid the cost of shortage of funds. KIIFB’s policy is to hold funds to the tune of six-12 months on hand. This is necessary because if contractors and suppliers are not paid in time, then they would charge this risk to their quoted amounts, thus significantly raising project costs. Negotiations and discussions with a financial institution takes six to 18 months. It is keeping this in mind as well as the need to make timely and uninterrupted payments to suppliers and contractors that KIIFB retains a sufficient level of funds in the banks,” Abraham said in response to queries on why the fund sourced at a higher interest rate is parked at a lower interest rate in local banks. “KIIFB’s financing model is far more robust than a regular annuity model because while allocations for annuity projects, in general, depend on the promise (or contractual obligation) to allocate the required amounts to pay the annuity in each budget, the allocations to KIIFB are specifically defined and assured in terms of its source, quantum and timing through the statute of the state legislature – viz the KIIF (Amendment) Act, 2016. Specifically, for KIIFB, a share of motor vehicle tax and cess on petroleum products is set aside each year by the government in the budget for making payments to it,” said Abraham.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/it-is-prudent-to-repay-infra-cost-over-its-lifetime-kiifb-ceo/articleshow/80694668.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Kochi||Kerala: Row over appointment of MB Rajesh’s wife at SSUS||KOCHI: After CPM leader MB Rajesh’s wife Ninitha Kanichery was appointed as assistant professor at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit (SSUS) in Kalady, a Facebook post by Calicut University professor Umer Tharamel led to a controversy. Tharamel – who was a subject expert in the selection committee that conducted the recruitment at SSUS – without mentioning the name of the university or person alleged the rank list was ‘turned upside down’. Kanichery, a government school teacher, was appointed as an assistant professor in Malayalam department at SSUS. There was an allegation that the appointment was made ignoring others who had higher qualifications and his post supported the allegation. In his post on Thursday morning, he said "I have visited several colleges as a subject expert for teacher appointment and conducted several protest. But, for the first time I had an experience in one of the universities in Kerala where the rank list turned upside down to my surprise. I had expressed my disagreements and criticisms to my colleagues and varsity authorities. In the wake of the incident, I want to inform Kerala’s academic community that I will not continue (as subject expert) in this job." Though no names were mentioned, discussions and allegations began in the social media referring to the appointment of Kanichery. Following this, university issued a statement denying the allegation. "The allegation on teacher appointments at SSUS are baseless. All appointments were made with strict adherence to UGC norms and only one of the 17 appointments created a controversy following the Facebook post by a language expert, who was a member of the selection committee. This act by an interview board member is unjustified and suspicious," said a statement by SSUS vice-chancellor, Dharmaraj Adat. He said that the selection committee consisted of seven members including three language experts and an education expert, who is the chancellor’s nominee. The rank list was prepared based on the average marks given by all members after the interview, he said. Later at night, the controversial post disappeared from Tharamel’s Facebook page.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/row-over-appointment-of-mb-rajeshs-wife-at-ssus/articleshow/80694730.cms||---

Inspector Sunil Mane of the crime branch had received information about the Aadhaar card fraud following which police cracked down on the centre. “A Borivli bank had outsourced the work of preparing Aadhaar cards for those who came to open bank accounts to one of the accused.

February 5, 2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Ram temple fund raising a low-key affair||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The fund collection drive of Sangh Parivar organizations for the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya is underway in Kerala as a low-key affair. The fund collection drive that started on Jan 31 will conclude on Feb 21. The instructions for the pan-India drive come directly from the trust set up for temple construction in Ayodhya. A delegation led by Vishwa Hindu Parishad international secretary general Milind S Parande called on governor Arif Mohammed Khan at his official residence on Wednesday. Mataji Jananabhinishta received Khan’s contribution to the temple trust. Other members in the delegation included Isro’s former chairman G Madhavan Nair who is the president of the fund collection campaign committee in Kerala and former DGP TP Senkumar, the vice-president of the committee. Sangh Parivar sources said there was strict instruction from the top that the collection drive should not turn into a show of strength. Rather, it should be a silent campaign in which Parivar representatives would visit all Hindu households and seek contributions. A four-fold leaflet, with the drawing of Rama on the facing sheet, is also distributed in households. Those who conduct this campaign are not expected to speak about anything else, even in the poll-bound states. They aren’t supposed to make forceful demand for donation. The coupons, in the denominations of Rs 10, Rs 100 and Rs 1,000, are distributed by Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Theerth Kshetra and those who are in charge of the collection drive at ward-level are supposed to remit the daily collection in one of the three accounts opened for the purpose in nationalized banks. “The campaign is an attempt to ensure participation. Contributions can be namesake only. The campaign in Kerala is along the lines of the campaign Parivar organizations had carried out for setting up the memorial for Swami Vivekananda in the sea in Kanyakumari,” said a VHP leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ram-temple-fund-raising-a-low-key-affair/articleshow/80694741.cms||B S Anilkumar

February 5, 2021||Nagpur||Another Fadnavis govt decision nixed, NIT to continue as city planning authority||NAGPUR: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Thursday reversed yet another decision of the previous BJP-led government. Instead of abolishing Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), the state cabinet has made it the planning authority for Gunthewari layouts. Confirming this, district guardian minister and Maharashtra energy ministry Nitin Raut told TOI that the previous government’s cabinet had taken the decision to dissolve NIT in 2016 and 2019. But on both occasions, the past government had failed to table it before the legislative assembly. On August 13, 2019, Fadnavis cabinet had okayed the dissolution of NIT and its merger with NMC. But it did not issue any gazette notification to implement the cabinet decision. BJP and even Congress corporators backed the decision, with BJP-ruled NMC passing a resolution for this in the general body. Past mayor Sandip Joshi demanded NMC’s reply should be discussed by the house, but this did not happen. In January 2020, Raut made it clear that he wanted NIT to stay and become the planning authority for Gunthewari layouts. “When the decision has not got a nod from the legislative assembly, it automatically remains in abeyance,” he said. Raut said the cabinet also took the decision to reinstate the powers of NIT as a planning authority. “The cabinet has also sought opinion of the law and judiciary department to restore the powers of NIT,” said Raut. NIT will be planning authority for seven schemes and unauthorized layouts in the city, the guardian minister said. “NMRDA’s jurisdiction will be only out of city limits, whereas NIT will work within the city,” clarified Raut. Since becoming guardian minister, Raut wanted to make NIT a development authority for Gunthewari layouts. His proposal was opposed by BJP leaders from the city, who wanted NMC to be the sole planning authority of the city. MLA and City Congress president Vikas Thakre and assembly speaker MLA Nana Patole too backed Raut’s decision. The Fadnavis government had five years to dissolve NIT but it failed to do so. NIT has transferred maximum Gunthewari layouts to NMC. Now there will be a problem of parallel jurisdiction in these areas, said sources. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari said the decision will hurt the city’s development, as he blamed NIT for some underdeveloped areas in the city. He said the MVA cabinet decision was beyond understanding. “Congress corporators had in the past supported BJP move to abolish NIT, as they too were facing people’s wrath over lack of civic amenities in areas under NIT,” he said. City BJP president and MLC Pravin Datke said the party will oppose the cabinet decision tooth and nail. City Congress president and MLA Vikas Thakre welcomed the decision and said since NIT’s power as planning authority was handed over to NMC, nothing has happened for the last two years. “Now, I will ensure development in Gunthewari layouts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/another-fadnavis-govt-decision-nixed-nit-to-continue-as-city-planning-authority/articleshow/80694743.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Former Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni too had appreciated Raja’s work at VCA, Jamtha. According to the handlers, Raja is very obedient and was always ready for action. Now, the BDDS is left with three sniffer dogs, all of them male labradors. The seniormost among them is King whose handlers are Ravindra Patil and Gajanan Chandurkar. Rana and Shiv, both two years old, are handled by Sachin Gedam and Dinesh Hode, and Shashi Nirgodkat and Rajesh Meshram. Another separate dog squad of city police has five dogs. The farewell ceremony for Raja was held at BDDS office and presided over by Pradip Pullarwar, police inspector in-charge of BDDS Nagpur. A cake was cut to celebrate Raja’s 10th birthday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-illustrious-service-pensionless-bdds-sniffer-dog-is-handlers-family/articleshow/80694779.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamna’ stated every section of society, whether Hindu or non-Hindu, was safe under the Thackeray government, however, BJP should support Hindu farmers at the Delhi border. “Sharjeel has absconded to UP so it is also the responsibility of the UP government to hand him over. Devendra Fadnavis should not doubt the capability of Maharashtra police as he was also in power,” the editorial stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sharjeel-will-be-held-bjp-should-back-farmers/articleshow/80696689.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

UP’s additional chief secretary of sugarcane and sugar industry, Sanjay R Bhoosreddy, said the decision was aimed at promoting high-value job opportunities for qualified youths, while improving the efficiency of the management and functioning of the sugar mills. “In addition, the state administration has also decided to contractually employ up to 51 technical officers in the three sugar mills of UP State Sugar Mill Corporation — Munderwa mill at Basti, Pipraich mill at Gorakhpur and Mohiuddinpur mill at Meerut — with the same aim,” he said. These positions have been proposed for top managerial personnel, engineers, chemists, accounts officers, quality control managers, cane managers and administrative officers. Initially, 21 management trainees would be positions in the sugar mills, Bhoosreddy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-to-hire-management-trainees-in-sugar-mills/articleshow/80693329.cms||Keshav Agarwal

There were no inflammatory messages or name-calling this time around but an overflowing of apologies, incensed by a post made by Sachin Tendulkar who shared a pro-establishment message on Wednesday. Messages similar to it and with minor variations, that exhorted Indians to stay united and reject international interference in internal matters, were shared by a large number of sports and film celebrities in India. They were considered to be an organized response to tweets by pop icon Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg which offered solidarity to farmer protests. The comments, numbering more than 4,000 were mocking in tone, apologized to her failing to understand what type of a person she was. “Dear sister, I am taking back whatever I said. That person who was considered God turned out to be an useless. It’s only when incidents happen that we realise their character. The ‘God’ has a rubber stump in the place of a spine,” wrote a user identified as Noufal, who also invited Maria to attend Thrissur pooram after the pandemic ends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/malayalis-ditch-tendulkar-say-sorry-to-sharapova/articleshow/80694805.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Bareilly||5000 turn up at prayer meet for UP farmer who died in R-day tractor rally||RAMPUR: The 5-acre grounds of the Gurdwara Kalgighar Khalsa Darbar at Dibdiba was packed on Thursday morning. The standing wheat crops had been uprooted the previous day to make space. And by noon, some 5,000 people had gathered for the final funerary ritual of Navreet Singh, a 24-year-old farmer who had died in Delhi during the Republic Day farmers’ tractor rally. His grandfather, Punjabi author Hardeep Singh Dibdiba, kept a close eye on the stage, where political representatives and farm leaders spoke in turns about the protest, Navreet and farmers’ problems. When someone dropped a 1984 reference, Hardeep was quick to intervene: “This is not the place.” The ‘antim ardas’ (final prayers) ritual marks the conclusion of a three-day reading of the Guru Granth Sahib and praying for the deceased. Days before the ceremony, posters had gone up in villages nearby, inviting everyone to turn up for the “martyr”. Thousands did. This included supporters across communities, religious leaders like Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa and politicians, including Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, RLD’s Jayant Chaudhry, former Union minister Jitin Prasada, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait’s son Gaurav, and several others from opposition parties in UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab. On her way to the gathering, four vehicles in Priyanka's convoy had met with an accident in Moradabad but no one was injured. “Navreet was 25. My son is 20. You have young sons … Why did he go there? There was no political conspiracy. He went there because he was in pain. He understood the farmers’ suffering. He knew injustice was being meted out,” Priyanka said. “The biggest cruelty of the government is calling martyrs (like him) terrorists.” The ceremony overshot its scheduled three-hour itinerary by over two hours. His aunt sat by his portrait the entire time. His wife is still in Melbourne, unable to get out of the country because of pandemic restrictions. His parents kept a low profile while his uncle, Inderjeet, kept busy with the arrangements. Four parking spots had to be created for the 500-odd cars that came to the small village. Sikh leaders from Dibdiba and surrounding villages had pooled money to make sure there was food for everyone. After addressing the gathering, Priyanka went to Navreet’s house to meet his family. “His family wants a judicial inquiry. We are with farmers and their families. Our government is yet to identify this movement as a real struggle. There is no politics here. It is the pain farmers are in,” she told TOI. By Thursday night, “Priyanka Gandhi” was trending on Twitter in India. More than 250km away in Delhi, farmers protesting at the Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri borders organised candlelight vigils. In Amritsar, the Khalra Mission Organisation held a bhog (last prayers) meet for Navreet. And BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, whose tears turned the tide for the protest at Ghazipur, said his "sacrifice" would not go in vain: “Bill wapasi hi ghar wapasi hai (only the law’s withdrawal will make us go home).” (With inputs from Aakash Ahuja in Rudrapur)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/5000-turn-up-at-prayer-meet-for-up-farmer-who-died-in-r-day-tractor-rally/articleshow/80693355.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: 360 of 576 buses on special hire to cops brought back||NEW DELHI: A day after Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) ordered the withdrawal of 576 of its buses provided as ‘Special Hire’, 360 of these buses were withdrawn till 3pm on Thursday. Out of the 576 buses provided to Delhi Police and other central police forces, maximum 218 buses are deployed in North zone where both Singhu and Tikri border points are located. Total 106 of these buses have now been withdrawn, followed by 98 of the 137 buses provided in the East zone where farmers are protesting near the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border in Ghazipur. In the South zone, DTC had provided 113 buses on special hire, out of which 96 have been withdrawn and 60 out of 108 deployed in the West zone have been withdrawn. Sources in DTC said that 216 buses were yet to be withdrawn in view of the law and order situation. With nearly 45 public transport buses getting damaged on January 26, Delhi’s transport minister Gahlot had directed that from now on, DTC’s buses could only be provided on ‘Special Hire’ after approval from the Delhi government. The withdrawal orders were issued on Wednesday. “Many of these buses were hired by Delhi Police for transportation of its personnel but were also used as barricades to stop protesters. As a result, the buses sustained damages,” a source said. “DTC has sent a bill amounting to a few crores of rupees as rent and repair cost to Delhi Police,” he added. “For the maintenance of public order, police personnel need to be moved and transported to their designated locations of deployment. For which, DTC has been providing buses to Delhi Police for decades. We have requested DTC to continue the cooperation,” said Chinmoy Biswal, DCP, PRO, Delhi Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/360-of-576-buses-on-special-hire-to-cops-brought-back/articleshow/80696659.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Salem||Gang robs two families of 40 sovereigns gold, Rs 2 lakh||Salem: A 10-member gang barged into two houses in Rayarpalayam village near Veeraganur in the district in the early hours of Thursday and decamped with gold ornaments weighing 40 sovereigns and Rs 2.25 lakh in cash after attacking the occupants there. District superintendent of police Deepa Ganigar have formed four special teams to nab the gang members. According to Attur deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Immanuel Gnanasekaran, the gang first entered the house of a 30-year-old farmer, R Deeban. “They knocked on the main door and Deeban’s mother Kalaiselvi, 58, responded by opening it. The gang barged into the house and attacked Deeban, his mother, wife Divya, 26, two daughters aged 6 and 4 and tied them up in a room and made away with gold ornaments weighing 25 sovereigns and Rs 1.25 lakh.” The gang then entered the next house, which belonged to AIADMK functionary Kumar alias Kumarasamy, 72. “This time too, they knocked on the main door, which when opened they attacked Kumarasamy, his wife Amirtham, 63, son Vasudevan, 38, and decamped with gold ornaments weighing 15 sovereigns and Rs 1 lakh,” the officer said. Kumarasamy managed to come out of the house and lodged a complaint with the Veeraganur police. The SP, DSP and Veeraganur police inspector Murugan, along with other officials, visited the crime scene and initiated an inquiry. Sniffer dog was also pressed into service. While it ran for nearly 1km from the two houses, police couldn’t gather any clue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/gang-robs-two-families-of-40-sovereigns-gold-rs-2-lakh/articleshow/80696635.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Interacting with mediapersons on the sidelines of his visit to Mathura and Aligarh on Thursday, Shivpal said: “We are also in touch with other small parties in the state to forge an alliance.” He said his party had established its base in all districts of the state, and alliances would help opposition parties remove the BJP from power. “Those who made these black farm laws against the farmers’ interest should not be given any chance to win the elections,” said Shivpal. “We are with the farmers and if required, we will start a ‘Jail Bharo’ andolan,” said Shivpal, adding that “these laws have been made only to help corporate houses”. “In fact, all decisions taken by the central government, including demonetisation, GST, labour migration during the Covid-19 lockdown, among others, were not in favour of the nation or the public,” he said. Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “not fulfilling the promises he had made”, Yadav said that “his ministers and bureaucrats follow him and lie openly”. “It was promised to double the income of farmers, but the income has come down. If farmers don’t want these new laws, then why the government is adamant to go ahead with the laws,” asked Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ready-for-alliance-with-sp-to-defeat-bjp-in-assembly-polls-says-shivpal-yadav/articleshow/80693378.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Herd immunity can’t be taken for granted yet, caution experts||PUNE: Covid task force experts have cautioned against taking herd immunity for granted despite some sero-surveillance reports showing 50-60% of the people tested had antibodies.  “A cautious approach should be maintained despite these reports,” Niti Aayog member Dr Vinod Paul, also a member of the national task force, told TOI. The national sero-survey report released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Thursday stated that only 21% of the population showed evidence of past exposure to Covid-19. Paul said it meant a large proportion of the population was still vulnerable. Scientists estimate 70-85% of people need to develop antibodies before Covid-19 wanes through herd immunity. Both natural immunity and vaccines can play a role in achieving it. Dr Paul said the current sero-survey indicates the infection could spread to more than 75% population even now hence it is crucial to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. “A big proportion of our population is still vulnerable, and the national mission of vaccination will help overcome the pandemic in a better way,” he said. State technical expert Dr Subhash Salunkhe stated there might be herd immunity, but only in certain pockets. He said the sero-surveys conducted in Delhi, Pune and Mumbai did show that 50% of those tested had developed antibodies, but the exact number of infections or even the antibodies created was still a grey area. “The only thing the country can do now is aim to vaccinate 30-40 crore of the population in the coming two to three months to ensure the pandemic becomes endemic,” he said. ICMR’s chief epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda said India is still a long way from achieving herd immunity. Another public health expert, Dr Giridhara Babu, said it was implausible to infer the entire country had achieved herd immunity because of the diverse nature of the regions and populations within India. “At the most, we can infer dense pockets of urban areas have reached the threshold for population immunity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/herd-immunity-cant-be-taken-for-granted-yet-caution-experts/articleshow/80694839.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Chaudhary is scheduled to address a 'mahapanchayat' in Shamli on Friday and then visit Amroha on February 7 and Aligarh on February 9. The RLD leader said, “A campaign to unite and further strengthen the farmers' movement will be launched in Mathura on Chaudhary Ajit Singh’s birthday on February 12, as a tribute to his sacrifices to the farming community.” He will stay in Mathura for four days — February 12, 16, 17 and 18. Besides, his visit to Bulandshahr is scheduled on February 10 and Hathras on February 15. Chaudhary said the government should understand that if these laws are unacceptable to the farmers for whom they have been enacted, then they should be repealed. “We will move village to village to continue mustering support for the farmers and keep this movement alive,” he said, adding that it is a "battle of ideology". Party’s state spokesperson Sunil Rohta told TOI that the 'Chalo Gaon Ki Ore' [move towards village] programme was announced by Chaudhary at Mathura’s 'mahapanchayat'. It will cover the maximum number of villages across western UP in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rld-leader-to-visit-villages-across-west-up-from-feb-5-to-motivate-farmers-to-join-stir/articleshow/80693370.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Dehradun||Govt releases SOPs for reopening schools for classes 6 to 12||Dehradun: Chief secretary Om Prakash issued orders on Thursday for the reopening of government and private schools for classes 6 to 12 from February 8. The schools were earlier allowed to reopen only for classes 10 and 12 students in November last year which saw quite a few students and teachers catching the Covid-19 infection in the initial days, and ultimately, led to low attendance. The order mainly asks the schools to implement the updated SOP, which is largely similar to the previous one issued by the government in October 2020 when it had given its nod for the reopening of schools for classes 10 and 12. The order states that the schools that give mid-day meals should do so by ensuring social distancing and sanitisation of the dining place. In the new SOP, schools will have to appoint a nodal officer among their staff members who will ensure social distancing and sanitisation taking place in the school premises from time to time. The nodal officer will also be responsible for informing the respective district administration for any suspicious Covid-19 cases. The district magistrate has been given the responsibility to take a call for the opening or closing of the schools if the staff or students of a particular school are found to be infected. The DM has the authority to close the school for a few days after examining the seriousness of the situation. The chief education officer (CEO) has been given the responsibility to keep a daily record of the number of students/staff being infected with the virus and others. The school buses have to be sanitised daily and masks are mandatory all the time for everybody. Online classes will also continue by the schools and if a student doesn’t have access to an online class facility then the school must call such students primarily to the school. If a student is not willing to come to school and doesn’t have access to online classes then it is the school’s responsibility to ensure that he/she gets access to it. Parents’ written approval is mandatory before permitting any student inside the school campus. If a school struggles to ensure proper social distancing norms then it is advised to operate the classes in two shifts. The SOPs for the private residential schools have also been released and they are also allowed to reopen their campuses for students of classes 6 to 12 from February 8. The private residential schools have been directed to implement the earlier SOPs issued in October 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-releases-sops-for-reopening-schools-for-classes-6-to-12/articleshow/80693372.cms||Mohammad Anab

February 5, 2021||Patna||Patna: Woman BDO attacked for rejecting poll papers||PATNA: The block development officer of Ghoswari in rural Patna, Kamini Devi, was attacked after the nomination paper of a candidate for the primary agricultural credit society (PACS)  was rejected after the scrutiny ended on Thursday. The BDO is the returning officer for the poll. The 42-year-old BDO was seriously injured after being thrashed by the candidate Bambam Yadav, Kurmichak panchayat sarpanch Manoj Kumar and his associates at Ghoswari on Thursday evening soon after the scrutiny for the PACS election ended. A home guard jawan, who was with the BDO, was also injured in the attack, police said, adding the incident took place in front of the Ghoswari block office at 5.45 pm. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh told TOI over the phone that Yadav had filed his nomination for the post of Prahladpur PACS president. “However, Yadav’s nomination paper got rejected in the scrutiny by the BDO-cum-returning officer which enraged him leading to the attack on her,” he said. Singh said the woman officer was about to board her official vehicle when Yadav along with the sarpanch and some other associates attacked her resulting in injury to her head and other parts of her body. He said that the administration would take strict action against the culprits. “Such an incident with a female government officer is completely unacceptable. One should approach higher authorities in the case of any grievance,” the DM said, adding the sarpanch has been arrested. Ghoswari SHO Sanjeev Mauaar said the BDO was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment while her head was bleeding profusely. Mauaar said though the sarpanch was arrested from the spot, Yadav and three others managed to flee. The SHO said scrutiny for the PACS election ended at Ghoswari block office around 5 pm and everything was normal till then. “A police patrolling team and home guard jawans were also there with the BDO. However, she instructed them to go as everything had ended,” Mauaar said. He said when Kamini Devi was finally leaving the office, Yadav along with his associates suddenly reached the spot and started thrashing her. The SHO said raids were on to nab Bambam Yadav and at least two more of his associates who were evading arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-bdo-attacked-for-rejecting-poll-papers/articleshow/80693947.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The Congress leader defended himself by saying that he was only referring to the working-class background of Pinarayi Vijayan and not his caste. His remarks at the Aishwarya Kerala Yathra at Thalassery on Tuesday that Pinarayi comes from a ‘toddy-tapper family’ had evoked sharp responses. Sudhakaran told reporters in Delhi that his intention was to remind the chief minister of his humble past. “What is wrong in mentioning the job of the toddy-tappers or beedi workers? Isn’t it true that Pinarayi’s father was a toddy-tapper? Every job has its own dignity,” he said. Asked to explain the connection between toddy-tapping and using the helicopter, Sudhakaran said he was referring to a mismatch between a working-class leader splurging money after he became a chief minister. “He has spent Rs 18 crore for helicopter journeys in one year. People should assess whether it is the quality of communist leader,” Sudhakaran said. The KPCC working president said the outlook of a political worker who is from a poor background will be different from that of a person who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. “I was referring to the luxurious life, spending crores from public exchequer,” he added. Asked about opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala’s reaction that such statements should have been avoided, Sudhakaran said he is not aware of it. Sudhakaran also blasted Congress leader and MLA Shanimol Usman, for asking him to tender an apology. “No CPM leader has raised any problem in this issue because they knew that it doesn’t merit any response. So, why Shanimol is agitated over the remarks? He reminded that many Congress leaders, including Ommen Chandy, were insulted with cultureless words in the past. Why Shanimol didn’t feel upset at that time?” Sudhakaran asked. Meanwhile, DYFI said Sudhakaran’s remarks are not to be limited as his personal one but the reflection of the degenerated mindset of the Congress. In a statement issued on Thursday, DYFI state secretariat said Congress is being led by the ideology of Sangh Parivar, which venerates the Manu Smruthi. Asking the Congress leadership to tender an apology, DYFI said the people will reject the party which carries the casteist mindset of the Sangh Parivar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/i-was-recalling-cms-humble-past-not-caste-sudhakaran/articleshow/80693507.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Coimbatore||Rogue tusker Shankar ‘re-enters’ TN forest||Udhagamandalam: An elephant resembling the rogue tusker, Shankar, which killed three people in Gudalur division in the Nilgiris in December last and subsequently moved to Kerala forest was found near Cheramabadi forest area on Wednesday night. Shankar evaded the forest department’s attempt of capturing it even after tranquilizing it with a dart on December 17, 2020. “On Thursday, we found the elephant and a calf in a herd in the Cheramabadi forest area. However, we are not sure if it is the same rogue elephant which killed three people in December last,” district forest officer of Gudalur division Sumesh Soman said. He said only when the elephant moves little away from the herd and the thick forest, it could be identified by its ears and tusks. Shankar has small tusks; one of which is broken. Meanwhile, the forest department is in the exercise of mobilizing teams and kumkis to capture the jumbo. “Our priority now is sensitizing the public in that area. Shankar seems to be calmed down. Since it is with a herd that too with a calf, it would be a threat to the forest staff if they approach it,” Soman said. He added, “We need at least four to five kumkis to handle the elephant to tranquilize it. We have alerted the forest and the local veterinarians. Teams have been formed for the operation of capturing it.” One kumki has already reached the Cherambadi area. The DFO said, “Once located, the jumbo will be tranquilized and with the help of kumkis it will be taken to the Theppakadu elephant camp in MTR.” The rogue elephant had killed the trio, including a father and son on December 11 and 13 in Gudalur division, creating panic among the public. The rogue elephant unleashed a rampage in 2016 in Pandalur taluk in the division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rogue-tusker-shankar-re-enters-tn-forest/articleshow/80696671.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It took more than six fire tenders to douse the fire that started around 4am and raged on for over five hours. No one was injured in the accident. The reason for the accident is yet to be ascertained by police and fire service personnel. Primary investigation has pegged the damage around Rs 8 crore. “The fire started spreading to one bag to another within seconds,” an official from the Rasipuram fire service station said. “The exact loss will be estimated only after a couple of days. But we have stored nearly Rs 8 crore worth of turmeric in the warehouse,” PR Sundaram, former AIADMK MP and owner of the godown, said. Farmers from Rasipuram and surrounding villages including Namagiripettai, Mullukurichi, Mettala and Pudhupatty had stocked their produce in the warehouse, he added. Meanwhile, the Rasipuram police registered a case and initiated investigation into the fire accident. “We suspect electrical short circuits to be the reason for the accident,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/fire-destroys-turmeric-worth-rs-8cr-in-godown/articleshow/80696700.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Dehradun||‘Rs 50 too low a penalty for crime against animals’: Over 7.5L sign petition to PM, urging changes in Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act which hasn’t been amended in 60 years||Dehradun: Over 7.5 lakh people have signed a petition addressed to PM Modi urging him to intervene and amend provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, 1960, which provides for a penalty of only Rs 50 in cases of cruelty to animals. The petition has been initiated by the NGOs, People For Animals (PFA) and Humane Society International/India (HSI).Pointing out that the animal cruelty cases that get reported in the country are “just a blip on the radar and most cases are never reported”, Gauri Maulekhi, trustee of PFA, said that “despite being a punishable criminal offence, cruelty against animals continues unabated in the country given the absence of a deterrent penalty in law.”Alokparna Sengupta, managing director, HIS India, added that “it is high time the PCA Act was amended to create an effective deterrent.” “The Act was enacted to replace a colonial legislation and sought to prevent infliction of unnecessary pain and suffering on animals. However, quantum of punishment, that is, the penalties has not been reviewed even once in the six decades of the Act’s existence. The past year has seen some of the most heinous acts of animal cruelty in India – each horrific case highlighted the inability of the current law to protect animals,” she said.Animal lovers say that it is ironic that even as India has one of the most stringent Acts in the world to protect its wild animals — Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 — the non-wild animals like dogs, cats, poultry etc are not effectively protected as any torture to them is covered under the PCA Act whose penalty amount is hardly a deterrent.With lakhs of people signing the petition in just around a fortnight — the campaign began on January 19 — Maulekhi says that the response has been overwhelming. “It is heartening to see that among the signatories are Bollywood actors like Tiger Shroff, Shraddha Kapoor and Pooja Bhatt to name a few. That so many people relate to the need to give more teeth to laws to prevent cruelty to animals speaks about the urgent need for the PCA Act to be amended,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rs-50-too-low-a-penalty-for-crime-against-animals-over-7-5l-sign-petition-to-pm-urging-changes-in-prevention-of-cruelty-to-animals-act-which-hasnt-been-amended-in-60-years/articleshow/80693384.cms||Shivani Azad

February 5, 2021||Delhi||Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg reasserts her support to farmers||NEW DELHI: Climate justice activist Greta Thunberg reasserted her support for farmers on Thursday, amid rising hostility directed at her for allegedly being a part of an "international conspiracy to defame India" "I still #StandWithFarmers and support their peaceful protest. No amount of hate, threats or violations of human rights will ever change that. #FarmersProtest," Thunberg tweeted around 4.30pm, which was liked over 120k times and shared by over 43k users. Thunberg posted her tweet hours after news surfaced that Delhi police had filed an FIR against unidentified people for making a digital toolkit she had shared on Twitter on Wednesday. Thunberg had raised an online storm after she tweeted a "toolkit" to help amplify the protests on social media. The tweet, which was later deleted, consisted of details of strategies that can be used to help farmers. Greta Thunberg and Greta Thunberg Exposed hashtags were top trends in India on Thursday, drawing over 199k and 350k tweets respectively. The activist was targeted on social media by several people who accused her of furthering propaganda against India. "Meanwhile Greta Thunberg just put her foot in her mouth... Publicly shared the tweet bank that was secretly given to her to cut, copy, paste. Deleted it as soon as she realised her mistake!!" BJP's Priti Gandhi wrote. Many, however, also came out in her support, including UK Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi. Former finance minister P Chidambaram wrote, “There are many Gretas among Indian women and girls, but they are shackled by poverty, social constraints and fear. Sooner than later, India’s Gretas will find their voices and speak in favour of the farmers... The issue is not Rihanna or Greta Thunberg or any individual. The issue is the manner in which the government is countering the farmers’ protests as though they were an invading army.” Meanwhile, hours after Thunberg deleted her tweet, she shared another post with a link that had a fresh “toolkit”. While the earlier version contained hyperlinks to documents used to plan earlier “tweet storms”, the new one did not have any such information. It also removed references to Ambani and Adani, the two alleged benefactors of the farm acts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teen-climate-activist-thunberg-reasserts-her-support-to-farmers/articleshow/80696712.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Dehradun||Over 7, 400-km roads constructed in U’khand under PMGSY in last 4 years: CM Rawat||Dehradun: Pointing out that the quality road connectivity leads to the overall development and the economic growth of rural areas, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Thursday said under his tenure, 7,431 kilometres road have been constructed in the last four years under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna (PMGSY). He claimed that the rate of roads constructed under his tenure was almost as equal to the construction that took place in the first 17 years of the state’s existence. “Connectivity has remained a major concern, especially in the hills. Proper roads and good connectivity will benefit the agriculture and other sectors in the hill areas. In a period of close to four years, roads of 7,431-km have been completed with an expenditure of Rs 3,209 crore. A total of 573 rural areas were identified and the state exceeded its target by connecting 645 village areas. In the ongoing financial year, a total of Rs 822 crore has been utilised to construct roads for a length of 1,800-km,” the CM said. He further said all the PMGYS projects are being carried out at a rapid pace in the Himalayan state. Under the PMGSY, a total of 10,263 kms were approved in the Himalayan state from 2000 to 2017. For which, Rs 4,001 crore had been approved. Out of the total length, approach roads were constructed for 7,529 km and the total cost incurred was Rs 2,810. While the target was to connect 1,299 locations, but the approach roads could connect only 955 rural areas. Rawat did not fail to mention that locals faced problems in the absence of bridges to connect one area from the other. “An in-principle approval has been given by the Centre to make 127 bridges at such locations with an expense of Rs 330 crore,” he added. He said Rs 530 crore have been approved for works under the PMGSY Phase 1 and for phase 2, in-principle approval has been given for 248 additional road works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-7-400-km-roads-constructed-in-ukhand-under-pmgsy-in-last-4-years-cm-rawat/articleshow/80693402.cms||Kautilya Singh

February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Covid vaccine awareness boosts polio inoculation numbers in Telangana||HYDERABAD: As compared to previous years, the pulse polio immunization this year got a boost due to increased awareness about the importance of vaccines among people -- a possible outcome of Covid vaccine awareness. This led to many difficult to penetrate areas, especially in Old City, seeing better participation. A much better response to booth activity was also witnessed this time. As a result, the very first day of the polio immunization programme in the state on Sunday, saw 90.4% immunization this year. This progressed to 102% coverage over the next two days, which means that the state overshot its target of 38.3 lakh children between 0-5 years of age. The turnout for the drive in the city was 5,15,510. "We have been hearing a lot about vaccines. It is very important for health. Last time I was not aware when it happened, but this time when there was an announcement near our house, I made it a point to get my baby (second child) vaccinated," said Nazia Begum from Achireddy Nagar, an area which has seen less response to drives previously. Speaking about the response, G Sudheera, joint director of immunisation of Telangana, said, "While the polio vaccination programme has been going on for decades, mothers are getting their children for the drive. Our coverage was very good even earlier, but a spin off from increased awareness is that we saw many more people coming to the booths by themselves this time, rather than we having to go behind them." The last mile reach was also higher this year which was an added advantage. "There is heightened awareness about vaccination on account of the pandemic and that has helped higher participation for polio vaccine drive this time," said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, founder, Helping Hand Foundation. The NGO volunteers with health authorities for the immunization programmes. Askari said, "In addition, since schools and anganwadis remained closed, Asha and anganwadi workers could carry out door-to-door surveys and identify potential polio recipients beforehand and conduct camps."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-vax-awareness-boosts-polio-drive/articleshow/80694858.cms||Amrita Didyala
February 5, 2021||Coimbatore||Flights, passengers up, but not anywhere near pre-Covid days||The aviation sector is yet to recover from the Covid-19 impact, despite more flights resuming operations and adding more destinations. While the passenger traffic is seeing month-on-month growth, it is yet to reach anywhere near the pre-Covid days. As per the data available with the Airport Authority of India, passenger traffic in the city airport was down by 77.5% in the first seven months of the current financial year, compared to the same period in the previous fiscal. During April-December, the city airport had recorded a footfall of 4.44 lakh, which is a sizeable drop from 19.75 lakh in the same period in 2019, when too the passenger traffic was down by 4.2% from 20.63 lakh in the comparable period in 2018. City airport director R Mahalingam says the passenger traffic for the first seven months of the current fiscal can’t be compared, as the airport was closed for two months. “But if you look at it month-on-month, passenger traffic in December had crossed 40% of that of the comparable month in 2019. While data for January is yet to be compiled, we are sure that the footfall has touched close to 50% of that of January 2020.” According to officials, there were only three flights when the city airport resumed operations on May 26 after a gap of 52 days. “When operations began, we had flights only to Hyderabad, New Delhi and Chennai. Gradually, flight services began to Mumbai and Bengaluru. Now, we have direct flights to Ahmedabad, Pune and Kolkata as well,” said J Sathish, industrialist and a frequent flier. Besides the low number of flights, the airport also had to contend with the fear of flying among the people during the pandemic situation. This is despite the airport authorities taking all precautions, including giving passengers face shields, masks and sanitizers, and filtering out air every few seconds. P Krishnaraj, president, Travel Agents’ Association of Coimbatore, said, “For almost the first four to five months, people chose to drive to Chennai and Bengaluru, because they were scared to fly in a closed, air-conditioned space. People were flying only when left with no other choice. While the business travel is picking up now, holiday and leisure travel is yet to gather momentum.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/flights-passengers-up-but-not-anywhere-near-pre-covid-days/articleshow/80696715.cms||---

In a complaint to environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, Mishra said massive dumping of debris at Bhatti village was on to reclaim land in violation of Environment Protection Act, 1986, and Tree Protection Act, 1975. Mishra demanded a probe into permission by civic solid waste management department for dumping six lakh brass or 1.5 lakh trucks worth of earth to reclaim the land. He demanded action against MTDC and civic officials for dereliction of duty and allowing wanton destruction of mangroves. Mishra earlier raised the issue at the District Planning Committee meeting on Monday.

As the magnitude of the issue was large, the case was entrusted to CID in 2014. Since the last seven years the case inquiry is tardy.” He added, “Submission of fake challans is a serious matter. This has caused huge loss to the exchequer. A Right to Information Act reply revealed that CID probe is still on even after seven years. This shows that government is not serious to nab the culprits.” The fake challan issue was reported in Shankarpally zone.

February 5, 2021||Chennai||AIADMK caught in a quota quagmire||CHENNAI: It’s a devil’s choice for the ruling AIADMK, which is caught in a political wedge. The PMK chose the right time to pressure the AIADMK, barely three months ahead of the assembly , to demand internal reservation for the vanniyar community within the 20% MBC quota. The release of V K Sasikala, whose clout with the backward mukkulathor (thevar) community is well-known, couldn’t have been at a worse time either for the AIADMK leadership. For the ruling party, taking the hard decision of shedding the PMK would mean pitting itself against two powerful communities in the forthcoming assembly election – vanniyars in the north and thevars in the south. If it’s a choice between fighting two powerful enemies or settling for one, then a compromise with the PMK is on the cards, say government sources. But conceding to the PMK’s demand would open a Pandora’s box and deepen the caste divide. “It is not off the table, but we will try hard not to concede to the PMK’s demand. If we have to, we will work on a formula that would not just incorporate the PMK’s demand for internal reservation in the 20% MBC quota, but also factor in a provision to appease the BCs,” said a source. The backward castes include the influential gounders, a community to which the CM belongs, besides his confidantes and senior ministers S P Velumani and P Thangamani. BCs also include kallars, a powerful thevar sub-sect prominent in the south, and naidus to which DMDK leader Vijayakant and his wife Premalatha belong. On Wednesday, discussions between a PMK delegation led by its president G K Mani and AIADMK government representatives including ministers C Ve Shanmugham and K P Anbalagan (both vanniyars) remained inconclusive. A source said the government’s idea is to prolong the discussions till February-end when the election notification is likely to be issued. Once that happens, the government cannot make any announcement. A promise can then be made to factor in the quota promise in the party manifesto. Not conceding to the PMK’s demand may antagonize the vanniyar community, members of which are in the AIADMK as well. “A promise in the manifesto may not be seen as the AIADMK buckling under PMK pressure,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-caught-in-a-quota-quagmire/articleshow/80694901.cms||Jaya Menon

However, the cheer from the public was short-lived as the snowfall remained intermittent in the afternoon and consequently failed to settle on the ground. But later in the night around 8.30 pm, heavy snowfall started again and the entire town was covered with a thick blanket of snow. “There has been no snowfall this winter. Therefore the snowfall on Thursday has brought cheer. We are hoping for a good snowfall as it boosts tourist activity and is also critical for ensuring recharge of water springs that feed the town,” said Pushpa Padiyar, a resident. Many tourists also expressed delight to witness the snowfall. “This is the first time I have seen snowflakes in my life. It is amazing,” said Ranjeet Kumar, a tourist. Meanwhile, Dhanaulti and Buranskhanda also received around one to two inches of snowfall on Thursday. Earlier, lack of snowfall had worried many since the entire water supply in the town is met with various springs that are fed by underground aquifers, and lack of snowfall might lead to water scarcity during the summers, concerned residents had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/snowflakes-in-mussoorie-bring-cheer-to-tourists-locals/articleshow/80693428.cms||Anmol Jain

There is no recycling plant for Bawana’s 20MGD water treatment plant, leading to wastage of precious water, an official said. DJB will undertake exploration of up to 3MGD fresh water in Dwarka and brackish water in entire Delhi by boring 16 tubewells at various locations. Extraction of groundwater through borewells have been recommended in a report at Pochanpur village, Ghumenhera village, Kakrola, and Bamnoli village in Dwarka. DJB approved consultancy work for rejuvenation of 100 waterbodies and drains near Badshahpur drain in Najafgarh and Timarpur for treatment of waste water from Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-okays-plans-to-develop-water-sources/articleshow/80696718.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||ISIL accused returned to blast police headquarters in Mumbai, HC told||MUMBAI: Additional solicitor general Anil Singh on Thursday told Bombay high court that Kalyan resident and ISIL accused Areeb Majeed had returned to India in 2014 with an ulterior motive and an “intention to blast police headquarters in Mumbai”. Singh said Majeed was involved in terrorist activities and had sustained a bullet injury in Iraq. HC was hearing an appeal by National Investigating Agency against a special court’s order granting him bail. Majeed had travelled to Iraq and Syria in 2014 for few months before he returned to India. He was arrested on November 28, 2014. The special NIA court granted him bail on March 17, 2020. HC had extended the stay on bail granted to Majeed. HC on Thursday reserved its verdict on the appeal but commented on “suffering” imposed by him on his parents and family Majeed argued that it has been over six years since he was in prison and even after he was granted bail. “NIA does not have proof against me,’’ he said, urging that NIA’s appeal be rejected and he should be released pending trial. The judges wondered why a 21-year-old who was studying left his family to be “with people you don’t even know and have not met in life”. “Don’t you have enough suffering around you? You may have been immature at that time, like you said. Imagine the suffering you’ve imposed on your family and parents,’’ said Justice Pitale. Majeed replied, “As soon as I realised, I came back.” The judges said Majeed has no idea what his parents must have been through. “Even I have suffered for six years after they kept me away from them (family),” said Majeed. When the judges asked what he would do if granted bail, Majeed said he will study law. Justice Pitale said, “If you had utilised your abilities and skills to the best when you were 21, it would have been a matter of joy for your family and country.” The judges will pronounce the verdict on February 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/isil-accused-returned-to-blast-police-hq-in-mumbai-hc-told/articleshow/80694726.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Pratap Chandra Shetty resigns as legislative council chief||BENGALURU: Senior Congress MLC Pratap Chandra Shetty on Thursday resigned as legislative council chairman to pre-empt the combined bid by BJP and JD(S) to vote him out through a no-confidence motion in the ongoing session. With this, the no-confidence motion moved against him by the BJP is invalid. Senior-most MLC and JD(S) member Basavaraj Horatti is expected to replace Shetty. As per the pact, JD(S) will get the chairman’s post and the BJP the deputy chairman’s post. ‘Equations between parties have changed’Shetty handed in his resignation to his newly elected deputy, KM Pranesh, in the evening. “I’ve realised that equations between the parties have changed. Technically, I have time till the next session to prove my majority. I will not do so. Moral values have always been my priority,” Shetty said. The BJP is the largest party in the council, but the combined opposition of Congress and JD(S) had the numerical advantage. But the opposition unity ruptured after JD(S) backed BJP’s call to vote out Shetty as the council chair. JD(S) submitted an official letter, stating it had no confidence in the chairman. The letter is believed to have prompted Shetty to quit. The BJP made its first bid to bring the no-confidence motion in the winter session of the legislature, but Shetty rejected the notice on technical grounds and adjourned the house indefinitely on December 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/shetty-resigns-as-legislative-council-chief/articleshow/80697899.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Woman lawyer smears paint on KS Bhagwan’s face||BENGALURU: A city-based woman advocate smeared Kannada writer and rationalist KS Bhagwan’s face with black paint inside the City Civil Court Complex near Mysore Bank Circle on Thursday. The incident took place soon after the 76-year-old writer stepped out of a court hall and walked towards the entrance when advocate Meera Raghavendra blocked his path and blackened his face. “You’ve grown so old and yet you abuse god and religion. Shame on you,” she shouted after the incident. Bhagwan immediately asked police accompanying him to arrest her. As cops walked towards Meera, she said, “Arrest me. I’m ready for everything.” As male cops announced they have to detain her for the act, Meera asked them to send women police to detain her before walking away. Cops said they will serve a notice on Meera to appear before them for questioning by Friday. Advocate threatened to get me killed: WriterWe will direct her to appear before investigation. We will then decide the future course of action,” he added. Condemning the attack, Kannada and culture minister Aravind Limbavali said, “Difference of opinion will always be there. But it is wrong to attack someone physically.” The veteran writer later went to the jurisdictional Ulsoorgate police station and filed a complaint, and said she shouted that she would “get me killed before I reached Mysuru”. “I was provided security by the government after journalist Gauri Lankesh was killed and it was found that plans were made to kill me too,” he said in the complaint, adding he appeared before II ACMM court to attend the hearing in a private complaint case. “A woman advocate, identified as Meera Raghavendra, had filed another private complaint against me in the same court hall. After completing court work, I came out of the hall around 12.30pm when Meera Raghavendra attacked me and daubed black paint on my face. She shouted that she will get me killed. She was recording her act on a mobile phone that was apparently beaming the act live on Facebook...,” his complaint read. Based on his complaint, police booked Meera under IPC sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (act with criminal intimidation).

February 5, 2021||Bengaluru||Private players get Rs 9,000-crore slice of Tejas deal, most companies from Karnataka||BENGALURU: Of the Rs 46,898-crore order for Tejas jets placed with defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, at least Rs 9,000 crore will go to private players, most of whom are from Karnataka. Confirming this, HAL chairman and managing director R Madhavan said on Thursday: “If you remove the tax part of the contract, the deal is worth only about Rs 36,000 crore, out of which close to Rs 6,000 crore will directly go to MSMEs. And, since we are supplying ground support equipment and other things, another Rs 3,000 crore is expected to go towards Indian partners.” HAL is to supply 83 Light Combat Aircraft Tejas Mark-1A in nine years, starting 36 months from Thursday. As on date, 463 vendors are partnering for the project, including about five tier-1 enterprises like L&T, Madhavan said. This number is expected to go up to 550-600 as more MSMEs will be coming in and pitching, he added. Each Tejas fighter to cost Rs 309 croreOf the current vendors, 230 are in Karnataka and 131 of them MSMEs. “In the coming years, Tejas will be the backbone of IAF and will contribute considerably to job creation in Karnataka,” he said. “The indigenous content in the aircraft is about 52% and HAL is looking at ways to increase it in the raw materials to 65%, which will also see more local partners added.” A day after the deal, described by defence minister Rajnath Singh as the largest Make-in-India procurement order so far, was inked, HAL gave a break-up of the project. The basic cost of the fighter would be Rs 309 crore, while trainers would cost Rs 280 crore each. The order is for 73 fighters and 10 trainers. “While Rs 2,200 crore is ERV (exchange rate variation), customs and taxes is around Rs 7,000 crore, so that makes it around Rs 9,000 crore. Rs 11,000 crore will be used for ground support equipment, spares and training aids and manuals... Minus these, the total order is worth only about Rs 25,000 crore,” he added. Madhavan said HAL is likely to deliver only two aircraft in the first year. “The first one should go out in March 2024. Then we will augment production capacity to 16 per year and hope to complete deliveries by eight years,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pvt-players-get-9k-cr-slice-of-tejas-deal-most-cos-from-ktaka/articleshow/80697910.cms||Chethan Kumar
February 5, 2021||Trichy||Thousands die in Tamil Nadu as road safety proposals await green signal||Tamil Nadu has roads that are among the deadliest in the country, but four major road safety projects proposed in the state have remained on paper for years now. Though tenders were floated for some projects and funds were sanctioned, nothing has materialised. Despite repeated attempts, TN road safety commissioner Tenkasi S Jawahar was unavailable to answer questions on why the four projects are being delayed. ANPR systemIn February 2018, the government had proposed to introduce a speed violation detection system (SVDS) along Chennai-Trichy national highway (NH45), which reports around 100 accidents a year. The system was to consist of speed sensors, ANPR cameras and a control centre. Any vehicle which crossed the speed limit of 100km per hour will be caught using 56 sensors fitted at multiple points on the 270km stretch. These sensors will trigger an image capture command to ANPR cameras. A total of 168 cameras were supposed to be installed. The control centre, with the help of a software, can extract vehicle registration number details of speeding vehicles using images captured by these cameras and generate traffic challans automatically. “Though it is a necessity, there are no signs of progress,” said G Ganesh from Tamil Nadu Lorry Owners’ Association. “Till then, the government should ensure that roads are safe. For instance, for the past six months lights near Singaperumalkoil on NH45 have not been working. When they can’t get the basics right, there is no point in dreaming about such hi-tech projects.” GPS-based auto metersIn 2012, former chief minister J Jayalaithaa had announced that her government will install GPS-enabled fare meters in autorickshaws in Chennai. She had promised to install meters fitted with receipt printers and panic buttons in 43,000 autos in the city in the first phase of the project. Seven years later, the state transport department set up a pilot control centre in Anna Nagar. But that became defunct. Months later, plans were devised to run the project in Thiruvanmiyur regional transport office (RTO) and 2,000 autos were shortlisted. But that too did not take off even as plans are on to expand the pilot scheme to at least six more RTOs. G Sadagopan, a transportation activist from Avadi, said: “Given the number of crimes happening in autos and public transport, an SOS option in autos is necessary, particularly for women and senior citizens.” A regular autorickshaw user, S Dinesh from Perungudi, said without smart meters, commuters end up paying more. “Every day, we have to haggle with auto drivers. Some of them demand four to five times more when passengers are not familiar with the local tongue,” he said. High security number platesIn 2001, the Union road transport ministry had made installation of high security registration number plates (HSRP) mandatory for all vehicles. The primary purpose was to stop misuse of stolen vehicles. Unlike conventional number plates, HSRPs can’t be tampered with or removed once fixed. At present, automobile dealers are embossing holograms and barcodes on conventional number plates but are not installing the third number plates (stickers on the top left corner of a car’s windshield) as mandated by central government rules. Asked about the delay, a senior transport department official said, “Tenders floated in 2013 were cancelled and fresh bids were floated. This too was caught up in legal hurdle for long. Only now we have got this sorted and invited bids on January 18 to install HSRP plates for 2.7 crore vehicles in the state.” But S Rajvel, state chairperson of Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), said there were no scanners or necessary infrastructure to scan or track stolen/misused vehicles as claimed. Delhi and Puducherry are the only states that have implemented it to an extent, he said. In Tamil Nadu there are only four approved manufacturers, so the cost of vehicles will increase if HSRP stickers were introduced, Rajvel said. Digital testing tracks in RTOsWhile inaugurating the first electronic driving testing track at Karur RTO in May 2018, Tamil Nadu transport minister M R Vijayabaskar had said the it will be expanded in 13 other RTOs across the state including six in Chennai and its suburbs. But the project has remained on paper. As per the proposed design, these tracks will have an H-track, a slope and a sharp curve. Applicants should be able to drive through all these three type of tracks without hitting against the bollards or poles on the sides to get a licence. Vibration sensors fitted to the bollards will buzz if the driver hits against the sides. An applicant is given two chances to pass the test. Of the 830 people who took up the test at Karur RTO in 2019, 40% flunked. Road safety experts said the technology exposed the loopholes of manual inspections. But only technology may not suffice, awareness is the key. “Along with such high-end tests, RTOs should ensure that learners attended enough classes before arriving at their offices for driving tests. At least during road safety week celebrations, they can take awareness classes for all applicants,” said road safety advocate V S Suresh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/thousands-die-in-tn-as-road-safety-proposals-await-green-signal/articleshow/80700481.cms||Ram Sundaram
February 5, 2021||Coimbatore||Restore communal harmony in dist, residents tell officials||Coimbatore: With tension rising between the Hindu and Muslim outfits in the district, residents and several organizations have called for restraint. While some of the organizations are planning to hold a meeting with all the religious leaders, others have sought the intervention of the district administration to ensure peace and harmony. V Nandakumar, president of Universal Brotherhood Association, said, “The protests and the counter protests that are being conducted by both the Hindu and Muslim outfits have significant impact on the common people. Even though the relationship between a Hindu and Muslim has not changed much, there is a constant sense of unrest.” Following the communal tension in 2016, the association had conducted a meeting with all the industrialists, religious leaders and other important people to restore communal harmony. Pointing out that hate messages were being spread on social media platforms, igniting tension, he said the government should take strong action to curtail such messages. S R Abbas, a resident from Karumbukadai, said it was the time to stand united and support each other. “When someone makes a remark in the public and hurt our religious sentiments, all we expect is support from the brothers of other religions by condemning that act. When we are hurt, even a small support from our brethren will strengthen the bond.” M Abdul Hakkim, secretary of Jamaat e Islami Hind, said such incidents (derogatory speeches) were setting a bad example and should not be encouraged. “So far, the blasphemous speech has not affected the cordial relationship among the people in the city. But if the tension continues to prevail, it might have a significant impact. Before that, the government should intervene and take immediate steps to diffuse tensions.” Explaining that everyone wanted peace but the same could not be achieved without justice being delivered, he said the government should take stringent action against those who deliver hate/provocative speeches and ensure that the same was not repeated. Another resident Riyaz said the business people and the middle-class were the most affected by the communal disharmony, as their livelihood was at stake. “At a time when we are struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is adding further stress to us.” R Ravindran, secretary of Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore, said the personal attacks against each other should be avoided at the political platforms, because along with the peace and harmony of the city, development of the city would also be degraded. He said they were planning to organize a meeting with all the religious leaders, non-governmental organizations and other important people to sort out the issue at the earliest. Activist C G S Manian said more than 90% of the public were together and the friction between a small group of people - who are attempting to fuel an issue for their personal gain – was leaving a bitter impact on society. “The district administration should intervene and hold a meeting with the religious leaders to sort out the issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/restore-communal-harmony-in-dist-residents-tell-officials/articleshow/80696719.cms||Nivedha Selvam

When they can’t get the basics right, there is no point in dreaming about such hi-tech projects.” GPS-based auto metersIn 2012, former chief minister J Jayalaithaa had announced that her government will install GPS-enabled fare meters in autorickshaws in Chennai. She had promised to install meters fitted with receipt printers and panic buttons in 43,000 autos in the city in the first phase of the project. Seven years later, the state transport department set up a pilot control centre in Anna Nagar. But that became defunct. Months later, plans were devised to run the project in Thiruvanmiyur regional transport office (RTO) and 2,000 autos were shortlisted. But that too did not take off even as plans are on to expand the pilot scheme to at least six more RTOs. G Sadagopan, a transportation activist from Avadi, said: “Given the number of crimes happening in autos and public transport, an SOS option in autos is necessary, particularly for women and senior citizens.” A regular autorickshaw user, S Dinesh from Perungudi, said without smart meters, commuters end up paying more. “Every day, we have to haggle with auto drivers. Some of them demand four to five times more when passengers are not familiar with the local tongue,” he said. High security number platesIn 2001, the Union road transport ministry had made installation of high security registration number plates (HSRP) mandatory for all vehicles. The primary purpose was to stop misuse of stolen vehicles. Unlike conventional number plates, HSRPs can’t be tampered with or removed once fixed. At present, automobile dealers are embossing holograms and barcodes on conventional number plates but are not installing the third number plates (stickers on the top left corner of a car’s windshield) as mandated by central government rules. Asked about the delay, a senior transport department official said, “Tenders floated in 2013 were cancelled and fresh bids were floated. This too was caught up in legal hurdle for long. Only now we have got this sorted and invited bids on January 18 to install HSRP plates for 2.7 crore vehicles in the state.” But S Rajvel, state chairperson of Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), said there were no scanners or necessary infrastructure to scan or track stolen/misused vehicles as claimed. Delhi and Puducherry are the only states that have implemented it to an extent, he said. In Tamil Nadu there are only four approved manufacturers, so the cost of vehicles will increase if HSRP stickers were introduced, Rajvel said. Digital testing tracks in RTOsWhile inaugurating the first electronic driving testing track at Karur RTO in May 2018, Tamil Nadu transport minister M R Vijayabaskar had said the it will be expanded in 13 other RTOs across the state including six in Chennai and its suburbs. But the project has remained on paper. As per the proposed design, these tracks will have an H-track, a slope and a sharp curve. Applicants should be able to drive through all these three type of tracks without hitting against the bollards or poles on the sides to get a licence. Vibration sensors fitted to the bollards will buzz if the driver hits against the sides. An applicant is given two chances to pass the test. Of the 830 people who took up the test at Karur RTO in 2019, 40% flunked. Road safety experts said the technology exposed the loopholes of manual inspections. But only technology may not suffice, awareness is the key. “Along with such high-end tests, RTOs should ensure that learners attended enough classes before arriving at their offices for driving tests. At least during road safety week celebrations, they can take awareness classes for all applicants,” said road safety advocate V S Suresh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/thousands-die-in-tn-as-road-safety-proposals-await-green-signal/articleshow/80700484.cms||Ram Sundaram
February 5, 2021||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Without his hero, Vijayakant look-alike begins campaign||CHENNAI: For two decades Kumar has been better known for his sobriquet ‘Vijayakant’ as he dresses up like the DMDK chief Vijayakant. But for the past two years he has not seen his hero due to the latter’s ill health. A week ago, Kumar, began his campaign starting with a photoshoot with Captain’s (as Vijayakant is fondly called) wife and DMDK treasurer Premalatha. He believes if Anni (Premalatha) finds a good alliance in the forthcoming election, the party will fare well. “Captain is not active as earlier, but that doesn’t spoil the charm. I will remain a look-alike of him forever. I will campaign for him in the forthcoming elections. I hope Premalatha will lead the party well,” said Kumar, who has incorporated elements from Captain’s personal sartorial style to complete his avatar. “Earlier, I used to follow his style based on the movies that he acted in. Now, I have changed it. I have started wearing dark sunglasses that Captain uses these days. There are some changes in the ways he dresses that I have incorporated,” said Kumar, a theatre artist from Namakkal. Kumar can imitate Captain’s voice, gestures and mannerisms. Kumar was an MGR-Rajini fan, when his friends told him that he looked like Vijayakant, he didn’t take it seriously. But slowly he too started to see the similarities.  Kumar said he would plan his campaign programmes after consulting DMDK leaders. “I am waiting for the dates of the election to be declared. For me, Captain is my god. I will travel across TN as a look-alike for Captain,” said the 48-year-old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/without-his-hero-vijayakant-look-alike-begins-campaign/articleshow/80694847.cms||M T Saju
February 5, 2021||Madurai||Thousands die in Tamil Nadu as road safety proposals await green signal||Tamil Nadu has roads that are among the deadliest in the country, but four major road safety projects proposed in the state have remained on paper for years now. Though tenders were floated for some projects and funds were sanctioned, nothing has materialised. Despite repeated attempts, TN road safety commissioner Tenkasi S Jawahar was unavailable to answer questions on why the four projects are being delayed. ANPR systemIn February 2018, the government had proposed to introduce a speed violation detection system (SVDS) along Chennai-Trichy national highway (NH45), which reports around 100 accidents a year. The system was to consist of speed sensors, ANPR cameras and a control centre. Any vehicle which crossed the speed limit of 100km per hour will be caught using 56 sensors fitted at multiple points on the 270km stretch. These sensors will trigger an image capture command to ANPR cameras. A total of 168 cameras were supposed to be installed. The control centre, with the help of a software, can extract vehicle registration number details of speeding vehicles using images captured by these cameras and generate traffic challans automatically. “Though it is a necessity, there are no signs of progress,” said G Ganesh from Tamil Nadu Lorry Owners’ Association. “Till then, the government should ensure that roads are safe.

February 5, 2021||Dehradun||Indian officials deny Nepal admin's claim of formation of artificial lake near border||Pithoragarh: The Dharchula administration on Thursday denied any artificial lake formation near Kali river in Malpa village, located almost 50 km away from Dharchula in Pithoragarh, after the officials from the Nepal border raised an alarm that any new lake formation could cause a flash flood-like situation.The response came after Nepal’s Kanchanpur district authorities issued a warning on Tuesday that landslide blocked Kali river due to which an artificial lake got formed. The officials then ordered their citizens residing near the river to evacuate to a safe place and alerted the Indian authorities.“We were informed that an artificial lake has been formed near the Kali river, after which we sent a team of revenue officers and the Sashastra Seema Bal personnel to recce the area. But they did not find any lake there,” Anil Kumar Shukla, SDM of Dharchula, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/indian-officials-deny-nepal-admins-claim-of-formation-of-artificial-lake-near-border/articleshow/80693455.cms||Prem Punetha
February 5, 2021||India||15 oppn MPs stopped from reaching farmer protest site||GHAZIABAD: A group of 15 opposition MPs, among them former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, was on Thursday stopped from walking across the Delhi-Ghaziabad border to the farmers' agitation site at UP Gate on NH-9. Standing near the barricades, which have been fortified with iron spikes, concertina wires and a concrete barrier built across the road, Harsimrat said it was as if protesting farmers had been imprisoned on one side of the border and opposition MPs on the other. "I'm seeing such barricades for the first time within the country. It is impossible to meet people on the other side. Such barricading is normally seen at the border with Pakistan. I'm shocked to see it in Delhi," said Harsimrat, whose party SAD walked out of NDA last year in protest against the new farming laws. "We were stopped by police in anti-riot gear as if we are anti-nationals and terrorists. Don't we have a right to meet farmers, many of whom have come from my state," she asked. SAD's Sukhbir Singh Badal had earlier this week visited the UP Gate site and met Rakesh Tikait, who is leading the sit-in agitation here, to extend his party's support. Harsimrat was accompanied, among others, by NCP's Supriya Sule, DMK's Kanimozhi and Trinamool's Saugata Ray. "We were stopped from meeting protesters. Now, we are headed straight to Parliament where we will raise the issue with the Speaker," said Sule. "We wanted to see what is happening here but we were not allowed to go to the protest site," said Kanimozhi. The MPs, including those from NC and Left parties like RSP, arrived in a bus but had to leave within 15 minutes after a heated exchange with cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/15-oppn-mps-stopped-from-reaching-farmer-protest-site/articleshow/80697927.cms||Abhijay Jha

February 5, 2021||Dehradun||Plants in upper Himalayan region flowering and fruiting up to 4 months before usual season; forest dept report says it’s due to climate change||Nainital: Highlighting the effects of climate change on the phenological cycle of plants in the upper Himalayan region, a survey conducted by the Uttarakhand forest department’s Pithoragarh forest research range has found that flowering and fruiting in four of the most common plants around Munsyari has been happening at least three to four months before the normal season.The field survey, a brief report of which is available with TOI, studied four common plants — rhododendron, kafal, Himalayan raspberry (hisalu) and Himalayan cherry (bhenkal) — and found that while the fruiting and flowering in these species happens in late spring or even summers, it was taking place in late January instead.According to the report, while flowering in rhododendron takes place in March-May, they were already blooming at the time of survey. Similarly, kafal which witnesses fruiting in late April to June witnessed the same phenomenon in January. Himalayan raspberry flowering and in some cases, ripening of fruits was also witnessed even though in normal times, it flowers in March and fruiting takes place in late March and April. Meanwhile, Himalayan cherry flowering was witnessed three months before the usual season.Sanjiv Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests (research), said that these findings clearly point out the changes in phonological cycle of plants as a result of warming of the upper Himalayan region due to climate change. “Our surveys had been observing changes in the phenological cycles of these plants over the years. However, this time it is more visible and prominent. Munsyari is famous for its cold and snowy winters, and therefore, these changes are a clear indication of the impact of climate change,” Chaturvedi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/plants-in-upper-himalayan-region-flowering-and-fruiting-up-to-4-months-before-usual-season-forest-dept-report-says-its-due-to-climate-change/articleshow/80693502.cms||Prashant Jha
February 5, 2021||Chennai||AIADMK files plaint against use of party flag by ‘outsiders’||Chennai: The ruling AIADMK on Thursday complained to the director general of police against the use of the party flag by ‘outsiders’. This comes in the wake of J Jayalalithaa’s close aide V K Sasikala’s car that she used on release from prison sporting the AIADMK flag.Ministers D Jayakumar, C Ve Shanmugam, party deputy coordinator K P Munusamy were present, when party presidium chairman E Madhusudhanan filed the complaint with the DGP in the latter's office. “The reason behind this is Sasikala used our party flag in her car while she has no moral right to do that. Our party senior functionaries had condemned it, still a complaint has been preferred with police so that the practice does not continue,” Munusamy said.Law minister C Ve Shanmugam said the EC had recognised the party led by OPS and EPS in 2017 and all appeals by Sasikala and T T V Dhinakaran were dismissed. “If Sasikala wants to conduct a case, she could do so in the United Nations or hold Mannargudi khap panchayat,” he said.Meanwhile, T T V Dhinakaran on Thursday tweeted that Sasikala’s return to Chennai has been postponed by a day. She will now start from Bengaluru on Monday, February 8 instead Sunday as announced earlier. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-files-plaint-against-use-of-party-flag-by-outsiders/articleshow/80694956.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Over 4,000 given Covaxin in Maharashtra, 20 mild reaction cases||MUMBAI: Six centres in the state have completed administering Covaxin to over 4,000 healthcare workers till Thursday. Four of the six centres said they have not recorded any severe adverse effects. Together, these centres have reported around 20 cases of mild after-effects following immunisation. Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, is given under a ‘clinical trial’ mode and those taking the vaccine have to document any symptoms they develop within seven days of taking the shot. Most centres said they didn’t record any hospitalisation. Only Mumbai and Aurangabad have each seen a case where the recipient suffered some unusual symptoms. At JJ Hospital, which is the only centre giving Covaxin in the city, the team has recorded the case of a doctor who suffered from fever for upto a week. The doctors are deliberating whether the recipient had viral fever which coincided with the vaccination. “We haven’t had any other complaints of side-effects barring this one case where the doctor had fever for 6-7 days and was on medication. It may or may not be related to vaccination, but we will be reporting this event to the civic authorities,” said Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer of the JJ vaccination centre.  He said that of the 495 who took the vaccine in JJ, around 60 were private doctors who chose to take Covaxin over Covishield. The Government Medical College in Aurangabad has reported nearly a dozen cases of mild reactions. Dr Jagannath Dixit, nodal officer of the centre, said that the common complaints were of fever, itching and pain at the injection site. The hospital only had one patient, a 51-year-old doctor with a history of allergy, whose blood pressure shot up following vaccination. “She was advised to think about taking the vaccine given her medical history and she chose to take it. However, her BP returned to normal within 2-3 hours and she went home later,” said Dr Dixit. At his centre, the daily turnout is around 50%. The Government Medical College in Nagpur has vaccinated 999 till Thursday at two of its booths. Nodal officer Dr Uday Narlawar, said that they have seen around eight cases of side-effects, which were mild. “There is definitely some hesitancy in taking the vaccine. Our turnout is around 25%,” he said. Dr Satish Humne from the District Hospital in Amravati, that has vaccinated the highest (1,141) among all Covaxin centres, said they didn’t report a single case of after-effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-4000-given-covaxin-in-state-20-case-of-mild-reaction/articleshow/80694966.cms||Sumitra Debroy

February 5, 2021||Coimbatore||Cargo traffic will soar as flights increase: Official||The Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent closure of the airport has a direct bearing on the air cargo, which has dropped by more than 50%. However, the cargo traffic is increasing constantly, with the city airport in December handling more than 70% of the freight that it handled in the same month in 2019.As per the data with the Airport Authority of India, the airport handled only 3,625 tonnes of cargo during April-December 2020, compared to 7,515 tonnes in the same period in 2019. Pointing out that their cargo space was the belly of a passenger flight, R Mahalingam, city airport director, said, “Unless the number of flights touch that of the previous year (2019), cargo movement won’t match the previous levels. We are utilizing almost 80% of the existing cargo space we have.” Airport officials said only 18 flights were operating to and from the city, compared to 36 in 2019. “Timing of the flights is also important. For example, base flights are convenient for cargo, compared to afternoon flights, because we have more loading time. Despite the number of base flights getting reduced to one from three, we are on a journey to normalcy,” the airport director said.The domestic cargo movement, which stood at 236 tonnes in June, has grown to 608 tonnes in September and 615 tonnes in November. In December, it stood at 575 tonnes. “Our domestic cargo is mainly perishables and engineering goods. Movement of perishables like flowers, fruits and vegetables, is always higher during the festive seasons,” said a cargo department official, explaining the zig zag graph.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cargo-traffic-will-soar-as-flights-increase-official/articleshow/80696743.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

February 5, 2021||Chennai||Shops running out of chess sets: Viswanathan Anand||CHENNAI: Chess fans, over the years, have seen Viswanathan Anand take on players from across the world, but last month the 51-year-old tried something different. On a popular chess platform, the five-time world champion played his own bot (a robot) and the match gained a lot of traction on social media sites. The online version of Anand certainly made the legend work hard before the match ended in a draw. “It was crazy. Once I got a winning advantage and I spoiled it. The second time my bot spoiled my winning advantage. It’s still a computer but with human elements and that makes it more of a realistic game,” Anand pointed out during the Spotlight Lecture series, part of the IIT Madras’ annual cultural fest Saarang on Thursday. If not for the covid-19 pandemic, Anand would have had a tight schedule featuring in over-the-board competitions across the world. But that’s not the case currently and Anand conceded that featuring in online tournaments was odd. “Chess-wise, I have not been very active. I am very much waiting for over-the-board chess events to resume. (Playing) online (events) is a bit weird for me but I have played them quite a lot before the pandemic. It’s just that suddenly playing it, and being serious with an arbiter watching you and the results counting --- has made it difficult to adapt to,” Anand conceded. The last 12 months has witnessed exponential growth of chess thanks to online tournaments, top players streaming on various platforms and a few other factors. One of those has been the popularity of a web series on Netflix called Queen’s Gambit which has certainly lifted the profile of the sport. “Membership numbers and subscriptions to popular chess platforms were breaking records even before the Queen’s Gambit arrived (during the pandemic). But that series definitely took the popularity of the sport further, and shops are running out of chess sets now,” Anand pointed out. Players, in recent times, have embraced blitz format like never before, and Anand believes the right attitude is key to achieve success. “You would assume some blunders are going to be made in blitz games. One must approach it with a liberated attitude. Sometimes the moves stop making sense but it’s all in your head,” he said.

February 5, 2021||Kochi||Kochi corporation plans to set up decentralized waste plants||KOCHI: In an effort to reduce the quantity of garbage being treated at the solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram, Kochi corporation authorities are mooting a multipronged strategy to ensure that more decentralized garbage treatment plants are coming up in the city. After visiting the Brahmapuram plant premises in 2019, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) team had given instructions to the corporation to take urgent measures to bring down the quantity of garbage being treated at the plant. “We will be exploring various methods for setting up decentralized plants and reducing the quantity of waste transported to Brahmapuram plant,” mayor M Anilkumar told TOI. The corporation authorities have already started moves to set up more biogas plants in the city. In December 2019, the corporation council gave approval for the proposal. “A government accredited agency has been shortlisted for setting up biogas plants. Once the council gives its nod for the move, the firm can be entrusted with the responsibility,” sources with the corporation said. The corporation also plans to make their own biodegradable waste treatment plants mandatory for schools, where students are given noon meal, and hospitals. Health supervisors have been instructed to identify vacant places which are suitable for setting up decentralized biodegradable waste treatment plants. At the same time, there are reports that most of the biogas plants which had been set up in various households and other institutions from time to time become defunct soon. So, there are suggestions for using more innovative and cost-effective methods of setting up treatment plants. “There are new methods where food waste is being turned into manure. The cost of such small units would be well within a couple of thousands. So, it would be one of the cheapest means for treating biodegradable waste,” sources said. At the same time, the construction of the proposed waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram is yet to begin. In 2017, Kochi corporation authorities had entered into an agreement with a private firm for setting up the plant at Brahmapuram on a public private partnership model. But the government scrapped the private firm after it failed to start the work even after two years of signing the agreement. Later, the government deployed Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) as the nodal agency for setting up the plant. A year after this, KSIDC couldn’t complete even the preliminary works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-plans-to-set-up-decentralized-waste-plants/articleshow/80693509.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
February 5, 2021||Chennai||‘Rajiv case convicts would’ve been hanged if not for AIADMK’||CHENNAI: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday said in the assembly that but for the AIADMK government’s sustained efforts, the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case would have been hanged by now. “The DMK is staging a political drama to make people believe that they are fighting for the release of the seven convicts. Their aim is to gain public sympathy ahead of the assembly elections,” he said, referring to the opposition’s decision to boycott the assembly session citing delay in governor ordering their release. He expressed confidence that the governor would take a “good decision” and give his stamp of approval to the TN cabinet’s decision taken on September 9, 2018, recommending the premature release of the seven convicts. “We are asking the governor to consider the cabinet’s decision whenever we meet him,” he said. He criticised the DMK and its leader M K Stalin for carrying out a “misinformation campaign” regarding the issue. Seeking to set records straight, the CM said the DMK government, on August 19, 2000, had advised the governor to commute the death sentence of Nalini Sriharan and uphold the capital punishment of Sriharan, Shanthan and A G Perarivalan. The governor accepted the cabinet decision, said EPS. “If the order was implemented, they would have been executed by now,” he said and wondered why the DMK, when it was in power, did not pass a resolution to commute the death sentence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rajiv-case-convicts-wouldve-been-hanged-if-not-for-aiadmk/articleshow/80694937.cms||Shanmughasundarm j
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi HC declines to hear PIL on Republic Day violence||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Thursday declined to entertain a PIL seeking investigation into the violence during farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day and the alleged lapse in security, which resulted in a religious flag being hoisted at the Red Fort. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh asked the petitioner to either withdraw the plea or face dismissal with costs. “So, you started typing the petition right after the incident on January 26 noon? Do you know how much time is given for investigation under the Criminal Procedure Code? You are a lawyer. You expect the investigation to be completed within two days of the incident? Does the government have a magic wand that it will wave and everything will be done? Should we dismiss it with cost or will you withdraw,” the bench told the advocate, Vivek Narayan Sharma, counsel for the petitioner. Subsequently, Sharma said he would withdraw the petition filed on behalf of three UP residents, who had sought action against people involved in the violence. “Permission sought is granted. Petition is dismissed as withdrawn,” the bench said. During the brief hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that 43 FIRs had been registered in connection with the incident, and of those, 13 were transferred to the Special Cell (Crime Branch) of Delhi Police. The senior law officer also told the court that, where required, provisions of UAPA had been invoked and the “investigation was being carried out on priority looking at the seriousness of the matter”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-declines-to-hear-pil-on-r-day-violence/articleshow/80696748.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Budget gives Shiv Sena poll promises of property tax waiver, theme park at racecourse a miss||MUMBAI: The last budget presented before the BMC elections, which are scheduled early next year, has left out some of the Shiv Sena’s key 2017 civic election promises like converting Mahalaxmi Racecourse into a theme park on the lines of New York’s Central Park and a 100% property tax waiver for those living in homes measuring less than 500 sq ft. BMC Budget 2021-22, however, has attempted to cover many of the saffron party’s other poll promises by giving them a mention and making token budgetary provisions like constructing a Dabbewala Bhavan, a shooting range and setting up a music academy. But these projects are unlikely to be completed before the 2022 polls. “All the 2017 manifesto promises, barring one of two, are in the budget and will be fulfilled. We had made a budget provision for a theme park at Mahalaxmi Racecourse via the standing committee last year, and we will do it this year too. In fact, we will start the process to convert it into a public park this year,” said Sena corporator Yashwant Jadhav, chairman of the BMC standing committee. “All those items that are missing in the budget will be added by the standing committee and fulfilled.” In his budget presented on Wednesday, municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal made it clear that only the general tax component of property tax would be exempted for those living in houses measuring less than 500 sq ft. This means that a full waiver as promised by the Sena in its 2017 BMC poll manifesto won’t be given. Chahal only made a Rs 1 crore provision for construction of a Dabbewala Bhavan in central Mumbai, and another Rs 1 crore to build a shooting range in the city. He added that the BMC was setting up a Model Music Centre under the tutelage of music composer Mayuresh Pai at a BMC school in Lower Parel and made a token provision of only Rs 10 lakh for the project. The Sena had also promised parking facilities outside railway stations, a single pass to travel across modes like BEST, railway and Metro, night collection of garbage and setting up shops to sell generic medicines, but the BMC budget did not lay out any detailed plans for these initiatives. The Sena’s plan to set up a cath lab in RN Cooper Hospital to monitor heart ailments and a dedicated hospital for treating diabetes too didn’t make it into the budget, but the poll promise to start an OPD-on-wheels got a provision of Rs 5 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/budget-gives-sena-poll-promises-of-property-tax-waiver-theme-park-at-racecourse-a-miss/articleshow/80696794.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Addressing the media as part of Aishwarya Kerala Yatra, he claimed that the government decision to extend the validity of PSC rank list was an election stunt. He alleged that backdoor appointments and regularizations were done solely on the basis of political considerations. "The criteria for regularization has been spelt out by director Kamal and it is reserved only for those associated with Left front and their relatives," Chennithala said referring to the letter written by the Chalachithra academy chairman who requested regularization of four Left sympathizers working in temporary posts at the academy. Chennithala said that the investigation in gold smuggling case came to a halt after the chief minister wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He alleged that IAS officer M Sivasankar managed to secure bail in the case because of the tie-up between state and central governments. "Investigating agencies had said that the involvement of M Sivasankar was only the tip of the iceberg. Now where is that iceberg? The probe has almost been scuttled and people now know that it is because of the understanding reached between CPM and BJP," he alleged. Speaking at the public meeting in Kozhikode Beach, Karnataka PCC president, DK Shivakumar claimed that LDF was hobnobbing with BJP in state. He alleged that a conspiracy was afoot, through which BJP was trying to enter the state with the help of Communist party. Inaugurating the meeting, IUML state president Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal said Kerala was facing a dangerous situation where fascist forces and Marxist front are speaking the same language and taking the same stand on various issues. Referring to the statement made by LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan after Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala came home to meet him, Thangal said that it is not political decency to communalize a meeting between leaders of constituent parties in a front.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/if-elected-udf-will-review-backdoor-appointments/articleshow/80693504.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Chennai||HC wants ‘dignified’ solution to stray menace||Chennai: The Madras high court has directed the Tamil Nadu government and the Greater Chennai Corporation to come out with a plan to tackle stray dog menace in a dignified manner, particularly on the premises of IIT-Madras. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy passed the interim order on Thursday, on a public interest writ petition filed by People For Cattle in India (PFCI) alleging that stray dogs on IIT-Madras campus are being confined in cages in the guise of sterilising them. “Stray dogs and other animals should be treated in an ethical manner,” the bench said. According to the petitioner, the Animal Birth Control Rules, 2001, require that dogs which are captured for tagging and sterilization have to be released in the same habitat where they were captured. However, the dogs captured on the IIT campus have not been released so far and are confined in cages. The petitioner stated that though the entire incident was brought to the notice of Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), no action has been initiated. “The entire action has violated Section 11 of Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act, 1960 by keeping the dogs in captivity for 90 days,” the petitioner said. Recording the submissions, the bench directed the petitioner to implead the Chennai Corporation and the Tamil Nadu government as party respondent. The bench further added that awareness has to be spread out among the public to treat stray dogs ethically and humanely. The court then adjourned the hearing by four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-wants-dignified-solution-to-stray-menace/articleshow/80694964.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Chennai||Tamil Nadu ministers hail Edappadi K Palaniswami as eternal, number 1 chief minister||CHENNAI: Amid the unease caused in the AIADMK because of the release of J Jayalalithaa’s close aide V K Sasikala from Bengaluru prison, the state ministers and MLAs on Thursday rallied behind chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam in a show of solidarity and hailed the leadership for following the path shown by the party leaders, M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa. Senior minister K A Sengottaiyan set the tone by saying that EPS would script history by retaining power. EPS would be eternal CM and OPS would remain supportive, he said. “You will be the chief minister tomorrow (read after polls) too. You are going to create history by becoming an eternal chief minister. Let me extend my wishes to you,” he said amidst loud thumping of desks. Palaniswami and Panneerselvam were present, listening in rapt attention, when the members were seeking to put up a united show under their leadership. Except eight AIADMK MLAs, including minister R Kamaraj, the remaining 115 members were present in the House. Since the opposition - the DMK, the Congress and the IUML - had boycotted the session, the treasury members got lots of time to take part in the question hour. Electricity minister P Thangamani, a close associate of Palaniswami, said the state was blessed with rains even in the month of December and said it was a sign of positive things in store for Palaniswami. “The opposition boycotted the session, but voters will boycott them and make EPS the chief minister,” he said. The 100-minute long session saw the members hailing the leadership with monickers like Salethu Singam (Lion of Salem), Kongu Nattu Thangam (Gold of Kongu belt), Kudimaramath Nayagan (Hero of Kudimamaramath) and Jallikattu Nayagan (Hero of Jallikattu). Social welfare minister V Saroja thanked the chief minister for rolling out schemes like mobile application for the welfare of transgenders. “He is the number one chief minister in the country. He is going to establish Amma’s rule in 2021 too,” the minister said. The unveiling of Jayalalithaa’s mausoleum, conversion of the former CM’s Poes Garden residence into a memorial and installation of a bronze statue of the late leader on the Marina came in for praise. Members also hailed EPS for the introduction of a 7.5% NEET quota for government school students and the government’s decision to pay their fees. Noting that EPS was brave enough to visit every district and hold Covid-19 review meetings even as the infection wreaked havoc across the world, municipal administration minister S P Velumani hailed the deputy CM for announcing EPS as the CM candidate for the polls. The members reeled out various other achievements of the EPS government. Cooperatives minister Sellur K Raju said, “The CM scripted history. He works relentlessly day and night for the people’s welfare. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ministers-hail-eps-as-eternal-no-1-cm/articleshow/80694969.cms||Julie Mariappan
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra awaits scrapping policy to get rid of 16 lakh decrepit vehicles||MUMBAI: More than 16 lakh vehicles in Maharashtra can be scrapped to reduce congestion, pollution and declutter roads once the government introduces a policy on the matter, said state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne on Thursday. In the Union budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a 'voluntary vehicle scrapping policy' to phase out old and polluting vehicles: commercial vehicles over 15 years old and private cars and bikes over 20 years old. The state is likely to come out with guidelines soon and will make the process digital for the end user. Times ViewMaharashtra government should expedite the voluntary Vehicle Scrapping policy as vehicular pollution is now a major contributor to global warming. It will also promote use of fuel efficient and environment-friendly vehicles. There is also an urgent need to rid our roads of abandoned vehicles which pose a hazard. While there is a deterrent of a hefty 'green tax' for car owners who refuse to scrap vehicles, government should also give incentives to them to buy a new car in case they scrap the old one.At present, there is a green tax in Maharashtra for vehicles aged over 15 years. “If a scrapping policy is implemented, we will conduct stringent checks to ensure people pay the green tax and also get fitness certificates for older vehicles,” an RTO official said. “As per National Informatics Centre (NIC) records, 16 lakh vehicles in the state have surpassed the age of 15 years (commercial) or 20 years (private) and can be scrapped. But there are old records prior to computerisation, which are not digitised, and so the actual number could be more,” the transport chief said. One of the advantages of a vehicle scrapping policy will be to tackle the problem of abandoned vehicles (colloquially called 'khataras'). Dhakne said, “Municipal bodies can be the implementing authorities to clear khataras from the road and send them to government-approved scrapyards.” A traffic police officer said impounding vehicles in Mumbai is difficult as there is no space to keep these, and private cars, taxis and autos rotting at detention centres is a common sight. Wadala resident Priyesh Shah said he has clicked pictures of scores of vehicles abandoned by the roadside in Cuffe Parade, Mumbai Central and Wadala. “The authorities should find the owners of these khataras and prosecute them,” he demanded. Dhakne said a policy on scrapping will help declutter roads and increase carriageway. A senior transport official said that if vehicles continue to remain on roads for a long time, spare parts become non-functional and thus the chances of an accident increase. “Also, many car owners do not know where to go and how to get vehicles deregistered or scrapped. The new policy will make this simple for them," he said. “If the government decides on some incentives, the scrapping certificate can be used to get good discounts for purchasing a new vehicle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-awaits-scrapping-policy-to-get-rid-of-16-lakh-decrepit-vehicles/articleshow/80696926.cms||Somit Sen

Also, four cases of minor adverse effects following immunization (AEFI) were reported on Thursday although there were no severe cases. So far, 1,88,097 staff have been vaccinated in the state. “We have been encouraging our staff to take the vaccines but most of the nurses and wardboys have turned down the vaccine. This hasn’t changed even after conducting awareness sessions and counselling,” a official from a mid-sized hospital in Nizampet admitted. So far, 64% of the targeted government healthcare workers and 45% of private healthcare workers have taken the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/58-health-staff-took-covid-shot-so-far/articleshow/80694962.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Coimbatore||TNEB to increase power tariff this yr to offset loss||Coimbatore: Without being able to bear the loss, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) is planning to increase the power tariff this year, said members of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board Engineers’ Union on Thursday.Speaking to reporters, R Govindharajan, general secretary of the union, said the board had incurred a loss of Rs 1,60,000 crore in the past 17 years, as it hadn’t considered any of the recommendations - especially to revise or cancel the long-term agreements signed with private companies for purchasing power and to self-generate power - provided by experts.Over a period of time, he said, the board had increased the power tariff by 250%. Now, without being able to bear the loss, the state government has been planning to revise the tariff and it is expected to be announced after the state assembly elections.The board was converted into TNEB Limited, under which Tangedco and TANTRANDCO had started functioning in 2010. “At the same time, the government has passed an order stating that a tripartite agreement should be signed by the company, government and employees’ unions to ensure the benefits of the employees are not compromised. But the agreement was not signed in the past ten years,” he said.Pointing out that about 1,80,000 families were dependent on the board, he said the government should take immediate steps to sign the agreement. “We have been requesting the government to sign the agreement, but to no avail,” he said.Pressing their demands, the members staged a demonstration in front of the TNEB office at Tatabad on the day. They have decided to take out similar demonstrations at across the state in a few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tneb-to-increase-power-tariff-this-yr-to-offset-loss/articleshow/80696764.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Kochi||Ernakulam: Rural cops to prepare list of young drug abusers||KOCHI: In view of reports that more youths are falling into the traps of drug addiction and abuse, Ernakulam rural police are planning to conduct awareness classes and de-addiction programmes for school and college students. “We are preparing a profile library of young drug abusers. The idea is to bring them back to the mainstream through de-addiction and other such programmes,” said district police chief (Ernakulam rural) SP K Karthick. Sources said abandoned buildings and deserted areas have become a hub for illegal activities, including drug abuse, in many parts of the district. The number of youths getting addicted to drugs is also on the rise despite efforts from the side of the police to keep drug abuse in check. Thrikkakara MLA P T Thomas said there are locations in areas like Ponekkara, Thammanam, Vyttila and Edappally where youngsters gather to indulge in anti-social activities, including drug abuse. He said at least four youngsters had lost their lives in the past one year in incidents relating to drug abuse. “I personally know incidents in Edappally, Palarivattom and Vyttila where narcotic abuse led to deaths. In one incident at Edappally, a youth under the influence of narcotics, met with an accident and died. In another case, a youth was stabbed to death in a clash related to drugs at Palarivattom. Many in the age group of 16 to 25 are falling for this,” said Thomas. He said that police should be given training to handle youngsters who are first-time offenders. “In many cases, when police arrest a big gang for drug abuse at least a few among them would be first timers. At least such youths need to be treated differently so that they can be given proper care to come out from the trap,” said Thomas. A senior official with the city police said that patrolling activities in deserted locations in the city would be increased. In a press conference held in connection with the murder of an accused in the Elamakkara burglary case at a deserted location on January 28, city police commissioner CH Nagaraju had also promised to increase patrolling to avoid crimes getting reported from abandoned areas. Karthick, meanwhile, added that parents have an important role to play in keeping minors safe from narcotic abuse. “Parents can monitor children and keep a tab of their activities. Children in their late teenage years are vulnerable to peer pressure and they need to resist the peer pressure and say no to these kinds of activities,” said Karthick. “We are now planning to attach the properties of those persons who have amassed wealth through drug business. We believe that property attachment under the NDPS Act can become a major deterrent to other miscreants who are active in this sector,” added Karthick.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rural-cops-to-prepare-list-of-young-drug-abusers/articleshow/80693534.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Bareilly||Wife, brother of UP farmer who died in Delhi booked for ‘insult to national flag’||PILIBHIT: Three days after the death of a 32-year-old UP farmer who had gone “missing” from the protest site at Ghazipur and was later found dead at a Delhi hospital, his wife and brother have been booked by UP police on charges of insulting the national flag. The farmer from Bhopatpur village under Pilibhit's Bari Bujhiya panchayat, Balvinder Singh, had left for the Ghazipur border on January 23. A week later, on February 1, his family got a call from Delhi Police saying he had died in a road accident. The next day, they were handed his body after autopsy at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital in Delhi and, on Wednesday, the last rites were performed at his village. His body was draped in the tricolour. Balvinder's last rites were performed at his village on Wednesday. His body was draped in the tricolour.“His wife Jasveer Kaur, brother Gurvinder Singh and an unidentified person have been booked under Section 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act,” Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, SHO of Seramau North police station, under whose jurisdiction the village lies, said on Thursday. The section under which they have been charged says, “Whoever in any public place or in any other place within public view burns, mutilates, defaces, defiles, disfigures, destroys, tramples upon or otherwise shows disrespect to or brings into contempt (whether by words, either spoken or written, or by acts) the Indian National Flag or the Constitution of India or any part thereof, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.” Explanation 4(d) of the section adds that “disrespect” includes “using the Indian National Flag as a drapery in any form whatsoever except in state funerals or armed forces or other para-military forces funerals.” Gurvinder said on Thursday that there was a reason they lay the tricolour on Balvinder's body: "We believe farmers are fighting for the country, like soldiers at the border. Balvinder was a martyr for the farmers' cause. A funeral is a sacred ritual. It was a patriotic gesture." Religious and farmer representatives, meanwhile, extended their support to the grieving family. “I condemn the police action and demand that the UP chief minister order Pilibhit Police to withdraw the FIR,” said president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee. “If the tricolour was placed on the body of a protesting farmer, it symbolised the patriotism of farmers, not an insult to national honour.” Vice president of RLD’s UP unit Manjit Singh Sandhu, himself a Pilibhit-based farmer, said, “FIRs are being used to suppress the voice of farmers. There will be a massive agitation on the streets if the FIR is not withdrawn. The family did nothing to insult the tricolour.” After getting his body, Balvinder’s family had questioned the manner in which he had died. His younger brother Virendra Singh had said, “He had multiple injuries on his face. The body should have had injuries and fractures in other parts if he had been mowed down by a speeding heavy vehicle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/wife-bro-of-up-farmer-who-died-in-delhi-booked-for-insult-to-national-flag/articleshow/80693514.cms||Keshav Agarwal
February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Recruitments take a hit at universities||HYDERABAD: Failure of the Telangana government to appoint regular vice-chancellors (VCs) for state universities has crippled academic work. Teaching and non-teaching staff members in various state universities admit that the failure in appointing regular VCs has not only affected the funding to varsities, but has also delayed recruitments and promotions. “Nearly two-third of faculty positions in Osmania University (OU) are lying vacant. With faculty members superannuating each year, it is only getting more and more difficult for the existing staff to continue working. Not just recruitment, even promotions have not been taken up for more than five years for many of us,” said a faculty member from OU. There are total 1,267 sanctioned posts across several department at OU of which 845 are lying vacant. The opposition parties have slammed the Telangana government for its delay in appointing regular VCs. “By not appointing regular VCs, the universities are running like headless corpses. Thousands of teaching and non-teaching posts are being kept vacant due to non-appointment of VCs. On one hand, the CM is promoting private universities and on the other hand, it is destroying the government universities,” said Sravan Dasoju, national spokesperson of All India Congress Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/recruitments-take-a-hit-at-varsities/articleshow/80694979.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||OU profs join MLC poll race, give main parties the jitters||Hyderabad: Two teachers of Osmania University are all set to pose a challenge to the three main political parties TRS, BJP and Congress in the ensuing polls to the two graduate MLC constituencies. Retired professor M Kodandaram is entering the electoral fray from the Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam constituency, while two-time MLC professor K Nageshwar will contest from the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar seat. Given the popularity of the two professors among the electorate, comprising graduates, including government and private employees, teachers among others, the talk in political circles is that the entry of these academics has made the upcoming electoral battle all the more interesting in the two MLC seats. Do these two teachers have the potential to upset the applecart? Political analysts said both the professors are popular among the educated lot, including students, unemployed, teachers, government and private employees. However, a clear picture on the strength of each candidate will emerge only after all political parties finalise their candidates, they said. While BJP had won Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar seat in 2015, the Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam seat was bagged by the ruling TRS. The political rivalry between both these parties has heated up after the rise of the saffron party as a major political force in Telangana following its win in Dubbak by-poll and good performance in GHMC elections. BJP is likely to field its sitting MLC N Ramchander Rao from the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar seat, and Premender Reddy from the Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam constituency. “We have worked out strategies and are confident of winning both the seats,” BJP chief spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ou-profs-join-mlc-poll-race-give-main-parties-the-jitters/articleshow/80694954.cms||Roushan Ali
February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||More than a year on, search panels yet to find vice-chancellors||HYDERABAD: Constitution of search committees for the appointment of vice-chancellors (VCs) for 11 state universities seems to be an eye-wash as the government has not convened a single meeting of members ever since they have been appointed. This, even as Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao made tall promises of appointing VCs by January-end. In July 2019, state university VCs demitted office following which the Telangana chief minister appointed senior bureaucrats as in-charge VCs of universities. In September, 2019, the government had constituted search panels comprising three members each to screen all applications and recommend three names for each post to the Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan. Being chancellor of all state universities, the governor will have the final call on appointment of VCs. The search committee members have not got any communication from the government in the last year and a half. “Apart from the communication from the University Grants Commission that I have been appointed as a member of the search committee, I have not received any other communication from the state government,” said Prof Appa Rao Podile, who is a member of the search committee for the Mahatma Gandhi University. Search committee members claim that they don’t even have an idea on the number of applications received and the process of scrutinising. “There has been no meeting convened by the government to be able to go ahead with scrutinising applications. A meeting was planned at the end of 2019 but that too was postponed,” said a search committee member. A coordination committee was also set up last year. It was to coordinate with search committees to expedite appointments of VCs latest by January. However, it too remains on paper as the search committees are yet to hear from it. Sources said the governor has shot a strongly-worded letter to the state on its delay in appointing regular VCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/more-than-a-yr-on-search-panels-yet-to-find-vcs/articleshow/80694975.cms||Preeti Biswas
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Petrol price in Mumbai: Per km drive in rush hour Rs 6||MUMBAI: Petrol price in the city breached the Rs 93-mark and was hiked to an all-time high of Rs 93.20 per litre on Thursday. Diesel rate also increased by 37 paise to a new all-time high of Rs 83.67 per litre at city petrol pumps. The cost per km for petrol-driven cars in Mumbai during peak hour rush is now close to Rs 6. “We have to face traffic snarls during peak hour and now driving to office is expensive,” said Vikrant Bhat, who works in Bandra Kurla complex. Across Maharashtra, more than 23 districts have petrol prices crossing Rs 94 for a litre. Parbhani has the highest petrol rate at Rs 95.39 followed by Nanded at Rs 95.22 per litre. Hefty diesel costs have hit transporters badly and TOI recently reported that if prices keep rising, it could sound the death knell for several small transporters who will have to shut shop. A leading transporter from Mumbai said that the trucks are back in operation due to ‘Mission Begin Again’ and there are nearly 1 lakh trucks transporting goods. “With diesel, toll and few other costs, our operations are becoming economically unviable,” said Bal Malkit Singh, former president of All India Motor Transport Congress. The body will convene an emergency meeting to announce a nationwide agitation against rising fuel prices, he said. Since May 2020, petrol and diesel prices have risen by nearly Rs 17 a litre. Petrol price had escalated from Rs 76.31 on April 2 to Rs 90.34 on December 7 and Rs 90.6 on January 6 , Rs 91.32 on January 14 and after a few more hikes, it touched Rs 93.20 on February 4. Similarly diesel price shot up from Rs 66.2 in April last year to Rs 80.5 in December and Rs 80.7 on January 6 before touching Rs 81.60 on January 14. The increasing taxes and VAT which are very high in Maharashtra has upset consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/petrol-breaches-rs-93-mark-per-km-drive-in-rush-hr-rs-6/articleshow/80693520.cms||Somit Sen
February 5, 2021||Chennai||Madras HC on memorials: Is there any space on Marina beach?||CHENNAI: “How many more memorials will you (government) keep creating for leaders,” asked the Madras high court, wondering whether there was any more space available on the Marina beach for memorials. There can be only one Gandhi, one Nehru and one Patel. You can’t keep creating memorials for every other leader, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said on Thursday. “We do not mean any disrespect, but for successive chief ministers you cannot have this… you can have one Gandhi, maybe one Nehru, since he was the first, one Patel but if you keep extending it you would have memorials for deputy chief ministers also... This personality cult is not something that is great for a republic or espoused in the Constitution,” the bench said. The bench made the observations while hearing a plea moved by J Deepak, legal heir of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, challenging the validity of Tamil Nadu government’s order converting Jayalalithaa’s Poes Garden residence into a memorial. Responding to the observation, advocate-general Vijay Narayan said, such matters are policy decision of the government. To this, the bench wondered as to how long the government is going to continue building memorials out of all these places. “Have you almost exhausted the Marina?” the judges said. Answering the court, the AG said, it is not unusual as several states erect memorials for former chief ministers. In Tamil Nadu alone there are 17 memorials for freedom fighters, former chief ministers and persons who have contributed greatly to the welfare of the state. The AG also stressed that Jayalalithaa too has contributed immensely to the welfare of the state and the women. Unconvinced, the bench said, “When policy (of the government) goes to the absurd, that is where we come in.” The court then recorded the submissions of the advocate-general and the counsel for the petitioner and directed the state to file a counter in four weeks. The bench also observed that they would wait for the order on the challenge made to the land acquisition proceedings (pending before a single judge) before dealing with the present petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-on-memorials-is-there-any-space-on-marina-beach/articleshow/80694977.cms||Suresh Kumar

The split and formation of new outfit, Bharatiya Jana Sena (BJS), was announced by V Gopakumar, N K Neelakandan, and K K Binu in Kochi on Thursday. Neelakandan, a leader of Kerala Pulayar Mahasabha and president-elect of the new outfit, said BJS has the support of 12 community organizations and it would work to ensure the victory of UDF in assembly polls. Accusing BJP of deceit in Sabarimala issue, Neelakandan said BJS has over 10,000 votes in 82 constituencies and the party would work to ensure BJP’s defeat. BJS leaders alleged that instructions were issued to BDJS and BJP workers to vote for CPM in Kerala to ensure the defeat of Congress. Gopakumar and Binu will be the working presidents and S Baiju the treasurer. BJS has the support of 11 district committees, added Neelakandan. The decision to support UDF was taken after a meeting chaired by PK Kunhalikutty. Meanwhile in Kollam, BDJS president Thushar Vellappally said there was no split in the party and that BDJS has the support of all district committees.

February 5, 2021||Coimbatore||CM inaugurates drinking water supply scheme||Coimbatore: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami inaugurated the Kavundampalayam–Vadavalli drinking water augmentation scheme in the city through video-conferencing from Chennai on Thursday. The scheme is aimed at providing more drinking water to the residents of Kavundampalayam, Vadavalli and Veerakeralam, which were added to the corporation limit a decade ago. A statement from the corporation said that the scheme would benefit thousands of families and take care of their drinking water requirements till 2036. “Under the scheme, the areas will get an addition of 11.52MLD of drinking water and the total quantity of water supplied to the areas will increase to 25MLD. With this, drinking water could be supplied once in four to five days. The water supplied to the areas will increase from 75 liters per capita a day (LPCD) to 135 LPCD,” an official from the Tamil Nadu water and drainage (TWAD) board, implementing body of the scheme, said. At present, the areas get only 13.6 MLD of drinking water which is supplied once in 10 to 15 days. “TWAD has constructed 12 overhead tanks (OHTs) in addition to the existing 19 OHTs in the areas and laid pipelines for 41.94km to implement the scheme,” the official said. In addition, TWAD has also laid DI pipelines for 17km and HDPE pipelines for 304km to supply water to 26,659 households – who had already obtained household water connections in the area - to provide adequate water at good pressure, the statement said, adding that connection is yet to be provided to an equal number of households. The scheme is implemented at the cost of Rs 108.16 crore – Rs 61.80 crores under TNUDF, Rs 30.90 crore from state government fund and Rs 15.46 crore from the corporation fund. Meanwhile, the chief minister has also laid the foundation stone to commence the Ukkadam flyover extension work in the city. The flyover would be extended to Athupalam junction from Karumbukadai junction on one end and to Oppanakara street from Ukkadam junction on the other end, for a total of 2km at the cost of Rs 265.44 crore. A source from highways said, “The flyover would be extended for 600 metres till Athupalam Junction, where a loop would be constructed for commuters who want to enter Palakkad Road from the flyover. Ramps would be set up along both the Pollachi Road and Palakkad Road. On the other end, two loops - one near Ukkadam bus stand and another at Perur Bypass Road - would be constructed. Those coming from Town Hall must use the loop near the bus stand to enter the flyover, while those travelling to Town Hall from the flyover must use the other loop. To enter Sungam Road, commuters must use the ramp connecting the loop near the bus stand. The ramp ends near Pullukadu. The extension works are expected to be completed within two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cm-inaugurates-drinking-water-supply-scheme/articleshow/80696779.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The first accident took place on the Pilibhit-Basti National Highway (NH-730) near Khag Sarai village under Gajraula police station at 11.30 am where two motorcycles collided head-on, killing three bikers, including the front riders of both bikes and the first pillion rider of one of the two bikes. Both bikes were carrying three people each. Gajraula police station SHO Jai Prakash said the victims were identified as Ravindra Kumar (30) of Kayasthan locality in Puranpur city — who was on his way to Puranpur from Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand along with his two friends — and Vikky (27) and Hassan (8) of Kashi Ram Awas Vikas Colony in Pilibhit city, who were on their way to Pilibhit from Puranpur. They had not received a written complaint in the matter, added the SHO. The second accident took place on Bareilly-Haridwar National Highway (NH-74) near Sardar Nagar village under Jahanabad police station around 3.30 pm, where a truck allegedly hit a motorcycle. As a result of the impact the pillion rider, Alvia (13) of Nawabganj town in Bareilly, fell on the road and was run over by the truck, said police. Rafiuddin of Dhundhri village under Amaria police station was on his way to Nawabganj to drop the girl at her home, said police, adding that Rafiuddin sustained injuries.

The driver was booked under sections 304 A (causing death by rash or negligent act), 427 mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs fifty or over) and 338 (causing grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/two-minors-among-4-killed-in-road-accidents-in-pilibhit/articleshow/80692050.cms||Keshav Agarwal
February 5, 2021||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: CBSE boards to clash with JEE main, students worried||CHENNAI: Thousands of Class XII CBSE students in the biology-maths group are worried their board exam will clash with Joint Entrance Exam (Main) in May. As per the date sheets released by the CBSE, biology exam will be held on May 24, while the final session of JEE (Main) is scheduled to be held from May 24 to 28 when more than five lakh students across the country are set to appear. Students and teachers from Tamil Nadu want the National Testing Agency (NTA) to delay the start of the JEE (Main) final session to avoid a clash. Ebi Manuel, a Class XII biology student and IIT aspirant from the city, said biology is a vast subject and students need to concentrate more on it. “It will affect only the biology-maths group students.” Manuel, who has applied to all four sessions of JEE (Main), said the May session would be his last chance. “I request the NTA to change the schedule for the last session to enable the students to prepare better for the biology exam.” NTA is conducting JEE (Main) from February 23 to 26, March 15 to 18, April 27 to 30 and May 24 to 28. Since engineering admissions in Tamil Nadu are based on board exam marks, students in the state will give more importance to the session conducted after the board exams. The CBSE has also scheduled the computer science board exam on May 29, a day after JEE (Main). Kaushik, another student, said the clash should have been avoided as some students target the main exam after the board exams. Many teachers echo this view. “Students are stressed about the schedule since both the exams are very tough and dates also are clashing,” said Sunitha Shine, a Class XII teacher from the city. Though the exams are conducted in four sessions all the four sessions are important, she added. Trainers said students should be given a provision to change the date of the exam. “Even a single student should not be affected due to the scheduling. In case, a biology student gets an exam on May 24, he or she should be given the option to change the exam date,” said B Pavan Kumar, deputy director (Chennai) of coaching institute FIITJEE. NTA officials said students who have exams on May 24 will not be given the slot on that day. “The roll numbers of CBSE students will be collected by May. Biology students will get an exam session other than May 24 so there won't be a clash,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cbse-boards-to-clash-with-jee-main-students-worried/articleshow/80694991.cms||A Ragu Raman
February 5, 2021||Coimbatore||Cops held for receiving bribe||Coimbatore: Sleuths of the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) on Thursday arrested a police sub-inspector and a constable for accepting Rs 6,000 from a man for not booking a case of drunk driving. The arrested people were identified as A Maruthaiah Pandi, 54, and S Sakthivel, a constable attached to the traffic police station at Sulur. The cops had intercepted Murugan, a wall painter and a native of Dharmapuri, when he was returning to Kalapatti on a motorcycle on January 31. As Murugan was drunk, they seized the motorcycle and demanded Rs 12,000 for not registering a case. When Murugan expressed inability to pay the bribe, the cops agreed to let him go if he pays 6,000. Murugan informed DVAC DSP T H Ganesh, who laid a trap. Preliminary inquiry revealed that the SI did not register a case, but kept the motorcycle in a private parking facility. On Thursday afternoon, when Murugan handed over currency notes laced with chemical powder to Pandi and Sakthivel, DVAC sleuths in plainclothes caught them read-handed. They were booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cops-held-for-receiving-bribe/articleshow/80696785.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: As frontline workers queue up for Covid vaccination, turnout crosses 50% again||NEW DELHI: The turnout for Covid vaccination slightly improved on Thursday when the drive included frontline workers like Delhi Police and civil defence personnel, and sanitation workers in addition to healthcare workers. After Wednesday’s 40.2% turnout, the count reached 51.8% on Thursday, with 9,494 people out of the 18,300 expected reaching 183 vaccination centres in government and private hospitals to get the jab. Only 13 reported adverse events. The exact number of frontline workers turning up for the shot was not available, but officials said many of them had come. “Frontline workers were permitted from Thursday on a pilot basis at some select vaccination booths. From Saturday, their vaccination will start on a full-scale,” said an official. The capital has around 6 lakh frontline workers, who have played a crucial role in the Covid fight. Out of them, around 3.5 lakh have registered for the shot. Close to 90,000 healthcare workers have been vaccinated so far. As compared to the turnout, the number of adverse events was small, said a source. Central district reported five adverse events, followed by Shahdara and West districts that recorded two cases each. New Delhi, North East, North West and South West districts did not report even a single adverse event. The number of adverse events is declining and the confidence among healthcare workers is fast growing, said an official. “The vaccine hesitancy is decreasing, and the beneficiaries are now more confident about the efficacy of the vaccine,” he said. The overall turnout was only 53% on the first day and touched 91.5% around a week ago before starting to decline, and has remained less than expected for the past two days. The number of vaccination centres has increased from 106 to 183 and many of the new centres are reporting far low turnout as compared to the old centres. According to officials, instructions have been issued to all those managing the vaccination drive to ensure higher turnout. A large number of the staff members at the hospitals where the vaccination started on the first day — 86 centres — have been vaccinated. The turnout has not touched even 85% since the government has increased the number of centres to 106. Each centre is supposed to inoculate 100 healthcare workers every day. As part of the upscaling plan, the government slowly wants to add more centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-frontline-workers-queue-up-for-c-vax-turnout-crosses-50-again/articleshow/80696790.cms||AlokKNMishra
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC pulls up cop for callously not tracing minor in Pocso case||MUMBAI: In a strongly worded order, reprimanding an investigating officer in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act case for “casually” saying she was unaware about the whereabouts of a 14-year-old sexual assault survivor, Bombay high court has said the law prescribes cops take care of the victim and witnesses in a trial. “This callous and cavalier conduct and behaviour of the investigating officer is deprecated. The conduct of the investigating officer is reprehensible and cannot be countenanced. There is no reason for the investigating officer to be too casual in not keeping a record of the whereabouts of the prosecutrix and particularly under the special statute, ie the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso Act),” the court said. It added the officer was also oblivious to the enactment promulgated by the state legislature— Maharashtra Witness Protection and Security Act. It said conviction cannot be sought by adopting shortcuts in law. In an application made through advocate Rahul Arote, the child’s 62-year-old grandfather, the accused in the case, moved high court against the trial court’s order rejecting his plea to call her back, affording an opportunity to his lawyer to cross-examine her. The accused said his lawyer was unable to attend the court and cross-examine her on December 22, 2020. The court had advanced the hearing then as she had been traced after two years. In the lawyer’s absence, the trial court had directed the accused to cross-examine her. On January 27, HC told the prosecution to produce the girl before the trial court for her cross-examination. The court reasoned the rights of an accused stand forfeited by not affording him a reasonable opportunity to defend himself. The following day, though, on the court’s directions when the public prosecutor inquired with the investigating officer in open court, she said whenever the teenager is traced, she will be produced before the trial court. “Accused persons after being released on bail are absconding or not traceable is a common phenomenon. However, a victim in the crime after being searched, produced before the court on an earlier occasion, is not traceable or her whereabouts are not known to the investigating officer speaks volumes,” the high court said. It has directed the DGP to look into the matter and give directions to the officer to find the child and bring her to court. “If the present investigating officer is not interested in tracing out the prosecutrix, then the director general of police may depute any other responsible senior police officer for the said task and submit the compliance report to this court on or before the next date,” the court said. HC directed the principal secretary, state law and judiciary department, to look into the conduct of the public prosecutor after it found she had informed the defence lawyer about the advanced date of deposition in the “most casual manner” via phone messages.

February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Close shave for 23 students as fire breaks out in school||HYDERABAD: Twenty-three students of class 9 and class 10 escaped unhurt, when a fire broke in a school located in Gowlipura in Old City on Thursday. The fire broke out at Srinivasa High School at around 11 am. Though injuries were not reported, the ground floor was gutted and due to the fire, furniture and records were burnt. Before the two-storey building caught fire, some wires were burnt due to short circuit. There was power fluctuation two to three times before the building caught fire. After voltage fluctuations, sparks were noticed by staffers working in the school. “When wires in ground floor caught fire, the staff members rushed to the classes and ensured children moved out of the building. If there were no power fluctuations and wires were not burnt, staffers would have not been alerted and there were chances of causalities or injuries being reported,” said an official from police department. “Children were assisted by staff while moving out of the building,” he added. The fire first broke in a store room located in the ground floor of the building and later started spreading to other rooms. Soon after the fire broke out, the main switch was turned off. Locals rushed to the spot and started dousing the fire by pouring water using buckets before firefighters reached the spot. The school is surrounded by residential buildings. “We pressed into service 10 staff members and two vehicles. Within 20 minutes, they were able to douse the fire,” said V Papaiah, regional fire officer — central region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/close-shave-for-23-students-as-fire-breaks-out-in-school/articleshow/80695012.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Kochi||Lack of road connectivity makes life miserable here||Kochi: Water and fishing are part and parcel of their life. But the same make life of residents in ward number 13 of Edavanakkad panchayat miserable thanks to the apathy on the part of authorities and those who run prawn farms in acres of waterbodies. Absence of bunds to protect the land situated close to the waterbodies where shrimps, pearl spot and other fish are reared by private parties, affect families who live near Thoppilakettu and Kannuvilakettu — two prawn farming areas. When the water level rises, it enters courtyards and houses. Lack of road connectivity makes the situation worse. Wading through the waterlogged and dilapidated path leading to his house, 72-year-old Narayanan said he and his family often had to undergo harrowing experiences due to water entering their small house. “The illegal reclamation of ponds and streams near our house was started in 2015. Waterlogging has become a common issue since then. Besides, those who run the prawn farms refuse to construct bunds. Water from the prawn farms enters our courtyard every day,” he says. His wife laments about the shortage of drinking water even though there is water connection. A road, the construction of which remains incomplete, is the dream of hundreds of residents who faced the wrath of the tsunami in 2004. The road, starting from Saidu Muhammad Road, is meant to connect to the bridge at Kannuvilakettu. Though the Rs 64 lakh-worth road work was inaugurated by Vypeen MLA S Sarma in 2016 and metals laid for a few meters, the work was dropped midway. Now the rest of the path, through which people walked freely earlier, is filled with vegetation. “Now the residents have to take a longer route, though motorable, to reach the main road,” said Sasi, another resident in the ward. Sheela, another resident, who lives a few meters away from the dilapidated sea wall, complains about lack of political will to complete the road construction. “We handed over two cents for the road,” said Sheela. While ward member Rani Ramesh said the road work was started using the MLA fund. “Only formation, involving filling metals and constructing side walls, was carried out with the available amount. Huge amount is needed for doing formation in rest of the length and the panchayat cannot afford it,” said Ramesh. Sindhu, another resident, said every time she has to spent money for autorickshaw while returning home via coastal road after buying rice from ration shop for Rs 1 per kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lack-of-road-connectivity-makes-life-miserable-here/articleshow/80693559.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Coimbatore||96-year-old Urdu school upgraded||Udhagamandalam: A 96-year-old Urdu medium elementary school in Ooty, which was upgraded to a middle school, was inaugurated by Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya on Thursday. The Gandhi Nagar Municipal Urdu medium Elementary School at Kandal, the only one of its kind in the district, was started on January 1, 1925 with 23 students. “Till the academic year 2016-17, the school maintained more or less the same strength. The number of students increased after Mohamed Ameen took over as the headmaster in 2017,” said chief education officer Nazarudeen. “As many as 14 new students jointed Class VI after upgradation. There are 154 students now.” There was a need to upgrade the school as Muslim population is more in Kandal area, said Divya. “The Ooty municipality facilitated the school with two more classrooms.” Presently, only two elementary grade teachers are serving in the school, besides five teachers appointed by the PTA. “The government has sanctioned two BT teachers and a middle school headmaster post. It is the only school in the Nilgiris teaching subjects in Urdu medium. The students are also taught Tamil and English,” Nazarudeen added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/96-year-old-urdu-school-upgraded/articleshow/80696793.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt med college doctors protest wearing PPE kits||Thiruvananthapuram: The government medical college doctors staged a protest before secretariat on Thursday wearing PPE kits demanding the immediate rectification of the anomalies in the pay revision. The protest was organized as part of the ongoing strike called by the doctors since January 29. The Kerala Government Postgraduate Medical Teachers Association (KGPMTA) has also decided to intensify the agitation in the coming days if the government is not considering their demands favourably. After implementing the pay revision in 2006, the government revised the pay structure of the doctors in 2020. However, this pay revision has come with a lot of anomalies. After the pay revision, the salary of the entry cadre (assistant professor) in general surgery, medicine, cardiology and neuro surgery has come down to Rs 68,900 from Rs 79,900, said Dr Ajith Prasad J S, state president of KGPMTA. The patient care allowance and non-practising allowance have been brought down to 12% and 20% from 15% and 25%. If the tenure for getting the promotion to associate professor post from the assistant professor post is four years as per the MCI guidelines, now after the pay revision this has been increased to eight years, said Dr Ajith Prasad. “When the state government has cleared all the arrears for all the faculty members in the government arts and science colleges, they have not given any promise on the arrears for the medical college teachers. The pay revision was implemented with a retrospective effect of January 1, 2016,” said Dr Jeji G, state secretary of KGPMTA. Meanwhile, the Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association has decided to conduct a 24-hour fast in the government medical college hospitals on Friday. “The government is turning a blind eye towards the agitation called by the doctors and no steps are being taken to fulfil our demands. Hence we have decided to intensify our agitation,” said Dr S Binoy, state president of KGMCTA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-med-college-doctors-protest-wearing-ppe-kits/articleshow/80693560.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Kozhikode||MYL denies charges of fund diversion||Kozhikode: Muslim Youth League (MYL) national leaders have denied the allegation that the fund collected to help the victims of Kathua and Unnao sexual violence was diverted for other purposes. Addressing a news conference here on Thursday, MYL national general secretary C K Subair said the organization had collected only Rs 39,33,697 and not Rs 1 crore as alleged by the former national committee member Yusuf Padanilam. Among this, Rs 5 lakh was given to the father of Kathua victim and Rs 5 lakh to the mother of Unnao victim. Money was also given to others related to the cases and the remaining Rs 14,73,687 are with Mavoor Road branch of the Punjab National Bank, Subair said. The person who raised the allegation was a candidate in the elections to the local bodies with the LDF support. “The allegation that Rs 15 lakh from the fund was given to MYL state general secretary P K Firos is a lie. The fund was collected by the national committee ,” Subair said. Firos’s name was dragged into the controversy because of minister K T Jaleel’s grudge towards him. “Jaleel had stated that a case should be registered based on the allegation. We welcome any investigation, but Jaleel should be ready to tender an apology if the charges are proved wrong,” he said. MYL national vice-president Panakkad Mueen Ali Shihab Thangal, who also raised the allegation, was also present at the news conference. Ali said he is satisfied with the explanation over the fund. Meanwhile, Jaleel has demanded that the enforcement directorate should conduct a probe into the MYL fund collection as money had come from the Gulf countries too. He said the financial growth of some of the MYL leaders also should be probed. It is learnt that P K Kunhalikutty and leaders of the MSF and MYL had sorted out things among themselves, but it is not an issue that can be easily ended, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/myl-denies-charges-of-fund-diversion/articleshow/80693556.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Adverse events in less than 0.3% cases, mostly mild||NEW DELHI: Less than 0.25% of the healthcare workers vaccinated in Delhi have developed adverse events. According to senior health officials, the adverse events reported so far are mostly mild, for example local pain at injection site and febrile illness. There have been no deaths and serious adverse events are rare, officials added. Delhi has already vaccinated more than 90,000 healthcare workers. On Thursday, 9,494 healthcare workers got vaccinated against Covid-19. Of this, data shows, 13 (0.13%) reported adverse events. Earlier on February 3, February 2 and February 1, Delhi recorded 17, 17 and 15 adverse events post-vaccination, respectively. Maximum 51 (1.18% of the total vaccination) adverse events post-vaccination were reported on January 16, the first day of the mass immunisation programme against Covid-19. “Initially, people were apprehensive about the safety of the vaccine. The acceptance was low. People who received the vaccine reported about minor side-effects too, for example pain at the site of injection. But now, the beneficiaries don’t panic and only those people who develop mild to severe symptoms report to us,” said a senior health official. He added that the number of persons requiring hospitalisation post-vaccination has been low. Delhi is using two types of vaccines—Covaxin, which has been developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research, and Covishield that has been developed by Oxford/Astrazeneca in collaboration with Serum Institute of India. All state-run hospitals and private hospitals are giving Covishield while the central government-run hospitals are administering Covaxin. “Adverse events do occur but they are rare. The vaccines approved for emergency use are safe and people should embrace them to end this pandemic,” said an official in Delhi government. Till date, 10,871 people have died due to Covid-19 in Delhi. Overall in India, more than 1.54 lakh people have died due to the viral infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/adverse-events-in-less-than-0-3-cases-mostly-mild/articleshow/80696808.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Vaccination drive for frontliners picks up in Maharashtra; Mumbai off to sluggish start||MUMBAI: The overall vaccination numbers in the state and the city plummeted on Thursday, despite the immunization of frontline workers picking up momentum in some parts of Maharashtra and Mumbai beginning vaccination of frontliners, albeit on a very small scale. On Thursday, the state covered merely 57% and the city 54% of the intended numbers. Some said it was partly because vaccination centres are no longer allowed to register recipients, whose names are missing from Co-Win, on the spot. Frontline vaccinations saw a major uptick in the state a day after they kicked off, but Mumbai saw a small start. As many as 3,925 frontliners took the vaccine in Maharashtra, up from 793 on Wednesday. In Mumbai though, only about 58-odd frontliners took the vaccine. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said they would allow walk-in option to frontline workers from Thursday. Vaccination centres in Mumbai were increased from a dozen to 18 with the number of booths going up to 105. Overall, a total of 34,907 people, including 30,982 healthcare and 3,925 frontline workers, got vaccinated in the state of the intended 61,322. This is despite the number of vaccination centres being pushed up to 593. Around 50% (3,89,540) of healthcare staff are estimated to have been vaccinated so far. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a press conference that vaccination has to pick up pace in certain states. He cited the examples of MP and Rajasthan, where 74% and 67% healthcare workers have been vaccinated. Nationally, he said, 45% of 96.31 lakh registered healthcare workers have been vaccinated till the 19th day of vaccination. In Mumbai, 4,331 recipients took the vaccine on Thursday of the intended 8,064 despite the addition of six new centres. The six new centres started on Thursday were Maa Hospital in Chembur, Kasturba in Chinchpokli, Centenary Hospital in Govandi, Jumbo facility in Dahisar, SK Patil Hospital in Malad East and BARC. AMC Suresh Kakani said the attendance of frontline workers was not impressive. “We had a sort of trial in a few centres, but the response was not good. We will be keeping the option again on Friday to understand the problems,” he said. A civic official said they were sensing some hesitancy from frontline workers, such as those from the department of solid waste management, to get vaccinated. Besides, the technical glitches have been holding back the drive. Dr S R Suryawanshi, nodal officer of Nair Hospital, said policemen from nearby police stations had come to take the vaccine. “The app was slow, but we could manage a few,” he said. Dr Gomare said it was unclear why footfall of health workers has dropped suddenly. “It had gone beyond 7,000 in the past few days,” she said. Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer of the JJ centre, said Co-WIN is no longer allowing registration of health workers whose names are missing from the software. “It has been stopped since the past two days and many doctors had to go back without taking the vaccine,” he said. Several centres across the state have reported that the app was no longer allowing registration of health workers whose names are missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-drive-for-frontliners-picks-up-in-state-city-off-to-sluggish-start/articleshow/80695100.cms||Sumitra Debroy

February 5, 2021||Coimbatore||Leopard kills calf at Nellithurai||Coimbatore: Days after a leopard was caught from Madukkarai, another one is on the prowl at Sundapatti beat of Nellithurai reserve forest, creating panic. The leopard entered a farm land, 50 metres away from the reserve forest at Sundapatti beat on Wednesday night, and attacked a one- year-old calf owned by Rukmani. As villagers rushed to the place, the big cat abandoned the calf and escaped to the reserve forest. The injured calf could not be saved. Forest department officials deployed anti-poaching watchers in the area. “We have installed three camera traps in and around the farmland to monitor its movement. With the help of village panchayat and revenue department officials, the villagers were warned of the movement of leopard,” Mettupalayam forest range officer Palanirajan said. “Villagers are advised not to come out of their houses at night. They should keep their cattle in closed sheds to protect them from leopards. They have been asked to alert the forest department if they notice wild animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/leopard-kills-calf-at-nellithurai/articleshow/80696797.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Now, pay up tax on vacant land||Hyderabad: Property owners who own open plots in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits may have to cough up vacant land tax (VLT) from now on. To fill its coffers, GHMC has decided to collect VLT from plot owners every year. Of over three lakh properties liable for VLT, 40% have paid tax. VLT is 0.5% of the property value at the time of registration. “With enlisting of properties in Dharani, people coming forward to regularise their plots under Layout Regularisation Scheme (LRS), the civic body now has all details, it is easy to approach property owners. We are planning to collect VLT,” a GHMC official said. Though there was a provision to collect VLT, the civic body did not focus on it much. “In several cases, people who buy plots live in other parts of the city, while in some cases they live in other states too. As phone numbers of property owners were also not available in the records, there was delay in VLT collections,” a GHMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-pay-up-tax-on-vacant-land/articleshow/80695072.cms||Nabinder Bommala
February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||IIIT-H researchers design AI video editing solution||HYDERABAD: Researchers at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIITH), who have been working on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in video editing, have designed a complete end-to-end framework for video editing which can make video recording and editing cost-effective. Using AI, the system can automatically generate shots from various angles from single video input and can mimic an expert editor by selecting the shot that most vividly narrates the plot at each given instance. “It is a very dark time for theatre and other live performances. Small-sized companies are being forced to shut down because they can’t invest in heavy camera equipment and transition to live streaming. Our endeavour is to assist such houses and ensure the output is aesthetically top-notch,” said Vineet Gandhi from the CVIT lab, IIIT H, who has led the research. He said that the method adopted by his team is similar to the traditional creation of videos, where first shots are taken and then manually selected or edited to create a flowing storyline. What makes this system even more unique is that it creates cinematic-looking footage, he added. Gandhi said that according to the scientists, while incorporating gaze or eye-tracking data in the selection of shots is a desirable editing technique, relying completely on gaze is not always optimal. “To provide a smooth narrative, the algorithm has also been trained on cinematic principles such as avoiding cuts between overlapping shots, avoiding rapid shot transitions and maintaining a rhythm,” added Gandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-researchers-design-ai-video-editing-solution/articleshow/80695047.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Facing fund crunch, GHMC struggles to pay salaries||HYDERABAD: Hit by fund crunch, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is struggling to even pay salaries. GHMC staff, including top officials and ground-level staff, are yet to receive salary for January. GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar has instructed six zonal commissioners to hold salaries in their respective zones till further instructions. As per civic records, the average expenditure of the corporation per month is Rs 250 crore, which includes salaries, maintenance and payment of bills to contractors. While salaries and maintainanace sum up to Rs 120 crore, on an average, Rs 130 crore is paid to contractors for civic works. GHMC’s major source of income is property tax and building permissions. For the current financial year (2020-21), GHMC plans to generate Rs 800 crore revenue through building permissions, but was able to generate around Rs 482 crore. In the previous year (2019-20) till January, Rs 766 crore was generated through building permissions, however, the town planning wing was able to save over Rs 1,400 crore by issuing transferable development rights (TDR) certificates instead of giving cash compensation to property owners whose land had been acquired. The civic body was hoping to fill its coffers using property tax and generate Rs 1,400 crore, but was able to generate only Rs 1,289.68 crore this financial year (till January). However, the collections crossed previous year’s revenue. In 2019-20 till January, the property tax collections stood at Rs 1,258 crore. To execute infrastructure projects under the strategic road development plan (SRDP), GHMC has availed Rs 2,500 crore loan at 8.65 % interest rate. “The money will be released phase-wise, they will be credited to the agencies depending on the progress of the works,” a GHMC official said. Employee unions said ground-level staff should be paid salaries before higher-ups get their due. “Sanitation workers performed their duties amid Covid-19 too risking their life, many of them are sole bread winners for their family,” Greater Hyderabad Municipal Employees’ Union president U Gopal said. The civic body also did not get any aid from the state government. “For the past two years, the civic body has hardly been getting assistance from state government. In 2017-19, GHMC wrote to the state government seeking Rs 67 crore, but got only Rs 1.3 crore,” a GHMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/facing-fund-crunch-ghmc-struggles-to-pay-salaries/articleshow/80695057.cms||Nabinder Bommala
February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Telangana HC cracks down on rogue loan apps, tells cops to spare none||HYDERABAD: Directing the police to see that all unscrupulous loan apps in Google play store are summarily removed, Telangana high court on Thursday ordered a crackdown on firms and people behind it. Providing a legal backup for the ongoing raids of police on the instant loan app operators, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy directed the state government and police chiefs to leave no stone unturned in nabbing the criminals running the loan scam. “Block these rogue loan apps immediately for playing havoc with the lives of innocent people,” the bench said while hearing a public interest plea filed by advocate S Kalyan Dilip. The judges issued notices to the Union home secretary, its cyber security division, state government and DGP, asking them to respond in four weeks. They also called for a report from the DGP on the menace and the progress police have made so far in tackling the issue. The judges asked reports from the police commissioners of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda also. When Dilip brought to the notice of the court the exorbitant rates of interest — ranging from 150% to 450% per week or fortnight — collected by the instant loan app firms coercively from borrowers, the judges said: “We want a report on the situation in the state in general and Hyderabad in particular.” The petitioner said the loan app firms were luring gullible people with instant loans and later burdened them with unacceptable interest rates. ‘Organisers use coercive recovery methods’“Not just this, the organisers and their henchmen plunge into action once they notice defaults and use cruel, coercive recovery methods on the defaulters,” he said. Dilip said since the organisers have access to the phone contact list of the borrowers, they send objectionable messages to friends and kin depicting them as frauds. “Unable to withstand this unprecedented onslaught, some borrowers have killed themselves,” the petitioner told the judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-cracks-down-on-rogue-loan-apps-tells-cops-to-spare-none/articleshow/80697460.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

At present, about 450 tonne of waste is generated daily from the entire Bidhannagar civic body area. “An agency has been engaged to conduct the bio-mining work to remove the waste from Mollar bheri ground, which will take about a year’s time. The waste will be dumped at Dhapa till the government provides us with an alternative dumping site,” said a civic official. Officials said that bio-mining work at the Mollar Bheri site has started to segregate the piled up waste that has remained dumped there for several years and then recycle them. Once the process is completed, the land will be restored to its original condition. Before the inception of the township of Salt Lake, Mollar bheri ground, spread over a 55-acre of land, was under the Salt Lake reclamation and development board. It was towards the end of 2019 that the civic authorities had stopped dumping the waste, collected from the entire civic body areas of Salt Lake and Rajarhat, at Mollar Bheri following the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) order asking them to stop causing environmental damage as a large part of the site fell within the wetland area. Previously, the civic body had been fined by NGT for not complying with its orders. The dumping site was then fenced off and guards were posted and notices were put up, prohibiting disposal of waste at the site. Environment activist, Subhas Datta, who had filed the case against the pollution of the East Kolkata wetlands, said that the accumulated waste water polluting the water bodies should be prevented at the earliest. Datta had earlier submitted a petition in May 2019, alleging that illegal dumping of solid waste by the Bidhannagar civic authorities was happening on Mollar bheri for a long time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bidhannagar-civic-body-to-rid-mollar-bheri-of-waste/articleshow/80695128.cms||Suman Chakraborti

February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: 4 booked for land registration fraud||HYDERABAD: Medipally registered a cheating case against four persons for allegedly resorting to double registration of a 150-square yard plot in Narapally. Two days ago, Buchireddy, a businessman from Narapally, lodged a complaint with the Medipally police alleging that A Srinivas, a private employee, in collusion with three others has resorted to fraudulent registration of his plot in the name of Srinivas. Buchireddy told police that in 2000 he had purchased 150 square yard plot in Narapally from Yadgiri. Buchireddy built a boundary wall around the plot. Recently, A Srinivas and his associates met Buchireddy and informed him that Yadgiri had registered the plot in Srinivas’ name, Medipally inspector B Anji Reddy said. The complainant also alleged that Srinivas, in collusion with Yadgiri and two witnesses, including Srinivas’ brother Narasimha, had executed the fraud. “Narasimha, who is the brother-in-law of Narapally councillor, signed as a witness on the registration forms. We have registered a case under Sections 420 and 406 of the IPC against four persons, including Yadgiri, Srinivas and Naarasimha,” the inspector said. On Thursday, Medipally police issued a notice to the accused to record their statements. “Based on the evidence, if required, we will arrest the offenders,” the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-booked-for-land-registration-fraud/articleshow/80695107.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Challan fury: Cops lose power as avenging electrician cuts supply||HYDERABAD: Revenge, as they say, is best served cold. To avenge a challan, a power department employee did just that. He returned the favour to the unsuspecting police department by cutting off electricity from a traffic signal and two city police stations. It all started on Tuesday evening, when Jeedimetla traffic police SI N Ramesh stopped a teenager on a two-wheeler and issued a challan. The boy called A Ramesh (30), an electrician with Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Ltd (TSSPDCL), who had sent him to get some equipment. “Ramesh was carrying out repairs at a company where the teenager was employed,” Jeedimetla inspector K Balaraj said. Ramesh immediately intervened and even went to the spot to get the challan revoked as he had sent the teenager for work. But the SI told him that challan had already been issued. Upset that police did not listen to him, Ramesh turned off power to a traffic signal in Shapurnagar, forcing cops to regulate the vehicle flow at a busy junction. Power went off at same time“Ramesh was not satisfied with turning off the power supply to the traffic signal. He went ahead and turned off the power supply to Jeedimetla law and order and traffic police stations,” the inspector continued. The clueless cops waited as the power went off simultaneously at both police stations at around 6.30 pm. “We later came to know about Ramesh’s argument with the traffic SI. We immediately contacted TSSPDCL officials and after an hour, power supply was restored with the intervention of senior officials,” said Balaraj. Based on a complaint given by the traffic SI, a case was registered against Ramesh under section 353 (for obstructing public servant). But with Ramesh on the run on Wednesday, it turned out to be another cat and mouse game before the electrician was finally arrested and sent to judicial remand on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/challan-fury-cops-lose-power-as-avenging-electrician-cuts-supply/articleshow/80697483.cms||Mahesh Buddi
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Hybrid teaching may be difficult: College principals||MUMBAI: While the state has decided to open college campuses from February 15 after a 10-month break, principals raised concerns over the proposed format. Besides the key issue of commuting due to restricted train timings, some feel in the first phase, priority should be given only to students who have practicals or for subjects where online teaching is not very effective. Many feel theory lectures can continue in the online format, especially in metros like Mumbai. Others are also worried that following the SOPs (standard operating procedures) prescribed by the University Grants Commission will put a strain on infrastructure and resources. The state has permitted re-opening of campuses with 50% attendance on rotation basis. A principal pointed out that such hybrid teaching will not be effective in the absence of technical equipment. “Will teachers live-stream the same lectures or will they teach two sets of students on alternate days? Just using the laptop camera will not be sufficient. How will the teachers’ workload be distributed?” asked the principal, adding universities need to seek clarification on all these points. Another principal said he would be meeting his teaching staff soon to finalise the roadmap. “We would prefer to get students only for practicals as of now, but we will wait for the university’s directive,” said the principal. A principal said commerce classes usually have 120 students per division. Even if 50% are called, not all may want to voluntarily come with attendance norm being relaxed in the state. “While opening colleges in Mumbai is challenging, it can be done with proper planning. Lectures such as accountancy can be taught offline. Online teaching is not very effective,” he added. Colleges will have to spend more to follow all the safety and hygiene guidelines, said a principal. “In a year that has seen fee collection drop to less than 50%, government should be setting aside some grants for colleges for non-salary expenses,” he added. A Mumbai University official said they will be writing to district officials under their jurisdiction seeking their nod to reopen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/college-principals-hybrid-teaching-may-be-difficult/articleshow/80695208.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Amid low turnout, North Delhi Municipal Corporation offers more flexibility||NEW DELHI: Witnessing low turnout for vaccination drive against Covid-19, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to allow more flexibility to beneficiaries in choosing the centre for getting the shot. The data from four vaccination centres under the civic body shows that instead of 400 selected people who were supposed to get inoculated on Thursday, only 124 people took the vaccine, which translates to just 31% turnout. Only 15 people took the shot in Girdhari Lal Maternity Hospital, 34 in Kasturba Hospital, 35 in Hindu Rao Hospital and 40 people took the vaccine in Balak Ram Hospital. So far, 438 people have been vaccinated in these four units. North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that he visited Balak Ram Hospital on Thursday to oversee the vaccination drive. “In order to increase the numbers and facilitate more people, we have decided that anyone who has registered himself/herself on the database application can come to our centres and take the shot. Some people were facing problems as their vaccination centre was away from their home or workplace, so we have decided to make the overall process more convenient,” he said. The mayor further said that department heads and senior doctors were being encouraged to take the shot first to boost confidence among junior staff members. “In the next phase when representatives are allowed to take the shot, I will be the first one to volunteer to take it. The vaccine has been cleared by the central government and regulators after taking all due considerations and it is absolutely safe,” he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Girdharilal Hospital had witnessed just 13 beneficiaries getting vaccinated and Kasturba Hospital 34. A total of 185 people had received the vaccine on Tuesday, while the number dipped to 124 on Thursday. A senior municipal official said that some hesitancy was still being witnessed among healthcare workers. The mayor thanked doctors, nurses and paramedical staff of the corporation for their active participation in the vaccination drive. He said that the civic body was following all the guidelines issued by the Union health ministry for the Covid-19 vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amid-low-turnout-north-corpn-offers-more-flexibility/articleshow/80696846.cms||Paras Singh
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nirav Modi’s sister, her hubby seek cancellation of warrants||MUMBAI: Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi’s Belgium-based sister Purvi Mehta and her husband Maiank Mehta have moved the special Prevention of Money Laundering (Act) court for cancellation of non-bailable warrants against them. The court has directed Enforcement Directorate (ED) to file its replies and the matter will be heard on February 11. Last month, the court permitted them to become approvers and depose as prosecution witnesses against Nirav Modi in the money-laundering cases filed by ED. The court granted the couple pardon while allowing their applications to be declared approvers. The court then held their pleas were allowed on the condition of “making full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within (their) knowledge, relative to the offence and every other person concerned”. “The applicant-accused shall appear in court by returning to India, for which the complainant-prosecution shall facilitate the approach of accused at earliest, and shall take suitable steps accordingly,” the court said. Nirav is prime accused in Punjab National Bank scam. Purvi was made an accused in the money-laundering case filed by ED. The court issued non-bailable warrants against the couple in 2018. Interpol issued a red corner notice against Purvi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/niravs-sis-her-hubby-seek-cancellation-of-warrants/articleshow/80696897.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai to mark Frontier Gandhi’s birth anniversary tomorrow||MUMBAI: Perhaps no other Muslim freedom fighter championed the cause of unity like the “Frontier Gandhi” Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (1890-1988) did. It is thus apt that a group of peaceniks led by Sarhadi Gandhi Memorial Society in the city will celebrate Ghaffar Khan’s 131st birth anniversary on February 6 at Y B Chavan Centre to uphold peace and unity. The city also recalls its bond with the tallest leader of the Pakhtuns or Pashtun tribesmen of the North West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) in Pakistan. “Ghaffar Khan not only symbolises Hindu-Muslim unity but also friendship between India and Pakistan. He can be a binding force for the entire South Asia from Khorasan (Afghanistan) to Arakan (Myanmar),” said writer and peace activist Sudheendra Kulkarni. Kulkarni, as a journalist, had covered the centenary celebrations of the Indian National Congress in 1985 in the city where Ghaffar Khan had been invited. “He spent more time in jail and exile than Nelson Mandela. And the Haryana government has changed the name of a hospital named after him. We must remember this great patriot,” said Sarhadi Gandhi Memorial Society’s chairman Advocate Jalaluddin. One of the most trusted colleagues of Mahatma Gandhi, Ghaffar Khan won the moniker “Frontier Gandhi” for his non-violent resistance through the voluntary organisation Khudai Khidmatgar (Servants of God). He loved his fellow Pashtuns of Mumbai.“We took pride in his sacrifice for Indian freedom,” said Yaqoob Khan, general secretary of Anjuman-I-Pakhtun Trust, the organisation which works for the welfare of Pakhtuns here.  Yaqoob Khan was a young boy when he first saw Ghaffar Khan in Mumbai in 1969 as the latter had come to India to attend the birth centenary of Gandhi. Activist M A Khalid had accompanied underworld don and Pakhtun leader Karim Lala to see Ghaffar Khan at a south Mumbai hospital in the late 1980s. “He was pleased to meet fellow Pakhtuns and gave us the dry fruits he had brought from Peshawar. His admirers gave him nankhatai, a Mumbai sweet,” recalled Khalid. Recorded messages of Ghaffar Khan’s grandson Asfandyar Wali Khan and Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson Rajmohan Gandhi will be played at the venue as part of the tribute to the great patriot on his birth anniversary, said activist Jatin Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-to-mark-frontier-gandhis-birth-anniversary-tomorrow/articleshow/80695155.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
February 5, 2021||Kolkata||Xavier’s to start school of philosophy||Kolkata: As a part of Jesuit value education and commitment to interfaith studies, St Xavier’s University, Kolkata, is going to start a School of Philosophy & Religion. The religious and laity will be able to study in the school that will offer both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. “The department will offer specializations in Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. We shall offer more religion studies later. Today religion plays a crucial role in order to build up the spiritual and ethical character of society. It is important that people understand both religion and philosophy,” said the vice-chancellor, Fr. Felix Raj. The VC added that the university had no immediate plans to transition from online to offline mode of teaching. “I don’t want to disrupt the rhythm of the students. Hence, we will only begin the on-campus classes from the new academic session starting from July,” said Fr. Felix Raj. St Xavier’s University is planning to hold the second convocation on February 6 at the Rajarhat-New Town campus. This year 451 students will be graduating and they will receive their degrees in the convocation. “We have decided to conduct the convocation in a blended mode where the event will be live-streamed. Only the 79 award winners will be allowed to be present in-person. The first 10 rank holders from each subject have been invited to attend it,” said Fr. Felix Raj. At the event, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar will preside over the ceremony. The Guest-of-Honour is Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay, director, Indian Statistical Institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/xaviers-to-start-school-of-philosophy/articleshow/80695148.cms||Somdatta Basu
February 5, 2021||Ludhiana||Schools gear up for Classes X and XII board exams||Ludhiana: City schools have geared up for making preparations for the board exams for Classes X and XII after the CBSE has released the datesheet for the same. As per the CBSE datesheet, the board exams for both classes will begin on May 4. The board exams for Class X will conclude on June 7, while the last exam for Class XII is on June 10. Paramjit Kaur, CBSE city coordinator, said, “Usually, the practical exams are conducted in January and written exams begin in February and conclude in March. However, the exams were delayed this session due to the coronavirus pandemic. The datesheet has been released nearly three months before the start of the board examinations, so that students can make their study plan and overcome problems faced during the pandemic. Sufficient time has been given between the main subject exams of both Classes X and XII. This will reduce the stress of students and help them in making better preparations for the exams.” Anila Singla, physics teacher at BCM Arya School, said, “We are taking screening tests in two parts and from March and April, students will have pre-boards. Therefore, students need to allot time for subject-wise revision, make a schedule from now onwards. For this, allocate time separately for revising the syllabus of each subject. For example, they can target chapter-wise revision of a few subjects every day or one subject each day. Students will need to make a revision schedule and try to stick to it.” Gunwant Kaur, principal of Guru Nanak International School, Model Town, said, “The CBSE has given ample time to revise. Those students who are appearing in pre-boards and revision tests should know about their mistakes and work on them so that they do not repeat these in the final exams. Some students find chapters difficult and they keep on postponing revising these and for this they should prioritise these accordingly. As 30% of the syllabus is deleted, so students should know their syllabus and revise important topics.” “Take a good look at the syllabus of each subject. Students should filter and focus on revising important topics that they feel will be asked in the exams. Students should devote extra time preparing for important topics which have more weightage of marks, so that they can increase their chances of securing maximum marks,” adds Gunwant. She further says that the students are undergoing stress due to Covid and exams. “They also need to work on mental health too. To be stress free, students should have positive thinking and some physical activity on a daily basis.” Principal of Green Grove School Suzi George said, “Around 99% of our students are attending classes. They had a lot of time for self-study during the lockdown, but now taking things seriously they would have to be regular with their studies.” She added that, “Studying for long hours with focus is definitely productive, but students deserve breaks too or they can physical and mentally exhaust themselves easily. Taking a nap is the best for getting energised and refreshing the mind. Or if students don’t want to sleep, they can take a walk around the house or go to the park to let nature re-energise you.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/schools-gear-up-for-classes-x-and-xii-board-exams/articleshow/80693616.cms||Mehak Jain
February 5, 2021||Aurangabad||Jaleel raises LSD issue, seeks reply from health ministry||Aurangabad: Member of Parliament Imtiaz Jaleel from Aurangabad has sought a direct response on the need to provision timely and sustainable support for patients diagnosed with life-threatening rare diseases like Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs). The response from the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has been sought under Rule 377 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the lower house and is considered to be rare. MPs are allowed raise issues that are considered to be of public importance under this rule with the consent of the Lok Sabha speaker. A notice needs to be given before 10am on the day of the sitting and the text of the notice cannot exceed 250 words. Imtiaz had recently shot a letter to Union Health & Family Welfare minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan raising the issue. He has now sought a response as to why despite several requests and petitions by patients and their families awaiting funding support for treatment, the government has so far shown an indifferent attitude towards supporting them. Imtiaz said, “The current provision of one-time financial support up to Rs15 lakh under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN) by the Union government for treatment of Group 3 patients is highly inadequate and of little use to all those patients, particularly children, whose life-threatening medical condition requires repeated infusion therapy.” “There are increasing cases across several states, including 8 children from Maharashtra alone, who have lost their lives since the earlier National Policy on Treatment for Rare Diseases 2017 has been kept in abeyance, and the new revised policy still awaiting finalisation and notification,” the mater under Rule 377 filed by Imtiaz stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jaleel-raises-lsd-issue-seeks-reply-from-health-ministry/articleshow/80692650.cms||Mohammed Akhef
February 5, 2021||Trichy||From March 1, no collection of waste from Trichy apartments||Trichy: Leaving apartment dwellers in the city high and dry, Trichy Corporation has planned to stop door-to-door waste collection from apartments and gated communities across the city from March 1. Many of the residents who stay in apartments have said that the civic body has already stopped collecting waste since a week ago without any prior intimation. “We have been asking people living in apartments to manage waste for about a year now. Considering them as a bulk waste generator, we have planned to stop collecting waste from March 1,” S Sivasubramanian, commissioner, Trichy Corporation, said. Apartments having more than 5,000sq.m will have to process their waste, the commissioner said. People in K Abishekapuram zone complained that waste collection vehicles had been collecting waste only once in a week for a month now. Meanwhile, for the past five days, the mini trucks that usually collect waste at doorstep were skipping the apartments. On enquiry, the residents’ welfare associations were informed that waste collection would cease for the gated communities. “We were not given any prior notice about stopping the waste collection. With no other alternatives to dispose of waste, people will start littering around and burning of waste will increase in the coming days,” K Nanmaran, secretary of an apartment in Pattabiraman Street, said. With 70 to 200 units in each of the apartment complexes, the residents lack adequate space to store and process waste as instructed by Trichy Corporation. While new apartments have facilities to store waste, old apartments that were built around 20 years ago, have no space to store waste for more than a couple of days. The residents said that waste recycling machines that cost Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh are difficult to procure and maintain. With assembly elections around the corner, they are being pushed to protest against the civic body’s move as elected representatives were not helpful, said residents. There are more than 450 apartments in the city, and stopping waste collection from the gated communities will cut down the city’s waste generation by at least 100 MT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/from-march-1-no-collection-of-waste-from-trichy-apartments/articleshow/80696879.cms||Deepak Karthik

Before plunging the well, the woman left her slippers and scarf on the wall of the well. Sometime later, one villager spotted these slippers and scarf and alerted other villagers and the woman’s family. Soon, some of the villagers dived into the well at around 3.30pm and fished out the body of the three-month-old baby. Later, it took about eight hours for the villagers and the police to find the other bodies. Autopsy was on Thursday morning but the woman’s parents refused to accept the bodies till an offence was registered against her husband and in-laws. The bodies were accepted only after the offence was registered on Thursday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/woman-two-kids-jump-to-death-hubby-kin-booked/articleshow/80692641.cms||---

In all, 30 frontline workers were vaccinated on the first day of vaccination on Wednesday. Both Covishield and Covaxin have been preferred by the candidates. The vaccination which commenced at five centres in Trichy on January 16 is available in 15 centres including MGMGH, GHs, upgraded UPHCs and two private hospitals – Kauvery medical centre and Apollo hospitals. MGMGH topped the list by vaccinating 2,453 health workers including 1,934 private staff and 519 government health centre staff. While several centres had numbers in single or two digits, some centres like UPHCs at Navalpattu, Kattur, Theppakulam and Pullambadi were yet to start its count. MGMGH dean Dr Vanitha said they expected more nurses to come forward to take the vaccination in the coming days. In Nagappattinam, district collector Praveen P Nair took the vaccination at the government hospital in Nagapattinam. The vaccination got under way at 12 centres in the coastal district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/more-collectors-take-jab-as-numbers-inch-forward/articleshow/80696864.cms||Gokul Rajendran
February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Salary cuts, fines on agencies help GHMC improve roads||HYDERABAD: The city roads are looking a tad better and commuters are enjoying a smoother ride. However, this improvement has been seen only after private agencies were handed over the maintenance of main roads, clauses were included in the contract allowing penalisation of the agencies and officials were warned about a possible salary deduction. Not just this, GHMC zonal commissioners (ZCs), superintending engineers (SEs) and executive engineers (EEs) were warned of severe action if roads become unfit for commute. “If a pothole is seen after three days on any of the Comprehensive Road Maintenance Programme (CRMP) roads, action will be taken against the EE/SE/ZC concerned and a penal amount will be recovered from their salaries,” read an order issued by GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar. A tour around the city has revealed that several main roads are in good shape. But many loopholes were spotted too. Waterlogging at some streches, potholes, eroded bitumen layers and zebra crossing running into the central median were noticed. Potholes were spotted on the main road opposite mini Charminar near Hitex exhibition centre. At multiple places on the stretch connecting Madhapur (from metro station) to Jubilee Hills checkpost, the main road was damaged. Zebra crossing painted by CRMP agencies on Liberty Road near GHMC head office was running into the central median, while the paint got erased. Sheikpet main road going towards Jubilee Hills is another example where the road was damaged. Under CRMP, 401 stretches covering 709 km of main roads have been handed over to private agencies for a period of five years at a cost of Rs 1,827 crore. In case the pothole is not repaired within a stipulated time, the agencies will be penalised, a GHMC official said. Officials said that agencies are attending to the issues within the stipulated time. “On the stretch connecting Madhapur to Jubilee Hills, a new road has not been laid by CRMP agencies and the old road was damaged due to a sewage issue. We have already informed the agencies to recarpet the stretch,” said Vijay Kuamar, GHMC EE of Jubilee Hills circle. Meanwhile, civic activists and commuters said the officials must ensure that the taxes they pay do not go waste. “The zebra crossing closer to GHMC head office is an example of lackadaisical approach of contractors and lack of monitoring by GHMC officials. Taxpayers’ money should not be wasted,” said Harish Daga, an activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/salary-cuts-fines-on-agencies-help-ghmc-improve-roads/articleshow/80695184.cms||Nabinder Bommala
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Walk in the park with surround sound||NEW DELHI: If listening to a musical performance or poetry reading in the midst of lush greenery with the Yamuna quietly flowing by while you dig into some delicacies is your idea of a day well-spent, Delhi Development Authority has some very good news for you. From the Yamuna riverfront to Hauz Khas Park, Swarn Jayanti Park in Rohini and small neighbourhood parks, green areas maintained by DDA are spread across nearly 16,000 acres. The agency now wants Delhiites to engage more with the city’s green spaces by creating dedicated art and culture hubs in them. TimesViewDelhi parks have played host to music soirees and food festivals in the past too. However, turning them into cultural hubs can elevate them to Parks 2.0. The city needs more art and culture in open-air, public spaces. Conversely, organisers should be made responsible for any damage to the garden during such events.Beginning with some of the bigger and more vibrant spaces, DDA has come up with a rather staid-sounding policy for booking of DDA parks and put it in the public domain for suggestions before finalising it. Certain parks would be made available for entertainment, performances and other cultural and art-oriented events, while following terms and conditions laid down in the policy. To begin with, 20 parks have been earmarked. While most of these large district parks have open areas delineated for the purpose, some also boast of specific facilities, like amphitheatres, picnic huts and boat clubs. Apart from a three-acre site at the Yamuna riverfront, where a rejuvenation project named “Asita” is being carried out, the chosen green spaces include Millennium Park next to Ring Road, Sanjay Lake in Mayur Vihar, Coronation Park in Burari, Astha Kunj near Nehru Place, Hauz Khas Park, Rohini’s Swarna Jayanti Park and district parks in Dwarka, Hari Nagar and Saket. Smaller green spaces like Silver Oak Park in Defence Colony and Vasant Udyan at Vasant Vihar are also a part of the list. The areas range between one and three acres. Nine parks have amphitheatres with the one at Astha Kunj having the largest seating capacity of 750. Events can be organised to promote cultural activities, including musical performances, stand-up comedy, play and theatre, talks, poetry reading, documentary screening, language festivals, art competitions and shows, health-oriented events, exhibitions, etc. A privately organised get-together or a picnic, where entry would be through invitation, would be allowed too. “The vision behind this policy is better utilisation of green areas and more engagement of Delhiites with open, green spaces. Many parks have nice amphitheatres that are seldom used,” said a DDA official. The official added that they had also received requests on earlier occasions from people who wanted space for exhibitions and other events, but it couldn’t be carried out properly. “That is why we planned to make the policy and also invite the public’s suggestions. This will provide an opportunity to many budding artists who don’t have resources to book other locations. The amphitheatres can be used at nominal charges. However, the policy strictly prohibits political functions and marriage ceremonies,” he said. “Earning revenue is not DDA’s aim, but fees and security deposits will be charged so that people use the facilities responsibly. We want people to feel a sense of ownership towards these green spaces,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/walk-in-the-park-with-surround-sound/articleshow/80696907.cms||Sidharatha Roy
February 5, 2021||Jaipur||Warehouse on agri plots will not have to pay external development charges||Jaipur: The urban development and housing (UDH) department has decided not to levy external development and sewerage charges on warehouses developed on agriculture plots.The orders were released after receiving a nod from UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal. An official said, “To promote the warehousing industry, the decision has been taken. However, in future, if sewerage is laid for other establishments in the vicinity of the warehouses, then charges will be imposed.” The UDH department has also made amendments in the existing Rajasthan Municipalities (Disposal of Urban Land) Rules, 1974 to promote investments in urban areas and strengthen the financial condition of local bodies in the state.As per the new rules, owners can deposit land conversion fee in one year instead of six months. Earlier, if the amount was not deposited for six months, the process of land conversion was automatically cancelled. The department has also decided not to impose lease amount on land conversion cases proceedings for warehouses and cold storage of agricultural products. An official said, “For warehouse and cold storage of agricultural products, the civic bodies will allot land at 50% of the reserved price, but allottees will have to construct in two years.” The department has also given nod to issue freehold lease to plot owners who will deposit 10-year lease amount collectively. The landholders who have taken the lease deed (patta) from the civic body after depositing one-time lease amount of eight years will be contacted by the authorities. The official said, “The civic bodies will offer these owners to procure the freehold lease after depositing additional two years’ lease money. The amount for remaining two years can be deposited online.” In order to procure freehold lease deed on commercial plots, the owner has to deposit a one-time lease of 10 years instead of 12 years. The department has also increased the fee on selling the allotted plot before 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/warehouse-on-agri-plots-will-not-have-to-pay-external-development-charges/articleshow/80695182.cms||---

Krishnaveni, who had worked as a field assistant earlier, fell at the feet of Rajeshwar pleading that her job be restored. Last year, 7,700 field assistants who were taken as outsourcing staff for the MGNREGS were removed by Telangana government and the work they were doing was allocated to gram panchayats.

February 5, 2021||Trichy||‘Why collect waste mgmt user fee?’||Trichy: While Trichy Corporation has expressed its decision to stop collecting waste from apartments, people staying in apartments have questioned the purpose of collecting solid waste management charge (SUC) from them. Consumer organisations have come in support of the residents by saying that waste collection and disposal is an integral part of a civic body’s primary duties. “Flat owners are paying a minimum of Rs 180 once in every six months towards the fee for solid waste management. Having collected a specific charge, it’s unfair on the part of the civic body to deny waste collection,” V Nadaraja, representative of a gated community on VOC Road, said. Apartment dwellers said the civic body is refusing to accept waste such as fallen leaves and trimmed trees. As public bins were removed from public space, the residents find it difficult to dispose of garden waste, and they are forced to burn them in the open. “It seems the civic body is shying away from executing their duties and responsibilities,” S Pushpavanam, secretary of Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu said.  “User charge is being collected to handle dry waste such as plastic and recyclable products. Dry waste collection will continue,” Trichy Corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian told TOI. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/why-collect-waste-mgmt-user-fee/articleshow/80696881.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Kolhapur||Minister warns against bogus seeds||Kolhapur: Taking serious note of large-scale complaints being filed by farmers on bogus seeds, minister of state for agriculture Vishwajeet Kadam has instructed officials to register offences against the companies involved in it. Kadam was addressing a meeting in Mumbai which saw the presence of officials, representatives of seed manufacturing companies and farmers. Kadam said that two companies supplied bogus eight tons of onion seeds to farmers, resulting in heavy losses. “Besides, farmers also became more helpless due to heavy rainfall,” he said. Kadam warned that farmers were going through various difficulties and that the government would not tolerate any case of supply of bogus seeds. He asked the officials to ensure strict vigil on the supply of seeds ahead of Rabi season. Kadam said that similar to last year, he has received several complaints about the supply of bogus seeds in the market. Last year, the agriculture department had launched a special drive to prevent supply of sub-standard seeds of soybeen. Complaints were lodged against 23 companies involved in supply of sub-standard seeds. It also included government run agency Mahabeej. Agriculture department had even conducted raids at some places where seeds were either manufactured or stored. The department had received around 30,000 complaints against bogus seeds. Farmers were forced to spend additional money for re-sowing of the crop, Kadam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/minister-warns-against-bogus-seeds/articleshow/80692658.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Trichy||Central teams visit central, south districts to assess crop damage||Trichy: Two three-member central team visited rain-affected agriculture fields in Pudukottai and Thanjavur districts in the central region and Tuticorin, Virudhunagar and Tirunelveli in the south on Thursday to assess the damage to the crops due to untimely rain in January. Farmers who lost their crops pleaded with the team to help them to get compensation and relief from the union government. The team comprising Paul Pandian, commissioner of department of fisheries development, Shubham Garg, assistant director of central electricity authority, and Rananjay Singh, regional officer, ministry of road transport and highways, arrived in Thanjavur and inspected fields in Kavalipatti, Nambivayal, Thippiyakudi and Thuraiyur and examined the extent of damage caused to both agriculture and horticulture crops. Farmers who met with the team members appealed with them to get Rs 30,000 per acre as relief from the union government, as they lost almost the entire crops which were ready for harvesting. Farmers also appealed to recommend the insurance companies to sanction 100% compensation to meet their losses. Agriculture production commissioner and principal secretary to government of Tamil Nadu Gagandeep Singh Bedi inspected the fields and assured farmers that the state would recommend the union government to sanction the required compensation. Based on a report submitted by the state government, the central team was pressed into action. District collector M Govinda Rao, joint director of agriculture department A Justin and officials were present during the inspection. Earlier in the day, the team visited rain affected areas in Pudukottai district along with state director of agriculture V Dakshinamoorthy and district collector P Uma Maheswari. The team will continue their inspection in Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai on Friday to examine crop loss due to rain. In the south, state commissioner of disaster management D Jagannathan accompanied the team comprising joint secretary in the ministry of home affairs Ashutosh Agnihotri, director of oilseed development, Dr Manoharan, and deputy director FCD (Exp), ministry of finance, Mahesh Kumar. “The total area affected in the district is 1.21 lakh hectares. It includes 1.04 lakh hectares of agriculture and 17,000 hectares of horticulture crops,” Senthil Raj told TOI. The central team interacted with affected farmers and collected details pertaining to the cost of seeds, fertilizer and pesticides they had spent and the intensity of the loss incurred by them and received their petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/central-teams-visit-central-south-districts-to-assess-crop-damage/articleshow/80696895.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Jaipur||RHB sets record of selling 500 properties in shortest duration||Jaipur: Setting a record in times of the pandemic, the Rajasthan Housing Board (RHB) sold 500 properties worth Rs 135 crore through auctions. RHB commissioner Pawan Arora said, “Buyers are finding RHB properties promising for investment. No private or government agency has auctioned these many properties and earned revenue in such a short duration.” As per records, the RHB sold 70 premium properties for Rs 92.73 crore. These include a 2,400 sqm plot on Mahal Road at Rs 15 crore. The board also six auctioned six shops in Aayush Market for Rs 3 crore and 8 shops for Rs 10 lakh at Aatish Market, Mansarovar. To attract buyers, the board had also reduced the earnest money (a mandatory fee to bid for the property) from 5% to 2% along with other bidding relaxations. Last year too, defying the trend, RHB had earned over Rs 100 crore through auctioning of its flats across the state during lockdown. Officials claimed discounted rates, houses on instalments and location of flats attracted buyers to participate in auctions. In the past, RHB had made several attempts to sell its flats. However, all efforts turned futile as not many buyers showed interest to purchase the properties. In 2017, the RHB shortlisted properties (flats of different sizes) in Pratap Nagar here for selling over the counter. Unlike the earlier system of allotting houses through a draw of lots where buyers had to wait for months, people in this scheme could purchase RHB houses and take possession in a single day after depositing the house cost at the counter. “The RHB witnessed reverse trend since last year as many people came forward to buy these flats after being offered discounted rates,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rhb-sets-record-of-selling-500-properties-in-shortest-duration/articleshow/80695172.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Vijayawada||Explain high power purchases from pvt exchanges, ERC quizzes discoms||Amaravati: Taking strong exception to power utilities purchasing power at higher costs from private exchanges, AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) directed the discoms to submit a detailed report on total purchases made in the last one month. In a directive to the discoms, APERC noted that the quantum of power purchased from private exchanges was also very high during the period. The commission said that it found from the reports of discoms that the landed per unit cost of energy has been gradually increasing and is in the range from Rs 3.27 to Rs 4.07 except on two days during the period from 17.12.2020 to 15.01.2021. “The quantum of purchases are also huge, ranging from 30 MU to 40 MU per day in the majority of days during the said period which is about 15% to 20% of each day energy requirement in the State,” ERC observed. It further said the maximum (marginal) per unit variable cost of the last dispatched thermal power plant as per the approved tariff order for the financial year 2020-21, is Rs 3.98. “The per unit variable costs of many units of the state-run APGENCO thermal plants are in the range of Rs 3.24 to Rs 3.86. However, these units are being kept under reserve shutdown for longer periods on the premise that per unit costs of energy in the exchanges are lesser than the per unit variable costs of power from these power plants and that the procurement from exchanges will lead to the reduction of overall power purchase costs,” said the ERC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/explain-high-power-purchases-from-pvt-exchanges-erc-quizzes-discoms/articleshow/80694437.cms||Samdani MN
February 5, 2021||Vijayawada||Rlys to build access road to goods shed||Guntur: The railway authorities have decided to construct a direct approach road to the goods shed located at Reddipalem in Guntur city. The goods shed is one of the busiest cargo handling centres in the division where hundreds of lorries move in and out from Guntur carrying rice and chilli. The new road will decongest traffic in the city. The railway board has given approval for taking up the new access road to the shed which will help heavy vehicles reach the loading point without entering the city. “We will shortly start work on the new approach road... It will not only reduce traffic congestion but also help us manage goods loading time schedules by avoiding delays,” said divisional railway manager R Mohan Raja. The new road would be laid through the existing railway land along Vijayawada-Guntur track. As there is no need to acquire private land, authorities are expecting to complete work early as it involves only laying of road, which is expected to be three kilometres. Currently, vehicles have to pass through Nehru Nagar after entering the city to reach the goods shed, which often cause traffic jams, particularly when the railway crossing gate at Sita Nagar is closed for movement of trains. It takes nearly an hour to clear traffic during peak hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rlys-to-build-access-road-to-goods-shed/articleshow/80694448.cms||Samdani MN
February 5, 2021||Vadodara||BJP makes exceptions in rules, repeats 15||Vadodara: The BJP may have made rules for ticket distribution that left many in the party surprised, but it surprised many again on Thursday by making exception to these rules. The party also decided to repeat only 15 candidates who were elected in 2015 and fielded eight others who had won in the 2010 polls or before. The list of candidates declared on Thursday evening provided a mix of young and veteran corporators. With the party deciding at the last moment that former mayors will not be given tickets, the seasoned candidates did not figure anyone who had held the post earlier. Eight former corporators were those who had won polls in 2010 or before that. These included former standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel. The 15 corporators who had won in 2015 and were repeated included former standing committee chairman Satish Patel, Kalpesh Patel aka Jay Ranchhod who had opposed the entry of Congress veteran Chirag Zaveri in the party, and others. Old timers like Ajit Patel, Yogesh Patel aka Mukti, Ketan Brahmbhatt, Chandrakant Thakkar and others did not find a place in the list. Heavyweights like MLA Madhu Shrivastava’s son Dipak, MLA Shailesh Mehta’s son Dhrumil, former deputy mayor Jivraj Chauhan and all former mayors were also denied tickets. The party, however, made exceptions to its policy of not giving tickets to kin of leaders by doing so in the case of Rajesh Prajapati, son of Dalsukh Prajapati who joined the BJP some years back and was made the chairman of the Gujarat Matikam Kalakari and Rural Technology Institute. Prajapati is a member of the other backward classes (OBC), but will contest on a general seat in ward eight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bjp-makes-exceptions-in-rules-repeats-15/articleshow/80693109.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Jaipur||CM reviews to health, education, drinking water and employment||Jaipur. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has given instructions for effective implementation of schemes related to education, health, drinking water and employment. He said these schemes are important from the point of view of inclusive development. Gehlot was addressing the first meeting of the State Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA). The meeting reviewed the progress of schemes related to MNREGA, Prime Minister Crop Insurance scheme, Jal Jeevan Mission, integrated education campaign and National Health Mission. The chief minister said MNREGA scheme had proved to be a boon for connecting the common man with employment. In Covid times, its importance had increased. He directed Saharia and Kherwa of Baran, who completed 100 days of employment, and MNREGA workers of Kathodi tribe of Udaipur should be provided 50 days of additional employment. The chief minister expressed happiness that the number of employed families has increased from 50.65 lakh to 69.96 lakh in the last two years. Also, 99.69 per cent labourers have been ensured payment within 15 days.Reviewing the progress of the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, Gehlot said the government had ensured payment of crop insurance to farmers by giving part of the state premium. He directed that necessary steps should be taken to remove bottlenecks of the scheme and conduct it transparently.Gehlot said providing clean drinking water to every village was top priority. For this, water life mission plan should be given momentum. It was informed in the meeting that to speed up the mission, village drinking water sanitation committees have been formed in 38,000 villages out of 43,000 in all 33 districts. They will be formed soon in the remaining villages. Gehlot said strengthening the medical infrastructure up to villages was our main goal. Keeping this in mind, model CHCs should be developed under the National Health Mission. A plan should be prepared to increase the number of district hospitals as per the requirement of the state. Adequate medical equipment and other resources should be made available at health centres so that people do not have to go to cities for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-reviews-to-health-education-drinking-water-and-employment/articleshow/80695199.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Man gets 10-yr jail for rape bid on minor||Hyderabad: A 55-year-old man was convicted by a special court for Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), Nampally, on Thursday. The judge directed him to undergo 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for attempting to rape a 12-year-old girl. The judge, K Suneetha, in her verdict said that the convict was convicted under POCSO Act. Apart from undergoing 10 years of imprisonment, the convict was directed to pay a fine of Rs 5,000. In December 2019, the convict tried to rape the victim under Begumpet police station limits. On hearing the hue and cry of the victim, a neighbour, with the support of other locals came to the rescue of the minor. The convict, who had confined the victim in a room, tried to escape using another door. But the locals caught him and later handed him to police. The victim had come to the city 15 days before the offence and was taking shelter at the residence of the convict’s daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-gets-10-yr-jail-for-rape-bid-on-minor/articleshow/80696902.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Surat||70 fresh faces chosen in Surat, 38 Patidars get tickets||Surat: The BJP on Thursday fielded as many as 67 new faces for the upcoming municipal corporation elections with only 13 candidates of 2015 polls being repeated. The party announced the list of 120 candidates for 30 municipal wards. Notably, the BJP has given tickets to the 38 Patidar candidates from different wards of the city, especially those where the Congress had won in the last municipal election. Surat had witnessed large-scale violence during the quota stir led by Hardik Patel in 2015. There are 10 more Patidar faces this time as BJP had given tickets to 28 last time. Out of the total 44 municipal wards dominated by the Patidars, Congress had managed to win 23 seats in the last municipal election. This time, however, the Patidar factor doesn’t seem dominant, making it an uphill task for the Congress to retain the seats in the Patidar-dominated areas. Out of the 79 candidates, who had won the civic election in 2015, only nine candidates have been repeated. Notably, not a single Muslim candidate has been given the party ticket. Many senior BJP leaders including immediate past mayor Dr Jagdish Patel, his deputy Nirav Shah, former BJP city president Nitin Bhajiawala, former standing committee chairman Anil Goplani have been dropped following the tough criteria for selection of candidates. Navsari MP and BJP state president CR Paatil has ensured that his Marathi community gets better representation the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). Around about 12 Marathi candidates have been given tickets from the migrant-dominated areas including Limbayat, Udhana, Parvat Patiya etc. Paatil holds tremendous goodwill among people in these migrant-dominated areas. The Congress, which had managed to win just 14 out of the total 114 seats in 2010 election, had more than doubled its tally to 36 seats in 2015 and increased its vote share by 21.45%. In 2015 elections, BJP could win just two wards of the seven that had more than 40% of the Patidar population from Saurashtra, mainly from the diamond industry. The party managed to win ward number 13 of Umarwada and 14 of Karanj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/70-fresh-faces-chosen-in-surat-38-patidars-get-tickets/articleshow/80693392.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Rajkot||Repeaters, above 60 yrs relegated||Rajkot: The announcement of names of BJP candidates for Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) elections brewed in discontentment among the party ranks in the chief minister’s hometown on Thursday. With BJP president C R Paatil adopting new criteria for ticket aspirants, many a senior leader hoping to contest the polls found themselves disqualified. However, senior corporators had already expressed their unwillingness to contest the polls this time, much ahead of the selection process. The list of candidates declared from Gandhinagar only repeated 12 out of the 40 sitting corporators of BJP from the last term. BJP heavyweights like Nitin Bhardwaj, city president Kamlesh Mirani, other sitting corporators like mayor Bina Acharya, standing committee chairman Uday Kangad and Kashyap Shukla did not get tickets. But Kashyap’s brother, Nehal Shukla, got a ticket. It was a surprise for many that Bhanu Babariya, a two term MLA from Rajkot rural constituency, got a ticket to contest from ward number 1. Altogether 60 of the 72 candidates are not sitting corporators. Of them, 56 are totally new faces. There are 22 young faces who will try their luck in the elections. Nine wards of total 18 will have all new faces. While selecting candidates, BJP has considered educational degrees apart from the caste equations for the election. Sixteen candidates have high professional and postgraduate degrees, while many others are graduates. Considering the caste factor, the highest number of 14 candidates from Leuva Patel community got tickets, followed by eight from Brahmin community. Darbar and Aahirs have seven candidates each, while three are from the Lohana community. Interestingly, no Muslim candidates got tickets this polls. BJP leader Dhansukh Bhanderi said “All the candidates will meet near Bahumali Bhavan on Friday and fill their forms. We will talk about development.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/repeaters-above-60-yrs-relegated/articleshow/80693997.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: SEC against ‘forcible unanimous elections’||NELLOR/ONGOLE: State election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar on Thursday said the commission is not against anyone getting elected unanimously in village panchayat elections. He, however, made it clear that he is against ‘forcible unanimous elections’ as it would not augur well for democracy. Ramesh Kumar, who visited Nellore, Prakasam and Guntur districts to review the poll preparedness, directed district collectors and SPs to focus on the threats and pressures being exerted by a few people against political rivals to safeguard the democratic process. Speaking to reporters in Nellore, he said attempts to stall village panchayat elections have finally came to an end with the high court dismissing yet another petition filed against the conduct of elections. He said panchayat polls would be held with 2019 electoral rolls. “It is a fact that about 3.6 lakh new voters are not getting the chance to exercise their franchise in upcoming elections but the commission was compelled to go ahead with the elections to uphold the democratic process,” he said. He further said that he was not against any political party or politician. “I am performing my duty as a constitutional authority. I have no political agendas,” he added. On the commission’s directive to closely monitor ‘unanimous’ elections, the SEC said the commission will study complaints lodged by political parties about threats received by their leaders in contesting the elections. “Unanimous elections by creating terror, panic and fear will not be tolerated,” he made it clear. He asked why there were no unanimous polls to assemblies and parliament. He said that betterment of administration and development was possible only from different views and thoughts, and not through suppression of views. The SEC told the collectors and SPs that it would be viewed as their failure if the single nominations either for sarpanch or ward members are more than the desired numbers. He added that people might prefer to elect good leaders uncontested which the commission would not oppose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sec-against-forcible-unanimous-elections/articleshow/80693719.cms||Samdani MN
February 5, 2021||Vijayawada||Candidates take to social media to draw young voters to booths||Vijayawada: Young voters are going to play a key role in local body elections in Krishna district. According to data with panchayat raj authorities, close to 40% of voters in rural areas are in the 18 to 39 age bracket. In a bid to attract voters from this demographic, candidates for sarpanch posts have increased their use of social media apps to explain their agenda. Officials said that around 16.5 lakh new voters have enrolled this year. “We are continuing online campaigns along with traditional door-to-door campaigns. Many techies are working from home and they will cast their vote this time. We are designing a variety of campaigns keeping them in view. We are even preparing video documentaries and presentations of our manifesto and posting them online,” said Sesham Jyothi Rani, sarpanch candidate from Kanchikacherla.

February 5, 2021||Vijayawada||AP high court dismisses pleas challenging panchayat election notification||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Thursday dismissed two petitions moved challenging the panchayat election notification on the ground that the electoral rolls were not updated. The high court observed that the State Election Commission (SEC) has discretion to finalise electoral rolls as on the date of issuing schedule for the election and it is not inclined to intervene in the election process at this juncture. One Dhulipalla Akhila from Guntur moved a writ petition challenging the decision of SEC to conduct elections to panchayats according to 2019 electoral rolls. Akhila’s counsel, G Siva Prasad Reddy argued that the SEC is denying her right to vote by not conducting elections according to the updated electoral rolls. He said that it was the duty of the SEC to see elections are conducted according to updated electoral rolls. One Rayi Oliver Raju from Visakhapatnam moved a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on the same grounds that 3.6 lakh new voters are being denied their voting rights which could possibly change the results in majority of panchayats. Arguing on behalf of Raju, advocate N Joy requested the high court to issue directions to the state government to prepare updated electoral rolls and to the SEC to conduct elections according to 2021 electoral rolls. N Ashwani Kumar, counsel for the SEC, contended the arguments of the petitioners. He told the high court that the SEC is having jurisdiction and discretion to follow the electoral rolls which stood finalised as on that date as per the judgment given by the Supreme Court in Kishan Singh Tomar case. Since the government chose to non-cooperative and failed to finalise electoral rolls as on January 1, 2021 in spite of innumerable reminders, SEC decided to conduct polls as per the 2019 electoral rolls. The high court bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice C Praveen Kumar observed that they are not inclined to intervene in the election process at this stage as it is against the settled principle of law according various judgements given by the Supreme Court. Taking arguments of Ashwani Kumar into consideration and opinion of advocate general who also said that the poll process cannot be stalled at this juncture, the court dismissed both petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-dismisses-pleas-challenging-panchayat-election-notification/articleshow/80694350.cms||Srikanth Aluri

All alliance party leaders including DMK president M K Stalin will participate, party state secretary R Mutharasan said in Thanjavur on Thursday.

CPI strongly condemned the sedition charges against journalists who reported the farmers’ agitation as well as the suspension of three members of Parliament. The government should first withdraw the three contentious farm acts, he added. He said thousands of farmers lost their crop in the recent rain in Tamil Nadu.

February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Touching child’s cheeks without sexual intent not offence, says court||MUMBAI: Holding that touching a child’s cheeks without any sexual intent is not an offence, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court on Tuesday acquitted a 28-year-old electrician, even as he was found guilty by the same court for molesting the five-year-old girl’s mother. In the same judgement relating to the two separate offences that allegedly took place simultaneously, the court has sentenced the accused to one-year imprisonment in the 33-year-old mother’s case. The incident took place when the accused had visited their home to fix a broken refrigerator. Awarding the minimum sentence to the accused, the court said, “Except this case, no other cases are reported against him. He is young, so he can be given an opportunity of curing himself by sentencing for the minimum punishment of one year...”. The maximum sentence under the Indian Penal Code charge for outraging a woman’s modesty is five years in jail. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the accused. The incident took place on June 2, 2017. The woman told the court that after her husband left for work, she tended to her two minor daughters. She said later she asked the watchman to send the accused, the building electrician, to fix the fridge. The woman said he came home at 2.30pm, checked it and claimed there was a problem with some part. She said he went out and returned with the part. The woman said the accused then came close to her and felt her daughter’s cheeks. She said she scolded him, telling him not to touch her daughter. The woman said she then asked him to take a look at the washing machine as it was malfunctioning. She said when she went to the kitchen for some work, the accused came from behind and hugged her. Scared, she pushed him away. The woman said she gave him money and asked him to leave the house. That was when the accused tried to pull her close to him by holding her neck. The woman said after she protested, he went to the child who was standing close by and once again felt her cheeks. The woman said she shouted at him to stop, pushed him and ordered him to get out. She then called his supervisor over the phone and informed him. She also called her sister and disclosed the incident. Her brother immediately came home and called the police. The police arrived and caught the accused. He was subsequently granted bail. The child too was brought to court for her deposition when she was seven years old. She could not recall the incident though. The court relied on the woman’s statement to convict the accused on charges of molesting her and said there was no reason to disbelieve her. Acquitting the accused on the charges he faced with respect to the child, the court said, “It is for the prosecution to prove the guilt against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Even considering the testimony of the mother, as it is, still there is no such overt act on part of the accused which can be termed as sexual assault to the victim girl or amounting to outraging her modesty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/touching-childs-cheeks-without-sexual-intent-not-offence-court/articleshow/80693089.cms||Rebecca Samervel
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man gets 8 years for stabbing wife in row over eating curd at home||MUMBAI: Two years after a 39-year-old man was arrested for stabbing his wife in anger as she had eaten a portion of the curd she had brought home, a sessions court recently convicted and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment on the attempt-to-murder charge. The man had called the woman a “cat” which led to an argument. Finding the accused, Antop Hill resident Sachin Malore, guilty, the court said, “The offence proved against the accused is serious in nature. While showing leniency to the accused, the sufferings of the victim cannot be ignored. The accused stabbed his own wife on petty grounds.” The accused has been in jail since his arrest in 2017. The court refuted his defence that his wife, Ranjana, was injured as she accidentally fell on a steel utensil rack. “The testimony of complainant is supported by medical evidence as well as eyewitnesses who immediately rushed to the spot and found the accused assaulting his wife. There is no reason brought forward for false implication. During cross-examination, nothing is brought on record which will create doubt about the trustworthiness of the said witness,” the court said. Ranjana, a mother of two, was among the nine witnesses who deposed during the trial. She said the accused was unemployed and would often abuse her when drunk. She said she worked to support the family. Recalling the incident, Ranjana said on the night of September 9, 2019, the accused came home drunk. At that time she was eating curd which she had brought from her mother. Ranjana said the accused objected to this and remarked, “Looks like the cat has eaten the curd.” She said she questioned him for calling her a cat and told him her mother had given it to her. Ranjana said this angered the accused and he kicked her in the face. She said when he continued beating her, she asked him for the reason. Further enraged, he picked up a knife lying around, gagged her and stabbed her in the stomach. Ranjana said she began bleeding and raised an alarm. The landlord’s son-in-law heard her cries and rushed to the house. He rescued her by snatching the knife. The accused fled. Ranjana then called her sister. She deposed her sister lived nearby and so immediately arrived and took her to Sion Hospital. An FIR was lodged. Ranjana spent a month in hospital. The accused was traced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/man-gets-8-yrs-for-stabbing-wife-in-row-over-eating-curd-at-home/articleshow/80695258.cms||Rebecca Samervel
February 5, 2021||Jaipur||4,000 suspected cancer cases detected in early detection camps||Jaipur: Realising that early detection of cancer could be a game changer in preventing mortalities associated to it, the health department is focusing on organising early detection camps across the state. So far, 4,000 have been found to be suspected cancer patients in such camps organised in the state.Though the government is taking measures for detecting cancer cases in early stages, it has certain limitations. The doctors involved in screening of cancer at the camps are just able to identify suspected cases of oral, cervical and breast cancers. As for diagnosis of other cancers, they need to conduct certain tests, which is why, other cancers go undetected.On World Cancer Day that was observed on Thursday, health minister Raghu Sharma, while reviewing the situation in the state, said that early detection helps in controlling cancer.“The health department is setting up early detection camps at government hospitals in each district headquarters. We appeal to all to take advantage of the camps,” said Sharma.Till now more than a lakh people have been screened at these camps and around 4,000 potential patients have been identified. According to the World Health Organisation, cancer is the main reason in more than 60% of the deaths in non-communicable diseases. According to an estimate, around two crore people are suffering from cancer and each year 90 lakh new cancer patients are identified every year.Sharma said that in India 94 men and 104 women in a population of 1 lakh are cancer patients, while according to an estimate there are around 60,000 cancer patients in Rajasthan. Every year 20,000 new cancer patients are identified in the state. Prevention is the best treatment of cancer. Cases of cancer are increasing and one of the reasons is our changing lifestyle. Cancer can be prevented in 60% cases by improving the lifestyle.Making people aware is necessary for effective prevention of serious diseases like cancer, the health department believes. Acting on it, the state government on completion of one year, had started ‘Nirogi Rajasthan’ campaign with an objective to create awareness among people.Health Secretary Siddharth Mahajan said that cancer can be controlled through early detection. He said that the system of cancer screening at district levels will be strengthened. Besides this, arrangements will be made to consult cancer patients through tele-conference or tele-medicine at district-level, for which necessary training will be given.Nodal officer RN Meena said that cancer can be controlled only by making people aware. He said there are more than 100 types of cancers in the world of which leading cancers are oral, breast and cervical. He said that relief is being provided by setting up an early detection camp at each district headquarters on Wednesday every month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4000-suspected-cancer-cases-detected-in-early-detection-camps/articleshow/80695257.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Youth tied, beaten up by pals over theft, tries to end life||TRICHY: A 22-year-old man, seen blindfolded and beaten up by a group of people in a video clip doing the rounds on social media, has landed in hospital after consuming rat poison to end his life. Police have secured five of his ‘friends’, all daily wagers, seen in the clip based on a complaint from the victim. Inspector Subulakshmi of Ammapettai in Thanjavur district said the incident happened on Wednesday at Konur village where the victim Ramkumar (name changed) and Lakshmanan, 25, resided. A sum of Rs 30,000 had gone missing from Lakshmanan’s house on February 1 and he suspected Ramkumar might have stolen it during his visit a few days ago. On Wednesday, Lakshmanan along with his friends Vicki, 25, Rajadurai, 24, Parthiban, 25 and Sarath, 24, took Ramkumar to the village’s outskirts and asked about the money. Though he denied having anything to do with it, the five dropped a hood on his head . One of them started beating him with a log indiscriminately, while the others got hold of his hands. Ramkumar is seen pleading with them but they continued to beat him up. Inspector Subulakshmi told TOI that both the victim and Lakshmanan belong to the same community (dalits), while two of the five belonged to other castes. One of the attackers shot the incident on his mobile phone and circulated it on social media platforms. Humiliated, Ramkumar consumed rat poison and was rushed to hospital. On coming to know about the the video, a team of the Ammapettai police met Ramkumar at the hospital and got a written complaint from him against Lakshmanan and four of his accomplices. Based on the complaint, police secured all the five and are investigating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/youth-tied-beaten-up-by-pals-over-theft-tries-to-end-life/articleshow/80696916.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj
February 5, 2021||Trichy||Trichy MP urges defence min to cede land for RoB||Trichy: As there has been inordinate delay acquiring defence land to complete the Trichy junction RoB near Mannarpuram, Trichy MP Su Thirunavukkarasar has urged the defence ministry to cede the required piece of land to decongest the city. The stalemate between the state government and the defence ministry has put on hold one of the arms of the RoB to help vehicles bypass the congested localities near Trichy railway junction. The district administration and the state government has already identified compensatory land for acquiring the required portion of defence land in Mannarpuram. “The delay in completing the Chennai arm of the RoB for want of defence land is also delaying the phase II of the RoB’s proposal. I request the defence ministry to facilitate the land required at the earliest for completing the infrastructure project,” said Trichy MP Thirunavukkarasar, placing a request with Union defence minister Rajnath Singh in the Parliament on Wednesday. The delay in completing the Chennai arm of the RoB is not solving the purpose of the RoB which has four other arms towards Madurai, Bus stand, railway junction and Dindigul. The pending Chennai arm will help incoming vehicles reach Madurai road and Dindigul highway without accessing the congested junction locality. As vehicles continue to approach the existing narrow roads, traffic snarls continue. The district administration last May had identified the Tamil Nadu special police battalion land in Mannarpuram as compensatory land while the state government tendered a no-objection certificate (NOC) for the land transfer to acquire 0.66 acres of defence land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-mp-urges-defence-min-to-cede-land-for-rob/articleshow/80696910.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||GHMC, SCR caught in slugfest as residents suffer||SECUNDERABAD: The roads at Lalapet flyover crossroads (Ambedkar statue towards Moula Ali) and Shanti Nagar (heading towards Mettuguda crossroads) have been recarpeted. However,there are no footpaths on both important stretches. Moreover, the stretches have become narrow with vendors occupying both sides of the road. As a result, it has become difficult for the TSRTC city buses to operate without hassles and for commuters to use the road to reach Mettuguda crossroads, Secunderabad railway station and Rail Nilayam. To make matters worse, GHMC and SCR are engaged in a tussle over a piece of land that is required to lay pavements. GHMC expressed its willingness to construct pavements for a length of 1.5km under the CRMP, but alleged that the SCR was not ready to part with its land. “The black-topped road is being recarpeted by the private agencies under the CRMP. But, we could not construct the pavements. The SCR claims that the land belongs to it and pavements cannot be constructed on its land,” officials in GHMC engineering wing, Secunderabad north zone, told TOI. A GHMC official said: “For the last one year, we have been doing the rounds but have not received a positive response from the SCR. Pedestrians in Shanti Nagar are facing inconvenience with no footpaths.” SCR, on the other hand, has denied GHMC’s allegations. SCR divisional engineer Laxma Reddy told TOI that they have never raised any land issue with the civic body. “We have no objection if the GHMC constructs the pavements. We are urging the civic body to lay the footpaths for the convenience of local residents,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-scr-caught-in-slugfest-as-residents-suffer/articleshow/80696913.cms||Sunil Mungara
February 5, 2021||Aurangabad||Register offences for misappropriation of temple property: HC||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has said that authorities like the police and the charity commissioner’s office are expected to work with “secular mind and scientific approach” and must not accept religious propositions that cannot be scientifically proved. The HC on Wednesday directed that offences be registered under the Black Magic Act and for conspiracy, cheating, misappropriation and breach of trust for alleged illegal acts between 2011 and 2016 at the Jagadamba Devi Sarvajanik Trust in Pathardi tehsil of Ahmednagar district. The trust manages the famous Mohota devi temple. Former trustee Namdev Garad (52) had filed a petition in the court alleging misappropriation of nearly 2kg gold for “burial of suvarna yantras (pendants) to re-energise temple and deity” and for showing Rs25 lakh expenses for “ceremonies” for the purpose. The trust is headed by a judicial officer of the rank of district judge with a civil judge senior division among the other trustees, but the day-to-day affairs are managed by a chief executive officer (CEO). The HC took exception to the fact that despite several complaints, the police and the deputy charity commissioner did not act out of general fear about those associated with the trust and for not wanting to invite trouble as the matter involved religious feelings. The court directed the Ahmednagar superintendent of police (SP) to get the matter investigated by an additional or deputy SP rank officer within six months. When contacted, Ahmednagar SP Manoj Patil told TOI, “We have received the HC’s order today and are going through it. An FIR will be registered tomorrow.” The HC bench of Justice T V Nalavade and Justice M G Sewlikar said, “Many persons had made an attempt to draw the attention of the authorities to the illegalities. They (authorities) avoided to discharge their duty probably for the reasons quoted above. This court... cannot shirk its responsibility and holds that even the trustees like the petitioner (Garad), who was party earlier, can be made accused as one of the conspirators.” The bench said, “All the trustees who were party to the resolution and who approved the expenditure subsequently can also be booked for these illegalities. A complaint filed on March 7, 2017 by the Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (should) be taken as the base for registration of FIR.” Ajinkya Kale and Pradnya Talekar, lawyers for the petitioners, had argued, among other things, that the alleged activities were in contravention of the scheme of the trust, which was for religious, social and educational purposes. The bench listed out its prima facie findings for registration of an FIR and said the scheme of the trust did not allow for property to be disposed of in the manner it was done — for burial of gold and ceremonies in the name of yantras and creation of a new temple for 64 yoginis, for which there is no scientific evidence. Moreover, the scheme showed that if an amount of over Rs20,000 was to be spent, tenders had to be floated to allot work. “It is a fact that the trust lost property of more than Rs1 crore in the alleged activity. There is nothing on record to show that as per the Maharashtra Public Trust Act, the procedure for disposal of trust property like taking permission of the joint charity commissioner and calling tenders was followed. Only one man proposed by the architect was accepted by the trustees for this (yantra) work without verification of his competency,” the bench observed. The bench said there was no record to show as to how pure gold weighing 2kg was utilized and that 64 different moulds of yoginis were really created through any agency. “The circumstances are sufficient to make out the case of breach of trust... These activities apparently fall under the offences punishable under sections 420, 406 etc of IPC. It is also cheating to the poor people who had donated the ornaments to the endowment for purposes mentioned in the scheme of the trust,” the bench said. The HC turned down the plea for a stay on the operative order and said, “Giving stay to the order will amount to giving protection to the accused and it will be against the religious endowment. So, such relief is refused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/register-offences-for-misappropriation-of-temple-property-hc/articleshow/80692671.cms||Mohammed Akhef
February 5, 2021||Jaipur||Four solar cos seek special incentives to invest close to Rs 1.5 lakh-cr||JAIPUR: Four firms have sought special incentives from the state government to put up 34,200 MW solar projects and a component manufacturing facility having capacity for 2,000 MW. If approved, these projects are estimated to bring in investments of close to Rs 1.50 lakh-crore, including revenues of about Rs 10,000 crore to the government while generating employment for over 16,000 people, as per the proposals of the companies. Adani, Renew Power and Greenco have given 3-5 year deadline to bring these project on-stream. JSW has sought 10 year period. Collectively, they have sought 80,000 hectares, most of which are expected to be government-owned. Subodh Agarwal, chairman and managing director of Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd said, “We are now seeing proposals in multiples of not 100s but 1000s. This shows the growing appetite of investors for projects in Rajasthan.” Agarwal said that while the Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme-2020 offers competitive advantages to investors, the government is also offering additional benefits in the form of customized packages under the scope of the scheme to attract big-ticket projects. While the state empowered committee (EC) has cleared Adani’s 9,700 MW projects that would attract investments of Rs 46,000 crore, others are at various stages of approval. After the EC approval, the proposal needs to be passed in the Cabinet. Proposals of JSW (10,000 MW), Greenco (4,500 MW), and ReNew Power (10,000 MW) are now being processed for the EC for extending customized packages. Greenco’s project will be unique in the sense it will have storage solutions. Besides these power generation projects, ReNew Power has also applied for 2,000 MW capacity solar cell and panel manufacturing plant which would bring in investments of Rs 1200 crore. Agarwal said if the proposals go through, Rajasthan will have its first solar cell manufacturing plant in the state. “We are keen to provide all policy support and incentives to anyone who wishes to set up manufacturing units in the state. Now with the generation projects and their capacity growing fast, we have to have a strong manufacturing base so that we don’t have to depend on imports of solar cells and panels,” added Agarwal. In the central government Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced to raise duty on inverters so that their production in the country becomes competitive. Given the intention of the Centre to reduce dependency on imports, similar tariff barriers are expected on the import of cells and panels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-solar-cos-seek-special-incentives-to-invest-close-to-rs-1-5-lakh-cr/articleshow/80695250.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
February 5, 2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cinema operators upbeat on hall reopening from Feb 8||JAIPUR: Cinema operators in the state are upbeat on the reopening of theatres from February 8 after a gap of almost 10 months. While preparations are on, some of the hall owners have planned to come up with a system where there will be no human touch in ticketing, food and in other things. They will start with previously released films and wait for new releases. TOI on Tuesday spoke to various operators and film distributors to know how the theatres are responding to the reopening. “Since no new films are releasing, hall owners will have to bank on previously released films. Hopefully, we can have new releases from March onwards,” said Raj Bansal, a leading film distributor. An official of INOX cinemas said. “We will start a few screens as we need to ensure safety and hygiene. We are hopeful to set a benchmark on hygiene and disinfection. Also, we will have paperless ticketing and security checks without human touch. People booking tickets on the counter will get an SMS with a link to see their seat number and where exactly the seat is located inside the auditorium to avoid any human touch.” Likewise, there are some hall owners who are on ‘wait-and-watch’ mode. “We will first see the response of film lovers,” said Nandu Jalani, manager of Prem Prakash hall. Many cinema exhibitors are hopeful that within a fortnight things would become normal. “Though in Rajasthan, we can’t book more than 50 per cent of our seats, we are hopeful in the next fortnight, capping would be removed,” said a cinema operator from Ajmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cinema-operators-upbeat-on-hall-reopening-from-feb-8/articleshow/80695281.cms||Ashish Mehta
February 5, 2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Nurses demand they should be called ‘officers’||JAIPUR: Ahead of the state budget, government nurses have come up with a demand to change the name of the posts on which they have been working. They do not like to be called Nurse grade-I or nurse grade-II. They want more respectful names such as nursing officers and senior nursing officers. They are approaching the health minister, state Congress chief and others to get their demand fulfilled. For nurse grade-I, they are demanding that they should be called senior nursing officer and the nurse grade-II want to be called nursing officer. The nursing associations have a pointed out that there are a lot of government employees whose designations have been changed with time. “At secretariat office, superintendents are known as administrative officers, patwaris are now development officers and there are 36 such posts whose names have been changed and they are being called officers. Why nurses cannot be called officers. We want nurses to be called nursing officer, senior nursing officer depending on their posts. There are a lot of cadres which are working on lesser pay scale in comparison to nurses, but they are being called officers,” said Pyarelal Chaudhary, state president, Rajasthan Nurses Association. The nurses have submitted their memorandum to state Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra, health minister Raghu Sharma and several MLAs. But, they claimed that their demand has not been fulfilled, despite organising dharna, rallies and peaceful protests in the last two years. The nurses’ association said if the government accept their demand, it will not have to spent any budget on it as it is a non-budget demand. The office-bearers of nursing associations said if Delhi government and governments and Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have changed the names of nurse grade I and nurse grade II as senior nursing officer and nursing officer, then Rajasthan government should also act on their demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nurses-demand-they-should-be-called-officers/articleshow/80695288.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Plan to redevelop Rajpath takes off||NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday kicked off the redevelopment of Rajpath and its surrounding area, which is also known as Central Vista Avenue, after getting all statutory approvals, including from the Heritage Conservation Committee and Delhi Urban Arts Commission. Union urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri performed the ‘bhoomi pujan’ for the project, which stretches from Vijay Chowk to India Gate. It includes refurbishing of landscaping and lawns. The government claimed that the green cover is being increased from 3.5 lakh sqm to about 3.9 lakh sqm and a proper irrigation system will be provided. The plan includes creating adequate public amenities with toilets, drinking water facilities and vending areas at 10 locations for visitors and tourists. Once completed, the entire area will be more pedestrian friendly with underpasses at Janpath and C-Hexagon crossing with Rajpath. Officials said adequate walkways will be provided along Rajpath and the canals. “Walkways across lawns with bridges over canals are being provided to ensure connectivity with parking, public amenities at 12 suitable locations.” The project also includes refurbishment of canals with proper lining and aerators to keep the water clean. The revamped project will also get adequate parking space for cars, two wheelers and buses. “There will be proper signage, lighting, CCTV cameras, drainage, rain water harvesting and water supply system,” said an official. The redevelopment works are scheduled for completion by November-December so that the new look Rajpath gets ready for the next Republic Day celebration. As per the plan, there will be a modern seating arrangement on the lawns to see the Republic Day celebration. TOI on December 21 had first reported that mechanised bleachers (tiered bench seats) will replace conventional seats, which will allow a better view of the parade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plan-to-redevelop-rajpath-takes-off/articleshow/80695221.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: ‘Not allowing Facebook rep to appear will impact working of legislatures’||NEW DELHI: Delhi Assembly on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that it had withdrawn notice to India head of Facebook Ajit Mohan, but issued a fresh notice to send some competent person to appear before its committee on peace and harmony, while contending that not allowing any company representative to appear before the panel will impact functioning of legislatures. While opposing Mohan's plea for quashing of notice for want of jurisdiction, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi assembly, submitted that a witness seeking advance ruling from court to not appear before a legislative panel would have wider ramification on the functioning for legislatures. He said if this “novel idea” of advance ruling by witnesses is accepted, it would be impossible for committees of any legislative assembly or Parliament to function. Singhvi accused Facebook of being on a “high constitutional horse” for refusing to appear before the committee. The top court, he said, has earlier repeatedly held that committee proceedings amount to House proceedings. “Normally the court doesn’t interfere with House proceedings,” he said. “A person summoned by Parliament will claim that the matter is exclusively in the state list and seek an advance ruling from a court even before he appears as a witness. Some of the answers given on behalf of the petitioners during oral arguments show that this is a real possibility if the unusual prayer herein is engaged with," he told a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy. He said fresh summon was issued on February 3 for appearance of Facebook India Online Services Pvt. Ltd before the Committee on Peace and Harmony on February 25 and it has already been served on the company through its available e-mail addresses and dispatched through post as well. He said the date of appearance had been intentionally fixed after three weeks as the matter was being heard by the apex court on a day-to-day basis. Taking the affidavit on record, the court passed a brief order incorporating Singhvi's statement. “Singhvi submits that since the legal position in the larger context is being debated ... the specific challenge to the earlier notices would not stand as those notices stand substituted with the fresh notice,” the order said. The assembly panel is looking into complaints on the “role or complicity of Facebook officials in the Delhi riots” of February last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-allowing-facebook-rep-to-appear-will-impact-working-of-legislatures/articleshow/80696920.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: ‘Railways must pay for not informing about ticket cancellation’||NEW DELHI: Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has held that Indian Railways failing to inform a passenger about ticket cancellation and making alternate travel arrangements would amount to deficiency in service. The commission upheld an order of a district forum, which had awarded Rs 25,000 compensation to the passenger in 2018 for mental agony. Indian Railways had challenged the decision before the commission. A bench of Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal and Anil Srivastava said, “We hold that the appellant was deficient in their service as they failed to inform the respondent about the cancellation of the ticket and also failed to make alternate arrangements for travel on the date of journey, i.e. October 20, 2015.” The railways, through the general manager of Northern Railway, had appealed on December 7, 2018. The compensation ordered was towards the mental agony and litigation cost borne by Himanshu Bohra. The counsel appearing for the railways submitted that the district forum had failed to note that the ticket amount was refunded without any delay and there was no “consumer relationship” left with the respondent. As a result, the district forum did not have the jurisdiction to entertain Bohra’s plea, it was submitted. The counsel also stated that the ticket was in the waiting list at the time of the journey and the forum had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint in view of sections 13 and 15 of Railways Claim Tribunal Act, 1987. On the other hand, the passenger’s counsel contended that Bohra had received the confirmation of his booking on September 14, 2015, and had learnt about the cancellation only after reaching the station. Indian Railways, the counsel argued, had failed to make any alternate arrangements for his client. He also stressed that the present appeal was filed by the appellant only to harass Bohra and deprive him of the compensation. The commission observed that Bohra had received a message informing him of the cancellation on October 21, 2015 — a day after the date of journey. “The cause of action in the said complaint firstly arose on September 14, 2015, when the respondent’s ticket was confirmed and the complaint case in question was filed in 2015 itself. Therefore, we hold that the district forum is not wrong in entertaining the said complaint as the same was filed within two years from the date on which cause of action has arisen,” the bench noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rlys-must-pay-for-not-informing-about-ticket-cancellation/articleshow/80695243.cms||Aamir Khan
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Havoc wreaked by Covid in 2020 to push back time-table this year too||NEW DELHI: The pandemic led to the 2020 academic session in universities beginning in September instead of the usual July. 2021 promises similar niggles. The disruption of the school calendar has forced Central Board of Secondary Education to push the Class XII exams to May, a couple of months from the regular schedule, and results are likely only in July. Colleges and universities, accordingly, have to plan a new timetable for their admissions in 2021. Shobha Bagai, Delhi University’s dean of admissions, explained that the university admission process could begin only after CBSE published its results. “Since the exams are ending in June and it takes at least a month to declare the results, our admissions can take place only after that,” she said. However, Bagai clarified, “Under the National Education Policy, there is a plan to conduct a common admission test for undergraduate courses. We can, therefore, begin the process based on the entrance test with the minimum eligibility of a Class XII pass. So, actually our admission process will depend on what the Union education ministry decides on the admission policy.” Balram Pani, DU’s dean of colleges, confirmed this. “DU’s admission policy and the schedule will be improvised according to what the ministry decides,” he said. At Jamia Millia Islamia, Nasim Hussain Jafri, controller of exams, was clear that the entry schedule would be decided by the university. “Even if the Class XII results are delayed, we can begin admissions based on provisional registration. Students can submit their marksheets later,” said Jafri, adding that classes for the 2020-21 first-year batch, which started in December, will end in March because of the reduced syllabus and will be followed by exams. IIT-Delhi will not grapple with the delay in CBSE results. “Our admissions are based on JEE Advance and they aren’t linked with the CBSE results,” pointed out V Ramgopal Rao, institute director. JEE Main will be held between May 24 and 28, and JEE Advanced on July 3. At Jawaharlal Nehru University, registrar Pramod Kumar hoped to conduct provisional admissions. “JNU admissions too will not be affected because they are based on the entrance exam conducted by the National Testing Agency. Admissions can be done on a provisional basis before the CBSE results are declared,” said Kumar Meanwhile, before May, schools will be dealing with two sets of students of classes X and XII. “One set of students would be those who have been promoted from classes IX and XI. The other would be the students waiting to write the final Class X and XII exams,” noted Ashok Pandey, director, Ahlcon Schools. He also hoped that nursery admissions began soon so as not to further affect the calendar for the coming academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/havoc-wreaked-by-covid-in-2020-to-push-back-time-table-this-year-too/articleshow/80695269.cms||Shradha Chettri

February 5, 2021||Delhi||Switch-hit: Mass campaign to popularise electric vehicles in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched the ‘Switch Delhi’ campaign, which is aimed at turning Delhi’s electric vehicle (EV) adoption movement into a mass movement. The Delhi government had launched an ambitious EV Policy in August last year with the vision that by 2024, 25% of all vehicles in the capital should be EVs. Kejriwal said ‘Switch Delhi’ was a mass awareness campaign to sensitise each Delhiite about the benefits of switching over to EVs to the environment as well as to make them aware of the incentives and infrastructure being developed under Delhi’s EV policy. The campaign aims at informing, encouraging and motivating every Delhiite to switch from polluting vehicles to zero-emission electric vehicles. He also said that “the Delhi government has decided that all hired cars being engaged by various departments of the Delhi government will transition to EVs within the next six months.” Kejriwal said, “the Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy has been called the most progressive EV policy in India and among the best globally. The Delhi government has rolled out the highest incentives on the purchase of EVs among all Indian states, which range from a maximum of Rs 30,000 for two and three-wheelers and up to Rs 1.5 lakh on the purchase of four-wheelers, which is transferred directly to the buyer’s bank account within three days of the purchase.” “We have made road tax and registration fees also completely free on EVs. Since EVs cannot run on petrol, we are issuing tenders to develop 100 public charging stations spread across the length and breadth of Delhi,” he said. “Since the launch of our EV policy in August, nearly 6,000 new EVs have been registered in Delhi. Maximum EVs have been registered under subsidies and the rest are in the process. This is not sufficient, we need to do much more to promote this on a large scale,” the CM said. “I appeal to each and every vehicle owner in Delhi to switch from polluting vehicles to zero-emission electric vehicles,” said Kejriwal. “I appeal to the youth to let their first vehicle purchase be an electric vehicle.” Kejriwal also requested the RWAs and market associations to help spread awareness and urged delivery fleets and large corporates to set targets to transition their entire fleet to EVs and to set up charging points on their premises. “I appeal to all malls, restaurants and commercial shopping complexes to plan and create public charging points in your parking lots,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/switch-hit-mass-campaign-to-popularise-e-vehicles/articleshow/80695293.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 45% calls made on ‘100’ in pandemic not related to policing||MUMBAI: Nearly 45% of phone calls received on Mumbai Police’s ‘100’ helpline during the pandemic months of June-December 2020 were not related to policing. The helpline received 6.9 lakh calls in the seven months, but only about 38% callers sought help in policing matters. Times ViewAgents operating Mumbai Police’s Dial 100 helpline handle close to 3,000 calls per day. Prank calls and calls made to harass them end up affecting them and should be dealt with very sternly. Blocking phone numbers of harassers and registering FIRs against them is a good step in this direction.Another 17% callers made genuine inquiries. Prank calls and calls made to harass helpline operators were among the irrelevant calls made to the helpline, which is manned by 50 agents, all women constables, who report to an officer-in-command. “We have callers who dial accidentally or calls from senior citizens who are lonely and want to talk. But there are also calls from pranksters who think they can never be tracked down. We have begun identifying phone numbers from where repeated calls are made to our agents to harass them. The numbers will be blocked and in serious instances, legal action will be initiated,” said an IPS officer. Despite some calls aimed at unnerving them, agents still brought to the fore cases like human-trafficking during the pandemic. On October 10, a woman who spoke Bengali called up the helpline. The agents were not well-versed in the language but two of them handled the call together and calmed her down. From few Bengali words they recognised, the agents pieced together that the woman and two others had been confined in a room for long. They informed their officer and got the call location tracked down. The women had been confined at Manpada in Thane. The agents informed Thane police and took updates from them until all three women, who turned out to be Bangladeshis, were rescued and a pimp was arrested. In another case in December 2020, a caller informed said a BMW had hit his car besides four others and fled towards Kurla. The agents relayed the message to police stations in the vicinity and the BMW was intercepted at Saki Naka. The motorist was booked for rash driving as he had injured two persons. The helpline also jumped to the rescue of a man trapped in snow at Himachal Pradesh. On December 13, a helpline agent received a call from a frantic Mumbaikar who said his friend had gone trekking and was trapped at one point with his mobile phone about to conk off. “The caller said he did not know who could help. We got in touch with the Himachal police control room. They told us that the area where the friend was trapped came under Chamba police station,” said an official. The helpline agents informed Chamba police and stayed in touch until the friend was rescued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/45-calls-made-on-100-in-pandemic-not-related-to-policing/articleshow/80695495.cms||Nitasha Natu

February 5, 2021||Hyderabad||Allow lawyers at revenue tribunals: Bar council to CM||HYDERABAD: Worried over the government’s decision to do away with advocates at the revenue tribunals, the Bar Council of Telangana (BCT) has urged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to rescind the move and allow lawyers to argue the cases of landowners.  “They may lose rights over their valuable properties and hence, presence of advocates to effectively put forward their case is essential,” A Narasimha Reddy, chairman of BCT said. The BCT even got the issue studied by an eight-member committee soon after the government’s decision, he stressed. He said the names of the landholders will have to be changed following transactions like sale, succession, transfer, inheritance, etc. “The landholders need proper assistance at the time of seeking mutations and denying entry to lawyers would effectively mean denying assistance to them,” the council chief said. All special tribunals are headed by district and additional collectors. They were given timelines to dispose of the cases. “They are not allowing the advocates to argue the cases of the landowners citing lack of instructions from the government. The purpose of the new revenue regime would be defeated if these tribunals deny principles of natural justice,” the committee of the bar council pointed out. When pattadar passbook-cum-title deed is recognised as a piece of evidence to prove a title and when farmers are allowed to avail loans on basis of such titles, it is not correct to deny legal assistance to the owners who are fighting for such titles, committee said. It further said old Record of Rights Act allowed the advocates to argue the cases before the revenue authorities. “It is unfair on the part of the authorities constituted under a special tribunal to deny advocate assistance to parties,” the committee reasoned. A Narasimha Reddy, chairman of BCT, said farmers and landowners will not be able to present their case in a proper format before the tribunals||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/allow-lawyers-at-revenue-tribunals-bar-council-to-cm/articleshow/80696943.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: How Amendment Bill may reignite power tussle laid to rest by top court||NEW DELHI: The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, included for consideration and passage in the current session of Parliament, is all set to revive the power tussle between the Union and state governments. The face-off began in 2015 after Arvind Kejriwal was swept to power in Delhi with a huge majority, and culminated on July 4, 2018 when the Supreme Court drew the power lines by decreeing that the city’s lieutenant governor, the representative of the central government, was bound to function with the aid and advice of the council of ministers. This verdict was a watershed moment for the Aam Aadmi Party government because the concurrence of the LG was no longer required for administrative issues, except those dealing with land, police and public order, which remained under the LG’s jurisdiction. The state government had often accused the LG of obstructing its many projects, but with the court granting it leeway, it initiated numerous schemes in a short period, which played a major role in the party's consecutive return to power in 2020. The post-July 2018 period has been conflict-free, barring the occasional confrontation between the two power centres over administrative matters like appointment of special public prosecutors. The thaw also improved the relationship of the elected government with the bureaucrats and quickened decision making and delivery. The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which aims to give more power to the LG, may put this peace at peril. Central government sources stated that the amendments are meant for “better governance” of the capital and to reduce potential conflicts. They propose to clearly enunciate the functions of the council of ministers and the LG. AAP, however, believes that the Bill gives unlimited powers to the LG and thus will subvert the mandate of a government democratically elected by the people of Delhi. There are apprehensions that the Bill will set off a fresh round of animosity, the sort that marked the first few years of AAP’s second stint in power. The differences began mostly in April 2015, with the LG demanding to see the files and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal telling bureaucrats not to bother the office of the LG with all the files. The then LG Najeeb Jung hit back by directing ministers and government officials to refer all files to his office. Among the jousting points were the appointment of acting chief secretary Shakuntala Gamlin by Jung. Kejriwal was opposed to his administrative move, and soon the gloves were off in a battle that continued to take on bizarre dimensions with every administrative twist and turn. A senior IAS officer, for example, was astounded to find his office in Delhi Secretariat locked when he came for work, apparently on the orders of the AAP government. When the turf war worsened, both the LG and Kejriwal knocked on the President’s door for clarity on the power structure. To settle the ambiguity, the Centre issued a notification clipping the wings of the AAP government. The war continued nevertheless, and bureaucrats found themselves caught in the crossfire. In December 2015, many officials went on mass leave to protest the alleged harassment of officers caught between the state and Union governments. Apart from governance, the biggest casualty of this dissonance was the morale of the bureaucrats. The situation exploded in February 2018 after Anshu Prakash, the then chief secretary, accused AAP MLAs of assault at a meeting at Kejriwal’s residence. This triggered protests by the IAS association and Delhi government officials and continued for some time. In June, complaining that the bureaucrats were not attending meetings called by ministers, the CM and four cabinet colleagues sat on a dharna in the LG’s office for nine days, seeking both the end to the crisis and approval for some government schemes. Soon after, the SC verdict largely settled the power tussle. In February 2019, there was a two-judge bench split verdict on finer issues of division of power, such as the prerogative to transfer and post IAS and administrative officers, but this did not change in the status quo in the power structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-amendment-bill-may-reignite-power-tussle-laid-to-rest-by-top-court/articleshow/80695327.cms||AlokKNMishra
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Polluting units put on natural gas||NEW DELHI: All polluting industrial units in Delhi now have piped natural gas supplies available to them, providing a cleaner alternative to fuels such as petcoke (petroleum coke) or fuel oil and boosting the national capital's fight against air pollution. “IGL (Indraprastha Gas Ltd) has overcome various challenges in laying gas pipelines, such as through narrow lanes, to comply with the directions of the Commission for Air Quality Management and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) well within the prescribed timelines,” company MD A. K Jana said on Thursday. IGL is the national capital’s sole supplier of CNG (compressed natural gas) and PNG. In 2018, DPCC had ordered IGL to ensure supply of natural gas to all industrial units in the capital by January 31, 2021. The committee had listed 1,644 polluting industrial units spread across 50 industrial areas in Delhi. A survey showed that 1,607 of these units could be converted to PNG, while the remaining had shut shop. Indraprastha Gas Ltd connected all these units with PNG service well before the deadline, Jana said. Company director Amit Garg said IGL played a pro-active role in reaching out to units using polluting fuels and engaged industry associations to reach out to every unit. IGL is now working with the respective state governments to convert all industrial units running on polluting fuel in the National Capital Region (NCR) to piped natural gas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/polluting-units-put-on-natural-gas/articleshow/80695342.cms||Sanjay Dutta
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Tasked with evicting squatters, corporations can’t clear over 950 of their own parks||NEW DELHI: Though the municipal corporations have been entrusted with the responsibility of removing encroachments across the city, an internal report shows that about 70 acres of land in 964 parks, which are run by the civic bodies themselves, have been taken over by squatters. The worst affected civic body is North Delhi Municipal Corporation where 461 parks with a cumulative area of 32.6 acres are encroached upon. It is followed by East Delhi Municipal Corporation where 221 parks with an area of 29.4 acres are overrun by squatters. The report added that north corporation was able to remove encroachments in only five parks. Out of the 6,802 parks run by South Delhi Municipal Corporation, 7.24 acres of 282 such green areas are encroached upon. The three municipal corporations cumulatively manage 14,851 of the 16,299 parks in Delhi. While north corporation has 5,944 parks under its jurisdiction, East Delhi Municipal Corporation runs 2,105. A comparison of the 12 administrative zones has revealed that the maximum scale of encroachment was in Shahdara (South) where 27.7 acres were encroached upon in 187 parks. This was followed by Rohini zone in which 21.7 acres in 240 parks had been taken over by squatters. These two zones alone account for over 70% of the encroachments. The report states that the encroachments are both religious and non-religious in nature. “There are encroachments in the shape of jhuggies, houses, temporary structures, chabutra, transformers, boundary walls and car parking. Concerted efforts should be made to free the land from encroachments. The non-removal of encroachments from municipal land and parks valued at crore of rupees is a major irregularity,” it added. A senior official said the matter was being taken up at various forums and some encroachments like religious structures could only be removed after approval from the religious committee headed by the lieutenant governor. Another official said many such cases were pending in courts or with the special task force. Section 498 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act mandates that “no person can remove earth, sand or other material or deposit any matter or make any encroachment on any land vested in the corporations or in any way obstruct the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tasked-with-evicting-squatters-corpns-cant-clear-over-950-of-their-own-parks/articleshow/80695380.cms||Paras Singh
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Forensic crime scene units on the move||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has come up with six new mobile forensic crime scene units to facilitate the process of collection and examination of evidence, home minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday. Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Jain said these units were deployed in various parts of the capital. The government will ensure that these units run 24×7 to ease the timely collection of evidence, he added. “In cases of atrocities against women, the DNA samples used to take more than 4-5 years to get detected, but now with the improved infrastructure, the results are coming in 1-2 months only,” said Jain. Deepa Verma, director of Forensic Science Laboratory, said that the laboratory had recruited scientific staff for the crime scene management division to constitute mobile forensic crime scene units for further deployment at range locations. “Senior officers of the laboratory will review the reports, supervise their working and lead these units.” The six new units have been constructed in the Eastern Range (to cover North East, Shahdara, East districts); Western Range (Dwarka and West districts); Central Range (Central and North districts); New Delhi Range (New Delhi and South-West districts); Southern Range (South West, South and South East districts) and in the Northern Range (to cover Rohini, Outer North, North West districts, Railways, Metro, Crime Branch, Anti-Corruption, Special Branch, Vigilance and others).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/forensic-crime-scene-units-on-the-move/articleshow/80696947.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Cops lodge FIR over claims of abuse of kids at shelter homes||NEW DELHI: Acting on a complaint by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), south district police have filed an FIR under Juvenile Justice Act and IPC Section 188 in connection with a range of violations at Umeed Aman Ghar and Khushi Rainbow Home and an NGO, Centre for Equity Studies. A special team has been formed to investigate the allegations. In 2012, Delhi Police had found instances of sexual abuse of three minors at the children’s homes affiliated to the NGO headed by former National Advisory Council member Harsh Mander. NCPCR members had carried out an inspection in October 2020 and in a report highlighted several irregularities and cases of child sexual abuse at the homes. The report, a copy of which is with TOI, stated that the commission, in a recent communication received from an employee at one of the homes, had received information that sexual abuse was still prevalent and no reporting was being done of the same. “The non-reporting of such offences by the staff of the homes is a serious offence under Pocso Act, 2012 and also jeopardises the welfare and well-being of the children,” added the report. Apart from this, girls in the shelter home were even taken to anti-CAA protest sites, which was in violation of the code of conduct. Priyank Kanoongo, the NCPCR chairperson, said, “Multiple violations have been highlighted in our report. There are discrepancies in the funding received through multiple sources. Funds from organisations linked with terror have also been received. The cabins in which the children were residing were of barely seven feet and made one over the other, which can be dangerous and life threatening.” “The last time the person in-charge had not reported about the sexual abuse, he was merely transferred. This was against the court order. The reason why sexual abuse occurs at the centre is because the bathrooms of the senior and junior boys are together. In fact, the number of bathrooms, staff members and councillors are inadequate,” added Kanoongo. DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, The complaint was submitted by the NCPCR registrar against the alleged violations at Umeed Aman Ghar and Khushi Rainbow Home and Centre for Equity Studies. A case under Juvenile Justice Act has been registered on the basis of an inspection by NCPCR teams in October 2020. Investigation is in progress.” Mander did not respond to messages or calls made by TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-lodge-fir-over-claims-of-abuse-of-kids-at-shelter-homes/articleshow/80695410.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Space, staff shortages hit home for the destitute||NEW DELHI: In dormitories meant for 570 residents there are 974 jostling for space. And that’s not all ailing Asha Kiran Home Complex, the lone Delhi government run facility in the national capital for the homeless and the destitute. It is also grappling with a staff shortage with 163 vacant posts including those of critical service providers like caregivers and special educators. This data on crowding and vacancies is part of a report that was shared at a review of the complex located in Rohini and the measures required to improve the conditions of the inmates. As per the minutes of the meeting of the governing council, the overcrowding is leading to the “sick building syndrome” and causing stress to inmates staying at the home which also houses the abandoned and children who are mentally challenged with nowhere to go. Chairperson of the governing council of the Asha Kiran Complex, Indu Prakash Singh, who led the first meeting since the new council was constituted in December, said that based on data shared by the administration it became clear not only is decongestion necessary but even open space is required to enable residents to step out. The council has also asked the administration to get an assessment of the complex done by the public works department to establish the per resident space requirement. The complex is spread over six acres inside a 22 acre park marked as green land. In this backdrop the council will now be reaching out to the social welfare department to seek an additional four acres from DDA from the green belt for playground and physical activities for residents. “No construction activity will be allowed in this space to maintain the sanctity of the land use but if the DDA agrees to annex the land with the insitutional complex it will help in giving some respite to residents from the crowded dormitories and cottages,” Singh told TOI. With 974 residents in a space for 570, clearly the resources in the campus are under strain and the Council has decided to push for expediting the proposal for re-construction of an existing building complex in Lampur into a facility for intellec-tually challenged children. It was also decided by the Council that children with mild intellectual disability may be assigned with normal children in other homes for a more inclusive experience. However, any such decision about moving a child to another home will be taken only after a review of a child with mild intellectual disability by the Child Welfare Committee and on the latter’s orders. It has also been decided to separate the home for children and adults completely at Asha Kiran. The data on vacancies is also very worrying as it shows that out of 731 posts, 163 are vacant. These vacancies include crucial service providers like 57 posts of caregivers. All eight posts sanctioned for matrons and six posts for special educators are vacant. The posts sanctioned for medical specialist, physiotherapist, clinical psychologist and pharmacist are also vacant. The governing council has now asked for posts like special educators and matrons to be filled urgently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/space-staff-shortages-hit-home-for-the-destitute/articleshow/80695442.cms||Ambika Pandit
February 5, 2021||Jaipur||Power connection norms simplified||JAIPUR: The Electricity Regulatory Commission on Thursday issued the power supply code under which the discoms have to provide connection, replacement of faulty meters and other services in a time-bound manner. The faulty meters have to be replaced within 24 hours in city areas while in rural areas it is 72 hours. All applications are online and hard copy is not mandatory. A single application form will replace multiple forms for various categories. Disconnected connections for non-payment had to be restored within six hours on payment of dues. As per the new code, power connection charges in non-electrified colonies have been made cheaper while in multi-storey buildings, the charges will be calculated as per the built-up area. For the affordable housing schemes and for industry, there has been an increase in load factor and voltage. According to the new electricity code 2021 issued after 16 years, the time limit for new connection has been reduced from 30 days to seven days while for senior citizens and physically challenged, the discoms had to take their services to their door steps. The voltage demand limit for 11 KV increased from 1,500 KVA to 2,500 KVA while for 33 KV voltage demand limit has been raised from 5,000 KVA to 8,000 KVA which will reduce the cost of the consumer. Similarly, the new code has attempted to simplify the procedure for power connection to new colonies, township, group housing, multi storey, farm house and industrial areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/power-connection-norms-simplified/articleshow/80695492.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Scholarships to kids bring relief to 25 women widowed in riots||NEW DELHI: On Wednesday, a big burden was lifted from the shoulders of 25 mothers, whose children had lost their fathers in the riots in northeast Delhi in 2020. They had been running from pillar to post for assistance and the CPI-M came to their rescue, offering the children scholarships at a function in Kardampuri. Shabina lost both her husband and her brother-in-law in the riots. “Since then, we have had to struggle even for something as basic as a proper meal,” said Shabina. “A woman gets respect only till her husband is alive. I wanted my children to study well so that they could avoid the hardships we faced, but educating them was becoming a problem.” Happy at the partial scholarships presented to her four daughters, Shabina felt she would now be able to put them through school. Her thoughts were echoed by Nitu Saini, a mother of two residing in Mustafabad. Recalling the worst days of her life, Saini talked of February 25 last year. “Violence was at its peak, but that day my husband chose to help his friends caught in a fight. He got shot and died on the spot. There was a stampede-like situation and we couldn’t do a thing. From that day on, life has been an uphill battle,” she added. Saini sells fruits in northeast Delhi but her earnings aren’t adequate enough to take care of her household and children. “I and other widows raised our voice because the assistance we got from the government was not enough. We learnt of a group that could help us with a partial scholarship for our children,” said Saini. “Now, every three months, we get Rs1,500, which takes care of the children’s school fees.” Another woman, who lost her husband on February 25 too, said, “I rushed from one mortuary to another before tracing my husband’s body. I still get nightmares about those days.” She could not make ends meet on the meagre compensation she was granted, but is grateful for the scholarships because, she said, “the cost of education is high”. Zayera, whose 40-year-old husband was returning home after visiting his ailing mother-in-law in Ghaziabad and was killed on the way, located his body in Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital only after three days of running to various mortuaries in search. “I was on the verge of a complete breakdown and life wasn’t easy afterward,” said Zayera. “I knit sweaters for a living, but then there weren’t many buyers. So, I used a bit of my money to rebuild my house and the rest to construct a small shop. But I was left with no funds to start any business.” The widow is still figuring out a way to help herself, and the scholarship money couldn’t have come at a more opportune moment. “At least, my children do not have to give up education because of our financial condition,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scholarships-to-kids-bring-relief-to-25-women-widowed-in-riots/articleshow/80695480.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Petition seeks stiffer penalty for cases of cruelty to animals||NEW DELHI: An online petition started by People for Animals (PFA) and Humane Society International (HSI) has garnered over 7.5 lakh signatures making the call for an amendment to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1970, louder. Through this petition, citizens are urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to raise the penalty for cruelty against animals, which is currently just Rs 50. Gauri Maulekhi, trustee, PFA, said: “Most animal cruelty cases are never reported. Despite being punishable criminal offences, cases of cruelty against animals continue unabated given the absence of a deterrent penalty in our law. With India being envisioned as a self–dependent nation, we must ensure we put in place regulations and laws that deter animal cruelty.” TimesViewA Rs 50 penalty won’t discourage any offender nowadays. The fine must be raised. However, the amendment should incorporate suitable checks and balances to ensure that the provision isn’t misused.PFA and HSI India started the petition on January 19 and within a fortnight, it has garnered 7.5 lakh number of signatures, including those of public representatives and celebrities like BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, MP Anubhav Mohanty, actors Pooja Bhatt, Manoj Bajpayee, Tiger Shroff, Shraddha Kapoor and singer Mohit Chauhan. HSI India managing director Alokparna Sengupta said, “The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, was enacted to replace a colonial legislation and sought to prevent infliction of unnecessary pain and suffering on animals. However, the penalty has not been reviewed even once in the six decades of the Act’s existence. The past year has seen some of the most heinous acts of animal cruelty in India and each horrific case highlighted the inability of the current law to protect animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/petition-seeks-stifferpenalty-for-cases-ofcruelty-to-animals/articleshow/80695455.cms||---

What is his compulsion? He should have worked towards generating employment and fixing the economy,” said Jully. A large number of farmers belonging to Nehra Khap and from the nearby villages of Alwar district participated in the general meeting at Shahjahanpur on Thursday. They also collected food items, oil, flour, rice and pulses from their respective villages in support of farmers’ movement.

The World Cancer Day theme for 2021 is ‘I am and I Will’. Taking it forward, Sarang said, the importance of early detection and providing a quality system of treatment has been formulated. Narrating a bottom-up approach, he explained that cancer identification would be undertaken at the Panchayat level. Furthermore, each of the medical colleges would have a virtual tumour board, wherein various doctors from major hospitals will come together via video conference and discuss various complicated cases. National Cancer Grid is a network of major cancer centres, research institutes, patient groups and charitable institutions across India with the mandate of establishing uniform standards of patient care for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer, providing specialized training and education in oncology and facilitating collaborative basic, translational and clinical research in cancer. MP Directorate of Medical Education (DME) has proposed setting up of linear accelerators in seven colleges – Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Sagar, Vidhisha and Rewa on PPP model. Each of the medical colleges would also have comprehensive diagnostic histopathology setup, radiation therapy, surgical oncology among others for cancer treatment. Our aim is to provide universal health care with access to high quality and affordable cancer care backed by a robust public health system, said a DME official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/7-med-colleges-in-mp-to-have-linear-accelerator-for-cancer/articleshow/80693799.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Four held for running fake call centre to dupe US residents||NEW DELHI: A fake call centre at Tughlaqabad Extension has been busted when four men were arrested for allegedly duping people in the US by hacking their systems to make them believe that the security of their e-wallets had been breached. The accused then charged them on the pretext of fixing the “breach”. The mastermind has been identified as 36-year-old Aneesh Ahmad, who had worked at a BPO in Gurgaon. His associates are Shivendra Mani Tripathi (34), a BTech graduate who had worked with MNCs in Gurgaon; Ankit Pradeep (22), a BCom student; and Ashish Thapliyal (26), who had worked at a high-end hotel in Manesar after studying hotel management. None of the men has any previous criminal involvement. Eight laptops and six mobile phones have been seized. DCP (southeast) R P Meena said the gang used to dupe victims in the name of selling anti-virus. Ahmad allegedly said they had managed to get a toll free number thorough a person in Lucknow to pose as a legitimate customer care centre of e-wallet companies. The money was routed to accounts of a few people who used to charge 60-70% as commission before giving Ahmad the rest in cash and gift cards, Meena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-held-for-running-fake-call-centre-to-dupe-us-residents/articleshow/80695489.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Ahmedabad||Covid impact: Gujarat gets Rs 10k crore less from Centre||GANDHINAGAR: Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Gujarat government has lost a sizeable Rs 7,972 crore in the form of central share of taxes in the ongoing financial year. A comparison of the budget estimates (BE) and revised estimates (RE) for 2020-21 of the government of India reflects a huge drop in both central share of taxes and grants for the state. As far as central share of taxes is concerned, Gujarat was allocated Rs 26,661.7 crore in the Union Budget 2020-21 (BE) while in the RE (revised estimates), the amount has been pegged at Rs 18,689.4, reflecting a lesser allocation of Rs 7,972 crore in the share of central taxes. The state has been allocated Rs 2,362 crore towards rural local bodies in the 2021-22 Union Budget, a shortfall of Rs 833 crore compared to the allocation of Rs 3,195 crore in the 2020-21 Budget. Similarly, for urban local bodies, Gujarat has been allocated Rs 1,163 crore in the 2021-22 Budget, Rs 375 crore lesser than the allocation of Rs 1,538 crore in the 2020-21 Budget. Key sources in the state government informed that after the detailed study of the Budget, it has been realized that Gujarat’s allotment has dropped by at least Rs 10,000 crore. “The allocation to Gujarat is lesser by about Rs 10,000 crore. The cut is mainly in the central government’s share of taxes. We expect that by the end of March, we will only get the amount mentioned in the revised estimates,” a source said. Sources added that the reduction in allocation of funds will reflect in the state’s budget which is to be announced next month. Like the Union government, which has witnessed a drop in its revenues because of the pandemic, the state government has also faced loss in revenues in the form of taxes that it collects – mainly VAT on fuel and liquor, stamp duty, registration fees, vehicle taxes and the like. The upcoming state budget, scheduled on March 3, is bound to reflect both – reduced allocation by the Union government and lesser tax collection in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-impact-guj-gets-rs-10k-cr-less-from-centre/articleshow/80695555.cms||Kapil Dave

February 5, 2021||Jaipur||ACB had several proofs against IPS officer||JAIPUR: Ahead of IPS officer Manish Agarwal’s arrest for alleged corruption during his stint as Dausa SP, the ACB has received at least six more complaints who claimed to have been victims of his larger extortion racket. ACB had on Tuesday Agarwal, almost a fortnight after arresting two SDMs of Dausa and Bandikui, respectively, along middleman Neeraj Meena who was demanding Rs 38 lakh on behalf of the IPS officer. “Prior to his arrests, we got 164 CrPC statements of contractors of the company engaged in building a road in Dausa district which is part of Bharat Mala. In the statements, it is clear how the IPS officer during his stint as Dausa SP first started penalising the vehicles engaged in road construction and later authorized Meena to demand bribe for stopping police action,” said ACB DGP BL Soni. He added that it was unlikely that a person who had given statements before the magistrate can turn hostile later. “Also, we have recovered some diaries and other incriminating documents which will be used as corroborating evidences against the officer. We will soon apply for his prosecution sanction and will try to file a strong charge-sheet with evidence,” he added. ACB ADG Dinesh MN said, “After his arrest, we got six more complaints who claimed to have been victimised by the officer. Hopefully, they will be our witnesses in the case to tell the prosecution on the deep-rooted corruption by the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-had-several-proofs-against-ips-officer/articleshow/80695597.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Madurai||Plea to declare Lord Murugan as Tamil god dismissed||Madurai: Madras high court on Thursday dismissed a plea urging the state government to pass a government order declaring Lord Murugan as Tamil god. A division bench of Justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi observed that seeking to declare one deity as Tamil god would damage the fibre of the federal and secular nature of the country emphasised in the preamble of the Constitution.Hence they said the prayer sought by the petitioner G Thirumurugan, an advocate from Ramanathapuram district, cannot be granted including a direction to consider the representation. Though he has a justifiable reason to refer to Lord Murugan as a Tamil god which was for him to do so, as a state, such a request is not feasible for consideration. The judges observed that the petitioner also cited a statement made by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami referring to Lord Murugan as Tamil god. However, the CM’s said reference for declaring a public holiday during Thai Poosam festival cannot be relied upon for seeking relief. Hence, the judges said the petition cannot be entertained and dismissed it.

February 5, 2021||Madurai||Spell Tamil Nadu as Thamizh Naadu: Plea||Madurai: Madras high court on Thursday directed the state government to consider a petitioner’s representation to change the spelling of Tamil Nadu in English to “Thamizh Naadu or Tahmizh Naadu”.Petitioner M Selva Kumar, a Tamil enthusiast from Tuticorin district, stated that the word Tamil is wrongly represented while written in English. The correct representation of the pronunciation would be Tahmizh or Thamizh in English, he said. The letter zha in Tamil language is very significant. Several literatures including Sangam literature had emphasised the uniqueness of Tamil letter zha and our land was called Thamizhagam and Tamizh Naadu.Hence, the petitioner moved the Madurai bench seeking to make changes in representing Tamil Nadu in English as Thamizh Naadu or Tahmizh Naadu. He also sought to use this correct form of representation in government communications and orders. The special government pleader appearing for the state submitted that the request of the petitioner would be considered by the government.A division bench of Justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi observed that though they find some force in the request of the petitioner, they do not wish to get into the discretion of the administration.  The judges said they hope and trust that the government would consider the representation by considering the relevant materials including the uniqueness involved in Tamil letter ‘zha’ as contended by the petitioner. The judges disposed of the petition by asking the state government to take appropriate decisions in this regard within eight weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/spell-tamil-nadu-as-thamizh-naadu-plea/articleshow/80696988.cms||---

These unique attractions have not only attracted tourists, but also brought in many film and TV producers, including some of the Hollywood biggies, to shoot their films here. During the pandemic, when most of the business enterprises are struggling to survive, the state has seen a marked increase in the number of films and webseries shot across cities. In 2020-21, 35 films, webseries and TV serials were shot in the state, said an official of Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board (MPTB). “Out of these, around 18 were shot post Covid-19 lockdown; over 20 projects are lined up in the coming weeks. In comparison, 30 projects were shot in the state in 2019-20,” he added. Tourism board has taken several pro-active steps that have started bearing fruits now. MD of MPTB, Sheo Shekhar Shukla, said, “Having a film policy in place and stunning locations, have been very well-received by entertainment industry. We are committed to set up a world-class setup, including film city, film studios and allied infrastructure. We also want to see state-of-the-art skill upgradation in MP, so that filmmakers who come here, get each facility, along with technical know-how and best possible crew in the state.”  All these measures are expected to generate a lot of employment and boost the economy of the state. During the ongoing pandemic, the tourism board is busy marketing the state in the right places. “Film facilitation cell of the tourism department has contacted various production houses to inform them that Covid guidelines are strictly in place across the state and they can start the shoots here. It makes the filmmakers’ work easier,” said an official. Setting a film policy in March 2020 helped MP, said the MD and added, “Recently we also launched a single window permission portal online, which has added to the ease of shooting in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-turns-a-film-shoot-hub-in-covid-times/articleshow/80693865.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

However, the judges disposed of the petition by directing the central government to consider the petitioner’s request.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-print-netaji-pic-on-currency-notes/articleshow/80696991.cms||---

The money was used by Papla for his needs while he was on the run. This was revealed by the police team interrogating the gangster and his woman friend who were arrested from a house in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur.

We have found in the investigation that apart from Jia, there was another woman who was in touch with Papla and her bank accounts were used. A total deposit of almost Rs 10 lakh was seen in two bank accounts including one that belongs to Jia. So, she was clearly harbouring a criminal,” said Jaipur Range IG Hawa Singh Ghumeria. Ghumaria added that police have also identified a few other people who helped Papla with money and accommodation. “For harbouring a criminal, we are going to arrest few more people,” he added. Meanwhile, taking lessons from the past, Rajasthan police was taking special precaution and security of Neemrana police station where Papla is kept for police interrogation during the police remand of 15 days. “We have more than 200 policemen in and around the police station including more than 60 armed commandos. Also, we are monitoring the area using drone cameras. Nobody can dare to come and apply their tricks here this time,” warned Ghumaria. On the other hand, Jia was sent to judicial custody by the court. “More arrests likely in this case,” Ghumaria added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/200-cops-guard-police-station-where-papla-is-being-grilled/articleshow/80695640.cms||Ashish Mehta

February 5, 2021||Madurai||Residents fume as sewage water floods Kamarajarpuram||Madurai:The residents of Kamarajarpuram have urged Madurai Corporation officials to find a permanent solution to the overflowing sewage water, which has been troubling them for the past three years.The residents said that sewage water is overflowing frequently in the Kamarajarpuram North Street inundating the 100-metre stretch. It takes two to three days for the water to be cleared by the corporation every time after the issue is raised at various levels. They said that they live in fear that water stagnation could result in sanitation issues, which can affect their health.Whenever they raise a complaint, officials visit the place with a suction truck to clear the water. But, the issue resurfaces within a few days.C Jagadish, a resident, said that the road is stagnated with sewage water for the third day. “We find it hard to live here with the foul smell emanating from the water.

February 5, 2021||Madurai||SR needs Rs 11Kcr, got only Rs 95cr for 11 rly lines: MP||Madurai: The Railway Pink Book for 2021-22 released on Thursday states that only Rs 95 crore has been allotted for 11 new railway lines in Southern Railway (SR) in 2021-22 against the requirement of Rs 11,000 crore, said Madurai MP Su Venkatesan, addin that it includes a meagre Rs 1,000 each for nine new lines. “This clearly shows that development projects in Tamil Nadu are boycotted by the Centre,” he stated. “This is the second year Tamil Nadu is being humiliated with such meagre allotments. This has happened despite me taking it up in the parliament and the chairman of the Railway Board when such meagre allotments of Rs 1,000 each were made for a few lines in the state in the 2019-20 Budget. This will affect the development of the state. I will raise the issue in the ongoing Budget session,” the MP who is in Delhi told TOI. According to the pink book, Rs 95,00,09,000 has been proposed as outlay for 11 new lines in SR. The highest is Rs 75 crore for the 17.2 km Rameswaram - Dhanushkodi line against the project cost of Rs 206.7 crore, followed by Rs 20 crore for the 143.5 km Madurai - Aruppukottai - Tuticorin line. Nine lines have been allotted Rs 1,000 each, of which seven are in TN.  “Many of these ‘new line’ projects were announced by the government five to six years ago. Such meagre allotments year-on-year will delay completion of these projects by many years,” Venkatesan said. Engineer, activist and rain fan R Pandiaraja said that Rs 1,000 is insufficient to buy even one foot of steel rail line or a sleeper. “Three years ago the cost incurred for laying one kilometre broad gauge line and electrification was Rs 10 crore. It is now between Rs 11 crore to Rs 13 crore not including cost of bridges, culverts and other structures enroute. Meagre allotments will only keep the projects active on paper for years,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sr-needs-rs-11kcr-got-only-rs-95cr-for-11-rly-lines-mp/articleshow/80697012.cms||M K Ananth

The new films are not being released, so what do we offer to the spectators even if cinema halls start operating?” said president of Bhopal Cine Association, Deepak Simhal. “Bhopal Talkies or PVR or Cinepolis, which are open, too, have nothing to show to the spectators. They are on someday and off another day. Cinema halls will start operating from March 24,” he said. When asked why March 24, he said, “Suryavansham is releasing on March 31 and Godzilla before that, the cinema halls will start operating before that.” Owner of Rang Mahal and Sangeet Talkies, Bunny Singh, said, “Don't expect cinema halls to open before March or April. It 's only after new big-budget films featuring mega stars start releasing that cinema halls will open.” “Let alone little-known dubbed films, if films — which have been superhits in the recent past like Bahubali or Three Idiots are screened, not even 100 people will come to see those films. Therefore, without new films releasing, there is no possibility of cinema halls opening up.” He further said that the SOPs issued by the ministry of information and broadcasting for cinema halls are very tough and would prove very costly when the theatres open. “The guidelines ask for sanitisation of the cinema halls after each show. Where does it happen? Are the trains operated by the railways or flights operated by Air India sanitised after each trip? I don't think so. Newspaper reports also suggest that the address and phone nos. of people coming to watch the film will have to be taken down so that it could be used for contact tracing, if required. They are also asking for a person to be deputed at a distance of every six feet in the cinema halls. The SOPs are very tough and we shall be spending Rs 1 lakh extra, if they remain the same till March, when the cinema halls are likely to open,” he said. Manager of Jyoti Talkies, which had started operations after Diwali but was soon closed again, however, said that SOPs will have to be followed, and there is nothing wrong with the SOPs, but it would definitely raise the cost for cinema hall owners by Rs 70,000-80,000. Secretary of Bhopal Cine Association, Aziz Ahmed, said several big-budget films are ready, but it would take at least a couple of months to promote the films. Film stars will attend popular TV shows, teasers and trailers will be released, then the film will be released. “No producer or director would release a film made at a cost of Rs 100 crore or Rs 200 crore without adequate preparations. Therefore, new films will not start releasing before March and only then will the cinema halls open.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/despite-lifting-of-curbs-cinemas-to-open-only-by-march-end/articleshow/80693886.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Aurangabad||Cop attached to control room after assault||Aurangabad: Superintendent of Aurangabad rural police Mokshada Patil passed an order on Wednesday to attach an assistant police inspector of Shiur police station to the control room after his brutal assault by a group of suspects in the Cidco area on Monday. Patil stated that an inquiry will be carried out to ascertain the truth about the incident. The officer in question, Satyajit Taitwale, was apparently on leave citing some medical emergency at home. As per preliminary reports, Taitwale, along with an acquaintance, had gone to a hotel in the Cidco area. A brawl broke out between him and another group. Soon after Taitwale left the hotel, six suspects followed him, waylaid him in the Cidco area and then publicly assaulted him using rods. Taitwale sustained multiple injuries in the incident. He is said to have been discharged from hospital and is recuperating at home. Despite repeated attempts by authorities from Aurangabad city police in reaching out to the officer, he has refused to record his statement or even lodge a complaint against the suspects. Vithal Pote, inspector at MIDC Cidco police station, said, “We are open to registering an offence provided the officer comes forward with his complaint.” The officer said his team had also reached out to the officer and were awaiting his response about lodging a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cop-attached-to-control-room-after-assault/articleshow/80692796.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Fake GST billing scam of Rs 513 crore unearthed||AHMEDABAD: After extensive raids conducted in Bhavnagar, Ahmedabad and Gandhidham, by the enforcement wing of the state goods and services tax (SGST) department on Thursday, a fake billing scam of Rs 513 crore was unearthed. According to SGST department officials, the total taxable value of these bogus bill transactions happened to be Rs 451 crore and taxes of Rs 81 crore were evaded using these fake bills. SGST officials raided 40 locations for suspected tax evasion in 19 companies, of which 11 were in Bhavnagar. Fake bills were utilized to evade taxes without actual movement of goods – an age-old modus operandi in the GST fake billing scams reported thus far. The department officials have already begun proceedings to cancel these GST registration numbers. That apart, attempts are also being made to recover the evaded tax amount from the beneficiaries of these fake bills. Of the 40 locations, raids were conducted at 12 locations of Electrotherm (India) Limited and Hans Ispat Limited. During these raids, details of unaccounted transactions worth Rs 46.69 crore, including fake bills to evade taxes, were revealed from Electrotherm India Limited, on which no taxes were paid. SGST department officials recovered taxes worth Rs 10 crore on the spot, during the raids. That apart, Integrated Induction Power and Indus University were also raided and tax amount of Rs 92.66 lakh and Rs 8.44 lakh was respectively recovered on the spot from the concerned parties. Following a tip-off, a truck carrying goods of Electrotherm India Limited was intercepted on Wednesday, where some 50 boxes full of documents pertaining to GST and VAT was found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fake-gst-billing-scam-of-rs-513-crore-unearthed/articleshow/80695715.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Madurai||‘Rs 80cr memorial for convict, not even 6ft for Kalaignar’||Ramanathapuram: The AIADMK government that has built a memorial worth Rs 80 crore at the Marina for J Jayalalithaa, who was convicted for graft, was not ready to provide six feet to bury former CM M Karunanidhi, DMK president and leader of the opposition M K Stalin said at the second leg of the ‘Ungal Thoguthiyil Stalin’ event he kickstarted in Ramanathapuram on Thursday.“Can we give a place in Tamil Nadu for these people who did not provide a small piece of land to bury Kalaignar,” he asked the crowd at the meeting held at Thelichathanallur panchayat in Paramakudi. ‘No’, came the answer, as he called upon them to save the state from “such political hypocrites”.Stalin said the CM is making bold statements at empty chairs in the assembly. To the CM’s claim that the DMK is trying to make political gain by taking up the release of the seven Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convicts, the opposition leader asked if the state government tried to make political gains when they passed the resolution in the assembly two years ago. “Did we oppose it when it was passed? We welcomed it,” he said.“Earlier I said we will win 200 seats. I have now gained confidence of winning all the 234 assembly segments. We will not only rectify the wrongdoings of the present government but also get them punished,” he said.He said that their chief minister will give people the educational wealth that Kamarajar gave as CM, ensure the state’s rights are protected as it was when C N Annadurai was CM and ensure welfare schemes and development works are taken up as under Karunanidhi as CM.Stalin said DMK will meet the education expenses of the children of the four fishermen from Ramanathapuram district who were killed in the attack by Sri Lankan Navy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rs-80cr-memorial-for-convict-not-even-6ft-for-kalaignar/articleshow/80697038.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Pune||Maharashtra: Pending Temghar work likely next month||PUNE: The stock in Temghar reservoir has dropped to under 25% of its capacity, with the irrigation department gearing up to finish repairs to the dam’s wall and undertake strengthening work. The reservoir can hold 3.70 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water, and was filled to 100% following last year’s monsoon. Since then, the irrigation department has steadily released water from the reservoir to facilitate the work. Officials said they expect the work to begin once the reservoir is fully empty — likely next month. The irrigation department has been working on arresting the seepage from the dam’s wall. About 95% of the seepage has been plugged, with the remainder to be fixed next month. The department would also undertake the second phase of strengthening the wall. “It is necessary to bring down the live storage of the dam to zero as the work needs to be carried out near the bottom of the wall from the inside. Our plan of action is ready. Work would begin once the storage level drops,” an irrigation department official said. P S Kolhe, superintending engineer with the irrigation department said, “An expert committee is satisfied with the work carried out so. About 5% of the repair work is pending.” Temghar and its catchment areas received over 3,000mm of rainfall last monsoon. Water was released in the past four months into the Khadakwasla reservoir with an eye on the pending repairs. An irrigation department official said no water was wasted, as it was discharged into Khadakwasla through a proper channel. “In fact, the stock in bigger reservoirs, like Panshet and Varasgaon, has remained above 75% as water from Temghar was used on priority. On Thursday, Panshet was filled to 94% of its capacity (10.65 TMC) and Varasgaon (12.82 TMC) was 76% full,” the department officials stated. The irrigation department has said it has allocated Rs17 crore for the work on the dam wall. “Additionally, a proposal for around Rs98 crore, to carry out enhance strengthening, awaits the state government’s nod,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pending-temghar-work-likely-next-month/articleshow/80695718.cms||Sarang Dastane
February 5, 2021||Pune||Pune railway division sees passenger revenue fall 90% in 2020, pins hopes on goods trains||PUNE: The Pune railway division, which recorded a 90% dip in passenger revenue last year as compared to 2019, has pinned hopes on goods movement this year to pare down its losses. The last time the revenue was affected was in late 2018 and mid-2019 when the ghat section was closed fully/partially for four-five months for repairs after a series of landslides triggered by incessant rains. “But that cannot be compared with the situation in 2020. While the passenger revenue was Rs673.91 crore in 2019, the pandemic and lockdown reduced it to Rs72.50 crore in 2020. However, we are trying to focus on goods transport to narrow down the losses,” a railway official told TOI. Manoj Jhawar, public relations officer, Pune rail division, said that the railways was witnessing a steady rise in goods transport with the help of business development units (BDUs). “We have tied up with big automobile companies like Tata and Mahindra to transport cars and other products,” he said. A glance at the data reveals that goods revenue went down by 45.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, the parcel and luggage revenue of the Pune rail division also dipped by 61%. “This is because many companies started opening after the lockdown, but production has not been 100%. However, with many being vaccinated and cases dropping, we expect to see business growing by the end of March,” another official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-railway-division-sees-passenger-revenue-fall-90-in-2020-pins-hopes-on-goods-trains/articleshow/80695746.cms||Joy Sengupta

February 5, 2021||Madurai||Vanishing zebra lines pose threat to pedestrians’ lives||Madurai:The key junctions in Madurai city are yet to become pedestrian friendly as many of them have no zebra crossing and a few have faded markings. In the absence of zebra crossings, pedestrians cross roads at the will resulting in chaos at signals posing a threat to the lives of pedestrians.As the month-long road safety awareness programme is underway, commuters and pedestrians have urged the authorities to take swift action and fix the issue. They have pointed out that the audio systems installed at some of the junctions to guide pedestrians, especially for the blind, do not serve the purpose, as they keep on instructing pedestrians to cross the road whether it is green signal or red signal. “It is shouting all the time asking the pedestrian to cross the road. It would be risky if a blind person tries to cross the road listening to the audio,” said A Panimalar, a pedestrian.R Shahnawaz, a pedestrian, said that there is a zebra crossing at Aavin Junction for the pedestrians to cross the Kuruvikaran Salai. But the median has been extended and constructed on the zebra crossing, leaving the pedestrians to cross at will. S Senthil Kumar, a commuter, said, “Pedestrians crossing at their will is a nightmare for people at the wheels. They cannot be blamed as most of the junctions are yet to get zebra crossing.” When contacted, an official from the traffic wing of Madurai city police said that it is the duty of the authorities concerned to ensure that road markings are in place properly. They are in the process of sending a letter to the Madurai district collector seeking his directives, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vanishing-zebra-lines-pose-threat-to-pedestrians-lives/articleshow/80697041.cms||V Devanathan
February 5, 2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Fuel prices on fire, residents feel the heat||BHOPAL: Petrol and diesel prices in Bhopal were hiked by 34 and 35 paise respectively on Thursday. The price of the petrol remained at Rs 94.52 per litre in Bhopal while diesel was priced at Rs 84.81 a litre. In the last three months, petrol and diesel prices in the state capital went up by almost Rs 6 per litre. The fuel remains costliest in Anuppur where the petrol and diesel are priced little over Rs 97 and 87 a litre, respectively. The state government levies huge amount of taxes on petrol and diesel, making MP one of the states where fuel cost is extremely high. Meanwhile, people across the state still wait for the much needed "financial relief" obliquely hinted by the finance minister Jagdish Devda last month. Responding to a question on recovery of economy and impact of pandemic, Devda had said on January 30, “Raahat mil sakti hai” ( people may get relief) but he did not elaborate. Sources in the government, however, said, “Ahead of budget, an exercise is on to understand the impact of ‘relief’ on government’s coffers.The government is considering various permutations and combinations.” The state collects about Rs 27.75 on every litre of petrol sold in Madhya Pradesh, including a cess of Rs 4.50 and collects about Rs 18.75 on diesel including Rs 3 as cess. Quantum of revenue generated through fuel can be gauged from the fact that after a hike of Re 1 on fuel as cess to compensate for the revenue loss during corona-crisis, the government had aimed to collect an estimated Rs 570 crore annually -Rs 200 crore from petrol and Rs 370 crore from diesel. Along with common man, even the retailers now demand that fuel prices should be reduced. “ We now require more capital to procure the fuel on a daily basis while our margin of profit remains the same,” they lamented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fuel-prices-on-fire-residents-feel-the-heat/articleshow/80693934.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Pune||Pune: Barely five months into service, Siba sniffs & helps cops crack hard-to-detect crimes||PUNE: Barely two years old and five months into service, female Doberman sniffer dog Siba has already become a key member of the Pune rural police in the investigation and detection of some serious crimes that were, otherwise, difficult to solve. Recently, Siba helped the police trace a man who had raped and brutally assaulted a woman in Shirur to the extent that the survivor lost both her eyes. The female canine was also instrumental in solving a highway robbery case in Ranjangaon, where the police barely had any clue other than a piece of cloth and two pairs of slippers they had recovered from the crime scene. After sniffing the cloth, Siba led the investigators on a 3km-walk to a spot from where the police collected dumb data of mobile phones and eventually zeroed in on the culprits. At Nanded Phata, a murder that was passed off as a case of the victim committing suicide by jumping from a building’s terrace was also detected, thanks to Siba. “We found a cloth at the spot. This was enough for Siba. She directed the police personnel to two of the victim’s friends, who eventually turned out to be the murder suspects,” said Sibas’s proud handler, hawaldar Ganesh Phopale. “What sets Siba apart from other sniffer dogs in the police unit is her young age and efficiency in undertaking long trails. Usually, older sniffer dogs tend to slow down during long trails and eventually lose focus. But that’s not the case with Siba,” he said. B H Choudhari, another handler of Siba, said, “She is very active compared to other sniffer dogs and good at smelling objects, identifying those and following the perpetrator’s trail. She keeps at it and follows the trail or scent relentlessly, which is an added advantage.” . Superintendent of Police (Pune rural) Abhinav Deshmukh said, “Siba has proven very effective for us in detecting all such cases.” Siba was trained at the state Criminal Intelligence Department’s dog training centre at Shivajinagar for nine months to detect thefts, dacoities, robberies, rape and murder, commonly referred to as IPC (Indian Penal Code) crimes. “Here, a dog’s skills depend upon how it follows the trail left by a criminal after smelling different things,” Phopale said. Both her handlers stated that Siba was put through a well-planned training exercise and dietary routine, besides, grooming sessions and techniques of smelling and chasing things.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/barely-five-months-into-service-siba-sniffs-helps-cops-crack-hard-to-detect-crimes/articleshow/80695780.cms||Gitesh Shelke
February 5, 2021||Madurai||Schools can opt for classes on alternate days: Madurai CEO||Madurai: As the state government has permitted the schools to reopen for Class IX and XI starting February 8, preparations are underway in schools to welcome the students. With some schools facing issues of shortage/overburdening of staff and being unable to ensure social distancing, schools have been given the option of holding classes through shift system or on alternate days.Madurai district chief educational officer (CEO), R Swaminathan has given strict instructions to adhere to Covid-19 safety SOPs given. “Crowding is prohibited at all times, even during entry and exit. Only 25 students are permitted in a classroom. So, schools which are finding it difficult to manage without enough classrooms to maintain social distancing or have shortage of staff as same teachers have to attend to a large number of students, have been asked to go for shift system or have classes for IX and XI and X and XII students on alternate days of the week,” he said. As per directions given, periodical sanitization is particularly insisted upon at the end of classes.“Space should not be a concern as we can have students sit outdoors in the grounds as well if needed. However, the burden for teachers is a concern. We have limited number of teachers for high school and higher secondary level and they often handle multiple sections already. So, we decided to have students come on alternate days next week,” said the headmaster of a government-aided school. Teachers, however, are also concerned about loss of time if classes are set for alternate days.“Especially as board exams are approaching and students have to prepare for practical work as well, classes on alternate days are a concern. They need to come to school. Having online classes and offline classes on alternate days is also not practical for the staff. We worked out batches for students to attend theory and practical classes for Class X and XII. Similarly, by dividing in to batches, we should manage for other classes too,” said the principal of a private school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-can-opt-for-classes-on-alternate-days-madurai-ceo/articleshow/80697047.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Pune||NFAI revamps 2 vaults to ensure long reel life||PUNE: The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has completed the revamp and refurbishment of two of its three vaults at its flagship Law College Road campus. The multi-year refurbishment project of the three vaults, which can store upwards of one lakh film reels, entailed complete overhaul of its three-decade-old climate control mechanism. This is crucial to ensure long life of film reels, particularly old ones that are made of more combustible material. The NFAI also took inputs from leading film preservation and archiving experts from around the world. “These vaults at the Law College Road campus were made in the 90s. So, the various systems, especially the air-conditioning, had served its useful life. We took the help of leading preservation and archiving experts like Milton Shefter, who has been advising us for some time. The largest vault is now complete, which can store 50,000 reels. The second vault is also complete, and we are resuming storage in them. The third one will be complete in the next five or six months,” said Prakash Magdum, the NFAI director. Besides the climate control equipment, the cans for the reels are stored have also undergone a change in design. The steel cans are being replaced by plastic ones, and the cans are designed to be less airtight than the previous ones, so that the reels “can breathe”, said NFAI officials. “The air-conditioning equipment for the three vaults needed some space to be kept in previously. Due to the new equipment, nearly all that space has been freed up for storage of reels. We are furnishing that space now, so that we can store up to 30,000 reels,” Magdum said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nfai-revamps-2-vaults-to-ensure-long-reel-life/articleshow/80695754.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

February 5, 2021||Madurai||More than 50% cancer deaths due to late diagnosis, say docs||Madurai: Despite the increasing success rate of treatments for all forms of cancer, late diagnosis in majority of the cases in India and states like Tamil Nadu has lead to death in more than 50% of patients, said doctors at a private hospital in Madurai, while observing World Cancer Day on Thursday.Addressing the media, medical experts at Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC) said that the country can halve the cancer deaths by popularizing preventive health check-ups and investing in medical infrastructure for comprehensive early detection and treatment.Dr KS Kirushnakumar, head of oncology, MMHRC, highlighted that in India, cancer is the second largest cause of death next to heart disease. “In the recent years, more than 12 lakh Indians were diagnosed with various forms of cancer annually, and there are about 8 lakh deaths. Tamil Nadu is among the top 10 states in terms of the prevalence of cancer. A major reason for the high mortality rate is the late diagnosis,” he said.Dr Krishnakumar Rathnam, senior consultant and head, medical oncology, said that cancer cases in India are likely to increase to 15.6 lakh by 2025, according to the National Cancer Registry Programme Report 2020. Dr R Vijayabhaskar, senior consultant and head, surgical oncology, said that though cancer is a complex disease, most of its risk factors are modifiable. He added that people must go for early detection/screening, modify lifestyles, and work for creating a hygiene environment in their localities.In his address Dr P Ananda Selvakumar, senior consultant, radiation oncology, said that at an early stage patients will require only a single modality treatment, either surgery or radiation therapy but once it becomes stage III or IV, multimodal treatment is always required, either two or three forms of treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/more-than-50-cancer-deaths-due-to-late-diagnosis-say-docs/articleshow/80697048.cms||---

While 45 property owners have sent an official objection letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Angad Ghule, the chairman of the Sahyadri Farms Residents’ Association, asked, “Why put the citizens through the hassle of objecting to the plan when the civic body could have excluded this internal layout road of ours. Their own maps listed on the website clearly establish that it is not a thoroughfare.” Referring to the report published in TOI’s February 3 edition, which quoted the state urban development secretary, Bhushan Gagrani, as saying that the nine-metre widening policy was not for internal layout roads and the civic body could propose to exclude the lanes meeting dead-ends, Ghule said, “What is the logic of selecting a part of the circular road for widening? Ahead of this road, there is a natural storm water drain. So, it cannot even be extended in future as a link.” Neelima Bulakh, senior scientist, National Chemical Laboratory, said, “We have all planted a variety of trees, including mango trees, and most of them are more than 15 years old. All these trees will get axed if this absurd widening plan is forced upon us.” Capt (retd) Y P Kothari, former director of civil aviation and chief pilot, Government of Maharashtra, said, “The parameter walls of bungalows and buildings will have to be pulled down. Electric poles, electric supply meters and water connections will have to be relocated. We strongly oppose this move.” Kothari said, “Our gates will open directly on the road, which is very dangerous for senior citizens and children.” Shavaru Tirthakar, a professor in College of Military Engineering, said if the road was widened, there would be hardly any space between the building and the road, making it extremely difficult for the society residents to even manoeuvre their vehicles while approaching the parking lots in the buildings. “According to civil engineering, the minimum life of a building is 70 years and can be even more. Since these buildings are not over 20-year-old, we have no plans to redevelop these. For whom the PMC is offering the Transfer of Development Rights?” Tirthakar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-of-baner-colony-question-road-widening-plan/articleshow/80695804.cms||Abhijit Atre
February 5, 2021||Bhopal||Pictures of only PM, CM & party chiefs on posters, says BJP||BHOPAL: In the run up to the civic polls, the BJP in Madhya Pradesh has told party leaders that posters will be centered only on the Prime Minister, chief minister, and the BJP national and state presidents. Avoid photos of other leaders on posters, the top brass has advised. Sources say the BJP may come out with a ‘hoarding policy’ at the February 12-13 training session for MLAs in Pachmarhi. At the state working committee meeting in Indore on January 30-31, BJP in-charge of Madhya Pradesh, P Murlidhar Rao, had instructed workers on party's methodology, work practices, conduct and behavior. BJP state chief V D Sharma had cautioned leaders about style of working and advised them not to ‘overspend’ on banners and hoardings to please their mentors. “BJP is all set to bring about new changes in the party. It has been instructed to put up posters and banners centered on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi or chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Where necessary, workers can use pictures of national president J P Nadda and state chief V D Sharma. Posters and hoardings with pictures of all other leaders should be at a minimum. The size of the pictures will be decided by district or state heads,” said a senior BJP state functionary. According to sources, party leaders were shocked at the pomp and show displayed by BJP state chief of OBC Morcha, Bharat Singh Kushwaha, when he was taking charge of office on January 28. His supporters celebrated by bursting crackers and playing loud music at the state HQ when Chouhan and Sharma were holding the party’s election committee meeting. The party HQ was covered with big banners and hoardings and seniors had to intervene to control the uproar. The BJP has decided to have a ‘hoarding policy’ to prevent show of money and muscle power at public functions. “There is no ban on important publicity campaigns, but workers have been advised to take permission of the leadership before any publicity drive. They should refrain from unnecessary expenditure, putting up banners and posters and publicity material. But there is no official code of conduct for this and the workers are following the instructions on their own,” said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal. Congress took a swipe at BJP, and alleged that the hoarding policy would sideline leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia and his team. “This is an attempt to control senior leaders like Uma Bharti, Scindia and their supporters. Scindia is missing from BJP posters since the November bypolls. The new saffron policy will completely sideline these leaders,” said Congress state spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pics-of-only-pm-cm-party-chiefs-on-posters-says-bjp/articleshow/80694004.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Pune||Social cost analysis a must for such proposals: NICMAR chief||Pune: Mangesh Korgaonkar, the director-general of National Institute of Construction Management and Research (NICMAR) and a resident of Sahyadri Farms, said the Pune Municipal Corporation’s nine-metre road-widening plan for his society had “no rationale at all”.“I teach the fundamentals of project management to students at NICMAR. The PMC (Pune Municipal Corporation)’s proposal to widen the road in my society goes against these fundamentals as it has not carried out any ‘social cost benefit analysis’,” he said.He said the total number of households in this society would not exceed 100. “I really do not understand the rationale for widening the internal road to nine metres for a community with 100 households. If it was a highly populated society with limited internal road, I could have understood its need.”He said the road shortlisted for widening had a very low traffic density. So, on technical grounds too, there was no rationale, he said.Korgaonkar said it would affect the trees grown within the society and disturb the amenity spaces the residents created. Thus, it would affect their overall welfare, he said.“The project will not benefit the society members. Yet, it got proposed because while planning it, a social cost analysis was not carried out,” Korgaonkar said.Accredited by the department of scientific and industrial research, NICMAR runs advanced construction management courses on its Balewadi campus along Katraj- Dehu Road bypass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/social-cost-analysis-a-must-for-such-proposals-nicmar-chief/articleshow/80695823.cms||Abhijit Atre
February 5, 2021||Aurangabad||HC rejects scribe’s bail plea in murder case||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has rejected the anticipatory bail application of Ahmednagar scribe Bal Bothe, a key suspect in the alleged contract killing of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) activist Rekha Jare on November 30 last year at Jategon Phata in Parner tehsil. The bench of justice Mangesh Patil on February 1 said, “Considering all the facts, there is enough material to prima facie reveal involvement of the applicant (Bothe) in killing the deceased, for which he had a strong motive as well. Needless to state that considering the complexity of the matter and the stage of the investigation, applicant’s custodial interrogation is highly imperative.” Bothe has so far managed to evade his arrest even as the Ahmednagar police have nabbed five suspects, including Sagar Bhingardive and Aditya Cholke, who the police claim were given the contract for executing the murder which was a fallout of a relationship gone sour. Ahmednagar superintendent of police Manoj Patil told TOI, “We have issued a standing warrant against Bothe to police stations across the state to ensure that he is arrested soon. Now, we will go for the proceedings to attach his immovable assets.” Bothe’s lawyer Santosh Jadhavar said, “We will soon exercise the remedy of moving Supreme Court against the HC order.” Among other things, Bothe had pleaded he was being falsely implicated in the case by Bhingardive for having exposed the latter’s involvement in a running a sex racket. The HC observed: “Though it is now tried to be demonstrated that the co-accused, Sagar Bhingardive, had reason to entertain a grudge to falsely implicate the applicant, the CDR record reveals that the applicant was having continuous telephonic conversation with Bhingardive, particularly on the date of the incident.” The HC also referred to the transcript of the telephonic conversation between the deceased and the applicant and observed, “The transcript clearly indicates that he was persistently abusing her in filthy language. Pertinently there is a telephonic conversation which also gives the hint that he was even intending to ascertain her location and had threatened her of dire consequences.” It added: “The applicant was also simultaneously having telephonic conversation with the deceased as well. Apart from the link that these circumstances establish, it is indicative of the fact that it is not that Bhingardive could have falsely implicated the applicant. If really he was aggrieved by the news articles published by the applicant roping him in sex racket being run by him, there could not have been so many telephonic conversations between the two, that too on the date of the incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-rejects-scribes-bail-plea-in-murder-case/articleshow/80692886.cms||Mohammed Akhef

February 5, 2021||Pune||High court curb on PWD over Theur road project||PUNE: The Bombay high court has directed the public works department (PWD) and other respondent authorities “not to go ahead with the construction” of the Theur village to Theur Phata stretch of the Ashtavinayak road project “without following due process of law”. The project aims to link Ranjangaon and Theur, famous for two of the eight revered Ganesh temples in and around Pune. The bench of justices SC Gupte and Surendra P Tavade was on Tuesday hearing a petition by 81 land owners from Theur village, claiming the road project passed via their lands which were being taken over without any prior notices to them. The bench directed notices to be issued to the PWD, Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), Pune district collector, Theur gram panchayat and the state government. The notices are returnable by February 24 when the matter is due for next hearing. “The writ petition concerns illegal construction of road through the lands of the petitioners. It is contended that no notice was issued before any construction activity; no notice was issued for acquiring of lands. On these allegations, reply of the Respondents is required,” the bench said. Lawyer Chaitanya Nikte, representing the petitioners, told TOI, “The affected land owners contend that the stretch in question is not shown as ‘State Road 116’ in the map and that the PWD is wrong to claim that the Road Development Plan for 2001-21 shows the road as ‘State Road 116’. Even if it were, the project cannot be done on their lands before acquiring the same and giving them apt compensation.” “In January 2020, workers hired by the PWD started cutting trees on the ‘private land’ for widening of the road and this prompted the farmers to write to the collector and other authorities. Later, a query under the RTI Act revealed that the PWD was constructing the road as a part of ‘Hybrid Annuity Model 2018’ scheme,” Nikte added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-court-curb-on-pwd-over-theur-road-project/articleshow/80695846.cms||Vishwas Kothari
February 5, 2021||Pune||Civic body warns of penalties over wastage of water||PUNE: The civic body has warned citizens against water wastage, stating that fines would be slapped on the establishments found squandering the precious national resource. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) recently imposed a fine on a housing society after it was found that its overhead water tank was overflowing throughout the night. The PMC’s water department stated that such instances are avoidable. It has also appealed to citizens to approach the local civic ward offices in their respective areas if they find any instances of water wastage. Anirudh Pavaksar, head of the PMC’s water department, said that it was a step against wastage of water. He said, “Imposing fines is not the only intension behind the move. The administration wants citizens to make judicious use of water and avoid wastage. It is not possible to keep a tab across the city with limited manpower. Hence, we have appealed to citizens to approach the local ward offices in case of water wastage.” Pavaksar said that so far only one case has been detected, but the action will continue. The move will also help detect illegal water connections and zero in on establishments which have not paid tax arrears. “The administration has nuisance detection squads. The squads will initiate action against leaking tap and against those found wasting water,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-warns-of-penalties-over-wastage-of-water/articleshow/80695862.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Aurangabad||Highest ever allocation for SCR, but M’wada ignored||Aurangabad: Even if the South Central Railway (SCR) has received the highest ever budgetary allocation for the year 2021-22, Marathwada has been left starving for funds with no major allocation towards infrastructural development and other key demands. While the allocation for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana coming under the zone has witnessed more than two-fold rise in average allocation for a period from year 2014 to 2020, Nanded zone that caters to Marathwada has only experienced official apathy, sparking angry reactions from stakeholders.The only consolation for the region is allocation of Rs 149.8 crore towards the long-pending project of a new railway line on Beed-Parli-Ahmednagar route, but that comes under the jurisdiction of the Central Railway.As per the railway Pink Book, the SCR has been sanctioned a staggering amount of Rs. 7,222 crore for the year 2021-22 towards important infrastructure works, Rs 4,238 crore for doubling, third Line and bypass line works and Rs 2,195 crore towards new lines among other works.Around 18 ongoing rail projects across SCR has received funding in the annual budget, but none of such projects from the region has found a place on the list. As regards to electrification works, Rs 175 crore has been allotted for Manmad-Mudkhed-Dhone section, Rs 90 crore allotted for Parli-Vikarabad section and Rs 85 crore for Purna-Akola section, benefiting parts of Marathwada. The list of eight other projects that have received special funding does not include any work from the region. City MP Imtiaz Jaleel along with railway activists and passengers have expressed displeasure over Marathwada being badly neglected in rail budget. “Effective rail connectivity is key for development of any region, but the Centre has failed to address the needs of Marathwada. The public representatives from the region are to be also blamed, who take pride in raising and following non-issues rather than taking up the connectivity demands,” he said. Railway activist Anant Borkar said the SCR has once again given step-motherly treatment to Marathwada. “While Telugu speaking states have been offered bounty of funds, Marathwada has even failed to get minimum amount of funds required. We have no words to express our resentment towards step-motherly treatment given to the region,” he said. Divisional Railway Manager for Nanded division of SCR Upinder Sinh could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/highest-ever-allocation-for-scr-but-mwada-ignored/articleshow/80692919.cms||Prasad Joshi

February 5, 2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: BJP paid my MLAs to switch loyalties, says Kamal Nath||BHOPAL: Nearly a year after his government was toppled, PCC chief Kamal Nath in an informal gathering with the media on Thursday claimed that he knew that his MLAs were being paid by BJP to quit. “One day, an MLA came to me in the CM House and said that he has been given Rs5 crore and he does not know where to keep the money. I asked him to go and enjoy the money. He had come with the cash in his vehicle and asked if he could deposit the money somewhere”, Nath said. Nath said that even while the rebel MLAs were in Bangalore, he received calls from them saying how much they have been paid. On March 11 last year, Jyotiraditya Scindia quit Congress and joined BJP. Nath claimed that he had spoken to him even on March 2, nine days before BJP national president J P Nadda gave him membership in the saffron party. The former chief minister said that he did not have much to do with state politics since he had spent all his life in New Delhi power corridors. “But on May 1, 2018, I was sent here as state Congress president when there was just six months left for the assembly elections. My priority was to strengthen the organisation and build trust in the people so that Congress returns to power in Madhya Pradesh after 15 years,” Nath said. Nath said that his government got only 15 months out of which two-and-half months were spent with the model code of conduct in place before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “Had we got a good number of seats in the Vindhya region, this situation would not have arisen,” he added. Nath said his target was to give a new identity to the state and added that a campaign against the mafia was necessary. He also said there were many Union government schemes which he found did not work. “The money meant for the people did not reach the beneficiaries”, he said. Nath also recalled his tenure as Union minister for road transport and highways when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was Gujarat chief minister and would meet him for the completion of highways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-paid-my-mlas-to-switch-loyalties-nath/articleshow/80694027.cms||---

They vandalized a car and threw stones at two vehicles on the Pune-Solapur road,” Wanowrie police senior inspector Deepak Lagad said on Thursday. “We have arrested nine men named in the two FIRs registered under relevant sections of the IPC, Arms Act and Criminal Law Amendment. Five men arrested in a case relating to attempted murder will be in police custody remand till February 7.

Senior officials of Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) said Pune Municipal Corporation has installed automated doors at bus stops. They said 223 buses will make 2,946 trips — across 47 routes — on the corridor. There are a few niggles, such as synchronizing the doors with the bus schedule, and CCTV coverage, but an official said those would be sorted out soon. “Our main concern was a lack of doors, which posed a major safety risk to passengers. Until the doors are synchronized, PMPML staffers would will be stationed at bus stops to help the commuters,” the official added. The official added that CCTV cameras can be installed even after the corridor becomes operational. Since December, PMC and PMPML were involved in a standoff over starting bus service on the lane — civic officials said buses can run on the corridor, while the transport utility dismissed the notion and refused to start the service till doors are installed at bus stops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/swargate-katraj-brts-service-to-finally-start-today/articleshow/80695908.cms||Joy Sengupta
February 5, 2021||Aurangabad||30,000 get high-voltage shock for electricity theft in Marathwada||AURANGABAD: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), as a part of its ongoing public outreach drive, has exposed as many as 29,952 cases of power theft using metal hooks across eight districts of Marathwada. While the region is notorious for power thefts that makes it vulnerable to load-shedding as and when power deficit arises as per rules of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), stern action has been sought against such the offenders. Advocate Pradeep Deshmukh of advocacy group Marathwada Janta Vikas Parishad said the state power utility must deal with such consumers strictly in order to reduce the cases of power theft in the region. “As per MERC rules, areas having highest number of power theft and leakages are considered first for load-shedding. The honest consumers from Marathwada suffer due to the wrongdoings of a section of consumers,” he said. Sunil Jadhav, MSEDCL deputy chief public relations officer for Aurangabad division, on Thursday said legal action is being taken in the incidents of power theft. “The drawing of power using unethical ways is not only illegal, but also highly unsafe. As per the Electricity Act, 2003, in case of detection of Unauthorized Use of Energy (UUE), tariff equal to twice the tariff applicable for the relevant category is recovered if the MSEDCL authorities reach to the conclusion that unauthorised use of electricity has taken place. Also, the section 135 of the Act stipulates for initiating police action among other stern actions,” he added. The public outreach programme, One Village-One Day, launched by the MSEDCL across 8,000 villages in Marathwada since the first half of November last year has also witnessed replacement of 7,327 faulty meters and repair of 31,205 transformers. The initiative has resolved 29,543 complaints related to billing and offered 23,747 new power connections, show official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/30000-get-high-voltage-shock-for-electricity-theft-in-mwada/articleshow/80692948.cms||---

The price has gone up from Rs 694 to Rs 719 per cylinder from Thursday. Sources in oil marketing companies said that prices of petrol and diesel were hiked or reduced based on fluctuations in international crude oil prices. It was also impacted by the rise or fall in rupee vis-a-vis the dollar. The city had witnessed record-high fuel price hikes in October 2018 with petrol at Rs 91.34 and diesel at Rs 80.10, and the prices later dropped in subsequent months. However, over the past few months, the 2018-prices have been surpassed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cooking-gas-cylinder-price-rises-by-rs-25/articleshow/80694022.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Bhopal||Bhopal cops start probe into Vyapam’s law varsity admissions||BHOPAL: Police have begun an investigation into Vyapam-led admissions to National Law Institute University (NLIU), Bhopal, between 2000 and 2007, taking up a complaint forwarded by the CBI headquarters to the Madhya Pradesh government five years ago. Under scanner are students from some highly influential families, many of whom now hold key positions in the central and state administrative services, it is alleged. The complainant, RTI activist Ajay Dubey, had sent his complaint to CBI in 2015, which was forwarded to the MP government in 2016, say sources. On Wednesday, he was summoned by MP Nagar police station to come with documents regarding his complaint. Dubey alleges a scam in NLIU admissions between 2000 and 2007, when MP Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) — earlier known as Vyapam, which had hogged global headlines due to a massive recruitment scam — had handled admissions. “The scam that affected the careers of thousands of candidates of PMT, pre-PG (medical), contractual teachers, constables and even forest guards might have touched admissions to NLIU since they were also done through Vyapam,” Dubey alleges. MPPEB had conducted admission tests for NLIU since its inception in 1997 till 2008 when the prestigious institute came under Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). Dubey alleges that Vyapam had removed the names of those on the merit list between 2000 and 2007 so that children of high-profile people wouldn’t be identified. He has enclosed the merit lists of pre-BA LLB (honours) entrance test from 2000 to 2007, which he says was obtained through an RTI application. Documents reveal that in 2000, the names and roll numbers of the candidates were mentioned on the list. “New norms were introduced between 2001 and 2007 wherein only roll numbers were displayed. Names of candidates were removed,” Dubey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-cops-start-probe-into-vyapams-law-varsity-admissions/articleshow/80694139.cms||P Naveen

February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Maha govt nod for new water conservation scheme||Mumbai: A year after the Fadnavis government’s flagship water conservation programme Jalyukt Shivar was scrapped by Maha Vikas Aghadi government, the cabinet approved a new scheme on Thursday on almost on the same lines for three years (April 2020-March 2023), naming it ‘Chief minister water conservation programme’. The meeting, chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, approved implementation of the Rs 1,340-crore scheme, to increase storage capacity by repairing and maintaining resources. The Jalyukt Shivar scheme had a provision to create ponds, which the new one does not have. In four decades, many water resources have been generated through employment guarantee schemes, but due to lack of regular maintenance and repair, the resources have not been used to their full potential. To enhance storage capacity, 7,916 water resources will be repaired, for use in small villages. Soil and water conservation department will also initiate a special repair programme of small dams within the irrigation capacity limit to 600 hectares of water bodies such as ponds, lakes and dams, cement nullah dams to the leakage and increase storage capacity. A vigilance and quality control team of soil and water conservation department will inspect the work’s progress. The Fadnavis government had launched the scheme in 2014 to make 5,000 villages free of water scarcity. In October 2020, the Thackeray government set up a four-member panel to probe alleged irregularities in the over Rs 9,500-crore scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-govt-nod-for-new-water-conservation-scheme/articleshow/80695076.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

February 5, 2021||Nashik||Builders on a high as curbs on height of bldgs lifted||Nashik: Two buildings almost as tall as the Qutub Minar are already coming up in the heart of the city, but high-rises taller than these are expected in the future, thanks to the state government for introducing the new unified Development Control Promotion & Regulations (DCPR).“We have been receiving queries from real estate players who are keen to construct high-rises both for residential and commercial purpose. However, no-objection certificate (NOC) from the civic fire department will be needed,” municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav told TOI on Thursday. The DCPR, introduced in December last year, has done away with restrictions on the height of buildings in Nashik, Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Nagpur. Cities other these four will get permission up to 70 metres height.Jadhav said Nashik city will be witnessing a huge vertical growth. “With more properties in one building, the cost of flats or shops will come down and builders will be able to consume more floor space index (FSI).” Credai-Nashik members too are enthusiastic and feel that flat buyers will get more amenities like swimming pools and gardens. “It will boost the real estate sector as the number of flats will increase in high-rise buildings. Around 250 sectors depend on the realty sector, all of which will benefit,” said Umesh Wankhede, a senior member of Credai.Under the previous DCPR rules, the height of the building permissible was up to 70 metres and for up to 100 metres, permission of the committee led by the divisional commissioner was required.Raju Aher, executive engineer of the civic town planning department, said,.“At present, two 70m heigh buildings are coming up in the Gangapur road area and Untwadi locality in the heart of the city. Buildings taller than these are expected to come up soon.” Civic standing committee chairman Ganesh Gite said, “We will buy ladder of 100m height, depending upon the demand for high-rise buildings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/builders-on-a-high-as-curbs-on-height-of-bldgs-lifted/articleshow/80695952.cms||Tushar Pawar

February 5, 2021||Pune||Woman duped of Rs 12 lakh by ‘US doctor’ on matrimony site in Pune||PUNE: A 40-year-old woman from Wakad was cheated of Rs 12 lakh by a crook, who posed as a ‘US-based surgeon’ on a matrimonial site. The incident occurred between October last year and January this year. The woman lodged an FIR on Wednesday. Inspector Santosh Patil said the suspect contacted her through the website in October and introduced himself as Arjun Gopal, a cosmetic surgeon from the US. “The duo started calling and texting each other. The suspect soon proposed to her,” Patil said. In November, the suspect called the complainant and told her his mother suffered head injuries in an accident. “He asked her to pay for a shipment of herbal seeds, which he claimed to be importing from Bengaluru. She immediately transferred Rs1.3 lakh to a bank account in Bengaluru,” Patil said. Patil said the suspect then offered to make the woman a partner in the seeds business and also convinced her to bring her father on board. “He sent seeds to the woman via courier and took around Rs6.5 lakh from her,” Patil said. A few days later, the suspect told the woman he would be visiting India with the company’s purchase manager. He first claimed he was detained at the airport and asked her for money. He then sought more money to pay a fine over seized US dollars. In all, till the first week of January, the woman and her father transferred Rs12 lakh to the suspect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-duped-of-rs-12-lakh-by-us-doc-on-matrimony-site/articleshow/80695934.cms||Mihir Tanksale
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai cops approach Senegal court for Ravi Pujari’s custody||MUMBAI: Mumbai Police approached Senegal extradition court through external affairs ministry, seeking a clarification and to consider its request for custody of extradited gangster Ravi Pujari in pending cases here. Pujari, who was admitted to a Bengaluru hospital for a hernia operation, is now back in jail there. MEA last month approached the Senegal court after Pujari’s lawyer filed a writ petition in a Bengaluru court that he remain with Karnataka police till trial of 10 serious cases against him is completed. A session court in Bengaluru allowed Mumbai crime branch to take his custody on a request by a Mumbai court but Pujari’s lawyer Dilraj Sequeira moved Karnataka high court against it. “The HC said Mumbai Police wants Pujari’s custody for 10 days regarding certain charges, which was not required, as it could be done through video-conferencing, so Mumbai Police withdrew their application. In the original order of Senegal extradition court, there was no mention of Mumbai cases,’’ said Sequeira. Sources said Pujari does not want to be taken to Mumbai, as he fears for his life in Maharashtra jails, as there are several rival gang members and his own foot soldiers, who he had betrayed emotionally and financially. O P Singh, a Chhota Rajan member, was killed in Nashik jail, gangster Abu Salem was attacked in Taloja jail and undertrial Asghar Ali Mehendi and Rajan aide John D’Souza were killed in gang rivalry at Arthur Road jail. Mumbai Police said out of 49 serious offences, at least in 10 Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) is applicable, and if brought to Mumbai, he will be kept in a special anda cell, in whichever jail he is taken to. Pujari, who has more than 49 serious offences against him and his gang members, was extradited from Senegal last February. The murder of builder Om Prakash Kukreja, 2013 killing of two employees of builder Sudhakar Shetty, attempt to murder film-maker Mahesh Bhatt, Navi Mumbai builder Suresh Wadhwa, advocate Majeed Memon are some cases in which Mumbai Police had invoked MCOCA, and had forwarded 10 cases to Senegal authorities for Pujari’s deportation after his arrest. There are more than two dozen cases of threats to Bollywood personalities, including Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar, Karan Johar, Rakesh Roshan, Karim Morani and an industrialist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-approach-senegal-court-for-pujaris-custody/articleshow/80695082.cms||Ahmed Ali
February 5, 2021||Kolkata||Neighbourhood not safe any more, feel shocked locals||KOLKATA: Residents of the closely knit neighbourhood in Jorabagan take pride in themselves for being able to live like one big family all these years. They have always kept their doors ajar for neighbours, their children have freely mixed with one another and played in front of their houses till late into the evening. On Thursday morning, all their convictions were put to test after a nine-year-old was found physically abused and murdered. “It just seems that life will never be the same again,” said a senior citizen who has spent decades here. The sheer violence associated with the crime has numbed and shocked the entire neighbourhood. “This place might not be an elite address, but it has always been safe for women. That such a thing can happen to a child is beyond comprehension. There is a feeling here that she was watched or even carefully trapped by her murderer. We will now lock up doors and think twice of allowing women to go out alone after dusk,” said another neighbour. Minister of state for women and child development and social welfare Sashi Panja, who rushed to the spot after hearing the news, seemed to reflect the thoughts of the locals. “I know this place in my constituency very well. I can’t even imagine that such a thing can happen here,” she said. The locals were unhappy with the role of local police. “Even when we went to the police station, all they kept saying was that an FIR can be lodged only after 24 hours. They kept muttering that they would search for the girl but all through the night as we kept searching, not one officer from Jorabagan police even came to search for her. I read in newspapers that Kolkata Police was launching a special scheme to trace lost children. Why didn’t they then even come down here once?” asked an agitated local resident. Hundreds of them even stopped police from sending the girl’s body for postmortem for close to three hours on Thursday morning. Lalbazar has decided to look into the complaints. A clash broke out in the area in the evening after some protestors suddenly tried raising a few slogans. Sources claimed that minister Panja visibly looked upset when some youths from BJP raised slogans and asked why the incident was being politicized. BJP leaders said they were forcibly stopped by Trinamool and heckled and assaulted while they were trying to meet the victim’s family. Both sides blamed each other for politicizing the incident. Locals though said all they were demanding now is the arrest and exemplary punishment of the accused. “The girl was the youngest of the three siblings. We saw her grow up even though she did not stay here. She often visited here. I can’t think of a more dastardly act. We will only get some sleep after the criminals are punished,” said another local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/neighbourhood-not-safe-any-more-feel-shocked-locals/articleshow/80694160.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||60,000 school students in Mumbai still not connected to online studies||MUMBAI: Ten months since schools shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 60,000 of the 6.2 lakh school students in the city have not yet been able to access online learning. Data collected by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s education department shows while efforts were made to provide these students with offline learning material, they were unable to touch base with nearly 1,700 of them. BMC’s education department collates weekly data of students in 2,387 of their schools, as well as private aided and private unaided primary schools in the city. Recent data shows 40,888 of the 60,945 students who are not connected to online education are from civic schools. In June 2020, nearly 1.65 lakh students were not connected. Times ViewThe government must continue to strengthen its digital content solutions but also work on a model that will be more inclusive in case a similar situation arises in future. With Mumbai schools not yet open, the government could allow them to hold offline sessions in small groups to ensure learning continues for those who can’t connect online. The government could also work to provide remedial teaching for students to recover learning loss.Of these students, 37,213 do not have a smartphone or a computer and 20,367 have no internet access. “Our teachers have continued to reach out to as many students as they could and find ways to provide them with offline or asynchronous learning options. Through our efforts, we have been able to connect to most of the students, barring nearly 1,700 who were not traced because of their phone numbers or addresses changing,” said Mahesh Palkar, BMC education officer. According to the recent count, 37,292 students are still outside the city, down from 1.1 lakh who had migrated in June 2020. Of the migrated students, 22,072 are learning online with BMC. For those who are unable to learn digitally, BMC in August launched its offline learning programme where teachers, students, parents and NGO volunteers helped deliver physical worksheets and learning material to students. More than 24.6 lakh worksheets have been distributed since through 25,000 volunteers. As of February 1, most of the students who are logging on for digital classes are connecting through Zoom or Google Meet. Nearly 4 lakh students are connected with their schools through WhatsApp. “We have allowed teachers to use the medium depending on what the students are most comfortable with. Students can also use the content available on our 40 YouTube channels in case they cannot log in during the live classes,” said Palkar. Teachers say access to digital learning has increased disparity among students. “Most of our students are from the nearby slum and were not able to spend money on data packs, even if they had a mobile phone. We reached out to NGOs which helped us in the initial months. But soon, we had to meet the children in small groups to ensure learning continued for all. Even when schools reopen, we would have to work out a hybrid model that works for all students,” said the principal of a Kandivli school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/60k-school-students-in-city-still-not-connected-to-online-studies/articleshow/80694178.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

February 5, 2021||Ahmedabad||More than 100 sitting BJP councillors shown the door||Ahmedabad: For the first time in the city BJP’s history, more than 100 sitting BJP councillors were denied tickets for the coming Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) polls. The denial caused an upheaval with only 36 of 142 sitting councillors being repeated in their respective wards. One candidate who had won from Sarkhej ward was fielded from Jodhpur ward. Only 26% of sitting corporators were retained. Interestingly, 62 candidates were denied tickets because of ward delimitation or because some seats became reserved. BJP sources said Bopal-Ghuma was the biggest area to be merged with the AMC last year. Two sitting women corporators — one from Thaltej ward and another from Jodhpur — were assigned this ward. Sources said that barring Bodakdev ward, there is not a single ward where BJP has repeated all four corporators. In five wards — Chandlodia, Ranip, Ghatlodia, Naranpura, Sardar Patel Stadium — the BJP retained two sitting corporators each. In Vastral, three sitting corporators have been repeated. Interestingly, eight of the 36 candidates who were repeated had served two terms. Party officials claimed that so far the party was retaining about 60% of corporators while 40% have been replaced by new faces. Prominent among corporators who were denied tickets are former mayor Bijal Patel. The leader of the BJP in the AMC Amit Shah, AMC standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt, deputy mayor Dinesh Makwana and former mayor Gautam Shah were all asked to take a break.BJP city president and Nikol MLA Jagdish Panchal said, “36 candidates did not qualify because they had either completed three terms or were above 60 years of age.” BJP sources claim that in the eastern parts of the city —- Nikol, Vatva and others—the BJP rewarded a few Patel candidates who stood with them during the 2015 Patidar agitation and gave them tickets. The BJP in 2020 has 47 candidates who are Patidars. In 2015, 46 Patel candidates either from BJP or Congress won the elections. Of the four candidates fielded in Bodakdev, Ghatlodia and Bhaipura-Hatkeshwar ward, the BJP has fielded three Patidar candidates. There were at least nine wards where the party fielded two Patidar candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/more-than-100-sitting-bjp-councillors-shown-the-door/articleshow/80696045.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Chandigarh||CHB to launch IT Park housing scheme in April||CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is planning to launch its group housing scheme for the general public at Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Information Technology Park in April. The scheme, which was approved by the board of directors of the CHB in December last, will have 728 flats in three categories (4, 3 and 2BHK) in seven-storey towers. The board has finalised drawings of the flats and submitted those to the plan approval committee. Though the exact rates are yet to be decided, tentative cost will range between Rs 1.5 crore and Rs 2.75 crore. The prices will be fixed after approval of the drawings. The project land is part of 123 acres that the CHB got back from Parsvnath Developers after a long-drawn legal battle. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had given a go-ahead to its design in July last, but due to the pandemic, the project could not take off. The project report was placed before the board of directors in a meeting in December and it was accorded an in-principle approval. CHB will develop the project on two plots, measuring 10.51 and 6.43 acres. The towers will have two basements with a provision of parking of two cars for each flat in addition to surface parking for visitors. The CHB got the possession of 123 acres after the residential project, Prideasia, was aborted. The board decided to launch the scheme after it failed to sell 18 residential and commercial sites in an e-auction two years ago. Due to the high reserve prices, not many developers had shown interest. High-end flats for government officials of the Chandigarh administration, Haryana and Punjab are also planned in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-to-launch-it-park-housing-scheme-in-april/articleshow/80694166.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
February 5, 2021||Kolhapur||Vehicle scrapping policy to shape up foundry sector||KOLHAPUR: The foundry industry is expected to get a big boost after the implementation of vehicle scrapping policy and also with the rise in prices of imported spare parts which was announced in the recent budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Kolhapur foundry, which ranks second after Coimbatore in terms of foundry produce, will see a positive growth after the slag experienced in the sector last year due to lockdown. Chairman of The Institute of Indian Foundry men (IIF) for Kolhapur zone Sumeet Chougule said, “Kolhapur is known as the second largest foundry production sector in India and the parts made here are exported across the world on a large scale. The industrialists are expecting positive days ahead once the vehicle scrapping policy gets implemented as it will be a morale boosting change for the sector which experienced a slag last year due to lockdown. Around 300 factories from the foundry sector are located in Kolhapur zone comprising Kolhapur and Sangli districts with almost 80 tonne monthly manufacturing. A total of around 1,50,000 people are dependent on the foundry industry in Kolhapur.” The demand for foundry produce has increased since November last year. The increase in import duty on automotive spare parts will be a boon for local manufacturers and will further increase the demand of foundry produce. “The only concern for the foundry sector as of now is the increase in the rates of raw materials by almost 25%. This has certainly affected the balance sheets of the industrialists,” added Sumeet Chougule. Milind Mane, owner of a foundry in Gokul Shirgaon MIDC, said, “The vehicle scrapping policy will benefit the foundry sector as the availability of raw material will be met. Also, the demand for foundry produce will increase. The rates of raw materials like pig iron, steel scrap, CRCA scrap and casting scrap will drop after the implementation of the vehicle scrapping policy and also the demand for new vehicles in the automobile market will increase, thus creating further demand for the foundry produce. With the increase in prices of imported automotive spare parts, the demand for local produce may go up. Moreover, the parts which get imported are electronic components and circuits used in vehicles”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vehicle-scrapping-policy-to-shape-up-foundry-sector/articleshow/80692985.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
February 5, 2021||Chandigarh||4.69L ineligible farmers in Punjab got PM Kisan benefits||CHANDIGARH: Out of total 32.91 lakh ineligible farmers who got PM Kisan scheme benefits across the country, 4.69 lakh are in Punjab, 34,823 in Haryana and 12,544 in Himachal Pradesh. The PM Kisan scheme was launched by the Centre in 2019. Tamil Nadu tops the list with 6.96 lakh undeserving beneficiaries, followed by Assam with 5.81 lakh people and Punjab with 4.69 lakh. The Union government has issued guidelines to all states to identify such ineligible beneficiaries and recover the amount from them. Before the anomaly could be detected, 4,69,978 ineligible farmers in Punjab were already disbursed over Rs 345 crore under the PM Kisan scheme. The government authorities have been able to recover just Rs 1.32 lakh from these farmers and the process of recovery is still in progress. Similarly, cash transfer of Rs 36.74 crore was made to 34,823 ineligible farmers in Haryana under the scheme. Till date, only Rs 1.02 lakh has been recovered from these farmers. In Himachal, 12,544 farmers illegally took the benefit of Rs 13.34 crore under the scheme. Among these three neighbouring states, Himachal Pradesh has been able to make the highest recovery of Rs 2.41 crore from the unentitled beneficiaries till date. These facts came to the fore after the Union ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare tabled its reply in the Lok Sabha to questions put up by JDU MP from Bihar Dulal Chand Goswami, BJP MP from UP Sangam Lal Gupta and BJP MP from Maharashtra Ramdas Chandrabhanji Tadas. An amount of Rs 6,000 per annum is transferred under the PM Kisan scheme in three four-monthly instalments of Rs 2,000 directly into eligible farmers’ bank accounts. The Union ministry informed the Lok Sabha that during the verification process, it was found that 32.91 lakh ineligible beneficiaries across the country had been disbursed Rs 2,326 crore under the scheme, out of which only Rs 231 crore have been recovered. West Bengal is the only state which has not opted for the PM Kisan scheme benefits. The House was informed that 10.74 crore eligible beneficiaries across the country have been disbursed Rs 1,15,221 crore till date. It was also submitted that eligible beneficiaries are not deprived of the benefits as it is a continuous and ongoing scheme, and as and when data of eligible beneficiaries is received from states and union territories, the requisite amount is transferred to the account of beneficiaries through direct benefit transfer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/4-69l-ineligible-farmers-in-pb-got-pm-kisan-benefits/articleshow/80695982.cms||Sanjeev Verma
February 5, 2021||Nashik||Malegaon sheds naysayers tag, almost 100% get Covid vaccination jabs||NASHIK: The textile town of Malegaon has been a challenge for health authorities to get immunisation done due to hesitancy but it has outdone itself in Covid-19 vaccination programme. Data from the Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) shows that 1,744 of the 1,965 healthcare workers took the first shot of vaccine within 15 days of the nationwide vaccination programme launch on January 16. Many of the remaining 221 beneficiaries, who are yet to be vaccinated, have allergies or other health issues. “The turnout in Malegaon has been extremely encouraging. The civic administration has really done well to motivate the beneficiaries. It has resulted in the splendid outcome,” state deputy director of health (Nashik region), P B Gandal, told TOI. The densely-populated town was the epicentre of Covid pandemic in the state in April-May last year. The district administration had to work overtime as 4,700 were found infected with Covid-19 and 176 died. “There was severe hesitancy among the beneficiaries when the vaccination drive started in Malegaon. Two vaccination sites saw the attendance of 20-30 beneficiaries initially,” said MMC’s chief medical officer Sapna Thackeray. Then, the officials personally meet the health workers and counselled them about taking the vaccine. “We roped in doctors and other beneficiaries, who had taken the vaccines. They told the health workers that they did not face any health issues,” she said. Moreover, the snaps and comments of beneficiaries who took the vaccine were uploaded and circulated on various local social media groups to instil confidence among the health workers. “All these measures helped. We are now confident that the frontline workers too will respond positively towards the vaccination programme,” added Thackeray. The authorities have now closed down four vaccination centres. At present, two centres are functional, each with a target to vaccinate 200 in a day. The vaccination of frontline workers will start now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/malegaon-sheds-naysayers-tag-almost-100-get-covid-vax-jabs/articleshow/80695985.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
February 5, 2021||Chandigarh||Street vending zones to restart at 2 sites in Panchkula||PANCHKULA: The Panchkula municipal corporation (MC) plans to restart street vending zones at two sites with new guidelines and facilities for vendors. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said, “As per a survey conducted by the MC officials, there are 1,500 registered Panchkula-based street vendors. Priority will be given to them in the first phase. There are 4,000 street vendors from other states. In the second phase, they will be factored in.” The two vending zone sites are in sectors 15 and 19. Space between vendors has been increased to maintain social distancing, said the MC officials. All other guidelines, like wearing of masks, use of sanitizers, among others, will be followed and training will be given to them. The civic body is yet to decide on the date when the zones will become operational. MC joint commissioner Sanyam Garg on December 29, 2020, had held a meeting with the street vendor sub-committee and discussed provision of facilities. It was decided that the MC will provide street vendors multiple facilities, including CCTV cameras, insurance policy, health check-up, call centre to complain, sanitation, RO drinking water and toilet facility.  “A vendor will have to pay the rent of the allotted site on a monthly basis and submit police verification certificate. They cannot construct any permanent structure at the allotted space. And, it is their responsibility to maintain the space,” reads the draft policy. Also, 30% of the sites will be reserved for scheduled caste women, persons with disability, minorities, among others. The Parliament had passed the Street Vendors’ (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act in 2014, which guarantees the right to work as street vendors. They can be evicted only as per the provisions of the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/street-vending-zones-to-restart-at-2-sites-in-pkl/articleshow/80694179.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
February 5, 2021||Pune||January 2021 warmest in India since 1958, third warmest in 120 years||PUNE: India experienced its warmest January in 2021 since 1958 and the third warmest in 120 years going by the night temperatures recorded during the month, India Meteorological Department (IMD) data has revealed. The data also showed that south peninsular India had its warmest-ever January this year. O P Sreejith, scientist, Climate Monitoring and Prediction group, told TOI, “The temperature plunge in northwest India caused the region to witness a colder than normal winter in January with below normal average minimum and maximum temperatures last month. All other regions and the country as a whole recorded warmer than normal winter temperatures in January.” For central India, which includes Maharashtra, the average minimum temperature in January 2021 was the third highest in its recorded history by being 1.25ºC above normal. The average minimum temperature for the country in January this year was 1.09ºC higher than the month’s normal. The mean temperature in south peninsular India was 1.07ºC higher than normal, making January the warmest for the region since 1901. D S Pai, scientist and head, climate research and services, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “Regions such as those along the Himalayas and parts of south peninsular India witnessed significant clouding in January, which caused the minimum temperature to increase. Cloudy night skies tend to trap the outgoing long wave radiation emitted from the earth’s surface, causing an increase in minimum temperatures.” He said, “There was also a lot of moisture in central India in January. Whenever there is more moisture in the air, it tends to increase its temperature holding capacity. Cloudy skies impact both minimum and maximum temperatures. This was seen last month also.” Pai said strong easterly activity was witnessed in the south, with states such as Tamil Nadu receiving rain till mid-January. “At the same time, westerly activity in the north caused snow and rain in parts of north India. There was also interaction between the easterlies and westerlies, causing rain in parts of central India, including Pune and Mumbai. Various regional weather factors were responsible for the higher minimum temperatures in some regions, making nights quite warm during the first month of 2021,” he said. Several parts of peninsular India, central India and west India recorded rain in the initial January. Some stations in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh had recorded instances of triple-digit rains. Pune, which has rarely recorded rain spells in January until this year, recorded 32.5mm on January 8. This was the highest January rain during a single day in Pune’s recorded history since 1901.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jan-2021-warmest-in-india-since-1958-third-warmest-in-120-years/articleshow/80696009.cms||Neha Madaan

Coming a day after Vaghela’s declaration that he wanted to rejoin Congress, this caused speculation that Bapu was trying to influence BJP councillors who have completed three terms, a criteria that will bar them from a BJP ticket for the coming polls. Vaghela’s camp denied getting in touch with Dave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/turned-down-bapus-tea-offer-dave/articleshow/80695958.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Ahmedabad||‘Winners will have to give up party posts’||GANDHINAGAR: Apart from the stringent criteria that the BJP state parliamentary board had laid down for those seeking tickets for the local body elections, state party chief C R Paatil on Thursday said that those who get elected to local bodies will have to resign from posts that they hold in the organisation. The state BJP parliamentary board meeting held earlier this week, decided that those above 60 years of age and those who have completed three terms will not be given tickets for the local body elections. In addition, family members of BJP leaders will not be given tickets for the local body polls. Paatil’s statement sparked a debate within the BJP, with leaders contending that if these rules being adopted for local body polls were to be extended to assembly and Lok Sabha polls, most top leaders of the state BJP would either not be eligible for elections, or would have to give up posts they hold in the organisation. Speaking to the media on Thursday, Paatil avoided a categorical reply on whether these rules will be adopted while deciding tickets for the next assembly and Lok Sabha elections, fuelling speculation over the likely scenario in the next assembly election. He, however, said that the state parliamentary board can only frame guidelines and rules for candidates contesting local body elections. A number of ministers in the government are older than 60 or have had more than three terms as MLAs. Party insiders say that if both criteria are applied, there could be a drastic change in the state BJP, as like most ministers, several MLAs are older than 60 or have been MLAs for three or more terms. Moreover, party leaders said there are a number of elected leaders who also hold positions in the party organisation. A senior minister, expressing his concern said, “C R Paatil cannot decide on his own about not giving tickets to 60 plus leaders, those who have completed three terms, or relatives of leaders. The central leadership must have directed him. If the experiment proves successful, it could be adopted in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections as well. However, continuity and experience are equally important in running the government and the party will have to adopt a balance in the case of assembly elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/winners-will-have-to-give-up-party-posts/articleshow/80695980.cms||Kapil Dave
February 5, 2021||Chandigarh||Lake Club restaurant gets record bid||CHANDIGARH: The UT administration’s sports department has finally allotted the tender for restaurant and eatery at Lake Sports Club, popularly known as Lake Club, for Rs 5.11 lakh per month. This is for the first time that the club restaurant has received such a bid, and that too when only members will be allowed to avail services. With this move, the restaurant will resume after a gap of almost a year and will also be available for functions. A couple of years ago (when too only members were allowed), the successful bidder offered Rs 75,000 per month. But in 2019, the restaurant was opened for non-members too to get optimum revenue and the tender was allotted for Rs 4 lakh per month, which was then the highest bid. “The bid we received this year is quite good. Paper work has already begun and only some formalities are pending, so the club’s restaurant is likely to be functional in 10 days. The members will be able to enjoy dining at the club after a gap of almost one year,” said Tejdeep Saini, director of UT’s sports department. The successful bidder will now have to submit around Rs 36 lakh as a bank guarantee to the department and give post-dated cheques. The decision to allow only members was taken following a discussion among the senior officers and employees of the department. “Many members had raised an objection when the sports department allowed non-members in 2018. They reasoned that they were paying massive fees for the services, so outsiders should not be allowed. It was also said that the move would create chaos, which was not good for the members,” an official said. It has 1,200 membersAs per records, the Lake Sports Club has around 1,200 members, of which around 500 are permanent. Besides the restaurant, the club is famous for its sports facilities like tennis, archery, gymnasium and swimming pool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lake-club-restaurant-starts-soon-bid-sealed-at-rs-5-11l-per-month/articleshow/80694173.cms||Deepak Yadav

Police said Singh had recently ventured into the construction business and had started promoting at a plot in Kolkata that allegedly had some legal disputes. His business partner had lodged a complaint of forgery against him and Singh had been fleeing from one place to another to evade arrest. “It doesn’t look like an accidental death and it seems he was hit by someone on the front portion of his head. We are awaiting the post-mortem report,” said the officer.

February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Six held for evading Rs 145 crore customs duty||MUMBAI: Directorate Revenue of Intelligence (DRI) on Thursday arrested six persons for undervaluing imports by misdeclaring goods, evading customs duty of Rs 145 crore, and recovered Rs 40 lakh in subsequent raids. Narsiram Choudhary, Kailash Kumar Mali, Jasu Ram, Suresh Mali, Lala Bishnoi and Vijay Mahajan misused import-export code (IEC) of genuine importers to bring goods into the country. DRI searched suspected customs brokers and IEC-holders, resulted in recovery of Rs 40 lakh, documents and a huge stock of imported goods. Some traders said they were into importing mobile accessories. Documents undervaluing goods, mainly tempered glass and electronics, were prepared to reduce customs duty. The difference between declared and real value of imports were paid to suppliers from China via hawala. Officials retrieved WhatsApp chats showing a declared value of Rs 87.6 lakh for 17.5 lakh pieces of tempered glass, when the actual payment was Rs 2.6 crore. IEC-holders were paid Rs15,000 in lieu of letting the licence to be used for imports, an official said.

His name had been accidentally deleted after he sought deletion of his deceased father’s name two years ago. On Thursday, Patel received a BJP ticket for the third time to contest the forthcoming civic polls. He has been a councillor from the ward since 2010. With his name missing from the voter’s list, Patel was at risk of losing the chance to contest polls again. His request for inclusion of his name was not heeded by the election officer, who informed him that the list had been finalised and sent to the SEC. Patel approached the high court on Wednesday and submitted that his father Zaverbhai Patel, who served as a professor in SLU college, passed away in 2019. Following which, he requested the authorities to delete the name of his father from the electoral rolls. But the authorities committed an error and deleted his name instead. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice I J Vora heard the case and directed the election commission to instruct the concerned election officer to immediately include Patel’s name in voter’s list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/add-councillors-name-to-voters-list-hc/articleshow/80695983.cms||---

The court has directed Enforcement Directorate (ED) to file its replies and the matter will be heard on February 11.

The court then held their pleas were allowed on the condition of “making full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within (their) knowledge, relative to the offence and every other person concerned”. “The applicant-accused shall appear in court by returning to India, for which the complainant-prosecution shall facilitate the approach of accused at earliest, and shall take suitable steps accordingly,” the court said. Nirav is a prime accused in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam. Purvi was made an accused in the money-laundering case filed by ED.

February 5, 2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Rajya Sabha byelections on March 1||AHMEDABAD: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday announced the schedule of byelection to two Rajya Sabha seats of Gujarat, which fell vacant following the death of MPs Ahmed Patel and Abhay Bharadwaj. Voting will take place between 9am and 4pm at the Vidhan Sabha premises in Gandhinagar on March 1, and votes will be counted at 5pm on the same day. The Bharatiya Janata Party is assured of winning both seats, as the ECI has decided to hold separate casting of ballots for the vacant seats. The BJP will wrest one RS seat from the Congress on account of its MLA strength in the Vidhan Sabha. Ahmed Patel, whose term was to end in August 2022, and Abhay Bharadwaj, whose term was to end in June 2026, expired last year, necessitating the byelection. At present, the BJP has 111 MLAs in the Gujarat assembly, and like in the recent RS election, it is likely to get the votes of two BTP MLAs and one NCP MLA. The Congress, which has a strength of 65 MLAs, could get one additional vote of independent MLA Jignesh Mevani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rajya-sabha-byelections-on-march-1/articleshow/80696042.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Pune||Pune varsity weighs exam modes for fair assessment||PUNE: The state higher education minister Uday Samant, who declared the reopening of colleges from February 15 with 50% attendance, has suggested giving students the option of online or offline examination. However, conducting an examination in both formats comes with its own problems. The online examinations held by the state universities had drawn criticism for the lack of anti-cheating measures among others, resulting in a record number of students passing last year. Now, officials of Savitribai Phule Pune University are considering ways to ensure fair and transparent online examinations so that students who opt for the offline examinations are not at a disadvantage. Mahesh Kakade, director of examination and evaluation, said, “SPPU is one of the largest universities in the country with more than 800 affiliated colleges. We have 30 lakh students attempting the examination from Maharashtra and the other parts of the country and abroad. The sheer number of students, the number of courses and levels is vast. Hence, conducting examinations for such a large number of students is a big challenge.” He said he could not offer any comment on the mode of examination for now. “There will be a board of examination meeting in two days in which all options will be placed for the officials to consider. After discussions, the best possible option will be selected. The board will decide about a critically proctored online examination or an offline examination at a large number of centres. However, proper care will be taken to ensure a cheating or malpractice-free examination,” Kakade said. However, a senior official at the university, said, “When students appear for examinations on cellphones or tablets, it is impossible at the moment to ensure that no cheating happens. When you compare the number of students to the number of teachers, there is a big mismatch. Most colleges do not have the necessary infrastructure like a robust computer, uninterrupted network, and a technological team for quick solutions. Hence, there are many challenges before us.” While the university will allow online examinations, centres could be assigned in each district to conduct these examinations. “The students would need to come to these centres in shifts and appear for the examination. We need to have some checks in place when conducting examinations, otherwise the quality of the university will be in question,” he said. Affiliated colleges said if the university picks up an agency, their services must be allowed for colleges too. P B Buchade, principal of MES Abasaheb Garware College, said, “The colleges cannot afford their own agencies to conduct the examination. Hence, the only way out is for the university to extend the services of the agency to us too when we conduct the examination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-varsity-weighs-exam-modes-for-fair-assessment/articleshow/80696095.cms||Ardhra Nair
February 5, 2021||Pune||25,000 report for in-person classes in PCMC schools||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Schools under the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits reopened from Thursday for students from standards V to VIII. The in-person classes, which resumed for the first time this academic year, recorded an attendance of 25,745 students in 424 schools. According to the education department officials, all precautions pertaining to Covid-19 were taken by the respective civic and private schools, as inspection by the higher authorities was underway on Thursday. Dayanand Yadav, teacher at the Sonawane Wasti civic school, said around 46 students, out of 113 were present, as many parents were unsure about sending their wards back to school. In fact, two-three parents accompanied their wards to personally see the safety arrangements made by the school, the availability of the sanitisers and masks. Budha Nadekar, principal of Annasaheb Magar Madyamik Vidyalaya, Pimple Saudagar, said only 195 students were present from standards V and VI. “We are hoping that the response will increase as the parents are convinced about the safety. The secondary school on our premises is already operational from January 4, hence we have ample experience now on the safety front,” he said. Parag Mundhe, acting education officer, told TOI, “The attendance will increase. Around 223 schools did not reopen, as most of them are private schools. They will resume soon.” He added that the number of consent forms submitted till Thursday rose to 36,052, which indicates the possibility of better attendance over the rest of the week. A parent said, “We are still unsure about sending our child to school. The Covid-19 situation may seem under control, but considering the uncertainty of the virus and its infectious nature, we may take a few more days to decide.” Mayor Usha Dhore visited a Sangvi-based civic school where she distributed roses, sanitizer bottles and masks to the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/25k-report-for-in-person-classes-in-pcmc-schools/articleshow/80696067.cms||Piyush Bhusari

February 5, 2021||Pune||Safety audit mandatory for labs & equipment in colleges before Feb 15||PUNE: A safety audit of laboratories, hostels and electronic equipment in colleges has been made mandatory by the state higher and technical education department before the reopening of colleges. College representatives and principals said the fire safety and other equipment in the laboratories which were shut and non-functional for many months is being undertaken as there was more stress on practical work once colleges reopened. Principal of Modern College, Ganeshkhind Road, Sanjay Kharat, said, “The state government has issued this very important safety measure to be followed by colleges especially because many of the facilities are going to restart after a considerable gap. We have begun the process and electrical appliances, electronics, classroom power supply, laboratories and library facilities are being matched for top standards of safety to avoid any mishap in the future.” Principal of the Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce, Hrishikesh Soman, said their central repairs and maintenance department will conduct the audit at the earliest. At St Mira's College for Women, a meeting has been scheduled with teachers and other technical staff to draw an action plan for compliance with the safety audit as directed by the state government. “We have planned for a meeting with the staff to do a thorough check of the entire campus before we reopen for senior college. Duties will be divided and the compliance will be done before we reopen,” principal Gulshan Gidwani said. Principal of Maharashtra Cosmopolitan Education Society's Allana College of Pharmacy, V N Jagtap, said their centralised pipeline for gas at the laboratory, electrical supply to the laboratories and other facilities are undergoing a check and the audit shall be completed by next week. “We are also informing the technical team at the laboratory to do a double check of the facilities before the students start entering the lab,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/safety-audit-mandatory-for-labs-equipment-in-colleges-before-feb-15/articleshow/80696120.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
February 5, 2021||Kolkata||Schools get a yes vote from parents on reopening||KOLKATA: The Covid vaccination drive and the drop in the number of active cases have built confidence among parents who do not seem averse to the idea of their children going back to school from February 12. From only a handful of parents agreeing to offline classes for their kids a few months ago, the number has now gone up to almost 90% now. “Students are the soul of our schools. We are also eagerly waiting to bring them back,” said Fr Rodney Borneo, principal of Loyola High School. Among other reasons that may have prompted many to agree to send their children to campus are practical classes and dress rehearsal before board exams and the inability of many schools to hold hybrid classes. “Once classes resume on campus, we will not hold online sessions. It is logistically impossible. It will put teachers under extreme strain. We plan to hold pen-and-paper pre-board exams,” said a school head. T H Ireland, St James’ School principal, pointed out that towards the end of 2020, only 10% guardians were ready to send their wards back to school. “The number has grown to almost 60% now. We are waiting for further confirmation. We expect after classes resume and parents look into the elaborate safety and security arrangements in school, the number of students will further increase. We are expecting a smooth transition from online to offline mode,” Ireland said. Heritage School principal Seema Sapru hoped more parents would want to send their children back to campus. “Vaccination and the reducing infection rate have convinced many parents that their kids can resume classes on campus,” she said. Another prominent school plans to write to parents, stating those who will not allow their children to attend offline classes should send an email to the school head, informing about the decision. “We have implemented all the health SOP, suggested by both the state government and the board. The board exams will be held on pen and paper. At that time, students are required to be present on the campus,” the school head said. Richard Gasper, principal at St Augustine’s Day School, confirmed almost 90% parents were ready to send their kids back to campus. “We will hold offline classes only. The parents will have the option to keep the students back home. But the school will not provide online classes,” he said. “Most other states have reopened schools and classes are being held without any hiccup. We expect a substantial number of parents will have no objection to send their wards,” said Krishna Damani, spokesperson for South Point. Don Bosco Park Circus will reopen mainly for classes X and XII from February 15. “We will start phase-wise reopening,” said principal Fr Bikash Mondal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-get-a-yes-vote-from-parents-on-reopening/articleshow/80696129.cms||Somdatta Basu
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC questions JBIMS on admissions for NRI candidates||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday sought the response of Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies (JBIMS) to know how it granted admissions to NRI candidates on supernumerary seats without state CET cell’s approval. A bench of Justices Suresh Gupte and Surendra Tavade heard a petition by Sagar Bhoite and Gaurav Thakur, who had applied in the Children of Indian Workers in Gulf Countries (CIWGC) category for Masters in Management Studies course for 2020-21. Their advocate, Atal Bihari Dubey, said there are 120 seats and above that there are 15% seats in supernumerary category. Of these, one-third (6) are reserved for CIWGC and two-third (12) for OCI/PIO/foreign students. Six seats of CIWGC were filled and the petitioners were waitlisted. But the college illegally split OCI/PIO category (one-third each) and prepared a separate list for NRI students. “They made their own law. They made a third list,’’ said Dubey. Only two candidates who had applied in OCI/PIO category got admission. There were four seats remaining. So the college admitted six NRI students and accommodated four others in the balance four seats of OCI/PIO. The petition said when petitioners learnt of the merit list published on January 28 they were shocked to see blatant discrimination, violation of admission rules and undue favour towards NRI students. The JBIMS director did not entertain them. Dubey argued that first preference balance seats in OCI/PIO category had to be given to CWIGC category students. The judges pointed out that a proviso to the rules for admission permit giving these seats to NRI students subject to approval of authorities. “That approval was also not taken,’’ said Dubey.  CET cell’s advocates Rui Rodrigues and Aadesh Sawant confirmed its approval was not taken for NRI admissions. The court was told institutional round admissions close on Friday. Dubey said admissions were over and have to be approved by CET cell. The judges issued notice to JBIMS and said its director must be present on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-questions-jbims-on-admissions-for-nri-candidates/articleshow/80695098.cms||Rosy Sequeira
February 5, 2021||Ahmedabad||How much does AMC spend on citizen’s health?||AHMEDABAD: Health, it seems, is not a priority for the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). Over the past five years, large chunks of the budget were spent on roads, bridges and water supply. But Covid changed all. During pre-Covid years, the civic body usually earmarked anywhere between 6% to 7.5% of its total budget for health. This despite the city falling prey to frequent onslaughts of swine flu and vector-borne diseases like dengue and even turning into the country’s first Zika virus and Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF). Just to put things in perspective, consider the 2018-19 budget where AMC spent Rs 377 crore. In 2020 alone, the AMC spent Rs 268 crore towards hospitalization and paying for 32 lakh Covid antigen tests for almost half of the city’s population. “Also for last five years, we have been seeking at least 50 permanent doctors for our urban health centres and nearly 1,000-odd health workers. This year for the first time, the state government will recruit them for us,” says a senior AMC official who did not wish to be quoted. The AMC’s healthcare system has not been able to fully utilize the budget outlay in the years 2015-16 to 2019-20. AMC reported unspent amount of Rs 53 crore in 2015-16, Rs 97 crore in 2017-18, Rs 88 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 127 crore in 2019-20. The percentage expenditure for healthcare services is below 90% except in 2016-17. The budget for healthcare is not very big, it is less than 8%, therefore, under-expenditure against budget estimate is really cause of concern. Mahender Jethmalani of Patheya Budget Analysis says, “AMC should focus more on controlling the contagious diseases. Capital expenditure for upgrading hospital infrastructure so that patients are provided all diagnosis services, should be the focus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/how-much-does-amc-spend-on-citizens-health/articleshow/80696078.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Mangroves on MTDC land cut for studios: BJP||Mumbai: BJP corporator from Malad Vinod Mishra alleged that mangroves on land owned by Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation at Eksar village, Borivli, have been cut illegally for setting up studios. In a complaint to state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, Mishra said massive dumping of debris at Bhatti village was on to reclaim land in violation of Environment Protection Act, 1986, and Tree Protection Act, 1975. Mishra demanded a probe into permission by civic solid waste management department for dumping six lakh brass or 1.5 lakh trucks worth of earth to reclaim the land. He demanded action against MTDC and civic officials for dereliction of duty and allowing wanton destruction of mangroves. Mishra earlier raised the issue at the District Planning Committee meeting on Monday. He alleged land was being illegally reclaimed from the sea. Thackeray had recently announced that mangrove land with government departments would be handed over to state forest department and formally notified as reserved forests. For mangroves on private land, he recently wrote to Union ministry of environment and forests and climate change to empower forest department to take action against violations. Currently, action can only be taken by district collector. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mangroves-on-mtdc-land-cut-for-studios-bjp/articleshow/80695101.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Cyclists ask for 2 lanes to pedal in Mumbai daily||MUMBAI: Cyclists who are part of ‘Cycle Chala, City Bacha’ campaign propose to set up two permanent bicycle lanes to ride on all days of the week —one at Mindspace in Malad and the other one at Jamboori Maidan in Worli. The 24 bicycle councillors, one in each civic ward of the city, have also identified 1,200 bicycle stands in the city and suggested that ‘car-free day’ be celebrated once a month across Mumbai. These two proposals are being put up before city mayor Kishori Pednekar for her approval. Mumbai bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh said, “We are serious about the dedicated neighbourhood bike lanes at two places in Mumbai and having 1,200 stands with each stand/unit accommodating five cycles. We propose two units at each location which means having 10 cycles per location.” Firoza said there is a need for cycling tracks in areas where there is a critical mass of cyclists. “We need proper infrastructure which will encourage more cyclists to hit the roads,” she said. The cyclists have created a new design for the bicycle stand. Firoza is also working on a cycling map for Mumbai and will soon present it to the authorities. She is part of an international NGO from the Netherlands which promotes cycling in various countries and is among the few bicycle mayors in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cyclists-ask-for-2-lanes-to-pedal-in-city-daily/articleshow/80692384.cms||Somit Sen

The governor has appealed to other villages to take similar steps to become self-reliant and draw up plans so that they can have enough water and forests to ensure their basic necessities are fulfilled. Koshyari was on a day’s visit to Dhule district on Thursday. Baripada village has seen all-round development on land, forest and water belonging to tribal community. Locals Chaitram Pawar, Motiram Pawar and Vijay Pawar had taken the lead. “The work carried out by Chaitram Pawar is inspirational. It is important to note that Chaitram has carried out the development with the complete support of the tribals at every stage, which in turn has lead to self-reliance,” he said. The governor also underlined the contribution of the government agencies in ensuring that the villagers received the important knowledge and the funds for the cause. Later, the governor felicitated the Covid-19 warriors at a programme organized at Dhule Municipal Corporation. “The fact that most of us are compassionate, kind and have empathy towards each other has helped country like India to fight Covid-19 infection rather easily,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/governor-hails-baripada-for-atmanirbharta/articleshow/80696123.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Pune||Private doctors denied shot over ‘missing’ names in app in Pune||PUNE: A sizable number of private doctors in the city have been denied Covid vaccine over their names going “missing” in the centralized CoWIN app, despite them registering for the mega immunisation drive between October 24 and January 12. The doctors said their names could not be located and verified on the application when they approached the nearest vaccination centres as per their area pin-code for on-the-spot vaccination, which is allowed for registered but unscheduled beneficiaries. Confirming the development, Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said, “Quite a few private doctors have approached us with complaints of missing names in the CoWIN app, despite duly submitting their details to the local health authorities in a specified format. They had sent these details through a mail to the Pune Municipal Corporation’s ward office-linked email address. But when they approached the nearest centres, their names were found missing. Hence, they could not get the shot.” He said the complaints were scattered and the number could be 1,000 and above. City-based radiologist Vinay Chaudhari, who runs a diagnostic centre in Yerawada, had submitted his details, along with those of his staff members, through the PMC’s specified email ID in the prescribed format. “But still some names are either missing or they don’t match with the cellphone number of Aadhaar data uploaded in the CoWIN app. Hence, we could not pass the verification process and get the vaccine,” Chaudhari said. There are around 500 practising radiologists in Pune. “Besides, there are about 300 doctors practising in Chandannagar-Vadgaonsheri area who have been denied the vaccine for the same reason,” Chaudhari said. An umbrella organisation for general practitioners in the city has also received quite a few complaints of missing names in the last few days. Rupa Agarwal, president, General Practitioners’ Association, Pune branch, said, “Most of these doctors run clinics in their neighbourhood. When they approached the nearest vaccination centres, they found that their names were missing.” GP Aparna Gupte, who practises on Sinhagad Road, said, “I could get the shot but the names of 20 of my clinic staffers were found missing when we approached the vaccination centre. Besides, the names of the staff involved in the clinical work at the old age home I run were also found missing in the app.” Ashish Bharati, chief of the PMC’s health department, said, “We will definitely try to re-register these doctors. Their names could have gone missing due to certain mistakes in uploading the data.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-doctors-denied-shot-over-missing-names-in-app/articleshow/80696151.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) has approved the addition to the complex which will be beyond the 100m Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) setback line. According to the proposal submitted by the BMC to the MCZMA, the proposed memorial complex is spread over 1,19,130 sq feet. The corporation has scrutinised the construction plan as per Development Control Regulations 1967 for the area under CRZ and as per Development Control Promotion and Regulations -2034 for the non-CRZ area. The project will be executed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and is estimated to cost Rs 187.2 crore. The old mayor’s bungalow will house the museum and is located in CRZ II (area where municipal laws apply). However, MCZMA warned that if construction exceeds two lakh sq feet, BMC would need environment clearance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/thackeray-memorial-to-include-erstwhile-mayors-bungalow/articleshow/80696403.cms||Clara Lewis
February 5, 2021||Pune||Puneites vocal for local trains to ply||PUNE: The state government, since February 1, allowed the local and suburban trains in Mumbai to ferry the general public during specific time periods — consequently, it added to the frustration of Puneites regarding the resumption of services on their home turf. Dilip Holkar (36) has been riding his two-wheeler from Pune to Khedgaon and back since March last year. “Though I can avail the local train in Pune based on my essential service-provider status, the timing is not suitable for me. If Mumbai can open the services for common people, why can’t the same be mirrored in Pune? Each day I have to ride for a total distance of 130km,” Holkar said. When it comes to the Pune division, out of 42 local trains, only four pairs (eight) are running — but only for people engaged in essential services. Pune’s divisional railway manager (DRM), Renu Sharma, told TOI that only around 425 people were travelling in these eight trains. “The number of passengers is less and it doesn’t make sense to increase services,” she said, adding, “The services will resume as soon as we get permission.” Harsha Shah, the president of the Railway Pravasi Group, said thousands of people were suffering because of the lack of trains. Pune MP Girish Bapat has written a letter to the railway authorities regarding resumption of local train services for all in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/puneites-vocal-for-local-trains-to-ply/articleshow/80696137.cms||Joy Sengupta
February 5, 2021||Shimla||Heavy snow stalls traffic but warms hearts in Himachal||Manali: Himachal Pradesh, on Thursday, received widespread snowfall, with some places, including Shimla, getting the heaviest snow of the season. Heavy snowfall blocked several roads in Shimla, Kullu, Mandi and Chamba districts. Some places reported power outages and some buses were reported to have been stranded in the upper regions of the state.

In Dharamshala, it was 2.8 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius in Manali. Shimla meteorological department director Manmohan Singh said, “Mid and high hills of Himachal will receive snow and rain on Friday. Weather in the state will be generally dry from Saturday onwards.” While snowfall has cheered farmers, fruit growers and hoteliers, it has caused some problems in the upper reaches of the state. Tourists enjoyed snowfall in Shimla, Manali, Dalhousie and other areas. Tourist footfall in the state is expected to increase over the next few days. Himachal governor Bandaru Dattatreya also enjoyed snowfall with his staff members on the premises of Raj Bhawan in Shimla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/heavy-snow-stalls-traffic-but-warms-hearts-in-himachal/articleshow/80696176.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Amritsar||Protesters get tips on routes to reach Delhi||BATHINDA: Since re-routing of trains, police barricading and nails on roads have not left protesters with smooth passage to Delhi borders, farm organisations are advising them on routes that can be taken. After Punjab Mail train was diverted to Rewari from Rohtak, farmers were advised to use their own vehicles. Now that police has completely fortified borders with multiple layers of barricading, farm leaders have asked protesters to travel by train but remain alert as more trains could be diverted from Rohtak and Sonipat. Farmers are also being advised on where to change trains. Those who want to travel to Singhu border are being asked to disembark at Sonipat railway station instead of Narela and take an auto to reach Singhu as even the pedestrian route from Narela through the highway has been closed. Farm organisation BKU (Sidhupur) district Bathinda general secretary Resham Singh said when people who alight at Narela go to the highway, they have to face police barricading. Even the pedestrian route is not open, he said, adding that farmers need to suspend the journey at Sonipat. Despite the problems, farmers are leaving for Delhi borders to participate in the protest. A large number of protesters left for Delhi from across Punjab on Thursday. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) secretary Shingara Singh said farmers heading towards Delhi borders are being asked to remain alert in trains as some of them are being diverted to stop farmers from reaching protest sites. Farmers on the way to Tikri border are being asked to alight at Bahadurgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/protesters-get-tips-on-routes-to-reach-delhi/articleshow/80696175.cms||Neel Kamal
February 5, 2021||Nashik||Petrol to cost Rs 93.59, diesel Rs 82.78 in Nashik||NASHIK: Prices of both petrol and diesel have increased marginally in Nashik city after a span of six days. While the price of petrol has increased by 28 paise to Rs 93.59 per litre, diesel price notched by 30 paise to Rs 82.78 per litre on Thursday. According to Vijay Thakre, vice-president of Federation of All Maharashtra Petrol Dealers’ Association (FAMPEDA), there has been a continuous rise in both petrol and diesel prices in the city in the last few days and both the fuel prices are at an all-time high right now. The last time the fuel prices were this high in Nashik city was on October 4, 2018, when the petrol price was Rs 91.79 per litre and diesel costed Rs 79.31 per litre. On October 2, 2020, the petrol and diesel prices were recorded at Rs 88.29 per litre and Rs 76.25 per litre respectively. The rise in the fuel prices are burning a whole in people’s pockets as now, they have to shell out more from their monthly budget on fuels. Nonetheless, the farmers have been worried sick about the rise in diesel price. “The ploughing and other rates have already increased in the last six months and continuous rise in diesel price will increase the cost of production. The government should provide diesel to farmers at a minimum cost,” said Nivrutti Nyaharkar, a farmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/petrol-to-cost-rs-93-59-diesel-rs-82-78-in-nashik/articleshow/80696160.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The principal, Fr M Thamacin Arulappan, said the school would consider reopening in April but that would depend on the situation at the time. The school authorities said they wanted to tread with caution as they felt the situation is not yet conducive to restart classes on campus. That Class X and XII syllabuses have been completed well in time has given the school the opportunity to wait and watch. “Online pre-board exams of classes X and XII are slated for March. They were planned in advance. We do not wish to break students’ and teachers’ rhythm and will go ahead with online tests instead of pen-and-paper exams,” said Fr Arulappan. “If the situation is conducive, teachers will call in students in batches for practical classes (later). In the meantime, science teachers have prepared videos of experiments that have been sent to students,” the principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-physical-class-at-xaviers-school-now/articleshow/80696177.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Chandigarh||HC dismisses petition of judge||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday dismissed the petition filed by Haryana superior judicial service officer Ved Pal Gupta against his compulsory retirement by high court administration. A division bench comprising Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma passed these orders while hearing Gupta’s petition questioning the HC administration’s decision. Earlier, Gupta had approached the Supreme Court for quashing this decision but the same was withdrawn through order dated January 20, with liberty to approach the high court. In his plea, Gupta had sought directions to quash the inquiry dated April 24, 2017 through which he was held guilty and to set-aside the order dated December 15, 2020 through which the judicial work was withdrawn from him. The charges against Gupta were related to the sell-purchase of immovable properties. On December 12, 2020, the full court, which comprises the chief justice and all the judges of the high court, had decided to compulsorily retire Gupta, who is presently serving in the rank of district and sessions judge in Haryana. Later, the HC administration had withdrawn the judicial work from him. Gupta was indicted by an inquiry conducted by Justice Jaswant Singh who submitted his report on April 24, 2017. According to the inquiry authority, all the four charges levelled against him were found to be proved. Gupta was appointed as HCS (judicial) on September 30, 1987 and was promoted as member of Haryana Superior judicial service on June 13, 2001. According to him, he along with his wife had acquired/inherited and disposed of properties from 1990 to 2009 after obtaining permissions from the HC. On February 10, 2011, a note was prepared by the then joint registrar vigilance Haryana (later designated as OSD vigilance) regarding the immovable properties acquired by the petitioner. The then chief justice directed that a discreet inquiry be held in the matter and in pursuance thereto the OSD vigilance Haryana prepared an interim report dated August 17, 2011. In April 2012, he was issued a chargesheet with regard to the allegations. The inquiry committee of Justice Jaswant Singh after conducting regular departmental enquiry concluded in its report dated April 24, 2017 that the charges against him stand proved. He was called for a personal hearing on July 29, 2019 before the vigilance/disciplinary committee and a decision was taken to retire him compulsorily. Thereafter, the chief justice directed the decision of the committee to be placed before the full court and thus the decision of the vigilance/disciplinary committee was accepted in the full court meeting held on December 14, 2020 and recommendation was sent to the state government to implement the decision of the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-dismisses-petition-of-judge/articleshow/80696167.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Ludhiana||Unexpected fallout of R-Day events: Farmers' protest grows bigger||JALANDHAR: While these were initially being seen as setback, but the happenings of January 26 during ‘Tractor Parade’ triggered a chain of events which seems to have ended up making farmers movement bigger. Not only the protesters’ numbers have swelled at the three major protest sites around Delhi and meetings and mobilisation have taken place in UP and Haryana, but also the issue has been internationalised. If BKU’s Rakesh Tikait’s tears fuelled the nearly moribund protest on the night of January 28, Rihanna’s six-word tweet with a hashtag on Tuesday night pushed it to next level as other celebrities, political figures and public picked up the issue. The hashtag war on the issue continued till late in the night. As Sanyukta Kisan Morcha leaders went on defensive after the happenings at Red Fort, an emboldened Union government started tightening noose around the protests. Out of the three major sites – Singhu border, Tikri border and Ghazipur border – the latter with smallest numbers was chosen for eviction. However, the plan went awry as BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait broke down alleging that BJP functionaries were also there with police and they would attack the protesters. Even as protesters returned to the sites, the Centre tightened the noose further and shut down internet around Delhi and large parts of Haryana. The government also had permanent barricading installed with spikes on ground. However, these unprecedented restrictions both physical and virtual backfired at international level and farmers movement attracted attraction, which perhaps the protagonists of the movement could not have managed on their own. The issue was raised in different countries early on by the Punjabi NRIs, who held demonstrations in other countries. But, it was the news report about these restrictions in international media that pop superstar Rihanna tweeted on Tuesday night and then climate activist Greta Thunberg also tweeted the same story. Though the foreign minister issued a statement on Wednesday and some Bollywood stars and cricketers tweeted on it, but support of farmers seemed to be increasing. A week after January 26, images of big meetings of khaps across Haryana and UP, huge barricades and tweets of international celebrities are dominating the media and netizens’ mind space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/unexpected-fallout-of-r-day-events-farmers-protest-grows-bigger/articleshow/80696202.cms||IP Singh
February 5, 2021||Kolkata||Double dose to cure N Kol belt rain pain||Kolkata: The city’s only stretch in north Kolkata that goes under water even after a moderate shower — the Muktarambabu-Thanthania belt — is slated for a change this monsoon. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation on Thursday kicked off a project for diversion of a brick-sewer and construction of a stormwater drainage unit to curb waterlogging in the area.According to Tarak Singh, a member in the KMC Board of Administrators (BoA) the new unit and the diversion of a brick sewer will ensure minimal waterlogging in the area. Singh said that apart from Muktarambabu Street, residents of Tarak Pramanik Street and parts of Bidhan Sarani will benefit from the project. “We shall wrap up the project well before monsoon,” he added.A senior KMC official said the project was adopted after civic engineers found that a small part of the underground sewers at the crossing of Muktarambabu Street and Bidhan Sarani was running through a water supply pipeline, thus reducing its capacity to flush out stormwater. “We shall also set up a small stormwater drainage pumping station,” Tarak Singh said.Muktarambabu Street resident Pradip Shaw, who runs a grocery shop, said, “Every monsoon I need to keep my shop shut for days together dueto the waterlogging. I hope the situation gets better this year,” Shaw said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/double-dose-to-cure-n-kol-belt-rain-pain/articleshow/80696210.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Nashik||Jalgaon, Ahmednagar govt hosps excel in Niti Aayog assessment||NASHIK: The Jalgaon Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) and Ahmednagar district hospital have made it to Niti Aayog’s first list of well-performing hospitals in Maharashtra. The two hospitals have been found doing well on two different indicators in the assessment by the Niti Aayog of over 700 district hospitals (DH) across the country on various parameters. The assessment would serve as baseline for these hospitals and encourage them to improve. Niti Aayog additional secretary, Rakesh Sarwal, has sent information to the state health secretaries, district collectors and heads of the hospitals that have excelled in the assessment. He has asked the heads of the hospitals to send a note about the best practices that have led to the excellence. The Jalgaon GMCH, which also doubles up as district hospital, has been found doing extremely well in the functioning of OPDs, including deployment of doctors. The hospital is in the category of large hospitals, which are defined as those with more than 300 beds. The assessment has been made based on the total number of patients visiting the OPDs at Jalgaon GMCH, number of doctors attending the patients at the OPDs and the number of days the OPDs functioned in a year. The hospital dean, Jayprakash Ramanand, said that it was a huge achievement for them. “The indicator where our hospital has been found doing well is a critical one. In the pre-Covid days, our OPDs would get almost 700-800 patients a day. Although the OPDs were shut during the pandemic, we have recently reopened them. The footfall at our OPDs is significantly rising,” he added. Similarly, Ahmednagar district hospital has been found doing well on the parameter related to blood replacement rate at its blood bank. It is among the mid-sized hospitals, which have 200-300 beds. The assessment was done based on total number of blood units used and replaced in a year. Ahmednagar district civil surgeon Sunil Pokharna said that they pay utmost attention to matters pertaining to blood collection, its use. “We have a dedicated team that works to promote and collect blood through voluntary donation. Moreover, 98% of the blood is given free of cost,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/jalgaon-ahmednagar-govt-hosps-excel-in-niti-aayog-assessment/articleshow/80696208.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
February 5, 2021||Kochi||Custody death case: CBI files chargesheet against nine cops||KOCHI: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special crimes branch, Thiruvananthapuram, on Thursday filed a chargesheet against nine police personnel in the sensational Nedumkandam custodial death case. The chargesheet named K A Sabu, who was the then sub-inspector of Nedumkandam, as accused number one. Police personnel including Regimon C B (A2), Niyas (A3), Sajive Antony (A4), Jithin (A6), Roy P Varghese (A7) Biju Lukose (A8), Geeth Gopinath (A9) and home guard James (A5) were named as the other accused in the case. CBI has charged the accused with offences including the murder of Rajkumar, an accused in a financial fraud case. Sources said that the CBI probe has found that the policemen took Rajkumar into custody on June 12, 2019, and kept him in illegal custody up to June 15, 2019. The man was brutally assaulted while in illegal custody and he died while he was in judicial custody on June 21, 2019. The accused are alleged to have fabricated documents against Rajkumar as well. The CBI team examined and cited 152 witnesses, 145 documents and 32 material objects in the chargesheet filed before the chief judicial magistrate Ernakulam. This case was registered by CBI as per the direction of the Kerala high court on January 24, 2020. The accused have been charged under sections 343 (wrongful confinement for three or more days), 348 (wrongful confinement to extort confession), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to extort confession), 331 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to extort confession), 302 (murder) read with 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC, among other sections. This is the first chargesheet and further investigation against senior officials, including the then DSP and SP serving in the location and others including jail authorities and doctors, would continue. The agency would file a supplementary chargesheet on completion of such an investigation, sources said. The first accused Sabu was arrested by CBI on February 16, 2020. Sabu served as sub-inspector of Nedumkandam police station during the time and it was a team led by him, who was reportedly in charge of the station in the absence of station house officer, who took Rajlkumar, a native of Wagamon into custody in connection with a case registered under Kerala Money Lenders Act. Though Sabu was earlier arrested by the crime branch in the case, the high court had granted him bail. CBI arrested Sabu after the Supreme Court cancelled the bail granted by the high court when the state government challenged it. Though the initial postmortem report stated pneumonia as the cause of death, a re-postmortem carried out on August 22 had reportedly found 22 injuries on the body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/custody-death-case-cbi-files-chargesheet-against-9-cops/articleshow/80694430.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Kolkata||Bus, carpool owners may seek dynamic fees||KOLKATA: Bus and carpool owners are considering the options of dynamic fees abd a token advance payment before schools reopen for board classes. Under dynamic fees, they said, the amount might differ from one students to another, depending on the payments parents made during lockdown. Aiming to prevent spiralling of cost, operators said they wanted government intervention to stop the entire burden from being passed on to either parents or bus and carpool owners. The West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners’ and Operators’ Association has asked for tax concessions, a demand they have been making for four months. “We have no liquid cash and buses have been lying idle. But fines are being extracted. Like private buses and minibuses were granted concessions for six months, we, too, can be provided with such an allowance when services begin,” said Himadri Ganguly, general secretary of the association. About fees they plan to charge, Arupam Dutta of Poolcar Owners’ Welfare Association said, “We have spilt parents into two groups: those who helped us during the lockdown, whom we will provide services at all costs and those who severed all ties. For the latter, we will plan something. But students on the same route might be put in different fee slabs. We have asked everyone in the association to keep their vehicles ready by February 12,” said Dutta. Several individual bus and poolcar owners want part payment and NOC from parents. “As schools will not take the onus if a student contracts Covid, we are not sure how regularly kids will go to school. An NOC, with an advance, is a necessity,” claimed Satrajit Ghosh from Behala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bus-carpool-owners-may-seek-dynamic-fees/articleshow/80696269.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) held a meeting of the Malwa region on Thursday to chalk out the plan for the protest in Punjab. The union leaders claimed that 26 spots, including the state highways and national highways, have been selected for the blockade in protest against the suppression of farmers and police barricading and suspension of internet services etc. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), general secretary, Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said, “We have decided to block the roads at 26 places in Punjab. The list will be out soon by Friday. The protest will be carried out on state highways and national highways. The call of chakka jam has been given for the entire nation. On Thursday, we held a meeting with the Malwa region leaders. Our hold is in more than 1,600 villages of Punjab and thus the decision has been taken to protest in strength. For this, around 10,000 farmers at each spot will sit in protest on February 6. Already, the farmers under our union are holding protests at around 42 spots in Punjab, including in front of the houses of BJP leaders, Toll Plazas and some filling stations. Ten out of 26 spots decided for protest are the old spots where already the farmers are sitting on protest from over the last four months.” BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) press secretary Jagtar Singh from Sangrur said, “The protest will be held from 12 noon to 3pm.

The women will participate in large numbers at various protest sites.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/over-10k-farmers-will-gather-at-each-spot-during-chakka-jam/articleshow/80696216.cms||Bharat Khanna
February 5, 2021||Nashik||Mela Stand bus terminus may start ops by April||NASHIK: The Mela Stand bus terminus near Central Bus Station (CBS) is likely to become operational in the next two months. The project, estimated to be worth Rs 14 crore, was launched by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and then railways minister Suresh Prabhu in June 2017. The expansion work of the bus terminus was taken up to accommodate buses plying to more areas. Previously, the bus terminus sheltered the buses plying only to Trimbakeshwar. The project was expected to be completed by December 2018. Though the work was being carried out in phases, the permission required for levelling the existing structures and for cutting down trees in the vicinity had delayed the construction work. The construction work began in full swing after the Bombay high court granted the permission to the cut the 33 trees coming in the way of the bus -terminus expansion project in February 2020. Jakoji Kulal, executive engineer of MSRTC, Nashik region, said the Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020 delayed the work by a few more months. “Lack of labour and government orders about going slow on other works other than those which were priority did affect construction,” said Kulal adding that the work on bus terminus began again on May. “We are at the end of the construction process. There are some patches in the bus terminus that are yet to be constructed and asphalted. The bus terminus will likely become operational in two months,” said Kulal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mela-stand-bus-terminus-may-start-ops-by-april/articleshow/80696234.cms||Abhilash Botekar

February 5, 2021||Ranchi||Haji’s son to be sworn-in today||Ranchi: Abdul Hafiz, son of late JMM MLA and minister Haji Hussain Ansari, who died last year, is expected to be inducted in the Hemant Soren cabinet on Friday at 12pm, JMM sources said late on Thursday night. JMM is the lead coalition partner in the incumbent regime comprising Congress and RJD. According to sources, Hemant’s sudden decision to fill the vacant cabinet berth stemmed in RJD’s claim over Madhupur seat ahead of the bypolls on the seat. If Hafiz is sworn in, then he becomes the natural claimant for the seat on behalf the coalition alliance, during the bypolls. JMM’s move is also seen as an attempt to restrict RJD after the latter gave a raw deal to JMM in Bihar assembly elections prompting JMM to go solo in a handful of seats. JMM general secretary Vinod Pandey confirmed the developments to TOI on Thursday late night. Ansari, who held the portfolio of minority welfare department and represented Madhupur assembly constituency in Santhal Parganas, died in October last year, days after recovering from covid-19. After clinching the 2019 assembly polls, JMM-Congress-RJD shared cabinet seats in 6:4:1 ratio while one is still vacant. After Haji's demise, two berths went vacant which Hemant is expected to fill on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hajis-son-to-be-sworn-in-today/articleshow/80694558.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Certified yoga trainer from Silvassa, Swarupa Shah, has been appointed as the Bicycle Mayor who will pedal up to promote green leanings among DNH residents and encourage them to prevent environmental pollution through cycling. Shah, a fellow at Bharat Scouts and Guides, started her cycling journey a decade ago and has not looked ever since. It’s her most preferred mode of transportation in Silvassa today. “Silvassa is a small city roughly about 4km radius. Yet, I see many people travelling on their personal vehicles even for short errands. As the bicycle mayor, my agenda will be to encourage people to take up cycling for commuting purposes. I want to imbibe cycling in our culture and lead my city as the bicycle-friendly city of India” Swarupa said. Shah further said that the women especially can use cycles for commuting as well running their daily errands. “I have been commuting by bicycle for more than five years and want to represent the bicycle as visible mode of transport in Silvassa,” she added. The Silvassa Smart City Limited (SSCL) and the BYCS, an NGO based out of the Netherlands had called for the honorary post of Bicycle Mayor in December-20. The appointment took place after a rigorous selection process, said sources.

February 5, 2021||Ranchi||Officials hand-in-glove with mafia in illegal stone mining, says Boria MLA||Dumka: Ruling JMM’s Borio MLA Lobin Hembrom took a tough stand against illegal stone mining in the district by checking stone-laden trucks at Mirjachouki checkpost along NH 80 to expose the alleged nexus between stone mafias and the administration on Wednesday night. Since 9pm on Wednesday night, Hembrom and his men began checking challans of all outbound trucks and said hardly any vehicle had valid documents. Besides heavy losses to state exchequer, he added that the rampant illegal stone mining and transportation is also leading to miseries of villagers of Badtalli, which falls in his constituency, due to pollution. He said, “I was surprised to witness that not a single truck out of over one hundred intercepted by us during the barely three-hour time had any valid challan. Imagine the extent of losses to the exchequer.” He said thousands of trucks filled with stone chips are transported to Bihar from the crusher units based at Mirjachouki, Taljhari, Bhagiyamari and adjoining localities without paying even a penny to the government and the district administration is silent. “What are the district transport officer, district mining officer, local police and the pollution department doing? They are meant to safeguard the interest of the state exchequer and save local flora and fauna,” Hembrom said, adding that the transportation of trucks from Mirjachouki checkpoint will not take place till the illegal activities are curbed. Thousands of trucks loaded with stone chips stood stranded along NH-80 since Wednesday night owing to road blockade by villagers of the surrounding locality under Hembrom’s command. Notably, chief minister Hemant Soren represents Barhait assembly seat which falls in Sahibganj. Hembrom said 70 people had died of tuberculosis in the last one year in Badtalli village alone due to the alarming air pollution created by the crusher units. “Not only is the health of tribals at stake, they are forced to bear the brunt of damages to their fields and crops due to the pollution,” he said. “I have summoned deputy commissioner Ramniwas Yadav, his officials and stone traders to come for a meeting at this place on Friday to sort out the problems. My efforts are to draw attention of chief minister Hemant Soren to plug wrongdoings,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/officials-hand-in-glove-with-mafia-in-illegal-stone-mining-says-boria-mla/articleshow/80694728.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Ranchi||Parcel train mows down 2 elephants||Jamshedpur/Daltonganj: Two elephants died after they were run over by a parcel train between Bisra and Manoharpur stations, near the Odisha border, under Chakradharpur railway division in the early hours of Thursday. A 15-year-old elephant and a five-year-old calf were crossing the tracks when the train hit them. Following the mishap, forest officials from Rourkela in Odisha reached the site to start a probe. “Forest officials have arrived to take down the statement of the train driver. Their investigation will look into all possible angles which led to the mishap,” said Chakradharpur RPF’s divisional commandant Onkar Singh. The official dismissed reports of ruckus at the Manoharpur railway station when forest officials reached there to record the driver’s statement. But another railway official said on the condition of anonymity that the team of foresters was initially opposed by RPF personnel when it arrived to take down the statement of the driver, but they relented after senior officials intervened. Notably, 11 elephants have lost their lives after being run over by trains on the Howrah-Mumbai main line in Chakradharpur railway division in the last three years. In April 2018, four elephants were killed when they were hit by the Tatanagar-bound Alleppey-Tatanagar express between Bambra and Bagidih stations near Jharsuguda. Three elephants were killed by the Howrah -ound Jnaneswari express between Chakulia and Gidhni stations in August 2018. One jumbo died after the Howrah-bound Samleswari express ran over it between Chakulia and Kokpara railway stations in February 2020. In September last year, an aged elephant died after being hit by an inspection train in Raikapath. A senior forester of the Saranda division said the railways has been told several times to run the trains under 40kmph at night, besides blowing horns frequently while running through the elephant corridor in East Singhbhum and West Singhbhum districts. “Despite these alerts, passenger and freight trains run at 80-90 kmph resulting in recurrence of such incidents,” a forester said preferring anonymity. Meanwhile, in another incident involving elephants, a 45-year-old woman, Phula Devi, was trampled to death by an elephant in Ratanpur village under Panki police station in the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. Her husband, Basudev Ram, who was also attacked by the elepement however, survived with multiple fractures. Panki police station in-charge Pawan Kumar said, “A herd comprising a dozen elephants first attacked the cattle shed of the couple. The herd then started attacking the woman when she tried to save her cattle.” Her body has been sent for autopsy at the Medininirai Medical College Hospital in Daltonganj on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/parcel-train-mows-down-2-elephants/articleshow/80694781.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

February 5, 2021||Ranchi||Cong backs farmers’ chakka jam, to stage tractor rallies||Ranchi: The state unit of the Congress on Thursday extended its support to the February 6 nationwide ‘chakka jam’ called by various farmer unions. It also announced to hold a state-level tractor rally in Hazaribag this month to demand the repeal of the new farm laws passed by the Centre. The state in-charge of the party, RPN Singh, is expected to attend the tractor rally, Congress sources said. The state president of the Congress, Rameshwar Oraon, who convened a meeting of party MLAs and office bearers in this regard on Thursday, said: “We will hold a state-level mega tractor rally in Hazaribag on February 20. This will be bigger than the Godda-Deoghar rally held recently. There will be no let up of pressure on the Union government till it withdraws the contentious laws.” State agriculture minister and Jarmundi MLA Badal Patralekh has been made the coordinator of the rally. Notably, Patralekh met BKU leader Rakesh Tikait at the Ghazipur border on Tuesday night to extend his moral support to their protest. Party spokesperson Alok Dubey said as a prelude to the state-level rally, a series of programmes has been planned across Jharkhand. “On February 10, a farmers’ convention will be held at the block level. On February 12, the state party president will interact with netizens on the social media. The following day, we will hold 10km-long padyatras in all district headquarters,” said Dubey, adding that the party was also supporting the nationwide ‘chakka jam’ on February 6. “On February 6, we will hit the streets across the state to block state and national highways,” he added. Another party leader, Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo, said Congress was also exploring options to hold a rally in Ranchi and other districts. Notably, JMM and RJD, the other parties in the ruling coalition, have not formally announced their stance regarding the February 6 ‘chakka jam’ call, even though both the parties were opposing the farm laws. Meanwhile, opposition BJP accused the state government of having ‘double standards’. It said though the state government is opposed to the farm laws, it scrapped the Mukhyamantri Krishi Ashirwad Yojana scheme of the previous BJP-led dispensation that ensured steady financial assistance to poor and marginal farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-backs-farmers-chakka-jam-to-stage-tractor-rallies/articleshow/80694488.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

February 5, 2021||Ranchi||Garhwa retains 2nd spot in aspirational districts’ list, Bokaro bags 5th position||Bokaro: In Niti Aayog’s latest evaluation report, Garhwa district has maintained its spot in number two in terms of an aspirational district in the country, while Bokaro has ranked 5th in India. The ranking of aspirational districts was based on the assessment done by Niti Aayog in December 2020. “There were 81 points under six developmental areas, of which the progress was monitored and assessed by Niti Aayog to rank aspirational districts,” said Bokaro deputy commissioner Rajesh Singh. Bokaro and Garhwa have done well in all the parameters. When Niti Aayog had begun the ranking system in 2018, Bokaro was at 54. It bettered its position with 44th rank in 2019-20. Singh said, “Dhalai in Tripura and Garhwa have been placed at the second and the third positions and Baksa in Assam and Bokaro have been ranked fourth and fifth, respectively.” The ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ Programme aims to expeditiously improve the socio-economic status of 117 districts across 28 states. The programmes focus on health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development, and basic infrastructure, which have a direct bearing on the quality of life and economic productivity of citizens. “Bokaro performed better in all six areas and thus achieved the fifth rank,” said Aditya Mohan, one of the two fellowships looking after the aspirational programme in Bokaro. Singh said in order to ensure better performance, the Bokaro administration is constantly trying to perform better. “There has been a massive improvement in all the dimensions set by Niti Aayog,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/garhwa-retains-2nd-spot-in-aspirational-districts-list-bokaro-bags-5th-position/articleshow/80694682.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Goa||Give details on payments to disabled under DSSS: HC||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa Wednesday directed the government to file an affidavit indicating the payment made to needy persons with disabilities. The directions came following a public interest litigation over non-release of funds under the Dayanand Social Security Scheme to beneficiaries. During the hearing of the case, advocate general Devidas Pangam said an amount of “Rs 27 crore has already been released” to various departments for the implementation of welfare schemes. He added that payments will be made to the poor and needy persons with disability. Pangam made the statement during the hearing of a suo motu petition over delay in payment of monthly stipend of Rs 2,000 under the Dayananad Social Security scheme to poor and needy persons with disabilities. The high court directed the government to submit a list of payments already made and the time schedule within which the arrears will also be cleared. Last month TOI reported that the high court issued notice to the government and director of social welfare over the non-release of funds under the Dayanand Social Security Scheme to beneficiaries. The division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and Bharati H Dangre took cognisance of a letter to the court written by the Disability Rights Association of Goa. The association in a letter to the court stated that the government hasn’t paid the monthly stipend for the past five months. “Persons with disability, who are beneficiaries of the scheme, are facing a hard time due to non receipt of the amount for five months and besides their daily living expenses they have to pay for other expenses like physiotherapy and occupational therapy and other medical expenses,” president of the association Avelino de Sa stated in his letter. The non-release of funds is “denying them their only source of livelihood”, he said, requesting the court’s intervention to prevent any eventuality of deaths or suicides. There are presently 12,000 persons with disability who are beneficiaries of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/give-details-on-payments-to-disabled-under-dsss-hc/articleshow/80697152.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Goa||Forest rights cases: Tribal body wants backlog cleared||Poinguinim: The United Tribal Association Alliance (UTAA) chief Prakash Velip on Wednesday said the government will have to either speed up the disposal of forest rights pending cases or approach the Supreme Court seeking more time in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the apex court setting June 21, 2021, as the cut-off date for the implementation of Forest Rights Act 2006, the association has sent an SOS to the government to chalk out a strategy to clear the backlog, numbering around 9,778. Addressing a press conference, Velip expressed concern over a possibility that tribal people may lose benefits under the Forest Rights Act if the pending cases are not disposed of by June. “We have organised a programme on February 5 at the Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, to find a solution to this vexed issue. The chief minister Pramod Sawant and tribal welfare minister Govind Gaude will remain present,” he said. He said that though the act came into force in 2006, the implementation in state began only after 2012. When asked whether the BJP government, ruling the state since 2012, failed to dispose of the pending cases, Velip replied that the government did take measures to move ahead, but couldn't succeed. “The state administration sought expert advice to do the mapping via global positioning system (GPS). The pandemic too hampered the work,” he remarked. Velip mentioned that the tribal community has a lot of issues over land titles with devasthans, comunidades etc. He said a new 25-member managing committee of UTAA will be installed on February 5, at Ravindra Bhavan. The installation ceremony will be followed by a workshop on tribal land rights to be conducted by Ajay Gaude, chief officer of the Quepem municipal council. He added that 10 tribal activists from the state who have completed 60 years of age will be honoured as part of the 60th year of Goa’s liberation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/forest-rights-cases-tribal-body-wants-backlog-cleared/articleshow/80697156.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

February 5, 2021||Goa||Balli container awaits customs nod for Exim ops||Panaji: Over two years after it was inaugurated, the Container Corporation of India Ltd (CONCOR) inland container depot (ICD) at Balli, Quepem, continues to await customs certification to handle import and export operations. The lack of an authorised facility prompts most exporters to use the road route to JNPT, Mumbai, to ship goods, say stakeholders. CONCOR officials said the customs department had conducted an inspection mid-2020 as part of the process to declare the ICD facility as an authorised centre for unloading imported goods and the loading of export cargo. “What is required is declaration of ICD by customs under Section 7AA of Customs Act 1962, after that, further approvals are required to allow customs clearances,” said a CONCOR official. “The customs department conducted an inspection and submitted the report to CBIC and from there the notification is expected to come.” Section 7AA of the Customs Act deals with the notification of inland container depots and air freight stations as recognised facilities for import and export of cargo. At present, CONCOR handles domestic cargo movement of pig iron and food grains. To assist importers and exporters, CONCOR has offered direct port entry and direct port delivery services with a direct link to JNPT port.

February 5, 2021||Goa||Breached Carambolim bund causing flooding, likely to be repaired soon||Panaji: Tidal waters from the Cumbharjua canal are dangerously flooding vast areas of fields near houses in Carambolim khazan. However, hope for repairs of a neglected 10m breach in the Tollem-Sawat bund, which is causing the flooding, have arisen after a meeting of local farmers recently. The agitated farmers of Sawat asked the old truncated committee of the tenants’ association, which has continued since 2014 even after its term was over, to quit within a week and furnish details of accounts. They were upset over the apathy shown by the association and the authorities in plugging the breach. While the saline water influx into fields is worrisome for locals, the water level has also risen in some low-lying settlement areas. But houses near Panch Manos are more vulnerable, as saline water enters their houses, locals said. The chairman said that the panel had only three members and farmers didn’t turn up when notices were put up to elect a new one. The farmers, however, alleged that they had not been informed. Zilla parishad member, Dhaku Madkaiker held an inspection at the site of the bundh breach, and assured to take up the matter with the authorities. A temporary committee is preparing to initiate interim repairs till a tender is issued. The matter of the bundh, which had broken a few weeks ago, was raised at a meeting convened by Goa State Wetlands Authority to hear public views on declaration of Carambolim lake as a wetland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/breached-carambolim-bund-causing-flooding-likely-to-be-repaired-soon/articleshow/80697205.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Goa||PFA seeks probe into 4 dhirios over weekend||Panaji: People For Animals (PFA) Goa has written to the director general of police (DGP) seeking investigation into the four dhirios (bullfighting events) in Utorda over the weekend. The letter stated that a bullfight event was held in Utorda, on February 2, during which the losing bull was harassed to keep fighting and “considering the high betting averages the fight was not stopped, even when the bull was retreating,” leading to the frightened bull running across the fields towards the railway crossing. The rail crossing was, however, closed since a train was expected to shortly pass. The frightened bull then rammed against the yellow metal barrier “completely twisting and damaging it and was severely injured” in the process, the letter stated. There is no information on whether the bull was given treatment and whether it survived the injuries. PFA stated that the four bullfight events in Utorda were attended by several people, and involved “large sums of monetary betting”. PFA said that the incidents were illegal and need to be investigated. The letter has also been marked to Verna police station and the South Goa district collector, besides the DGP. Dhirios were banned by the high court in 1997 to prevent cruelty to animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pfa-seeks-probe-into-4-dhirios-over-weekend/articleshow/80697210.cms||---
February 5, 2021||India||SC imposes 1L fine on babus for delayed appeals||NEW DELHI: The rate at which the Supreme Court is imposing costs on the government for huge delays in filing appeals and directing recovery from officials responsible for the delay, soon many officers would be left with a slimmer paycheck at the end of the month. Days after imposing a cost of Rs 25,000 on the railways and asking it to recover it from officers responsible for the delay of 385 days in filing an appeal in the SC, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy on Thursday saddled the HRD ministry with Rs 1 lakh cost for filing an appeal in the high court after a delay of 2,509 days and carrying it to the SC after a delay of 532 days. It ordered the law secretary and the HRD secretary to ensure that the cost of Rs 1 lakh was recovered from officials responsible for the delay. "The approach of the Union of India in the manner it has filed the present special leave petition exasperates us as all earlier counsel appears to have been thrown in the dustbin," the bench said. A writ petition was filed in 2000, raising a question of parity in the pay scale of employees of the Central Tibetan School Administration. A single judge bench of the HC allowed it in May 2002. The Centre filed an appeal but no one appeared when it was called for hearing before a division bench, which dismissed it. After eight years, the Centre sought restoration of the appeal saying the counsel had become a judge and it wasn't aware of the "peculiar circumstances". The HC had dismissed the plea and said the Centre was not an illiterate litigant. The bench headed by Justice Kaul agreed with the HC and said, "The mighty government of India is manned by a large legal department having numerous officers and advocates. The excuse given for the delay is, to say the least, preposterous". On the case in hand, the bench dismissed the appeal and ordered, "Looking to the gross negligence and the impunity with which the Union of India has approached this court in a matter like this, we consider it appropriate to impose special cost of Rs 1 lakh in this case to be recovered from the concerned officer(s), to be deposited with the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Welfare Fund within four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-imposes-1l-fine-on-babus-for-delayed-appeals/articleshow/80698123.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
February 5, 2021||Goa||Goa urgently needs waste incinerator, says Lobo||Saligao: Minister for waste management Michael Lobo and environment minister Nilesh Cabral visited the garbage treatment plant at Saligao on Wednesday, where both stressed the need to set up a garbage incineration facility in Goa. They said the incineration facility is necessary to turn the refuse into biogas, steam or even electricity. Lobo said that at present, waste to be incinerated has to be transported outside the state and it costs around Rs 25,000 a truck to transport around 15 to 16 tonne to a neighbouring state. Cabral said there are many legacy dumps in the state waiting to be cleared. “We are in talks for such kinds of incineration technology to be set up in the state. We are working in that direction to see that Goa will be a garbage-free state,” Cabral said. The ministers also reviewed the ongoing work of remediation of the existing legacy dump in the jurisdiction of the Mapusa Municipal Council. Director for science and technology Levinson Martins and Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza were also present. “Earlier, no one could even stand at this site. There was a foul stench emanating from this waste, and now with the assistance of the waste management minister the garbage will be treated and the place will be cleared of the existing dump by April or May,” said D’Souza. Lobo said that all the waste generated in Goa should be treated only under the Goa Waste Management Corporation, whether it is bio-medical waste, commercial waste generated by hotels, waste from residential units or hazardous waste or even e-waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-urgently-needs-waste-incinerator-says-lobo/articleshow/80697211.cms||---

February 5, 2021||Nagpur||January last week spike in Nagpur district result of lax attitude, group tests||NAGPUR: After reporting 128 new Covid cases on January 25, which was the lowest daily number in last many weeks, Nagpur district constantly reported nearly 300 new cases per day in the last four days of January, causing concern about resurgence in infections. The overall average daily cases had been below 300 since January 20 but the increase in cases in the last week shows that we cannot let our guard down, say experts. When TOI closely tried to look for the reasons, it came to fore that persons from one family, one apartment or those living in close neighbourhood had tested positive together. Group testing done for teachers and CRPF jawans too had contributed to increase in number of tests, and subsequently the number of new cases. “My father suffered from fever and cough so he got himself tested. As he tested positive on January 23, remaining three members of our family also went for tests. All of us tested positive,” said 18-year-old Pawan. The very next day, their tenant Mayank, who lives in the same house, also tested positive. Doctors said that family members and people in neighbourhood are testing positive because they must have been casual about observing physical distancing rules. “The fear about Covid-19 has almost gone now, and people have started becoming casual regarding physical distancing. Many of us don’t wear masks too. No one wears masks when at home,” said Dr Darshan Savkar, a general physician at Manewada. “Many youngsters can get away with the infection on the basis of their immunity. But senior citizens and those above 50 years of age should must be careful,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. According to doctors, those above 50 having comorbidities may develop post-Covid complications and lung infection even after recovering initially from the infection. The list of Covid-19 patients shows that over 60% patients in the last five days of January were under 50 years of age. Also, as schools are going to reopen in February, the education department has made it mandatory for all teachers to get themselves tested for Covid-19. As a result, a large number of teachers started testing themselves after Republic Day. Number of daily tests, which was under 3,500 until January 25, increased significantly after that. On January 28, a record 5,814 tests were done. Similarly, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans are getting themselves tested in large numbers in last four days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jan-last-week-spike-in-nagpur-district-result-of-lax-attitude-group-tests/articleshow/80694629.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
February 5, 2021||Vijayawada||IBRD offers Rs 9,700cr loan to boost AP’s health infrastructure||AMARAVATI: In an attempt to strengthen infrastructure in public healthcare institutions, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has agreed to grant a loan of Rs 9,700 crore to the Andhra Pradesh government. The state government is gearing up to launch the works as the Centre gave its green signal for taking the loan from the international lending agency. The department of economic affairs (DEA) in the Union finance ministry has stamped its nod for the loan to be treated as Externally Aided Projects (EAP). Following the instructions of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, medical and health departments readied a plan for renovation and strengthening of primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs). The health department was of the view that improving the facilities at territory-level hospitals would improve healthcare, particularly for the poor. Besides, it was estimated that it would lessen burden on big hospitals like district and teaching hospitals. As part of the plans to expand healthcare services to village-level, the government has also proposed to set up YSR village clinics which would act as first healthcare centres in the village. “Subsequently, the chief minister directed the officials to include renovation and upgradation of infrastructure in teaching hospitals (Government General Hospitals). All the existing 11 GGHs in the state would be turned into state-of-the art super-specialty healthcare institutions with advanced medical infrastructure in almost all the specialties,” said deputy chief minister (health and family welfare), Alla Nani. The government is planning to set up eight government medical colleges along with nursing colleges. The government also granted seven super specialty hospitals exclusively for tribal agency areas in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari, Prakasam districts. The government is planning to launch the works at least on three government medical colleges in the current financial year and has constituted a separate Medical Education and Research Corporation (APMERC) to raise funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ibrd-offers-rs-9700-cr-loan-to-boost-aps-health-infra/articleshow/80693408.cms||Samdani MN
February 5, 2021||Vijayawada||General medical services restart at Vij GGH||Vijayawada: After nearly a ten-month-gap, general medical services, including outpatient and in-patient services, resumed at Vijayawada Government General Hospital (GGH) on Thursday. The super-specialty block came into functioning with a few surgeries. The significant lowering of Covid-19 cases over the last month has enabled authorities to restart services. The Vijayawada GGH is of immense significance for people from the city and adjoining areas. Around 1,500 people received treatment here daily before the pandemic outbreak. In March 2020, the hospital was transformed into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. Patients from five districts were treated at this hospital. For patients other than those suffering from Covid-19, regular ones were shifted to ESI Hospital. Now, officials have arranged a special ward for critical Covid-19 cases. As of Thursday, there are 54 Covid-19 patients at the hospital. GGH superintendent K Shiva Shankar said that the emergency unit is still continuing at ESI Hospital and will be shifted to GGH soon. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/general-medical-services-restart-at-vij-ggh/articleshow/80693430.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 5, 2021||Vijayawada||AP: Special courts in every district to hear SC/ST atrocity cases||VIJAYAWADA: The state government will set up special courts in every district to hear cases on atrocities against SCs and STs. Chairing a high-level vigilance committee on SC/ST atrocities at the Velagapudi secretariat on Thursday, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said the move will ensure speedy justice to victims in these cases. This was the first such meeting held in the state since bifurcation. The meeting resolved to complete enquiry into all atrocity cases in 60 days and punish the guilty, besides giving compensation to victims and helping them get better settlement. All cases registered under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act would be taken up for enquiry without political intervention, the CM said. He was joined at the meet by ministers M Sucharita, Pinipe Viswaroop, Adimulapu Suresh, chief secretary Adityanath Das, DGP D Gautam Sawang, and other senior officials. The chief minister also directed district collectors to hold regular meetings with officials concerned on atrocities and ensure justice is delivered. He also told the collectors and SPs to visit SC, ST colonies once a week and interact with locals to build confidence among them. Officials were told to closely monitor such cases and ensure that they are taken up on priority. The CM also authorised the districts to appoint special public prosecutors to argue cases at the district level. Jagan also said that Disha forensic laboratories being established in Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Tirupati will also deal with atrocity cases. He asked the police department to speed up work on the labs and complete them at the earliest. He also sanctioned 66 posts for the three labs and authorised the department to fill them on priority. The chief minister directed the education department to organise awareness classes in schools on the subject. Ministers Sucharita, Viswaroop and Suresh would monitor the implementation of the high power committee’s decisions at the district level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/spl-courts-in-every-district-to-hear-sc/st-atrocity-cases/articleshow/80693474.cms||Gopi Dara
February 5, 2021||Nagpur||BJP’s ‘halla bol’ on govt over power bills today||Nagpur: The BJP will launch ‘halla bol’ agitation against Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Friday for its failure to grant concession in power bills and its recent statements to snap electric supply of farmers, who defaulted on the dues. The saffron party legislators and activists led by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis would be staging protests across all constituencies in Maharashtra from 10am to 12 noon. Quoting energy minister Nitin Raut, the BJP leaders said he had assured to waive of charges till 100 units for consumers per month in wake of Covid-19 pandemic. However, the cabinet led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had thrown his proposal in the dustbin and disappointed all the citizens who were hoping for some solace from the government, city BJP chief Pravin Datke said in a press meet. Accompanied by city’s top BJP leaders, Datke said they were protesting against exorbitant power bills since March last year through various agitations like ‘Bhik Mango’ and ‘Nagara Bajao’ and also gheraoed Raut’s home over their demands. “The protests are basically organized to wake the CM and minister concerned from slumber, as they’re planning to snap power supply of poor farmers amid the pandemic,” he said. Fadnavis, who spoke to the media at his city residence, said about 78 lakh farmers were issued notices by the MVA government for disconnecting their power supply for defaulting on their dues. “This seems to be a Mughal government which has failed to help the farmers, who’re in dire straits due to incessant rains. They’re staring at big losses, but we are firmly with the farmers till they get relief.” Earlier, the southwest Nagpur MLA said there was an international conspiracy to defame the nation and create unrest as international celebrities and climate change activists were increasingly supporting protesting farmers at Delhi. He added that the government shouldn’t have granted permission for Elgar Parishad’s event at Pune as it had prior knowledge that objectionable remarks would be made there.

February 5, 2021||Visakhapatnam||AP needs more investor meets to bolster IT||Visakhapatnam: Even as Andhra Pradesh ranks high in the India BPO Promotion Scheme (IBPS) and Visakhapatnam does well in the two-tier city category, according to sources in the information technology (IT) industry, there have been no new investors’ conferences in the state over the last two years. Investors’ conferences are events in the form of webinars, summits and high-level committee meetings convened to discuss the IT ecosystem in an area and plans for development. These conferences also help create employment opportunities by helping build new companies. “These conferences happen regularly in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. These are a must for the growth of the IT-ITES sector in the state,” said a Visakhapatnam-based entrepreneur. One of the reasons why the number of investors’ conferences has gone down is that the state government is yet to come up with a new IT policy. The existing policy has expired and has not been renewed. Further, the government is yet to clear incentives of Rs 200 crore for companies. Speaking to TOI, RL Narayana, chairman of Information Technology Association of Andhra Pradesh Investors Committee, said, “The government will announce the new IT policy shortly. We hope that everything will be set right by the end of this fiscal.” Narayana further said that the state government has conducted two workshops on the new IT policy with ITAAP and other stakeholders and prepared certain new features.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-needs-more-investor-meets-to-bolster-it/articleshow/80693500.cms||V Kamalakara Rao
February 5, 2021||Mumbai||Nana Patole quits as Speaker, set to be named Maharashtra Congress president||MUMBAI: A day after his meeting with Rahul Gandhi, Maharashtra assembly Speaker Nana Patole submitted his resignation to deputy speaker Narwari Zirwal on Thursday. The 57-year-old Patole is set to be soon appointed as the state Congress president in place of Balasaheb Thorat, who had offered to quit a month ago in keeping with the Congress party's policy of 'one man, one post'. Patole's decision appears to have created a rift among the MVA partners on who will be the new speaker. While Thorat took the view that a Congress nominee will be the new speaker, the architect of the MVA, NCP president Sharad Pawar, said a discussion on the matter was essential. "We will discuss and then take a decision," Pawar said. Patole declined to comment on Pawar's suggestion, saying he was a senior leader of the alliance. According to reports, CM Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar have expressed surprise over Patole's decision to quit. "At a juncture when the government was all set to achieve complete stability, it was wrong on the part of Patole to quit. The budget session is less than a month away," a Shiv Sena minister said. NCP: We expect consensus on new speakerNana Patole’s decision to quit as Maahrashtra assembly speaker appeared to have created differences among the Maha Vikas Aghadi partners on who would take up the post. While Congress’ Balasaheb Thorat said a Congress nominee will be the new speaker, NCP president Sharad Pawar said on Thursday that a discussion on the matter was essential. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik however said, “Patole has resigned, it is an internal matter of the Congress. We expect there will be consensus on the new speaker among the MVA constituents.” A month ago, Thorat had told the Congress high command that since he was state Congress president, a member of the Congress Working Committee, leader of the Congress legislature party and also revenue minister, he wanted to be relieved of the responsibility of heading the party’s state unit. The Congress leadership agreed to his contention but has taken more than a month to take a decision. AICC secretary H K Patil, who is in-charge of Maharashtra, had after Thorat’s offer to quit had a digital interview with all district and block Congress presidents and following a consensus, it has been decided to appoint Patole as state Congress president, sources said. If there is consensus on a Congress nominee as speaker, Amin Patel, Sangram Thopate and Suresh Warpudkar would be the top contenders. Patel represents Mumbadevi constituency, while Thopte and Warpudkar have been elected from Bhor and Padhardi constituency. Patole, who represents Sakoli constituency in Bhandara district, was in the Congress till 2008 but then joined the BJP and was elected for two consecutive terms. In 2014, Patole, as BJP nominee, defeated NCP heavyweight Praful Patel in the Lok Sabha elections from the Bhandara-Gondia constituency. At a meeting with PM Modi in 2017, Patole accused the Modi government of being anti-farmer and later quit the BJP and joined Congress. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Patole was Congress nominee against BJP’s Nitin Gadkari and was defeated by a massive margin. In the 2019 assembly polls, Patole defeated Devendra Fadnavis’ trusted aide Parinay Fuke. A prominent leader of the OBC community and farmers, Patole was elected assembly speaker on December 1, 2019. Patole said he would work for expansion and strengthening of the Congress organization at the grassroots level and take up the cause of agitating farmers afresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nana-patole-quits-as-speaker-set-to-be-named-maharashtra-congress-president/articleshow/80698195.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The project is aimed at poverty alleviation of the population whom the Maoists target as potential recruitment base.Gadchiroli police had earlier sent villagers, especially students, to tours with a view to expose them to government-propelled developments and growth elsewhere in the state. This time, the cops have broadened their concept to theme-based tour by incorporating the exposure to best farming practices.After completion of the tour, the police department is also keen to extend them assistance to ensure they can implement the knowledge gained on the tour. “Apart from farming techniques, the population can also learn about various government schemes and facilities regarding agriculture and its policy on the tour,” said SP Ankit Goyal. “Naxals misguide these villagers stating that government has done nothing for the population,” he added.Sandip Patil, DIG Naxal range, said the tribal population is basically dependant on forest produce and least interested in engaging in modern farming which could help them emerge from the poverty.The women would be meeting experts at Central Citrus Research Institute in Nagpur, agricultural university in Akola, and Bamboo Research and Training Centre at Chichpalli in Chandrapur among other places including Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve.Goyal, who kickstarted the project under the supervision of Patil, said the objective is to make sure that the farming community in the tribal-dominated district is exposed to the modern farm techniques and possibilities. “We launched the project with the women by selecting them through the self-help groups engaged in empowering works. It is aimed at socio-political upliftment and their secondary effect would be to lessen the Maoist influence on them which is an incidental aspect,” he said.The women selected were from the families who had land for tilling and are into farming. “The farming practice is of primitive pattern in Gadchiroli which is uneconomical and also unyielding and so we decided to expose them to the best farming practices of Maharashtra,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gchiroli-cops-launch-agri-tourism-for-ryots-in-maoist-hit-district/articleshow/80692582.cms||Soumitra Bose

He said the police didn’t submit the CD file to the court. “On Monday, the court will hear the petitions of both parties and will decide on the bail petition. We will file a bail petition in the high court in the event of the local court rejecting the bail petition of Atchannaidu,” Rama Rao added.

The deceased were identified as Shravani and her daughter Sanvika. According to Chinna Chowk police station sub-inspector Ashok Reddy, the incident came to light at around 8am when locals found Shravani and her daughter hanging dead from the same ceiling fan. Upon receiving information, police reached the spot and initiated a probe. Preliminary investigation revealed that Sharavani was depressed due to her estranged relationship with her husband Sivakumar Reddy, a techie who used to work for a prominent software firm in the United States. “Both of them (the couple) were living separately for the last four years. We received a complaint from Shravani’s family and have registered a case,” the sub-inspector said. The husband, Sivakumar Reddy, has worked across different countries but has been living in Bengaluru since the lockdown, police said. A case has been registered under sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 302 (murder) of IPC and 174 (death due to hanging) of CrPC at Chinna Chowk police station.

February 5, 2021||Visakhapatnam||Psychiatric disorders can trigger occult killings, say experts||VISAKHAPATNAM: In Satyajit Ray’s award-winning film Devi (1960), protagonist Dayamayee’s father-in-law dreams that she is an incarnation of Goddess Durga. Soon, the entire village starts worshipping her. A terminally ill child brought to Dayamayee’s feet survives, which reinforces the blind belief of the family and villagers in her divine powers. With time, she too starts believing herself to be a reincarnation of the goddess and turns insane, even contemplating suicide when she fails to cure her nephew who dies due to lack of treatment. Ray’s film was set in the backdrop of 19th century India. We are now in the 21st century, but not much has changed still. Some places and families still continue to be blinded by superstitious belief, and engage in occult practices and tantric pujas with the help of some ‘godmen’ or ‘babas’. The recent double murder at Madanapalle, committed by educated and affluent parents (V Purushotham Naidu and wife Padmaja), is one such example. MVR Raju, professor of psychology at Andhra University, says Naidu and Padmaja seem to be suffering from personality disorder, hallucination and illusion stemming from a blind belief system. “Such mental disorder can be hereditary or triggered by environment and experience and require both psychiatric medication and counselling. The administration and government should also keep an eye on the activities of fake religious gurus or godmen,” says Raju. Dr Ramanand Satapathy, professor of psychiatry at GHMC, believes it could be a case of shared psychosis in which one of the members (the mother) might have been a patient of psychosis or some severe mental illness that was dormant in her. Concurring about the induced or shared psychosis theory, Dr C Radhakanth, professor of psychiatry at NRI Institute of Medical Sciences, pointed to the socio-religious system of culturally accepted overvalued ideation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/psychiatric-disorders-can-trigger-occult-killings-say-experts/articleshow/80693589.cms||Sulogna Mehta
February 5, 2021||Visakhapatnam||Murder accused at mental care hospital||Visakhapatnam: Purushotham Naidu and Padmaja, the lecturer couple from Madanapalle town in Chittoor district accused of killing their two daughters over suspected occult practice, were admitted to the government hospital for mental care in Vizag on Thursday for observation, examination and treatment. Escorted by the police and their faces covered, the couple reached the hospital in a government vehicle and was admitted to unit IV of the psychiatry department. They will be kept in observation in separate male and female wards for undertrials. Doctors said both of them were calm. “The wife did not speak at all or respond to any queries, while the husband was composed and apparently normal. It is the first day and relevant tests would be taken up subsequently. They will most likely be under a prolonged period of observation and treatment,” said a doctor at the hospital, adding that abreaction procedure might be used on the couple to get to the truth of the matter. Abreaction is a psychoanalytical process for reliving an experience to purge it of its emotional excesses. It can also be a method of making someone conscious of repressed traumatic events. “A short anaesthesia-kind agent is administered with the consent of patients to make them unconscious. When they are in the sub-conscious state, questions would be asked to know the truth behind the murders. They will also be made to relive the experience. Almost 99 per cent patients speak the truth during abreaction process,” the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/murder-accused-at-mental-care-hospital/articleshow/80693598.cms||Sulogna Mehta

Acting on a tip-off, DCB kept a watch near Raiya Telephone Exchange on Wednesday evening and intercepted a car. On checking, they found four boxes loaded with bottles packed in plastic and questioned the two people in the vehicle. They were planning to selling the concoction at paan shops in different parts of the city. “The bottles had inscriptions of ‘Ayurvedic Proprietary Medicine’ and maximum retail price (MRP) of each bottle was Rs 115. We grilled the driver of the car and got information about similar material have stored in godown on Old Morbi Road. From there, 47 bottles were found,” said police official. In all, DCB seized 2,550 bottles (each 300 ml) worth nearly Rs three lakh. Police arrested car driver Hardik Dudhrejiya (21), a resident of Munjka in Rajkot city. "He told us that one Girirajsinh Sodha was to receive the delivery of this intoxicating substance'. “The accused were selling the bottles directly at paan shops instead of medical stores or to patients and primary probe suggests that it's an organized racket of trafficking intoxicants,” a police official added. The seized material has been sent for forensic testing to ascertain the exact content. Earlier too, police had also busted similr rackets where intoxicant material was being sold as medicines and liquids at paan shops.

Jadav, who owns Alivez Gym and Fitness Centre on Race Course Road, has been accused of not paying salaries amounting to Rs 10.5 lakh to the trainers. According to 11 gym trainers, when the lockdown came into effect, Jadav sacked them from their jobs as the gym was closed and did not pay salaries to them for the months of January, February and March. When they asked Jadav to pay their salaries, he told them that he did not have money then so he will make arrangements within some days. In August, when the lockdown was lifted and government gave permission for reopening gymnasiums, Jadav too opened his gym. The trainers asked Jadav to pay their arrears then, but the accused promised them that he will start making payments to them. In September, Jadav was booked for cheating his partner Dr Devang Shah of crores of rupees and has been on run since then. While he is absconding, Jadav did not pay salaries and after waiting for months, the trainers approached police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/controversial-gym-owner-booked-for-not-paying-salaries-to-trainers/articleshow/80693052.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Surat||Ganja rackets busted, cops on trail of Odiya suppliers||Surat: As part of their campaign ‘No Drugs in Surat’, city police have stepped up their anti-drug vigil and carried out multiple operations against drug racket including the supply of ganja in the past six months. In many of these cases, the contraband link was traced to suppliers based in Odisha who were still supplying ganja to the city. Two teams of city police will therefore go to Odisha in search of at least 10 accused suppliers of the contraband there. “Police have identified some of the key players involved in supplying ganja, who are required to be arrested so that we can break the chain of drug supply in the city,” city police commissioner Ajay Tomar told TOI. Ganja is the highest-selling narcotics product that is consumed in large quantities in the city by people from various sections of the society. After cops cracked down on sophisticated and synthetic drugs, the availability of these narcotics have become difficult and so, ganja has filled the vacuum in some parts of the city. In the past, ganja was brought in to the city through trucks and trains from Odisha in huge quantity. Despite multiple seizures and arrests the supply continued unabated. However, rampant crackdown on such network of ganja distribution has hit the thriving illicit market in the recent past. “City police will seek Odisha police’s help to nab the wanted accused,” said Tomar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ganja-rackets-busted-cops-on-trail-of-odiya-suppliers/articleshow/80693827.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
February 5, 2021||Nagpur||Another tree transplantation disaster brewing at Ajni Van?||Nagpur: Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari is pacifying greens by promising that 70% of the trees to be felled for the Inter Modal Station (IMS) at Ajni, will be transplanted on the lines of Dwarka Expressway in Delhi. However, transplantation has been an utter failure, even if done scientifically, not only in Delhi but elsewhere in the country too, including Nagpur to be specific.On January 31, addressing the media, Gadkari allayed fears of green activists on large-scale tree felling and said the NHAI, which is implementing the IMS project, will transplant 70% trees. However, TOI found that several attempts in the city by MahaMetro, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), and Forest Development Corporation Maharashtra (FDCM) have failed miserably. FDCM transplanted 300 trees in 2017-2018 in Gorewada but many died.Environmentalist and plantation expert Prachi Mahurkar, who did a survey of trees at Ajni Van says, “There are 58 species of trees at Ajni. Considering their huge canopy, it will be a futile exercise to transplant trees from Ajnivan. A good natural green cover with creepers has developed over the last 100 years there.” As for Dwarka Expressway, which connects the industrial town of Gurugram, NHAI project director Nirman Jambhulkar says, “We transplanted around 5,000 trees in two years and the survival rate is 80-85%. We plan to transplant 5,000 more trees. We are doing it scientifically with an expert agency.”However, there have been many media reports about the failed transplantation of trees on Dwarka Expressway. V Selvarajan, founder of NGO Green Circle and resident of Dwarka, calls it a NHAI bluff. “As per the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) policy, 80% of trees transplanted should survive. But not many trees have survived.”The Green Circle team also released a video from Sector-23 in Dwarka, where many trees were transplanted. “A majority of trees are either dead or dying. Tree transplantation is not successful in India. Just digging a pit and watering won’t serve the purpose. Survival of a transplanted tree depends on many factors which are ignored,” says Selvarajan.Satyawrat Tyagi, general manager of J Kumar Infraprojects, an agency working for Dwarka transplantation, says, “The allegations are false. We are spending Rs 30,000 on each tree. People want immediate results, but it takes at least five months for shoots to come on a transplanted tree.”“It is true there were problems during Covid-19 as we were unable to water and manure trees. This led to some casualties, and media highlighted the failures,” says Tyagi.Green activist Jaydeep Das says, “Our past experience is of Aarey in Mumbai, where 64% transplanted trees died. In Nagpur, trees were reduced to stumps with no new shoots in last four years. The exercise is futile, and a waste of public money.”NMC garden superintendent Amol Chorpagar says, “All the roots of the trees have surface hair to enable infiltration of water and absorption of minerals and nutrients. Agencies try to dig small pits, which don’t allow water to reach the roots causing failure. Besides, success depends on tree species and health.”“Without scientific approach, it is like pulling out a pole from one place and fixing at a different place. I appeal to both, Centre and the state governments to prepare a policy and form an expert committee for accountability and systematic approach to tree transplantation,” said Selvarajan.BOXKEY TO TREE TRANSPLANTATION* Soil in both locations must match* Micronutrients and underground water sources in new area must be sufficient* New location must be free from disturbances like termites, concretization etc* Lot depends on species and age of tree* Transplanting agencies have to be technically capableFAILED TRANSPLANTATIONS IN NAGPURBy NMC at TekdiBy NMC near Trimurti Nagar (in 2004)By Mahametro in MIHANBy Mahametro in Patwardhan school ground, SitabuldiBy Mahametro in Ambazari Biodiversity park, Kachimet side||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/another-tree-transplantation-disaster-brewing-at-ajni-van/articleshow/80692702.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
February 5, 2021||Delhi||Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia slams bid by Centre to give LG more powers||NEW DELHI: The truce between the Delhi government and the Centre over exercise of powers seems to be over. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Thursday slammed the Centre after the Union cabinet approved some proposed amendments to the Government of NCT of Delhi Act to give more powers to the lieutenant governor and prescribe timelines for the elected government to send legislative and administrative proposals to the LG for his opinion. This was reported in TOI on Thursday. The Centre has included the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 for consideration and passage during the current Budget session of Parliament. Many progressive schemes delayed by LG in last five years, says SisodiaThe Bill gives unlimited powers to the LG, subverting the mandate of a democratically elected government,” Sisodia said, expressing his apprehension that the LG may use this act to unnecessarily intervene in matters of public interest and impede the government’s work in Delhi. The deputy chief minister said the BJP government at the Centre has secretly worked to get the Bill cleared, subverting the mandate of a democratically elected government. Calling the Bill “murder of constitutional democracy”, Sisodia said the central government wants to hinder Delhi’s development and progress by enhancing the LG’s powers. He said the Bill goes against the Constitution in giving more powers to the LG in addition to the existing powers on land, police and public order. The proposed amendment specifies that the elected city government needs to send legislative proposals to the LG at least 15 days in advance and that administrative proposals must reach him before seven days to seek his opinion and avoid any delays. The AAP government has had a long history of power tussle with the Centre that started as soon as it took over for the second time in 2015. “In its reading of the Constitution, the constitutional bench of Supreme Court has clearly demarcated the powers of elected government and LG. But, BJP, which has faced defeat thrice in the past, wants to govern Delhi through a proxy,” said Sisodia. "In the past five years, the LG has invariably hindered the decisions made by the Delhi government. Due to this, many progressive schemes, such as mohalla clinics, CCTVs, free electricity and water and school infrastructure improvement, have been delayed and the cost is paid by the people of Delhi,” Sisodia said. The AAP functionary said that BJP doesn’t want world class education and health facilities and free electricity and water for the people of Delhi. “That’s why it is taking to secretive and unconstitutional ways to impede the progress of Delhi. BJP hasn’t been able to provide basic facilities to people in the states governed by it. Rather than ensuring development in other states, it’s trying to deprive Delhiites by giving unlimited powers to LG in an undemocratic manner,” he said, adding that BJP will revoke free power, water and bus rides for women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-slams-bid-by-centre-to-give-lg-more-powers/articleshow/80698247.cms||AlokKNMishra

Guardian minister Nitin Raut, Congress MLA from North Nagpur, has expressed disappointment with Union minister Nitin Gadkari, also BJP city MP, for not inviting him to the meeting on the project. For last 10 years, the project to rejuvenate city’s iconic river-turned-nullah has remained only on papers.Raut told TOI, “State cabinet had appointed me chairman of committee for execution and monitoring of the project. Also, I am guardian minister of the district. Gadkari organized meeting on the project on January 27. Water resources department minister Jayant Patil (NCP), mayor Dayashankar Tiwari (BJP), and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis (BJP) were invited for the meeting. I did not receive any invitation. Discussion with guardian minister on any project is necessary for welfare of the district. BJP should ensure coordination if it wants to prevent opposition in development works. Otherwise, we will have to follow the same line which BJP is. I attended bhoomipuja programmes of Gadkari whenever invited.”The state cabinet on January 22, 2020, had approved revised cost of the project. A high-profile committee was also constituted with home minister Anil Deshmukh, sports and youth welfare minister Sunil Kedar, environment minister Aditya Thackeray as members and municipal commissioner as member secretary.Gadkari, Fadnavis, mayor and other legislators of BJP were not appointed as members in the committee. It gave birth to a political war between BJP and Congress.Raut also said he would start meetings of the committee soon to push forward the project.For last one year, neither the committee nor Gadkari held meeting to push the project. Agreement between centre, state and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is awaited for finalizing loan and beginning execution of the project.In the meeting, Gadkari had directed the finance department to expedite the process and also directed National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD) to commence tender process for appointment of project management consultant.The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court in 2010 had treated media reports of high-level pollution in Nag river polluting Kanhan, Wainganga rivers and Gosikhurd project as suo motu PIL and directed the civic body to rejuvenate the river. NMC had proposed the project in 2011. The project got momentum when Fadnavis became chief minister and Nitin Gadkari was elected as MP and appointed Union minister in 2014. The state’s cabinet and centre cleared the project in 2015.Due to inordinate delay in the project, the cost had increased from Rs1,476.96 crore to Rs 2,412.64 crore last year. Chances of further rise in the cost cannot be ruled out.NMC will execute the project. Centre, state and NMC will bear share of 60%, 25% and 15% respectively. Entire sewage generated in city will be treated, reused and two rivers will become free from pollution under the project.IAN* Nag, Pili and Pora rivers flow through city* Rivers turned into nullahs as NMC and NIT let city’s sewage flow in them* Rivers are polluting city’s environment as well as Kanhan, Wainganga rivers and Gosikhurd dam* HC in 2010 took cognisance of pollution and directed rejuvenation project* Sewage lines of 1,362.50km will be laid in areas along Nag and Pili rivers* Two STPs of 5 MLD each on Nag river at Mokshadham and Pili river at Mankapur will be built* Three new STPs of 72 MLD will be constructed at Shankar Nagar, Morbhavan bus stand and Martin Nagar* Four STPs of NIT will also be incorporated* Entire sewage coming into two rivers will be treated and then released in rivers* Water coming from storm water drains into rivers will be filtered before pouring into two rivers* NMC through French development agency is preparing another project — Nag Riverfront Development Project of Rs1,600 crore — in which banks of two rivers will be beautified and turned into recreational spaces||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/congress-bjp-row-erupts-over-nag-pili-river-project/articleshow/80692721.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

February 5, 2021||Mumbai||BMC banks on property tax and pending dues to boost revenue||MUMBAI: Since the BMC's revenue from the building proposal department was badly hit due to the lockdown, it is depending on property tax collection to increase its yearly earning. The municipal corporation aims to collect Rs 7,000 crore in 2021-22 through property tax, which will be its second highest revenue source after government grants in lieu of octroi. The slowdown in real estate deprived the corporation of its biggest income sources-so far, property tax collected this fiscal is a mere 17% of the targeted Rs 6,768 crore and building development charges are 70% less than the estimated Rs 3,880 crore. The BMC, however, set an ambitious target of Rs 7,000 crore for property tax collection in its 2021-22 budget, Rs 500 crore more than the targeted revenue estimated this fiscal. With the long-pending property dues amounting to over Rs 16,000 crore, the BMC plans to recover Rs 5,000 crore from various state government departments and Rs 1,600 crore from the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) to increase its revenue earning in 2021-22. "Property tax collection is BMC's major revenue source. Whatever tax dues we are unable to recover this year, we will do it next year. It is deferred payment which one need to pay, so it is not loss of the BMC," additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said. The BMC admitted that it will not meet the targeted Rs 6,768 crore earnings from property tax this fiscal, hence there will be a reduction of around Rs 2,300 crore in the collection till March end. In 2021-22, Mumbaikars will be charged the same amount they are paying in the current financial year, officials said. They added that the exemption in the general tax component of property tax collected from houses whose carpet area is below 500 sq ft is not affecting the BMC, as such amounts are only a couple of hundred crores. According to officials, earning from the building construction department has been affected as Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) has become an independent development authority for premises under its control and rakes in the construction premium which earlier came to the BMC. Also due to relaxation of open space around buildings norm, the BMC is unable to earn deficiency premium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-banks-on-property-tax-and-pending-dues-to-boost-revenue/articleshow/80698256.cms||Vijay V Singh
February 5, 2021||Nagpur||Former Congress leader Abha Pande to join NCP||Nagpur: Political churning has begun with a year to go for elections in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Abha Pande, former Congress leader and once a close associate of former Maharashtra minister Satish Chaturvedi, is likely to join Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the presence of senior party leaders, including deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, MP Praful Patel and home minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday. Pande is the only independent corporator in the NMC house. She had headed the standing committee during her stint with the Congress a decade ago. Pande was also city president of Congress Women’s Cell, and was also general secretary of the city Congress. As standing committee chairman, Pande was also trustee of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT). Two months ago, Pande met senior NCP leaders including Pawar and Patil in Mumbai, said sources in NCP. Pande had resigned from the Congress as she was denied a ticket, and contested as an independent candidate from Nagpur Central in 2014 assembly elections. NCP has recently started focusing on Vidarbha, where it has negligible presence. After senior party leader Praful Patel toured all the districts in the region, NCP chief Jayant Patil has been touring Vidarbha since the last couple of days. Now, Pawar is coming to make NCP’s presence felt in the region, which is now a BJP and Congress citadel. Pande was not only very active in her wards but also in assembly constituencies like Central and East Nagpur, political sources said. With their entry, the NCP is focusing on improving its tally in the NMC too. Currently, the party has only one corporator, Duneshwar Pethe. Sources said senior city NCP leaders are also in touch with many disgruntled BJP leaders. Party insiders confirmed that a former corporator from South-West constituency is in touch with NCP leaders, including Deshmukh. When Patil was in the city, one of the former standing committee chairmen too was contacted. Sources said with municipal corporation elections due early next year, the city will witness many such political movements in the days to come. Recently, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Prashant Pawar too joined NCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/former-congress-leader-abha-pande-to-join-ncp/articleshow/80692738.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
February 5, 2021||Nagpur||Portion of concrete ceiling collapses at NMC’s administrative building||Nagpur: A Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) official had a miraculous escape after a portion of the concrete ceiling collapsed in the basement parking of the new administrative building at Civil Lines on Tuesday evening.The incident took place when an official was in the basement to drive away his parked car. “I was lucky it did not fall on me or my four-wheeler,” the official said, requesting anonymity.As the plaster on the beam and some concrete came off, iron rods inside were exposed, revealing the poor quality construction work of the seven-storey building. TOI had reported on various issues here in the past. On Thursday too, TOI witnessed water seeping from the ceiling at many places in the basement parking.Construction of the building had started in 2003, and the ground floor was brought into use in 2013. The building still does not have a completion certificate or occupancy certificate.NMC officials have preferred to ignore the problems in the building, which also houses the offices of municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, Smart City office, and fire and emergency services headquarters. Despite repeated attempts, junior engineer A Mankar, who is also maintenance in-charge of the building, was not available for comments.Some builders visiting NMC’s town planning department in the same building said seepage can be seen in toilets on all the floors, and this has started weakening its foundation. They said creating proper drainage pipes would solve the problem. Structural experts said water seepage in the building over months will damage the structure. “The load bearing capacity of soil reduces once it gets wet,” experts pointed out.Despite many complaints over months, no action has been taken yet. Visitors also showed seepage marks on almost every floor exposing substandard quality of building construction. “There is leakage from toilets on almost all floors making the entire building stink,” said Rita Gelurkar, a visitor.The ill-maintained basement of the building can also be gauged from the fact that despite having ample basement parking facility for four-wheelers hardly any visitor dares to park vehicle there. “The basement parking for cars at the administrative building is useless due to this problem. This is forcing visitors, including NMC officials, to park vehicles on internal roads around NMC HQ premises,” said a security guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/portion-of-concrete-ceiling-collapses-at-nmcs-administrative-building/articleshow/80692748.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
February 5, 2021||Nagpur||After husband’s death, widow moves court for emergency med services across all state hosps||Nagpur: A homemaker has knocked the doors of the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court praying for emergency services in hospitals across the state to treat serious patients. Mamta Katare (30), who lost her husband due to lack of treatment, demanded services like first aid, portable electrocardiogram (ECG) machine, ambulance, general medicine and dietary facilities across all private and government hospitals, including those in rural areas. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Pushpa Ganediwala on Monday treated the issue as a PIL and directed its registry to place it before the appropriate bench. The state departments of medical education and drugs and home along with police superintendent, Katol police station officer and government medical college and hospital (GMCH) district surgeon have been made respondents. The petitioner, through counsel Rajnish Vyas, demanded constitution of three committees on the lines of the draft rules for the ‘Bombay Nursing Home Registration Act (Amendment), 2005’. These included — local supervisory authority, district registration nursing board and state nursing home registration board. “The quality in the proposed ‘minimum standards for private hospitals/nursing homes’ formulated by the Bombay Nursing Homes’ Association should be made mandatory to all hospitals. A time-bound plan for implementing these directives be formulated within six months and complied with in a year from the formulation date,” she prayed. The petitioner further insisted on granting compensation to her because of her husband’s death due to alleged negligence by the concerned medical practitioner and also initiating an inquiry from the district surgeon into the entire incident. In 2006, Katare entered into a wedlock with Sanjay, who was an assistant teacher in Lona village in Chandrapur, and had a son and a daughter. On June 2, 2016, her husband had attended a marriage and felt uneasy. He was immediately taken to Lata Mangeshkar Rural Health Centre in Katol. The medical officer had conducted an ECG test and advised him to take rest. After Sanjay complained of back pain, the doctor advised him to take an X-ray from any other hospital since they lacked the facility. When he was leaving, he suddenly collapsed and was taken inside the same hospital. The doctor there put an oxygen mask and asked his relatives to shift him immediately to another hospital. He was then taken to Dr Chinche’s hospital in Katol, which refused to admit him. Full report on www.toi.in Finally, relatives took him to the government hospital in Katol, but he was declared dead on arrival. His brother then lodged an oral complaint with Katol police alleging negligence and improper treatment by the medical officer at Lata Mangeshkar Hospital. After the medical officer reserved his opinion about the cause of death in the post mortem, the petitioner approached HC with grievances in 2016. The HC then directed the woman to make a representation with the appropriate authority, including the government’s home department, GMCH’s district health officer, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Health Care providers in New Delhi. When there was no progress, she again knocked the doors of the judiciary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-husbands-death-widow-moves-court-for-emergency-med-services-across-all-state-hosps/articleshow/80692766.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
February 5, 2021||Nagpur||HCL Technologies to add 1,000 employees at its Mihan campus||NAGPUR: HCL Technologies plans to add 1,000 employees at its campus in Mihan-SEZ. The first batch of 300 are expected to be recruited in March, said Srimathi Shivashankar, corporate vice-president of HCL. Currently, the IT company employs 2,000 persons at its campus in the city. Shivashankar, who was in Nagpur to announce the recruitment plans, said the campus at Mihan had reopened last month, coming out of the work from home mode. At present around 20% of the techies are working from the campus though the staff has an option to work from home as well. “HCL did not resort to any lay off or pay cuts during the Covid times, and rather the bonuses were paid in time and none of the other facilities were curtailed,” she said. Rather Covid has also opened up new opportunities for the IT sector, which has been already going strong. Work is going on for digital projects related to the medical sector over technologies that have come up in light of the pandemic, she said. A number of meditech companies are carrying out new projects in which even the IT companies have a role like in the field of artificial intelligence, she said. The HCL campus, which had started in 2018, has a total capacity of 5,000 techies in all, out of which 2,000 are already there. It is expected that in another two years the entire capacity would be utilized. This would be on the 50 acres land on which the campus stands at present. HCL also started the process to take back 90 acres of land in Mihan-SEZ that the company had earlier returned to Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC). Initially, HCL had been allotted 140 acres land in the SEZ being developed by MADC, a state government agency. However, the company, which had paid money for the entire land parcel, expressed its intention to return 90 acres on the grounds that it did not require as much area. Later, in 2019, HCL changed its mind and wanted the 90 acres back, said sources aware of the development. Now, the process of signing a fresh lease deed for the 90 acres will be initiated soon, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hcl-technologies-to-add-1000-employees-at-its-mihan-campus/articleshow/80692785.cms||Shishir Arya
February 5, 2021||Nagpur||HC warns jail SP, CBI of instituting retd judge’s probe||Nagpur: Peeved over failure of Central Jail superintendent Anup Kumre to explain his stand of not releasing an accused from the prison despite its orders, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday warned him and the CBI to institute an inquiry from a retired HC judge if they failed to explain their stand. This is the second time in a row, Kumre came under a scathing attack from the judiciary as he himself contradicted his statements in two affidavits filed by him in the court. On Wednesday, he was summoned by the bench comprising justices Zaka Haq and Amit Borkar for not complying with its orders of releasing an accused Ravishekhar Londekar. Now, the judges had granted time to CBI to explain the entire incident, as it had challenged Londhekar’s acquittal in HC, after sessions court released him from the offences. On Wednesday, the jail SP had cited the reason for receiving the accused’s release order late after 5pm and informed the affidavit that as per prison manual, no inmate can be released in the evening. After receiving flak from the HC, he filed another affidavit on Thursday stating that the HC order was in a drop box and therefore, he couldn’t see it in time. His contradictory stand irked the judges, which blasted him for misleading them. The judges warned CBI and Kumre to file an affidavit with full responsibility without trying to mislead the court on why they didn’t release Londhekar despite their specific orders and why any accused can’t be released after 5pm even after HC’s orders and under which rules. On Tuesday, the same bench had directed the SP to release an accused. His relatives then approached the jail authorities with an order copy. However, the SP allegedly refused their requests and also demanded sessions’ court orders for releasing him. His accused’s relatives then knocked HC’s doors through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar assisted by Saurabh Bhende.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-warns-jail-sp-cbi-of-instituting-retd-judges-probe/articleshow/80692788.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
February 5, 2021||Nagpur||Govt to HC: Sale of nylon manja banned||Nagpur: The Maharashtra government has informed the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday that it had banned sale and purchase of nylon manja in the state as per National Green Tribunal (NGT) directives. An affidavit filed by environment and climate change department principal secretary Manisha Patankar-Mhaiskar informed that steps in this regard were immediately taken after NGT’s orders of January 21 last year. She informed that for effective implementation of NGT’s orders, letters were issued by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to concerned departments to act against manja sellers. Even at Mantralaya level, similar directives were issued to all police commissionerates and superintendents to constitute a task force and prohibit sale of the deadly nylon thread that had claimed several lives over the years. The secretary further informed that the government was making all out efforts to prohibit sale and purchase of Chinese manja. When the HC asked her why the sale was still continuing and lives were still lost despite government’s efforts, she sought three weeks to reply on affidavit. The HC was hearing a suo motu PIL based on TOI and other media reports on deaths of 23-year-old engineering student Pranay Thakre and 22-year-old Saurabh Patankar this year after their throats were slit by the deadly strings over roads. In last hearing, the HC had asked the government to inform on compliance of NGT’s directives in this regard. Based on NGT orders, environment department secretary Satish Gavai had issued a notification to ban its sale on June 18, 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-to-hc-sale-of-nylon-manja-banned/articleshow/80692800.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
February 5, 2021||Goa||Supreme Court adjourns hearing in Goa mining case till month-end||PANAJI: The Supreme Court (SC) has adjourned the hearing in the mining matter till February 24 as the order in the review petition in mining cases was not available with the bench, advocate general Devidas Pangam said. The apex court had earlier heard the review petition on January 21 in the chamber. In February 2018, SC had quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases bringing the entire industry to a halt in the state. The state government had the filed a review petition against this order. Mining companies had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions, challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. During the Portuguese rule, the appellants (mining companies) were granted mining concessions, which were then converted into mining leases under the act. The SLP stated that the act should be made applicable from 1987 instead of 1961. The state government had also told SC that the companies had made a representation to the mines department, contending that under the amendment to section 8A of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, (MMDR Act), they are entitled to extend their leases to 2037, but that they would abide by the court’s order. The state government had said before the SC that the mining companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8A of the MMDR Act, they are entitled to extend their mining leases up to 2037, but that it would abide by the decision of the court. In August 2020, the state government filed an application before the Supreme Court asking that its review petition in the mining case be tagged along with the one filed by companies seeking to extend their mining leases till 2037. The government had filed a review petition in 2019 against the apex court’s February 2018 order that had quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases and stopped mining activity in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sc-adjourns-hearing-in-goa-mining-case-till-month-end/articleshow/80697052.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Goa||New info commissioners, but govt cuts members||Panaji: The government on Thursday appointed ex-speaker of the legislative assembly, Vishwas Satarkar, as chief information commissioner (CIC) and journalist Sanjay Dhavalikar as state information commissioner (SIC). The appointment orders were handed to Satarkar and Dhavalikar by director of information and publicity Sudhir Kerkar. Satarkar, who won on a BJP ticket from Priol in 2002, served as speaker of the legislative assembly from June 2002 to February 2005. He has completed his BCom and also has an LLB. A journalist for three decades, Dhavalikar was the editor of a local daily. For a brief period, just before Goa hosted the first International Film Festival of India in 2004, he was part of the Entertainment Society of Goa. The office of the SIC will become functional after the two appointed commissioners take the oath that will be administered by the governor. “The government will fix the oath ceremony after the governor fixes a date,” an official said. TOI had reported that the commission had become non functional after its last commissioner Pratima Vernekar demitted office last month. After incumbent Prashant Tendolkar demitted office in February last year, Vernekar was the officiating CIC. The other commissioner, Juino De Souza, retired in July last year. The commission, which decides appeals pertaining to non answered RTI applications and complaints against non release of information, will now have only two commissioners compared to the previous terms when it had one CIC and two SICs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-info-commissioners-but-govt-cuts-members/articleshow/80697066.cms||---
February 5, 2021||India||Oppn slams govt over agri laws in RS, Scindia mounts defence||NEW DELHI: The opposition in Rajya Sabha on Thursday continued its attack on the Centre over the farmers' protest on Delhi borders against the recently enacted three farm laws, while former Congress leader-turned-BJP star Jyotiraditya Scindia was the leading speaker from treasury benches defending the new legislations. Trinamool Congress leader Derek O'Brien said the government should "first take care of Delhi and then think of Bengal" in a reference to BJP's campaign against the Mamata Banerjee government, while Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda said the Centre has no right to question the patriotism of farmers whose sons protect the borders. Scindia slammed "double standards" of the opposition, quoting from the Congress' 2019 manifesto and said: "Congress will repeal, I repeat, will repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committees Act and make trade in agricultural produce including exports and inter-state trade free, I repeat, free from all restrictions." He further said that in 2010-11, then agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had written to all chief ministers and said that private sector participation was necessary in agriculture and amendments were needed in the APMC Act. "Yeh juban badalne ki aadat badalni hogi. Chit bhi mera pat bhi mera kab tak chalega (Opposition parties will have to change the habit of going back on their words. Heads I win, tails you lose. How long this will go on?)," he said. Lok Sabha failed to transact any substantive business for the third day with an unrelenting and united opposition stuck to its demand for a discussion on the farmers' issue. Congress and like-minded parties like DMK, Left, NCP as also TMC raised slogans, with members trooping into the well of the House, ignoring the pleas of Speaker Om Birla for order. The government managed to introduce "the arbitration and conciliation amendment bill" before the final adjournment. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi held a meeting with like-minded parties to elicit their views on the future course of action. The meeting saw the participants, including Shiv Sena, assert that the opposition should not relent till the government agrees to have a separate debate on the farmers issue. The unity in the anti-BJP axis appears stronger this time as sources said that while SP and BSP did not attend the meeting called by Rahul Gandhi, they conveyed that they will stand with the opposition. In the RS, DMK's N R Elango alleged the government was violating the federal structure with the farm laws as the states have the exclusive right to enact laws relating to agriculture. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh also slammed the government while urging it to repeal the three laws. TMC's O'Brien alleged the government had failed to uphold the sanctity of Parliament. Digvijay Singh slammed the slapping of sedition cases against journalists and civil rights activists. Former PM H D Deve Gowda said the government and farmers should resolve the concerns through dialogue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oppn-slams-govt-over-agri-laws-in-rs-scindia-mounts-defence/articleshow/80698281.cms||---

With due consultations with the south Goa collector the project was worked out,” adding that it will have parking facility for about 14-15 coaches, 200 four-wheelers and 180 two-wheelers. The drivers can wait here and rest till they are called to pick passengers. It will also have a rest room. About 586sqm of land from the 5,900sqm will be kept as green belt.” Godinho also said that the multi-level car parking building next to the terminal building will be ready for use in the next two months. He said that efforts are on to get more land for parking in front of the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parking-facility-at-goa-airport-to-be-ready-by-nov-godinho/articleshow/80697076.cms||---
February 5, 2021||Goa||High court notice to EC over Kamat disqualification plea||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Thursday issued notices to the Election Commission of India and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat over a petition filed seeking his disqualification as an MLA on the grounds that his wife’s business entities had subsisting contracts with the government when he filed his nomination for the assembly election. Petitioner Shirish Kamat is aggrieved by the order of the Goa governor which dismissed his review application seeking Kamat’s disqualification. He alleged that the governor acted on an erroneous and misleading opinion of the Election Commission of India. The petitioner stated that Digambar acted through his proxies— his wife and his son— in both a firm and company. These business entities had subsisting contracts with the government of Goa at the time of filing his nomination for elections to the Goa legislative assembly in 2017. He submitted to the court that the EC erred in observing that “even assuming that the respondent No. 4 (Digambar Kamat) derives monetary benefits due to his wife’s position as a shareholder in the company, which has subsisting contracts with the appropriate government, this in itself is not a sufficient criterion for the disqualification of respondent No 4 under Section 9 A of the Representation of People Act, 1951 as the same is completely contradictory to the provisions of Portuguese Civil Code in Goa”.
