The move comes at a time when the telecom sector is gearing up for spectrum auctions and roll-out of new-age technologies. "...the Board of Directors of the company, in its meeting held on February 03, 2021, reviewed company's routine financing/ re-financing strategies including any market maturities in due course, and approved raising of funds as and when deemed appropriate, vide issuance of secured/ unsecured, listed/ unlisted non-convertible debt securities including debentures, bonds etc. upto Rs 7,500 crore (or in equivalent foreign currency)...," the company said in a regulatory filing. This will take place in one or more tranches from time to time, and subject to all applicable regulatory/ statutory approvals, the filing added. "The board also authorised the Special Committee of Directors to decide, basis market conditions, on all matters related to the aforesaid issuance of securities including but not limited to the finalisation and approval of the detailed terms and conditions, quantum of tranche(s) and timings of the issue etc," Airtel further said. Bharti Airtel - which also announced its Q3 scorecard on Wednesday - has logged net profit of Rs 854 crore for December quarter against Rs 1,035 crore loss a year ago, as the telco witnessed improved realisations and the strong customer additions. Airtel posted its highest-ever consolidated quarterly revenue of Rs 26,518 crore in third quarter of financial year 2020-21, up 24.2 per cent over the year-ago period. Bharti Airtel had last week announced that its network is 5G ready now as the company successfully demonstrated live fifth-generation service -- with ultra-high speeds -- over a commercial network in Hyderabad city. Telecom operators are preparing to leverage 5G as the next frontier for future growth to bolster revenue streams and provide a stronger customer experience. Airtel had emphasised that the actual impact of the 5G experience will be available to customers "when the adequate spectrum is available, and government approvals are received." Airtel's latest fundraising plan comes at a time when the government has set the ball rolling for the spectrum auction, in which radio waves valued at Rs 3.92 lakh crore will be put on the block. The auction in seven spectrum bands for mobile services - 700, 800, 900, 1800, 2100, 2300 and 2500MHz bands - is scheduled to start from March 1. Experts tracking the sector have forecast "limited participation," though. Some believe that spectrum auction in India has turned into a buyer's market and may see "minimal competition" with operators going after airwaves that yield the best value for money instead of focusing on renewing all expiring spectrum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/airtel-board-approves-up-to-rs-7500-crore-fund-raising-plans/articleshow/80675671.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Business||LIC IPO may hit market in Q4 of next fiscal: DEA secretary||NEW DELHI: The initial public offering (IPO) of LIC may hit the market in the fourth quarter of next financial year, and the government has introduced amendments to the Life Insurance Corporation Act 1956 to facilitate this, Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said on Wednesday. As many as 27 amendments have been pushed through the Finance Bill 2021 tabled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday along with the Union Budget 2021-22. "Probably in the third or fourth quarter of next financial year, depending on how soon the valuation comes," he told PTI in an interview. On Monday, the finance minister announced that the IPO of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) will take place in the next financial year. Currently, the government owns a 100 per cent stake in LIC. Once listed, LIC is likely to become the country's biggest company by market capitalisation with an estimated valuation of Rs 8-10 lakh crore. DIPAM, which manages government's equity in state-owned companies, has already selected actuarial firm Milliman Advisors for ascertaining the embedded value of LIC, ahead of the initial public offer. While Deloitte and SBI Caps have been appointed as pre-IPO transaction advisors. The government on Monday budgeted Rs 1.75 lakh crore from stake sale in public sector companies and financial institutions, including 2 PSU banks and one insurance company, in the next fiscal year beginning April 1. The amount is lower than the record budgeted Rs 2.10 lakh crore to be raised from CPSE disinvestment in the current fiscal. However, Covid-19 pandemic impacted the government's CPSE stake sale programme, and the target has been lowered to Rs 32,000 crore in the Revised Estimates. So far this fiscal, the government has mopped up Rs 19,499 crore from CPSE stake sale and share buyback.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lic-ipo-may-hit-market-in-q4-of-next-fiscal-dea-secretary/articleshow/80675748.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Residents oppose tree park in Turahalli forest||BENGALURU: For the second consecutive day, over 100 residents protested the proposed development of a tree park in Turahalli forest. Enraged after spotting two earthmovers cleaning the area on Tuesday, they decided to intensify the stir on Wednesday. Residents thought the earthmovers were clearing the forest to set up the park, which was commissioned by chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s Vision 2022. Last week, he had announced a tree park would be created on 400 acres of land by April 2021, which left locals agitated. The proposed park will have a walking track, concrete structures, toilets, canteen, play area, water dispenser and gazebo. A protester stood outside the forest entrance, holding placards and shouting slogans— Kaadu Ulisi, Naadu Belesi (save forest; let the country grow). “The natural flora and fauna would be lost if a tree park is developed here. It will be a place for tourism and picnics,” said Abdul Aleem, co-founder of Changemakers of Kanakapura Road. Another resident and member of Save Turahalli campaign, Vijetha Sanjay Mysoremutt, said no public consultation was held. “Why does the government not discuss anything with us before giving a go-ahead to these projects?” Mysoremutt said. Another resident, Venugopal, said on Tuesday when locals questioned contractors at the spot if they had a work order, they fled. “Forest officials need to book an FIR pertaining to earth-movers entering the forest area without any permission or work order,” Venugopal said. There are enough trees in the forest and a special park in not required, he added. Range forest officer Gopal AA rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the residents. But they continued to protest until the earthmovers stopped working. Forest officers said the earthmovers were creating firebreaks. “We are working to prevent forest fires because summer is nearing. We have not begun work on the tree park yet,” Gopal said. After a protester raised a question about the work order, a senior forest officer said: “By the time the department issues the order, things would have gone bad. We can’t wait till then.” Another forest officer pointed out the government has sanctioned Rs 6.4 crore for construction of the tree park. “The park will be built on the periphery without destroying the forest, but according to the Forest Conservation Act, 1999, even that is not allowed. We’re not sure how the government is planning to go ahead with the project,” said the officer . ‘Work order not issued yet’The officer said he was aware of the protest. “We are only trying to prevent forest fire. Work order for development of the tree park has not been issued yet. Locals and environmentalists need not worry as of now,” he said. Deputy conservator of forests Ravishankar was unavailable for comment. Residents said they would resume their protest if the tree park work continues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/residents-oppose-tree-park-in-turahalli-forest/articleshow/80675785.cms||Nithya Mandyam
February 4, 2021||Goa||Ajay is BFI president, Goa’s Danuska joint secretary||In a high-stakes election for the Boxing Federation of India (BFI), incumbent Ajay Singh held on to his turf and warded off political pressure to retain the president’s post for the second successive term, defeating his nearest rival, Ashish Shelar, by 37-27 votes on Wednesday. For the post of secretary general, Assam’s Hemanta Kalita, who was treasurer in Singh’s first regime, emerged victorious by 39-25 votes, defeating Kerala’s C B Raje. The treasurer’s post went to Madhya Pradesh’s Digvijay Singh, who defeated Uttar Pradesh’s Anil Mishra 33-30. Mishra had gone to the Delhi High Court when the elections were postponed by the BFI owing to reservations expressed by some of the associations due to the pandemic. Eight zonal vice-presidents and an equal number of joint secretaries were also elected during the AGM. Among the joint secretary is Goa’s Danuska Da Gama, who defeated her rival 33-31 in a close victory. She is currently secretary of the Goa Boxing Association. After his election, Singh thanked AIBA for the support in the last four years and was grateful to AIBA president Umar Kremlev for sending an observer at short notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ajay-is-bfi-president-goas-danuska-joint-secretary/articleshow/80676060.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Bengaluru||Stigma, lack of pain delay early detection of breast cancer: Doctors||BENGALURU: A monthly self-examination is good enough to detect breast cancer at an early stage, but it’s not been followed by several women aged above 20 who end up seeking help at the third stage of the disease, doctors rue. In Karnataka, breast cancer is the leading cause or factors to 28% of cancer among women, as per the state health and family welfare data. Lack of awareness and ignoring the subtle changes are seen even among the educated and this is the prime reason for late detection, doctors point out. “Breast is still seen as a sex organ though it’s just another body part. Women feel shy to talk even as they notice changes. On Wednesday, I saw a 53-year-old woman who was aware of growth in her breast for more than a year, but never spoke about it to her sons. When she came to meet me, she was already in stage 3,” Dr Jayanti Thumsi, lead consultant – breast oncology, Apollo Hospitals, says. Close to 80% of the breast lumps are not cancerous and even if they are, breast cancer is the most treatable form, she adds. “Incidence of breast cancer is high in the Western world, but in India, though the incidence is less, the mortality rate is high. One out of two newly detected breast cancer patients dies within five years,” Dr Thumsi added. Breast self-examination is suggested one week after the periods. It should be repeated at the same time every month because during this window of the monthly cycle, the breasts are not very tender or lumpy. In case of menopause, it is recommended to do self-examination on the same day every month. According to Dr Anthony Pais, senior consultant – Oncoplastic Breast Surgery, clinical director, Cytecare hospital, 80-90 % of breast cancer patients who come to him at the advanced stages say they had not experienced pain. “To wait for pain is a wrong message. There is no pain associated with breast cancer. Misconceptions like one would lose breast if cancer is detected also makes many women end up with delayed presentations to the hospitals,” says Dr Pais. Over 75% of the breast cancer cases seen at government-run Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology are already in advanced stages. “The lack of screening programmes in India is a major hindrance. Any woman —18 years and above, who has a background of breast cancer case in the family, must not ignore self breast examination once a month. That apart, she must consult an oncologist once in three years,” says Dr C Ramachandra, director, Kidwai. He adds that alcohol, fat and red meat consumption, smoking, red meat consumption and sedentary lifestyle are all risk factors. Dr Pais adds that in 5-8 % of the cases, young women do consult doctors they know, or gynaecologists. “In some cases, doctors too take it lightly, as not every doctor is trained in breast cancer diagnosis. There are cases wherein mammograms are interpreted wrong and women have missed out on initial treatment options,” adds Dr Pais. Among the educated women, those in their early 20s are more careful to watch for any subtle changes in their breast, than those aged 30-40 years, says Dr Akshita Singh – Consultant – Breast Oncology, Narayana Health Mazumdar Shaw Medical Centre. “A quiet painless lump sitting in the breast gives a false sense of security. Only when the size of the lump is big and visible externally, women consult doctors,” says Dr Singh. She adds that women don’t discuss it even with their daughters, mother, or relatives. “The inherent shyness to speak about the breast, inability to discuss any changes in breast and lack of awareness about breast self examination are to be tackled,” says Dr Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/stigma-lack-of-pain-delay-early-detection-of-breast-cancer-docs/articleshow/80676284.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Though he had left home 45 minutes before the scheduled time, the poor condition of Whitefield’s Borewell Road resulted in the delay. The boy’s father, Srinivas Reddy, a resident of Borewell Road, was furious. He shot a video of the road and posted it on Whitefield Rising’s Twitter handle. It has gone viral now. According to Reddy, a 2km stretch which is in a deplorable state derailed his plan. #nallurhallikapadi protest was a few years back. Promises made @ArvindLBJP yet to be fulfilledSituation remains g… https://t.co/zlGPNTP2kE— Whitefield Rising (@WFRising) 1612006970000“We left home at 8am hoping to reach the exam centre, which is 10km away, before 8.30am,” Reddy told TOI. From Borewell Road, they were to take the Whitefield Main Road-Varthur Kodi-Madhuranagara route to reach the school. Two hundred metres away from his home, a truck had broken down on the road. Both sides were choked with traffic, making it impossible for Reddy to go back and take an alternative road. “The truck heading towards Nallurhalli was stuck because of the road’s poor condition,” Reddy added. They finally reached the school around 8.45am, when the exam officer disallowed the boy from writing the paper stating he was late. “We pleaded with the teachers to let my son to sit for the exam but they didn’t agree. The school management lectured us to start one hour early,” he lamented. Reddy’s plight is shared by many in Whitefield. Most roads have been dug up and finding an alternative one to reach a destination has become a challenge for residents. “Thanks to the pandemic, we are asked to work from home. Else we have no hope of reaching any destination on time because of the bad condition of roads,” said Jagadish C, a resident of Varthur. Posting Reddy’s video of Borewell Road’s miserable state on Twitter, Whitfield Rising said: “#nallurhallikapadi protest was a few years back. Promises made @ArvindLBJP yet to be fulfilled. Situation remains grave, if not worse c...The dug up sections outside the Post Office remains unchanged for year+” (sic). The hashtag, Nallurhalli Kapadi, alludes to a massive protest in the area held over the poor state of roads.

February 4, 2021||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Delay prompts BMRCL to end Simplex contract for Metro work on Bannerghatta Road||BENGALURU: Under fire for inordinate delay, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has terminated the contract of cash-strapped Simplex Infrastructures Ltd for work on Bannerghatta Road. The Kolkata-based construction firm had in 2017 received the contract for two elevated Metro lines: 7.5km Kalena Agrahara-Swagath Road Cross on Bannerghatta Road and the 3km Nagasandra-Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) on Tumakuru Road. The work was supposed to be completed in 2019. However, only 35% civil work on Bannerghatta Road and 68% on Tumakuru Road were over by December 2020. The work on Bannerghatta Road has now completely stopped. However, Simplex will continue to work on Tumakuru Road since it’s a small section. This is probably for the first time BMRCL is taking such a tough step against a civil contractor for delay in work. BMRCL managing director Ajay Seth said: “We’ve issued a termination notice since the elevated section was getting delayed as Simplex was unable to perform. BMRCL expects it to complete work on Tumakuru Road.” Simplex was unavailable for comments. Tender for pending workBMRCL will have to float a fresh tender to complete the pending work. “It’s a challenge to select a new firm since it is a time-consuming process. Many contractors are now facing financial distress especially after the pandemic, so it is also not easy for them to mobilise additional resources. BMRCL may float a short-time tender and firms already working with them may be keen to take up this work,” said an expert. BMRCL set a June-2024 deadline for Kalena Agrahara-Nagawara corridor. In September 2017, BMRCL awarded this section including five Metro stations — Kalena Agrahara (Gottigere), Hulimavu, IIM Bengaluru, JP Nagar 4th Phase and Swagath Road Cross — to Simplex at a cost of Rs 579 crore. While Kalena Agrahara-Swagath Road Cross is elevated, the underground section is between Dairy Circle and Nagawara. In February 2017, Simplex received the BIEC Metro contract with three stations including Manjunathanagar, Chikkabidarkallu (Jindal) and Madavara (BIEC), at a cost of Rs 299 crore. Officials said Nagasandra-BIEC will be completed in January 2022. Incidentally, last year, United Bank of India, the leader of a consortium of 28 lenders, identified Simplex as a ‘non-performing asset’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/delay-prompts-bmrcl-to-end-firms-contract/articleshow/80676532.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

February 4, 2021||India||House panel advises govt to tread cautiously on DNA Bill||NEW DELHI: A parliamentary committee in its report on the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill on Wednesday suggested the government to "pay very careful attention" to certain views on very important issues on the proposed legislation, saying some members have expressed their fears that the bill when it becomes a law "could be used to target certain sections of our society". The bill, sent to the standing committee after its introduction in 2019, provides for the use of DNA technology for establishing the identity of certain persons such as suspects, offenders, and victims. It also has provisions for the establishment of a DNA Regulatory Board which will supervise DNA data banks and DNA labs. Two members of the committee - Lok Sabha MP and leader of AIMIM, Asaduddin Owaisi, and Rajya Sabha MP and leader of CPI Binoy Viswam - had submitted their dissent notes to the panel, raising their concerns over issue of violation of individual's privacy and its adverse impact on marginalised and minority communities. It was, however, clarified that the DNA profiles to be stored are not for an entire population but for specified categories of individuals such as convicts and suspects of major crimes, relatives of missing persons so that their profiles can be compared with profiles of unidentified deceased individuals. Suggesting "independent and impartial checks and balances at every stage of the process" in the backdrop of such concerns, the panel, headed by RS member and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, said the government must address concerns in Parliament and outside, and pitched for procedural fairness in collection of samples of accused while underlining that illegally obtained evidence is inadmissible in court. Noting that the rights against self-incrimination have been widely accepted as a natural right and find a prominent place in the Constitution, the panel said, "This ensures that no person is forced to provide evidence that may incriminate him/her in any crime. There are no exceptions to this rule and all courts have accepted this as an inviolable guarantee. It said, "This will enable the legal system to understand the technology's limitations, identify when it is appropriate to use DNA technology to solve crimes appropriate and over time, substantially minimise all possible errors. Widespread and extensive training is of paramount importance."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/house-panel-advises-govt-to-tread-cautiously-on-dna-bill/articleshow/80677433.cms||---

February 4, 2021||India||Farmers protest: MEA slams ‘vested interests,’ social media turns battle zone||NEW DELHI: The farmers' protests that have been raging on Delhi's borders escalated into a full-blown global war of words on social media on Wednesday with tweets flying from both sides and the ministry of external affairs taking the unusual step of reacting to tweets by private foreign individuals with a detailed official statement and senior government ministers and Indian celebrities joining in the pushback. The foreign ministry said "vested interest groups" had been trying to "mobilise international support against India" and that "the temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible". US vice-president Kamala Harris's niece Meena Harris, who's a lawyer, climate activist Greta Thunberg, US House foreign affairs committee member Jim Costa, YouTuber Lilly Singh, poet Rupi Kaur, rapper Russ, former adult film star Mia Khalifa, UK MP Claudia Webbe and a host of others had earlier come out in support of the ongoing farmers' agitation after Rihanna's one-line post on Tuesday. "Why aren't we talking about this?!," the international pop star with a Twitter following of over 100 million had written with the hashtag #FarmersProtest and a CNN report on the internet shutdown around Delhi. The foreign ministry statement was followed by actors Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn, producer-directors Karan Johar and Ekta Kapoor, singer Lata Mangeshkar and cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli posting tweets with the hashtags IndiaTogether and IndiaAgainstPropaganda that the MEA spokesperson had used in the statement. Several members of the Modi government also joined in the counter-attack. “No propaganda can deter India’s unity. No propaganda can stop India to attain new heights (sic). Propaganda can’t decide India’s fate, only progress can. India stands united and together to achieve progress,” tweeted Union home minister Amit Shah. No propaganda can deter India’s unity!No propaganda can stop India to attain new heights!Propaganda can not dec… https://t.co/tUTWc68ZCs— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) 1612359767000FM Nirmala Sitharaman and a number of others, such as Hardeep Puri, tweeted parts of the MEA statement. Junior home minister G Kishan Reddy was more blunt. “We will not be cowed down by an international gang of anarchy lovers.” Defending the new laws and underlining the government’s efforts to find a solution, the MEA, in its statement, said: “The Parliament of India, after a full debate and discussion, passed reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector... A very small section of farmers in parts of India have some reservations about these reforms. Respecting the sentiments of the protesters, the government of India has initiated a series of talks with their representatives. The government has even offered to keep the laws on hold, an offer iterated by no less than the PM of India. “Yet, it is unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them. This was egregiously witnessed on January 26, India’s Republic Day. A cherished national commemoration, the anniversary of the inauguration of the Constitution of India, was besmirched, and violence and vandalism took place in the Indian capital. Some of these vested interest groups have also tried to mobilise international support against India. Instigated by such fringe elements, Mahatma Gandhi statues have been desecrated in parts of the world. This is extremely disturbing for India and for civilised society everywhere.” The statement concluded by saying: “Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken.” Watch Farmers protest: MEA slams ‘vested interests,’ says ascertain facts before commenting||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-protest-mea-slams-vested-interests-social-media-turns-battle-zone/articleshow/80678310.cms||---
February 4, 2021||India||Remove inflammatory content or be ready for jail, penalty: Govt to Twitter||NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday warned Twitter to either follow its orders regarding removal of "inflammatory content" on farmers' protests, or be ready to face jail and financial penalty. The action, under the IT Act Section 69A (3), could result in up to seven years jail for senior Twitter India officials, and a financial penalty on the firm. The government issued the ultimatum after Twitter refused to comply with its request to block 257 accounts that had used the hashtag #ModiPlanningFarmerGenocide. The company had initially "withheld" the accounts, but later unblocked them, citing "free speech" and "newsworthy" content. The accounts which had allegedly used the 'inflammatory’ hashtag included Kisan Ekta Morcha (@Kisanektamorcha), BKU Ekta Ugrahan (@Bkuektaugrahan), Caravan magazine (@thecaravanindia), CPM leader Mohammad Salim (@salimdotcomrade) and activist Hansraj Meena (@HansrajMeena). An angry IT ministry, headed by Ravi Shankar Prasad, hit back on Wednesday, warning the company to comply with its instructions — which, it said, had been given keeping public order in mind and in order to diffuse tension and hatred. “Twitter is an intermediary and they are obliged to obey directions of the government. Refusal to do so will invite penal action,” the IT ministry said in a notice sent to the company, according to sources. It added that “motivated campaigns” and the hashtag were being run to “abuse, inflame and create tension in society on unsubstantiated grounds”. “Incitement to genocide is not freedom of speech; It is threat to law and order. Delhi had witnessed violence on Republic Day,” the notice said, while reiterating its request to block the accounts. “Twitter cannot sit as an appellate authority over the satisfaction of the authorities about its potential impact on derailing public order. It cannot assume the role of court and justify non-compliance,” the notice said. It also quoted more than half a dozen Supreme Court judgments, “including of Constitutional benches” on what constitutes public order and the rights of authorities. When contacted over phone, a spokesperson for Twitter refused to comment on the matter. The government had originally requested the company to block 257 URLs and the disputed hashtag on January 31 under Section 69A of the IT Act, saying they were “spreading misinformation about protests and has the potential to lead to imminent violence affecting public order situation in the country”. The notice further said that Twitter only blocked these accounts on the subsequent day (February 1, 2021) for a few minutes before it allowed them back on the grounds of freedom of speech as their advocate made a case before a government committee at 3pm. “It is thus clear that the offending tweets/hashtag remained in public domain and must have been tweeted and re-tweeted several times at the risk and cost of public order and at the risk of incitement to the commission of offences,” the notice said, adding that it is in receipt of the company’s reply where it has “declined to abide and obey” the order. The notice said that Section 69A of the IT Act provides jurisdiction to the government to direct an intermediary to block public access to any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or hosted in any computer resource if the same is necessary or expedient in order to prevent incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to public order. “It may be noted that as per the relevant provisions of Indian law, the intermediary is bound to comply with the order of the designated officer authorised by the Centre, and in case of non-compliance, statutory consequences shall follow,” it said. With regard to Twitter citing right to freedom of speech, the notice said the company has “no constitutional, statutory or any legal basis whatsoever to comment upon the interplay of statutory provisions with constitutional principles or to unilaterally read down the scope of statutory provisions as per its own understanding of the constitutional and statutory laws of India”.

Taking cognisance of the Enforcement Directorate's chargesheet against the trio, the court said the material produced by the investigating agency constitutes offences under PMLA. "I am of the opinion that this material is sufficient to proceed against the accused persons," the court said. It also said ED was granted leave to continue with the investigation and take action as per the law. While Deepak Kochhar is in custody, Chanda Kochhar and Dhoot will have to appear before the court on February 12. Chanda Kochhar took charge of ICICI Bank as its managing director and CEO in May 2009, after which she allegedly illegally sanctioned loans to Videocon companies. The loans of Rs 1,875 crore to the companies allegedly turned into non-performing assets (NPA) in 2017 and caused losses to the bank. It is alleged in lieu of the loans, Chanda Kochhar received Rs 64 crore kickbacks through her husband's company Nupower Renewables from Videocon. "The flat situated at CCI, Mumbai, was purchased by the family trust of Chanda Kochhar from proceeds of the crime for a minuscule sum of Rs 11 lakh, when its actual price was around Rs 5 crore," ED alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chanda-kochhar-looks-to-have-misused-post-court/articleshow/80678737.cms||Rebecca Samervel
February 4, 2021||India||A tightrope walk for India as military takes over Myanmar||NEW DELHI: Days after Myanmar reverted to military rule following a coup, India pushed back against the West's attempts to resort to tough measures against the country in closed-door discussions in the UN Security Council. No press statement has been issued on the discussions, sources said, largely because China and Russia discouraged the move. Read AlsoChins in Mizoram fear exodus of kin from restive MyanmarThe people of Chin community living in Mizoram are fearing an exodus of their kin from neighbouring Myanmar where the military has seized power in a coup against the democratically elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Mizoram, which shares a 404km porous border with the restiveIndia finds itself in a familiar predicament regarding Myanmar - while supporting democracy, how does it pursue strong security and developmental interests after the latest military coup. Even though there has been no communication between New Delhi and the ruling Tatmadaw (Mynamar military) since the coup on Monday, India plans to continue its development activities particularly in the sensitive Rakhine state, where it is building the Sittwe port and homes for the Rohingya. Read AlsoMilitary coup: Indians living in Myanmar safe but waryIn the early hours of February 1, a day that was supposed to be the first day of a new session of Parliament in Myanmar, its military, also known as the Tatmadaw, staged a coup d’etat threatening the country's democratic transition. TOI spoke to Indians working in Myanmar who said people are in aThe US has already called it a "coup" leaving the door open for potentially more sanctions. Going by the experience of the past decades, it has become clear that sanctions don't actually work, particularly in already introverted societies like Myanmar. But sanctions might push Myanmar closer to the Chinese. It is believed that one of the reasons for the military to open up to democracy in 2010-2011 was to reduce their dependence on China. China and Russia have taken a non-committal approach to the coup while ASEAN made a muted call for "dialogue, reconciliation and return to normalcy". Japan called it a "coup" but Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato talked of continuing with economic assistance and said, "We will consider our response while we keep watching the situation." The western countries, including Australia and the US have issued strong statements with threats of sanctions. India wants to remain engaged in Myanmar for quite a few reasons. Many insurgent groups find haven in Myanmar which means India needs its help to counter them. Similarly, India can make common cause with the military to counter the fact that China supports the Arakan Army which has targeted the Indian Kaladan project, including briefly kidnapping some personnel. Most important India wants Myanmar to counter the biggest security threat - Chinese support with arms to the Wa army, which undermines its (Myanmar) forces, as well as help arm other insurgent groups in Myanmar and India. Historian Thant Myint U, summing up the issue, tweeted, "The Myanmar generals have always been motivated by power not wealth. ... Their creed is nationalism and their dream is to end the country's 75-year old civil war on their terms. Any effective international approach will also need to understand the unique psychology of Myanmar's political elites, shaped by decades of violence, isolation, poverty, and oppression as well as the deeply conservative and hierarchical nature of its mainly Buddhist society." For India, engagement with Myanmar is vital. It was not for nothing that foreign secretary Harsh Shringla travelled to NayPyiDaw together with army chief Gen MM Naravane in October. New Delhi recognised the importance of maintaining a two-track engagement, acknowledging the primacy of the army in Myanmar's affairs. In fact, close observers of Myanmar in India were not overly surprised at the coup. After the November elections, many detected a sense of unease among the military, an apprehension that Aung San Suu Kyi-led civilian leadership might diminish their role. Bilahari Kausikan, former permanent secretary of Singapore's foreign ministry, said, "As developments in Myanmar play out, it would be prudent for the US and ASEAN not to forget that no external party has much influence in Myanmar and that Myanmar's future lies in its hands."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-tightrope-walk-for-india-as-military-takes-over-myanmar/articleshow/80678790.cms||Indrani Bagchi
February 4, 2021||India||Mahapanchayats' message: 1 from each family for stir||ROORKEE/MATHURA: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) functionaries, who addressed thousands at the two mahapanchayats in Mathura and Roorkee on Wednesday, asked each farmer family to send one member to the protest sites in and around Delhi. Giving out this call, the functionaries at the mahapanchayat in Mathura claimed that about 5,000 people from Mathura alone are likely to reach the Ghazipur border in the next two days. Echoing the same sentiment and terming the laws brought by the Union government "death warrants" for farmers of the country, BKU chief Naresh Tikait said in Roorkee that people will not sit at home till the laws are repealed. "Till the farm laws are not repealed, we will not withdraw from our protest. We are going among farmers day after day asking them to join the agitation. We will continue to protest in a peaceful manner. And even if the government resorts to firing, we will respond to them without violence," Tikait told the gathering at Gud Mandi, about 9km from Roorkee city. About 300km away in Mathura, his son and BKU's youth wing president Guarav Tikait addressed an even bigger crowd and said, "Bill wapasi nahi to ghar vapasi nahi (No one will go back home till the farm laws are repealed)." Meanwhile, BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, who got a rousing welcome at the mahapanchayat held in Kandela village in Haryana's Jind district on Wednesday, vowed to stand by the farmers till their demand for repeal of the three agriculture laws is accepted. "Farmers are demanding only repealing of the three laws but if they are not heard, they may even ask for the throne of Delhi. The government should think of taking farmers' demand seriously," said Tikait. Representatives of more than 50 khaps from Haryana attended the gathering. The mahapanchayat passed six resolutions on repeal of the three laws, making a law to ensure minimum support price for all agricultural produce, waiving of farmer loans, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations and withdrawal of criminal cases registered against farmers in Delhi on January 26.

February 4, 2021||India||Farm Laws: Oppn fights for repeal, govt repels attack||NEW DELHI: Opposition parties on Wednesday asked the government to withdraw the three contentious farm laws even as BJP members in Rajya Sabha said the legislations were passed after "extensive deliberations" and would benefit the farmers and agriculture sector. Moving the motion on vote of thanks to the President's address in the Upper House, BJP MP from Assam Bhubaneswar Kalita accused the opposition of raising the farm laws issue to disrupt House proceedings. He said while the laws were passed after extensive debate and deliberations in both Houses, more than 10 crore people benefited from them. He said the Centre is in touch with farmers' unions to address their concerns. BJP MP from UP Vijay Pal Singh Tomar said, "It has been said there was no consultation before the laws were enacted. There have been 12 expert committees in the past two decades on the farm reform laws." He underlined that the new laws will help small farmers and the agriculture sector. He also said the NDA government has given more budgetary outlay for agriculture in one year than five years of UPA government. Participating in the discussion, leader of opposition in RS and Congress member Ghulam Nabi Azad suggested that PM Modi himself make the announcement on repeal of the laws. The PM was present in the House at the time. Azad also condemned the violence during the tractor rally in the Capital on the R-Day and the Red Fort incident, saying disrespect to the national flag cannot be tolerated. "I urge the government to withdraw these three bills," he said. The senior Congress member cited several examples, including one during his own party's rule in 1988, of the government giving in to the demands of farmers. Azad also made a case for restoration of statehood to J&K and holding of assembly polls, saying that people of the area were not happy and development work had come to a halt. He said the PM is the only person who can find a solution to both the problems - J&K and the farmers' agitation. Earlier, after the government and opposition members reached a consensus on discussing the farmers' issue during the debate on the motion of thanks, chairman Venkaiah Naidu asked three AAP MPs to withdraw from the House amid sloganeering over the farm laws. Demanding withdrawal of the sedition cases filed against party colleague Shashi Tharoor and some journalists, Azad said, "Shashi Tharoor was junior minister for external affairs. He has represented the country outside. How can he be an anti-national... then we all are anti-nationals." SP's Ram Gopal Yadav suggested that the three laws be withdrawn and fresh bills be sent to the standing committee for a proper discussion. DMK's Tiruchi Siva raised objection to the manner in which the bills were passed in RS, saying there was no order in the House at the time. This was countered by Venkaiah Naidu who asked him not to dig up matters that were over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farm-laws-oppn-fights-for-repeal-govt-repels-attack/articleshow/80678976.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Hybrid classes to be on till all students return to campus||Kolkata: Schools will continue to hold online classes for students of classes IX to XII along, with on-campus classes, that are slated to begin on February 12. Principals said they would offer the hybrid mode of teaching to ensure students, who did not attend physical classes, did not miss out on lessons. “We are ready for offline classes. But online classes will not be suspended till all students return to school. It will be a challenge to teachers but we have to bear with it as unwilling parents cannot be forced to send their wards to school,” said an institute head. For teachers, it means at least twice the workload. In addition to online classes, they will have to hold offline classes. If the number of students that attend school shoots up, they may have to split them up into two classes to ensure social distancing norms. “We are glad high school students can now return to classrooms. But for us, it will mean a fresh challenge, taking the same class twice or even thrice,” said a physics teacher at a missionary school. At schools with playgrounds, authorities are evaluating the possibility of holding classes in the open to accommodate all students at a go without flouting distancing norms. An SOP issued by the home ministry said outdoor classes could be held. Most schools have decided to limit the number of students to 15-20 per class. For classes with three sections, the number could rise to six or seven. That is not a problem now as classrooms used by students up to Class VIII are currently unused. But once all students returned, physical infrastructure constraints would prove a challenge, said a source. According to the central SOP, students should sit 6ft from each otherand “one-child-one-bench norm” was suggested. The state is set to issue a revised school SOP on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hybrid-classes-to-be-on-till-all-students-return-to-campus/articleshow/80675555.cms||Somdatta Basu
February 4, 2021||Patna||Nothing new in police verification order: ADG||PATNA: The state police headquarters on Wednesday said there is nothing new in DGP SK Singhal’s order on police verification character report for those seeking government contracts issued on January 30. The DGP’s order has been issued along with the letter of additional chief secretary (home) Amir Subhani as annexure issued on January 25. Subhani’s letter was addressed to DGP, all department heads, commissioners and DMs directing all to strictly follow the requirement of a character certificate of those seeking any government contract. In the letter issued in the backdrop of Subhani’s order, the DGP has mentioned nine different matters for which police verification report on the character is required. The matter of getting government contract has been placed on top. The DGP’s order reads: “If any person, after being part of law and order situation, protests, road blockades, etc, is found to be involved in any criminal activity and is charge-sheeted in the case then related information must be entered into character verification report. Such persons would have to be ready for serious consequences because they won’t be able to get a government job or contract.” ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar told TOI that all points mentioned in the order are already in practice as per rules. “Only instructions have been reiterated for properly following it and providing report within stipulated timeframe as per law. There is nothing new in the letter,” he said. ADG Kumar said police are only for providing information to the employer via the verification report and it is up to them what they intend to do with it. “If there is any information present against anyone in the files of a police station concerned, then it would be entered into the verification report of character,” he said, adding, the order nowhere is tampering with anyone’s rights to protest. Several IPS officers said this practice is old and if anyone is charge-sheeted in any law and order or protest case after getting booked in FIR, then its entry is made in police verification report as per requirement. DGP’s order also mentions if any person has been a named accused or non-FIR accused in any cognizable offence but has not been charge-sheeted after investigation, then no comments would be made against that person in the verification report. The order also reads that no comments would be made also against persons even if declared suspicious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nothing-new-in-police-verification-order-adg/articleshow/80675502.cms||---

Their agents visit villages, talk to unemployed people and lure them into paying huge sums of money. Some also work from home using laptops and cellphones. “We have information that fake agents have duped people on the pretext of providing them jobs in Gulf countries, Russia, Singapore, Malaysia, Europe and Africa,” Tavisi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/poe-50-fake-job-agencies-active-in-patna/articleshow/80674327.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Patna||‘4,000 CDRs analysed, 70 suspects quizzed in Rupesh murder case’||PATNA: The police on Wednesday claimed to have analysed the call detail records of around 4,000 suspects, scanned over 600 gigabytes of footage of hundreds of CCTV cameras and quizzed more than 70 people in the last 22 days to crack the sensational murder case of IndiGo’s station manager Rupesh Kumar Singh. The figures did not take into account the efforts made by the special task force (STF) and CID in cracking the case. One Rituraj has been arrested for killing Rupesh in his car outside his apartment at Punaichak on January 12 evening. A senior IPS officer said CM Nitish Kumar was periodically taking updates on the investigation from DGP SK Singhal and SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma. SSP Sharma said police first tracked the suspected killer then detained him for quizzing after which he confessed to his crime. “It was only then that police came to know about the motive behind murder. Police also quizzed his family members, who confirmed that Rituraj had a tiff with Rupesh on the road near the airport in November and he killed the IndiGo official to take revenge,” he said. The SSP said circumstantial evidences and Rituraj’s confession confirmed that he had shot Rupesh dead. He said police first tried to trace the killers by tracking the possible escape routes from the spot. “However, after going blind at Saguna Mor, where there was no more CCTV camera coverage of the road, police started tracking their movement in reverse by tracking the CCTV camera footages of the route taken to reach the spot,” Sharma said. He said it took several hours of scanning hundreds of CCTV camera footages of the roads and bylanes used by the four criminals, including shooter Rituraj, to commit the crime. “While tracking the originating point of the suspects, police traced Rituraj and his three associates’ movement from his residence at Adarsh Colony. The footages of period before the crime showed him moving to Alka Colony near Kumhrar,” he said. Sharma said he was spotted there moving on one of his friends’ bike. “Details of cellphone number mentioned in the bike’s registration finally got the police to Rituraj’s phone number as he had made a few calls to that friend in the past,” Sharma said. He said from there police came to know that Rituraj had switched off his cellphone hours before the murder and had fled Ranchi a day thereafter. “These were enough circumstantial evidences to arrest him from his residence on Tuesday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4k-cdrs-analysed-70-suspects-quizzed-in-rupesh-murder-case/articleshow/80674933.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Patna||Farmer bodies in Bihar to block roads for one hour on Saturday||PATNA: The farmer associations in Bihar will hold ‘chakka jam’ on February 6 for one hour only, from 2pm to 3pm, in place of three hours nationwide call for the same made by Samkyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM). The SKM is an umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi borders and elsewhere in the country against the controversial farm laws. The farmer unions protesting at Singhu border of Delhi has announced countrywide ‘chakka jam’ from 12pm to 3pm on February 6. Bihar Rajya Kisan Sabha, an umbrella body of 23 farmer associations in the state, however, resolved to block the roads for only one hour in order to avoid any hassles to students appearing in the ongoing intermediate exams being conducted by Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB). “The first session of the intermediate exams conclude at 12:30pm and the second seating starts at 1:30pm. Thus, considering the greater interest of the students, the farmer associations in Bihar have decided to block roads from 2pm to 3pm only,” Bihar Rajya Kisan Sabha (BRKS) general secretary Ashok Kumar Singh told TOI on Wednesday. Singh said members of different farmer associations will start coming on the roads from 1pm. “But students and emergency services will be exempted from the blockade. Apart from national and state highways, major roads in several districts will also be blocked,” he said, adding that elected representatives have been appealed to support the blockade. The farmer wings of Left parties will also participate in the blockade in Bihar. CPI(ML)’s state secretary Kunal said the farmer wing members of the party will block the roads in different districts on the call given by All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee. “The condition of farmers in Bihar is worse than their counterparts in Punjab and Haryana. This is why farmers from Bihar go to Punjab and Haryana to work as agriculture labourers. Accordingly, our party has demanded revival of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act in Bihar and ensure minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers for their farm yield,” Kunal said. He added: “The Nitish Kumar government had abolished APMC Act in 2006, which led to the winding up of the Bazaar Samitis. This, in turn, has worsened the conditions of farmers in Bihar and the Centre is now trying to do the same across the country.” BRKS’s Singh also said 90% of the peasants in Bihar are marginal farmers with less than five hectares of land. “The districts in Kosi and Seemanchal areas contribute around 30% to the total yield of maize in the country. However, farmers engaged in maize cultivation in this region suffer losses to the tune of around Rs1300 crore per year owing to inability to sell their yields at MSP,” he said. Meanwhile, ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said necessary measures and preventive steps will be taken to ensure that law and order is maintained during the Chakka Jam on February 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/farmer-bodies-to-join-feb-6-protest-for-one-hour/articleshow/80675096.cms||Piyush Tripathi
February 4, 2021||Amaravati||AP govt to sign MoU with Sulabh International for upkeep of school toilets||AMARAVATI: The state government has decided to rope in Sulabh International for the upkeep of toilets in government schools. The government will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sulabh International shortly. The school education department has decided to take the support of Sulabh international which will engage 49,000 people for the upkeep of school toilets in the state. During a review with the school education department on Wednesday, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy said there should not be any let off in keeping toilets in schools clean. He asked the officials to ready a standard operating procedure (SOP) before handing over the upkeep of toilets to Sulabh International. The government will also launch a mobile application to mark attendance of children in schools. The chief minister said the application should be developed in such a way that it should send alert messages to parents about absentee children while taking attendance. The chief minister asked officials to create awareness among parents about alert messages and encourage them to send children to schools in case their wards were found abstaining without their knowledge. The chief minister said the local village volunteer should visit the residence of the children if they were absent a second day, enquire about their health and bring them back to the school if they were found to be doing well. “Bringing children back to school is very important to reduce the dropout rate. We want all children of school-going age to be in school,” said the chief minister. Education minister Dr Adimulapu Suresh, senior officials B Rajasekhar, V China Veera Bhadrudu and Vetri Selvi were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-to-sign-mou-with-sulabh-intl-for-upkeep-of-school-toilets/articleshow/80674421.cms||Samdani MN
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Pre-boards to go offline at some Kolkata institutes||KOLKATA: Several city schools that are set to resume classes IX-XII on campus have drawn up plans to hold the pre-boards offline. Even those who had kept the practical examinations suspended after completing the theory papers will be holding the remaining assessment tests. The Cambridge Assessment International Education will be the first school board to conduct pen-and-paper examinations in Bengal this year. Fr Rodney Borneo, principal of Loyola High School, said, “We shall conduct the pre-board examinations on paper. This is a rehearsal examination. The students should get a feel of taking the real board exams, which is not possible online.” He added that the students of classes IX and XI will also be back on campus and take the annual examinations offline. Principal of another city school said that though the pre-boards have been conducted in January, the practical examination section had to be kept suspended as laboratories are closed. “Though we have imparted tutorials about conducting experiments online and shared videos with the board candidates, it is not possible to conduct the practicals on a virtual medium. Students require hands-on experience to observe the experiments and then conduct the same in laboratories. So, we plan to hold a few practical classes and then assess the students,” the principal said, adding that the science stream students are at a loss since the Class XII students were not able to attend a single practical class. A few schools have also decided to adjust their timetable for the pre-board examinations to allow students some time to adjust in the physical classes. “We will conduct the pre-board examinations from February 18. We delayed the exams by a week after the state’s decision to reopen the campuses from February 12,” said Sujoy Biswas, principal of Ram Mohan Mission School. Some schools will also hold the IGCSE for Class X students from February 8 as a pen-and-paper test. “We have a handful of candidates appearing in the examinations. We expect the state to permit the examination to continue,” said a principal. Fr Bikash Mondal, principal of Don Bosco School Park Circus, has decided to resend the consent forms to guardians seeking permission for their wards to attend classes. “Teachers will evaluate the answer scripts of the pre-board examinations with students to help them with guidelines of board exams. We also plan to give time to Class XII students to practice in laboratories,” he said. Sources indicated that the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations will announce the schedule for ICSE and ISC exams after the election dates are finalized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pre-boards-to-go-offline-at-some-city-institutes/articleshow/80675540.cms||Somdatta Basu
February 4, 2021||Business||Increasing e-pays drown core banking solutions||MUMBAI: The high frequency of digital payment transactions is forcing banks worldwide to go for a ‘lite’ version of core banking solution (CBS) by decoupling other functionalities from the main application. According to Accenture, this trend is expected to pick up in India with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and other digital pay channels increasing the frequency of transactions manifold. Sonali Kulkarni, lead (financial services) at Accenture in India, told TOI that ever since banks went in for a CBS that enabled anywhere, anytime banking, the trend was to add more and more functionality to the core application. However, the neobanks, or the digital banks, have managed to become more agile by opting for a cloud-based ‘de-coupled’ CBS. In markets like Australia, mainstream banks are going for a cloud-based lighter version of CBS such as ones provided by Thought Machine and Mambu, said Kulkarni. “Innovations have largely happened at the front-end. However, a seamless way of talking to the core banking is not in place,” said Kulkarni. As a result, every time there is a balance enquiry from any channel, it pings the bank’s CBS, putting pressure on the system. Incidentally, several large banks have faced downtime on their digital platforms as adoption of electronic payments went through the roof in recent months. “If you look at modern IT architecture, core banking should be only a system of records. All insights, analytics and business tools need to be taken out of CBS. That is called hollowing out the core,” she said. According to Kulkarni, banks need to build separate pools of data, or ‘data lakes’, for applications to tap into without putting pressure on the CBS. In the present setup, banks will end up facing a problem as they scale the front end. That’s because the back end was not designed for a high level of digital banking and will come under pressure as it cannot be scaled up. One reason banks are going slow is that replacing legacy systems is going to cost them millions of dollars and the technology they considered an asset will have to be written off as technical debt. However, banks do not have a choice. “Bigger banks cannot slow down customer adoption. Customers can still join Google Pay and PhonePe. While banking as a service is getting consumed, the end consumer may not even know there is a bank processing the payments. In some spaces, ‘invisible bank’ has already happened,” said Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/increasing-e-pays-drown-core-banking-solutions/articleshow/80677131.cms||Mayur Shetty
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Scholarship scam: Scrutiny increased||THANE: The district education department has now stepped up vigil among its staff to sift fake beneficiaries off the national scholarship portal after identities of hundreds of fictitious student from the minority community were found registered on the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) database last week. The wary department not only verifies identity of students by calling up the respective schools but also seeks undertaking from them about the numbers referred for the scholarships in a bid to safeguard the funds from being misused. “We are calling schools to ascertain the students’ identity and also asking them to send an undertaking about the same to avoid any fake names being sent for scholarships. We have also asked officials across talukas to keep strict vigil while approving the names,” said Chhaya Paradke, extension officer at the Thane zilla parishad. As many as 1,600 fictitious names including some from private, TMC and even zilla parishad schools were found registered last week on the UDISE portal based on which scholarships to the tune of Rs 1,000-10,000 per student from the minority communities are allotted and disbursed. Officials said the irregularity was spotted in few city schools but feared to be spread across the state or nation and be worth multiple crores of rupees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/scholarship-scam-scrutiny-increased/articleshow/80678312.cms||Manoj Badgeri
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Will numbers be enough? Logistics worry for carpool and bus owners in Kolkata||KOLKATA: With higher classes at city schools likely to resume after an 11-month-gap from February 12, owners of school buses and pooled cars are in two minds about providing transport facilities. Though all of them agreed it will be a positive change after the difficulty in surviving the past few months with zero income, many insisted there needed to be some out-of-the-box solutions to avoid further damage to the business model. Uncertainty about breaking even with only a fraction of students likely to return to campus, pending road and permit taxes, investments required to make the vehicles roadworthy again, loss of qualified and trained drivers who have taken up alternative professions, the significant number of vehicles now doing office duty, the surge in diesel prices and the social distancing norms are all weighing heavily on owners of over 1,500 pooled cars in Kolkata and its adjoining district and about 1,000 school buses across the state. Bus owners say that after being forced to stay off the road for 11 months, at least 60% of the vehicles no longer have papers in place. “But with zero income and with so few students, we have to find some quick practical solutions. Whether we make a trip with 10 students or 30, the cost will remain the same,” said Himadri Ganguly, general secretary of West Bengal Contract Carriage and Operators’ Association. For pooled car owners, getting trained drivers back is a challenge. “Unlike buses, our contracts are with guardians. The schools, too, will not be following a uniform policy. Some might ask students to come to school on alternate days, some might ask them to come every day and others might only concentrate on practical classes. We have to study the ground situation. We are waiting for schools to tell us their plans,” said Arupam Dutta of Poolcar Owners’ Welfare Association. Both associations held meetings on Wednesday and are likely to continue in the next two days. “Some of the ideas include merging routes and weekly rosters,” said Ganguly. “We need to know how many will be availing of our services before we begin to work on the logistics,” said Dutta. “Students’ health may need to be monitored before they step into the vehicles and PPE must be available when students don’t wear their own,” said an operator whose buses are contracted by a leading Behala school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/will-numbers-be-enough-logistics-worry-for-carpool-and-bus-owners/articleshow/80675505.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Campus return: Parents in Kolkata anxious but keen||KOLKATA: Parents of Class X students at Ashoke Hall were called by the school administration on Wednesday to clear their doubts about campus re-opening. Similar sessions were held in other schools last week and many are due to happen so that parents’ anxieties are dealt with properly. While most parents are reportedly keen on sending their children back to campus, they are at the same time, anxious about the kids’ safety and are eager to find out the steps taken by schools. All CNI schools have been given a written instruction by Bishop Paritosh Canning that they must sanitize the premises and send him details by February 9 before he gives the nod for reopening. TimesViewColleges and universities would be doing their best to conform to all Covid norms. Students, too, should cooperate and follow every guideline. The gradual decrease of cases has given us an opportunity. Let us make the best of it.Parents of Class XII students at Vivekananda Mission School, Joka, have met the principal to see the arrangements. “They are happy with what they saw. I will meet parents of Class X students next. I am trying to quell all fears,” said principal Sharmishtha Banerjee. Loreto House was also going to meet parents of students of classes X and XII on Saturday, said principal Aruna Gomes. Head of Ram Mohan Mission School Sujoy Biswas is also meeting parents in batches. “It is not just about taking consent mechanically. It is a relationship that we have forged with the parents,” Biswas said. Ashwini Mishra, parent of a Class X student at Ashoke Hall, said he was feeling nervous. “Yes, she is a board-year student but I am still not convinced about how safe the situation is. I might take some time to decide,” he said. Despite their anxiety, some parents, however, said that for board-year children, lab work was important and they would send their wards to school. “Doubt-clearing sessions and writing pen-and-paper pre-board exams that my son’s school is arranging after the re-opening are important. So I will send my son,” said Sudeshna Mitra, parent of a Class X student at La Martiniere for Boys. Chandan Dey, who runs a coaching institute near Narendrapur and whose son is in Class X at Lions Vidyamamdir, said he had been debating whether to send his son to school or not, especially because his pre-boards were over and the school would hold doubts-clearing sessions. “There are still a few days left. I will see the school SOP before sending him,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campus-return-parents-anxious-but-keen/articleshow/80675574.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
February 4, 2021||Patna||Bihar artists, writers back farmers’ stir but condemn violence||PATNA: After international pop icon Rihanna and Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg tweeted in support of the farmers’ protests in Delhi, prominent personalities from the field of art, music and literature have also extended their support to the ‘people who feed us’. But they also cautioned against protests turning violent as happened on Republic Day. Popular folk-singer and Padma Bhushan awardee Sharda Sinha said it’s within the rights of the farmers to protest and raise demands for their betterment. “The farmers’ agitation is well understood and justified. Initially, they had the entire nation supporting them, but the Republic day violence has raised serious questions regarding their conduct and demands,” she said. Shyam Sunder Sharma, a noted artist and former principal of College of Arts and Crafts, Patna, also said he stands with the farmers and supports their demand for “protection against the corporate players”. “However, I also condemn their course of action, which started as a peaceful protest but now has gone against the Gandhian principles of justice,” he said. Artists have questioned why only a handful of states are involved in the movement. Rajesh Kumar, an eminent actor hailing from the state said, “One should not overlook the fact that the protests are not happening across India. It’s mostly centred around two to three states. This raises questions as to why farmers in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and other states are not that worried regarding the new farm laws when we know that most Indian states practice farming.” He added, “Also, before supporting or opposing any matter, a detailed awareness about the law is required. Rather than forming an opinion or blindly following an agenda, people should properly study and then comment.” The 2019 Padma Shree recipient for Hindi folk literature, Shanti Jain said, “India has always been the land of peace and prosperity. As one of the largest democracy of the world, we are entitled and well within our rights to ask for change. However, when political agenda mixes with the plea of common people, it takes a dramatic discourse which is what we are experiencing right now in our country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-artists-writers-back-farmers-stir-but-condemn-violence/articleshow/80675135.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Patna||Katihar administration evicts vendors from roadside||KORHA (KATIHAR): The makeshift shops, fruit vendors and fish markets on both sides of the service road along the National Highway-31 were removed on Wednesday as part of the anti-encroachment drive at Gerabari Chowk under Korha block of the district, giving much-needed relief to hapless constables manning the traffic intersection there. The traffic at the crossover point will now be smooth because small vehicles will take the route of service roads. It will also prevent accidents and solve the perennial problem of traffic snarls on this stretch of the NH-31. Katihar SP Vikas Kumar said the anti-encroachment drive was being carried out to streamline vehicular traffic on the particular stretch of the highway. “It will also check accidents to some extent,” he said. A senior police officer and some residents, on the condition of anonymity, said at least four spots — near a petrol pump on NH-31, the entry and exit points of one of the service roads and the Katihar-Gerabari-Falka road intersection — are the ‘black spots’ from where the maximum number of trauma cases were reported to Korha community health centre. As per the Katihar administration data of accidents near Gerabari Chowk, one person was killed in 2017, four in 2018 and two persons lost their lives in 2019. At Kurshela Chowk, one person died in a road accident in 2017, three in 2018 and two persons lost their lives in 2019. Similarly, four persons were killed in 2017, one in 2018 and three in 2019 in toad accidents at Kurshela near Devipur on NH-31. Home guard constable Md Zafar Khan, who was regulating traffic at Gerabari crossover point, said, “Removal of shops and vendors from both sides of the service road will help in regulating traffic as well as checking accidents. The situation has improved today.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/katihar-administration-evicts-vendors-from-roadside/articleshow/80674139.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Patna||63% plots in Gaya district have irrigation facility||GAYA: A technical survey is being conducted in the revenue villages across the district to ascertain whether the land used for farming have irrigation facility or not. Water resources, agriculture, rural development and energy departments have been engaged in the survey work. The survey will also identify the functional and non-functional state tube wells. District magistrate Abhishek Singh has directed the officials concerned to complete the survey for ‘Har khet tak sinchai ka paani (irrigation water to each farmland) scheme under the Saat Nishchay part-II in the next three months. He directed the officials to incorporate the opinion and suggestions of farmers in the survey and make use of the app for this work. “After the survey is complete, possibilities would be explored to ensure irrigation water to each plot,” the DM said in a meeting to review the progress of the scheme in the district on Monday. District agriculture officer (DAO) Sudama Mahto said in the meeting that in the first phase, 63.56℅ of the plots were found to have irrigation facility, while 36.46℅ were non-irrigated land. The executive engineer of irrigation division has been made the nodal officer of this scheme. Executive engineers of energy department and the minor irrigation department, DAO and the district panchayati raj officer would be assisting in the implementation of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/63-plots-in-gaya-district-have-irrigation-facility/articleshow/80674366.cms||---

The ODF+ tag means that an area sustains its open defecation free status, ensures solid and liquid waste management and is visually clean. “Our objective is to uphold the tag and ensure that citizens do not make public places dirty,” the BMC commissioner said and added that the order would be strictly enforced in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pay-rs-50-for-defecating-urinating-in-open-bmc/articleshow/80674149.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||West Bengal universities to stay shut as hostels may turn disease hotbed||KOLKATA: Colleges and universities in Bengal will not reopen campuses for the ongoing semester. Physical classes might be held from the next semester. The decision was taken at a meeting of West Bengal Higher Education Council on Wednesday, attended by state university vice-chancellors. Education minister Partha Chatterjee said the government had accepted the decision. “We have asked universities to take into account the guardians’ concern. Online classes have been well adopted by students,” he said. The reason, higher education department officials pointed out, was that resuming on-campus classes would have necessitated reopening of hostels, which could have increased the risk of Covid transmission. Keeping campuses shut was still a safer option, they said. “Numerous students from districts, other states and even foreign countries study in our universities. If physical classes are held, how will they attend them? Without hostels, where will they stay here?” said a VC. Sources indicated the state did not want to take a risk ahead of the elections. Reopening of hostels will force universities to accommodate more than one student in a single room, which will increase the chances of Covid transmission “The government intends to complete the ongoing semester in the virtual mode. But it is likely the even-semester classes will be held physically for a few months before the final-semester exams are held in August. It will allow students to attend practical classes before they graduate,” said a VC, adding campuses were unlikely to open for physical classes before the elections. Universities have been asked to follow UGC guidelines and hold exams on time. “The odd-semester exams will be held in March. Calcutta University has announced its dates between March 8 and 26. Presidency University, too, will conduct it at the same time,” said a senior higher education official. Though CU has allowed PG departments to hold practical classes, sources said the government had instructed CU and all other state-run universities to stop any further academic activities on campus. “It was done without the state consent,” said the source. Only doctoral students and research scholars may be permitted to attend labs. At Jadavpur University, students’ unions were disappointed with the Wednesday decision. “It seems we won’t be given permission to open labs for PG students,” said a teacher. Students parties at JU, CU and Presidency have been pressuring the authorities to resume academic activities on campus. “Presidency has forwarded students’ demands to the state government. But reopening is a decision entirely lying with the higher education department,” said an official. In the meeting, a committee was formed for individual faculties to implement interface with the industry. “We also want to conduct a survey on the gross enrolment after massive expansion in the education sector, brought about after Mamata Banerjee came to power. It is important to assess the performance till now,” added Chatterjee. The academic and administrative audit of colleges is also on the anvil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/univs-to-stay-shut-as-hostels-may-turn-disease-hotbed/articleshow/80675605.cms||Somdatta Basu

The civic body says that in the first phase, 18 roads, having 11.41km length will be restructured and modernized. Civic body sources also added that plans are afoot under Smart City projects to build swanky pedestrian footpaths, landscaping, sewage and drainage system, underground water supply pipelines, utility ducts, night lighting, constructing vending zones, zebra crossings, cycling tracks, etc besides underpass for crossing the roads wherever there will be enough space. Re-engineering of the roads will also be done wherever required. The roads to be restructured and given smarter looks include Lajpat Park roads (635meters), Zila School road (440 meters), Naya Bazar-Kotwali chowk (500 meters), Shanker Talkies-Khalifabagh (830 meters), Kutchery Chowk – Manali Chowk (540 meters), Radha Rani Sinha Road (750 meters), Adampur chowk-Hotel Galaxy-Manali Chowk (1100 meters), Naya Bazar – Shanker Talkies – Adampur (1460 meters), Adampur–Manali Chowk–Tilkamanjhi Chowk (1600 meters), Manik Sarkar chowk – Ghanta Ghar chowk (600 meters), Kotwali Chowk – Khalifabagh Chowk – Ghanta Ghar Chowk (980 meters) and Ghata Ghar Chowk – Kutchery Chowk – Tilkamanjhi Chowk (1980 meters). BMC commissioner (incharge) Satyendra Verma said drawing and design besides bidding process for restructuring of roads is in the final stages. “Work for a model road will start at first as a pilot project, followed by work on 17 other roads. Coordination with the road construction department (RCD) and other departments concerned will be made for remodelling of the roads to allow hassle-free movement of traffic and pedestrians,” he said. Bhagalpur was selected under the ‘Smart Cities Mission’, a central government-sponsored scheme launched in June 2015, in the second list for smart cities in May 2016. The central government had proposed to spend Rs. 80,789 crore over five financial years (FY) starting from FY 2015-2016 with a plan outlay of Rs100 crore on an average per year for the city’s development and an equal amount (on a matching basis) to be contributed by the state. BMC deputy mayor Rajesh Verma said the cost for remodelling and restructuring city streets under the smart city project would entail an estimated outlay of Rs 300 crore. “The project tender has already been finalized and work is likely to start soon,” the deputy mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhagalpur-civic-body-to-build-smart-streets/articleshow/80674184.cms||Kumar Rajesh
February 4, 2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Covid fatalities surpass accident deaths in Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Deaths in the state from road accidents and other communicable diseases were less than Covid-19-related fatalities in 2020. The overall death rate also dropped by around 10% between 2019 and 2020, as per latest data from the civil registration system. The latest figures contain information on deaths from all parts of the state, except 153 gram panchayats where a new system is in place and for which data has not been compiled yet. Kerala recorded 2,37,407 deaths in 2020 compared with 2,63,983 the previous year – translating to a 26,576 drop. According to sources, even if data from the remaining panchayats is included, the figure will be significantly lower than in the previous year. In the case of communicable diseases, 2020 saw the lowest mortality of the past five years, at 90. This was down 61% from the previous year. Even road-accident deaths fell by 32%, and the figure of 2,979 was the lowest recorded in the past five years. Last year, Kerala reported 3,074 Covid-19 deaths. This was the first time that fatalities from an infectious disease outnumbered accident deaths in Kerala. The cumulative deaths from communicable diseases have always been lower than that of accident deaths. “Assuming that most of the deaths from 2020 are already registered, some of this reduction can still be a result of deaths averted by decreased economic activity, mobility and the overall lockdown resulting in reduced road traffic or industrial accidents, or even reduced number of deaths from infectious diseases. However, fact remains that Kerala historically had a very low proportion of deaths due to infectious diseases,” said health researcher Oommen C Kurian in a technical paper published by Observer Research Foundation. Also for the first time in five years, Kerala managed to bring down the fatality due to other communicable diseases below 100 in 2020. The most significant drop was noted in H1N1 deaths. In 2018 and 2019 Kerala recorded 50 and 45 HIN1 deaths, respectively, while in 2020 only two deaths were recorded due to H1N1. Medical practitioners attribute such a sharp dip in H1N1 mortality to widespread use of masks, which reduced chances of respiratory infection. Covid-19 remained the major and solo respiratory viral threat for Keralites in 2020, infectious disease specialists said. Commenting on the data, health minister K K Shailaja said interventions by health department and other departments with a focus on saving lives seem to have yielded results. Even districts with the highest number of Covid-19 deaths and which have recorded more than 300 deaths showed a dip in total number of deaths in 2020. In Thiruvananthapuram, which has had the highest Covid-19 mortality, death rate dropped by 11% while that of Ernakulam and Thrissur came down by 10%. “We will get the full picture only after data compilation from 153 local bodies as well which is being recorded in a new system,” said M Ramankutty, chief registrar, births and deaths, panchayat department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-fatalities-surpass-accident-deaths/articleshow/80675691.cms||Aswin J Kumar

On Monday, the Pune Manahagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) earned Rs1.04 crore, which was last seen before the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. On Tuesday, the daily revenue of the transport body touched Rs98 lakh. Officials are confident of further improvement, with schools reopening and the recently launched services doing an impressive job. “On February 1, nearly 7 lakh people travelled in 1,523 buses. Before the pandemic broke out, the PMPML would ferry close to 11 lakh people per day and the total daily revenue would be Rs3 crore or more. It is a landmark, considering that the pandemic hit the PMPML badly and bus services had resumed only six months ago,” a senior official with the traffic section of the PMPML said. “The services that started recently, especially the ATAL bus services, have done exceptionally well in attracting passengers. We are banking on the schools reopening and hope to see a 10% increase in ridership,” the official said. The transport body officials said that the Pune airport bus service was their only concern.  “The number of buses plying on the route have further decreased as the earnings are less. But, we hope things will change in the near future,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpmls-daily-revenue-touches-rs-1cr-mark-officials-confident-of-more-improvement/articleshow/80677305.cms||Joy Sengupta
February 4, 2021||Business||Zoho founder on National Security Advisory Board||Chennai: As governance and delivery of welfare services goes digital, India has tapped the private tech sector to add value to its national security initiatives. At a time when tech giants are under state scrutiny in the US for privacy and antitrust issues, India has appointed tech entrepreneur Sridhar Vembu — the founder and CEO of Chennai and US-based SaaS firm Zoho — to its National Security Advisory Board (NSAB).The NSAB is an advisory body part of the National Security Council and is headed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. “I want to thank Shri Ajit Doval-ji for appointing me to the National Security Advisory Board. I returned to India to serve the cause of technology led rural development and this advisory role affords me another opportunity to be of service to the nation,” Vembu said in a tweet on Wednesday. Responding to TOI queries, Vembu, who also ranks among the Padmashri awardees this year, declined to elaborate on his role due to confidentiality. He only said it will be advisory in nature, and he would provide inputs as and when required. Vembu, who was earlier based out of Silicon Valley, moved to a village near Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu before Covid struck to prove that learning hubs could be created beyond the metros. He has been busy the past year working out of his village by the mountains and has been setting up a research and development ecosystem in the hinterlands. Zoho, which offers a full productivity suite for enterprises and has over 50 million users for its 45+ business applications, has opened around 10 satellite offices in various small towns including Tenkasi, Surandai, Erode, Coimbatore and Palakkad in the past one year. Five more offices are in various stages of completion, Vembu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zoho-founder-on-national-security-advisory-board/articleshow/80677230.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Recipe for resumption: Isolation rooms, nurses and docs on call||Kolkata: Gearing up for the return of students, many schools are converting some of their sick rooms into isolation rooms or creating special spaces for them. If a student has a fever or shows signs of distress, s/he will be isolated in one of these rooms and checked by nurses clad in PPE and parents will be called to take the child home. These rooms are ready with roll-up sick beds, oxygen cylinders and pulse oxymeters to facilitate primary screening. While some schools have hired doctors to be on the campus throughout the day, others have tied up with neighbourhood clinics. Trained nurses have been hired to man the isolation rooms, apart from the nurses and ayahs in charge of sick rooms. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, Heritage School, the six St Augustine Day Schools and South Point High School are among those that have isolation rooms ready, while others, like Loreto House, are in the process of doing so. “We decided on this the moment talks about re-opening started last year,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. At the Heritage School, which also runs an international curriculum, isolation rooms have been readied for children who were abroad and have just come back. “They will be writing their IGCSE exams from these isolation rooms because they are in quarantine,” said principal Seema Sapru. The St Augustine Day schools have on-campus doctors and trained nurses in place along with isolation rooms, said Richard Gasper, who runs the group. Apart from isolation rooms, South Point School will install a thermal-scan camera to monitor temperature of students and teachers, said spokesperson Krishna Damani. “Covid isolation rooms are in the pipeline for us,” said Aruna Gomes, principal of Loreto House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/recipe-for-resumption-isolation-rooms-nurses-and-docs-on-call/articleshow/80675521.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

February 4, 2021||Patna||Phase II of Covid vax drive in Bihar from February 6||PATNA: The second round of Covid-19 vaccination involving frontline workers will start from February 6 in Bihar, and keeping this in mind, the deadline for the ongoing drive for healthcare workers has been rescheduled to February 5 from February 10. The department is also planning to finish giving the first dose to frontline workers in the next eight to 10 days. “This is to avoid any hassles in the second dose of vaccination of healthcare workers, which will start from February 14,” an official said. Currently, Covaxin and Covishield are being given across the country and each beneficiary is supposed to get two shots at a gap of 28 days. Since vaccination of healthcare workers started from January 16, their schedule for second shot falls from February 14 onwards. Health department special secretary Manoj Kumar said so far nearly two lakh frontline workers have been registered and this registration process will continue till February 7. “Those who miss the registration will be vaccinated later along with the general public,” said Manoj. The break-up shows 1.65 lakh registered beneficiaries are from the home department, 28,000 from the urban development and housing departments and 6,000 from the revenue department, taking the total number of registered beneficiaries to 1.99 lakh. When asked about the session sites where they will be administered the shots, Manoj said even now the lowest level healthcare centres for vaccination will be the PHCs. “Most of these beneficiaries are working at the district headquarters. Very few are working at the block level like officials of the revenue and Panchayati Raj departments and some police personnel. They will come to the PHCs for vaccination.” He further said district immunization officers have been tasked with the preparation of session sites and since the number of registered beneficiaries (frontline workers) is not much, they will not need any extra manpower. Vaccination rate rises: The state on Wednesday reported a slight improvement in the Covid-19 vaccination, compared to the last two days, with 49.1% of registered beneficiaries taking the shot. The figure for Monday and Tuesday was 40.5% and 49.1% respectively. The data reported by the State Health Society states that 82,327 healthcare workers were targeted for Wednesday, out of which 40,462 of them took the vaccine. Vaccination was carried out at 662 session sites, involving 3,310 human resources and one adverse event following an immunization case was reported. So far 2.62 lakh healthcare workers have been given the vaccine in Bihar of whom 2.54 lakh have got Covishield and nearly eight thousand have got Covaxin. The target reached is nearly half the number of beneficiaries registered on CoWIN app on which nearly 4.64 lakh healthcare workers have got themselves registered. Since just two days are left for the vaccination of this phase, the state health department special secretary said they will be one mop-up day for all those who have missed the shot, however, the date has not been finalized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/phase-ii-of-covid-vax-drive-from-feb-6/articleshow/80674818.cms||Sheezan Nezami
February 4, 2021||Patna||Theatres in Patna continue to witness poor footfalls||PATNA: Cinema halls and multiplexes in the city may have started operating at a higher seating capacity, but they are still witnessing poor footfalls. Talking to this reporter, the manager of a multiplex near Gandhi Maidan, Sharad Gupta, claimed, “We are taking all necessary precautions that include use of face masks and hand sanitizers. We also have provision for online booking of tickets to promote social distancing. However, the footfall is pretty low.” The manager of another multiplex in Patliputra, Dilip Kumar, echoed similar views. He said, “Although we are sanitizing our premises at regular intervals and adhering to all safety norms, the response from viewers has been poor.” The proprietor of a Hajipur-based multiplex, Vishal Boobna, attributed the low footfalls to fewer films being displayed in theatres. “Since only a few new films have been released, people are not going to the theatres.” Meanwhile, many movie buffs have decided to revisit cinema halls soon. 18-year-old Sanya Shekhar said, “I miss watching movies in theatres, but I will soon visit a hall with my friends.” Another student, Prachi Shrivastava, told this newspaper, “Covid has not vanished and it is our responsibility to prevent its spread. That said, I still want to go to a theatre to watch a film with my family.” A private firm employee, Prakash Kumar, misses “the ambience of cinema halls”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/theatres-continue-to-witness-poor-footfalls/articleshow/80674858.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Patna||Fog causes 7 accidents, 11 deaths in a month||PATNA: The winter fog in state has not only affected normal life but also caused at least 11 deaths in seven major road accidents since January 1 due to poor visibility. Altogether 34 persons were also injured in the accidents during the period. Five persons returning after celebrating the New Year died on NH-30 at Mohania in Kaimur due to poor visibility on January 1 night. One person was killed and three more were injured in the collision between a pickup van and an autorickshaw on Maner-Naubatpur Road in Patna district on January 18 night. One passenger lost his life and a dozen other co-passengers were injured after a bus carrying them climbed on a median and turned turtle at Hajipur due to poor visibility caused by fog on January 22 night. Another road accident in Maner the same day due to fog resulted in four injuries. Two persons were killed and at least seven were injured as two autorickshaws collided on Bikram-Paliganj Road in dense fog on January 29. The latest fatal accident took place near a bridge at Semra under Mufassil police station area in Motihari at around 2am on Tuesday when a pickup van fell into several feet deep ditch, killing two and injuring seven daily wagers. Police said the driver perhaps failed to see the road due to dense fog. On Tuesday, a head-on collision between a passenger bus and a sugar cane loaded truck in Bagaha injured more than six persons. As per the state transport department data, out of 7205 deaths in the 10,007 road accident cases reported in 2019, 1884 deaths were in accidents due to fog. Department authorities said it would take a few months to get an updated data on road accident deaths due to fog last year. Apprehending road accidents due to fog, transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal had sent a letter on December 3 to all the district magistrates and other stakeholders, including road construction department, rural works department and NHAI, to initiate preventive steps. He issued directions for fitting retro-reflective tapes, studs, cat’s eyes on roads as these things reflect light attracting drivers’ attention in poor visibility and give them an idea of the road leading ahead. Agarwal had also issued directions for installation of alert and warning signage at important spots and repairing the old ones. Besides, the authorities concerned were also directed to put up crash barriers, hazard and median markers and blinkers. Agarwal had also written them to work towards creating awareness among common masses to take precautions during fog. Avoiding halting a vehicle in the middle of the road, overloading, over-speeding, not talking or using cellphone while driving, avoiding overtaking etc were the few things which Agarwal had asked the authorities to make people aware about for reducing cases of road accidents from fog. A senior road construction department engineer, preferring anonymity, told TOI over phone that all of the divisions were engaged in necessary preventive works in order to avoid road accidents due to fog and poor visibility. “All divisions have been directed to fix retro-reflective tapes on trees, medians and other places so that drivers remain alert while driving. Trees are one major reason of accidents in foggy weather,” he said. The officer said they are also engaged in strengthening road shoulders so that accidents rates could be brought down. “These works are also being carried out on a large scale due to road safety month being observed from January 18 to February 17,” he said. He said at least 200 grey spots had been identified across the state. “There were 12 black spots in 2017, seven in 2018 and 13 in 2019. All of them have been rectified,” he said, adding black spots determined by the Centre separately are also rectified by them. The officer said the transport and road construction departments get to know about black and grey spots in state through CID. “We will get fresh figures from them for 2020 by March or April as data analysis of accidents takes time,” he said. The officer also said the state government has its own yardstick of earmarking black and grey spots, which is different from the Centre’s. “As per state analysis, black spots are those stretch of road where ten or more accidents take place in a calendar year even without any casualties. Grey spots are those stretches where two or more and less than ten accidents take place in a calendar year even without casualty,” he said. Transport minister Sheela Kumari told TOI over phone that road safety month was already going on. The department was operating vans in rural and other areas in all districts for creating awareness on road safety, she said. “These vans would keep moving for now. The department is making efforts to bring down road accident cases, including those resulted from fog,” she added. She said the department would open motor vehicle driving training centres in all districts. “These centres will also train about precautionary measures required for driving safely in a foggy weather,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fog-causes-7-accidents-11-deaths-in-a-month/articleshow/80674173.cms||Debashish Karmakar
February 4, 2021||Patna||‘Shaibal left his impact on every major policy in Bihar’||PATNA: I knew Shaibal Gupta because his guru Pradhan Hari Shanker Prasad was a friend. I was teaching in the economics department at the University of Pennsylvania and in Swarthmore College; also putting the final touches to my approved doctoral dissertation. One of my supervisors was Lawrence R. Klein, who later got the Nobel Prize. Klein had started the prestigious International Economic Review. He caught me in the Dietrich Hall, where we had our offices and told me a chap called PHS Prasad has sent a paper on ‘Growth for Full Employments’. Handing over the paper he said, “Give me your comments. The maths is OK.” I returned the paper after a week saying I wish I had written it. The paper was published in the journal. I came back home and met Prasad at a new institute in Patna (AN Sinha Institute) of which the legendary AK Dasgupta was the director. Prasad and I became friends. He produced some good students. P.P. Ghosh was the best and stayed on as a teacher in Patna and like all good teachers, remained unsung. Then there was Shaibal Gupta, Alakh Sharma and some others, who became ‘Acentrepreneurs’. A distinguished civil servant in Gujarat, Rathi Kant Basu, once called me an academician. When I remonstrated saying I was an academic, he said ‘Sir you go as an additional secretary in the Planning Commission at 33 and later as a secretary at 44: a dream any official would envy’. Shaibal set up a very prestigious think tank in Patna at his Asian Development Research Institute, bringing out studies and influencing policy. He would meet me in Ahmedabad and Delhi and get me over to Patna. He would push the idea that Alagh says Bihar must grow at 15% annual, otherwise, it will never catch up. I have a lurking suspicion he planted that idea, with Nitish Kumar, who referred it in summing-up a three-day meeting in Patna. He left his impact on every major policy issue in Bihar. His health started failing him but he kept up a hectic pace. He would always visit me in his sojourns to the West, breaking the journey in Ahmedabad in trips to Mumbai. We would make light food for him and we would catch up on ideas. He had a large house in Patna and would give me feasts when I went there, apart from my favourite Litti. The last time I met him we reminisced about his guru, the impractical PHS Prasad. I said as chairman BICP, I invited Pradhan to give a set of three lectures on price policy in a growing economy and how he laid it all out. The conscientious workers there, including NT Srinivasan, a Railways Accounts Service cadre officer who was a finance member understood this and polished theories of long-range marginal cost pricing. Later we made Srinivasan the finance officer in JNU. Shaibal regaled me with many such stories on how in Bihar brilliant ideas go begging and how his hands are always full. He always looked at those who wouldn’t t take ideas on account of caste, age or sex as the real bottlenecks to progress. He had a wide range of interests. They included the release of seeds issued at Pusa in Bihar for improving the productivity of paddy yield; better use of North Bihar Maize cultivation; or finding good vice-chancellors for universities in Bihar. ShaibalGupta I am sure is improving systems, in his quiet unobtrusive manner, wherever he is.

February 4, 2021||Patna||Opposition slams CM over DGP’s order on protests||PATNA: Opposition leaders hit out at the state government over an order issued by DGP SK Singhal, which stipulates that people indulging in violence in the name of protests will not be eligible for government employment or contracts. Leader of opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav criticized chief minister Nitish Kumar for the order and compared him with Hitler and Mussolini. A portion of circular pointed by Tejashwi read if anyone involved road blockade or dharna, affects law and order and gets charge-sheeted, then it has to be ensured that it gets mentioned in his character verification report. “Such people will have to be ready to face dire consequences because they will not get a government job or government contract,” read a part of the order. Highlighting this portion, Tejashwi said CM Nitish was now competing with Hitler and Mussolini. “Nitish Kumar is saying if anyone protests against the government using his democratic rights, then he will not get a job. That means one will neither get a job, nor he can protest,” tweeted Tejashwi. He further wrote that a CM with 40 seats was afraid. He even shared a newspaper clipping in which he compared Bihar CM to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Congress state spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre also lashed out at the government over this circular. Rajesh said, “Everyone knows that a charge-sheeted person cannot get a government job. But a fresh circular at this moment is a threat to all those who are protesting on the road, especially those teachers who even after selection are not getting appointment letters and those youths who have to wait for years for the result and job. Why keep reminding people now and then. This government should simply read the Constitution for itself and people” Rajesh said a few days ago the government had given a similar threat to employees working on a daily wage. He said, “They had also come out with a circular mentioning anyone who writes against the government or bureaucrats on social media will face legal hassle. There is an IT Act for such issues, so why to remind people with such circular. Now the state government is following the path of the central government and trying its best to suppress the voice of common people.” However, the ruling party leaders criticized the opposition for politicizing this issue. State BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, “It is not a new thing. This circular is just a reminder to make people aware of rights and responsibilities. Nobody is curbing the democratic right to protest and raise a voice, but one cannot be allowed to break the law in the name of rights and resort to notorious activities like violence or vandalism. We request everyone to be a law-abiding citizen and follow the constitution of India.” Same was the reply of JD (U) state spokesperson Anjum Ara, who said the government led by CM Nitish had worked for people and had raised their voice. “Our government follows the Constitution and circular has been written keeping it in mind. Everyone has the right to express himself in democracy, however, few people intentionally try to convert a peaceful protest into a ruckus. This is a reminder to them. Tejashwi has no right to talk about democratic rights as RJD rule was the worst phase which people have faced and it was termed by the High Court as Jungle Raj.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-slams-cm-over-dgps-order-on-protests/articleshow/80674350.cms||Sheezan Nezami
February 4, 2021||Patna||LJP blames JD(U) for NDA’s poor performance in polls||PATNA: The Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) on Wednesday blamed CM Nitish Kumar and his JD(U) for the NDA’s poor performance in the 2020 assembly polls in the state. “CM Nitish Kumar wanted to contest a majority of assembly seats and leave only 15 seats for LJP in the 2020 assembly election. This caused such a situation that the NDA got disintegrated in the state. Resultantly, JD(U) had to taste defeat in 72 seats out of 115 assembly seats it contested. The LJP also had to bear a loss of one seat,” LJP state parliamentary board president and former MLA Raju Tiwari has written in a letter sent to JD(U) national secretary general KC Tyagi. “Whatever situation was created during the assembly polls, the main reason was JD(U)’s insistence to contest a majority of seats and continue to hold the status of ‘big brother’ among the NDA partners,” Tiwari’s letter further said. In his two-page letter, Tiwari also recounted how an adverse situation was created during the poll to compel LJP to go outside the NDA. “However, LJP remained in the NDA and our leader Chirag Paswan decided to contest the assembly polls and support BJP in the election because LJP had no problem with the saffron party,” Tiwari stated in his letter written in Hindi. The LJP leader said he sent the letter to Tyagi because it was he who had blamed LJP for JD(U)’s poor performance in the last assembly polls. A few days after the election results came out on November 10, Tyagi had blamed LJP for JD(U)’s poor performance in the assembly polls. “LJP damaged the prospect of JD(U) in around 30 seats. Had the LJP not pitted its candidates against us, JD(U)’s tally would have easily gone beyond 80 seats. BJP should consider taking action against Chirag Paswan, who is an NDA component at the Centre,” Tyagi had said seeking action against Paswan. Reacting over Tiwari’s letter, JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad on Wednesday said, “The LJP is now writing such letters to find out an excise for the sins its leader Chirag Paswan committed by disobeying the code of alliance during the assembly polls. The LJP is now trying to return to the NDA fold by raising such issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ljp-blames-jdu-for-ndas-poor-performance-in-polls/articleshow/80674384.cms||Madan Kumar
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Don’t blame us if kids fall ill once classes start: Schools to parents||Kolkata: Parents could not blame the authorities if children fell ill after resuming classes or writing exams on campus, schools said. In the consent forms they are sending to parents, schools have made it clear they will not take any blame if any student falls sick and so, parents should willingly send their children or have the choice of letting them continue with online classes from home. Stating that they have sanitised the premises and implemented Covid-related SOP, schools pointed out that there could be several other factors behind a child falling ill, for which parents could not target the institutes. Some schools have gone to the extent of showing videos of all the measures they have taken so that parents are satisfied and feel the premises are safe. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy is one such school. “In a video, we have shown our sanitisation routine, touchless taps, touchless sanitizer dispensers, seating arrangements in classes. Despite all this, if a child falls sick, we cannot have parents blaming us. We have included a line in our consent form that parents will sign before deciding to send their children,” said Meena Kak, director of the school. Some other institutes that have mentioned this or are about to include it in their consent forms are Ashoke Hall, Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar, Vivekananda Mission School, Joka, Ram Mohan Mission School, Adamas International School and Loreto House. “I have a meeting with the parents of Class X and XII students on Saturday, when I will give them the details. I will tell them we can’t be blamed for any kind of sickness as we have tried our best and they should send the kids only if they are convinced. I will screen share the consent form and they will send them in by evening,” said Aruna Gomes, Loreto House principal. Head of Ram Mohan Mission Sujoy Biswas said both children and schools were more than eager to be with each other. “We have tried our best to make our school perhaps the safest place, after home. But even then, infections may come from elsewhere and parents should be logical enough to understand that. That one line in the consent form will keep schools safe,” Biswas said. Parents of Class XII students of Vivekananda Mission School have been shown around. “They will send their kids out of the free will. In our form, we are including a line to say parents will not blame the school if a child falls ill. It’s in no one’s hands,” said principal Sharmishtha Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dont-blame-us-if-kids-fall-ill-once-classes-start-schools-to-parents/articleshow/80675590.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The company said in a statement that during the quarter ended December 2020, the sale of cement was down to 2.6 million tons, from 2.8 million tonnes YoY. “The sales volume in the current quarter was impacted due to extended and above normal monsoon in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, AP and Telangana,” the company said, adding, “cement prices were constantly under pressure across all its markets during the current quarter.” The power and fuel cost for the quarter reduced mainly due to higher inventory base, procured at lower cost in earlier quarters. This has benefited the company to keep a check on overall cost, while the market prices of pet coke and coal have witnessed a sharp increase during the quarter. Ramco expects to commission the clinkering unit of 1.5 MTPA along with 9 MW (Waste Heat Recovery System) WHRS in Jayanthipuram and 2.25 MTPA clinkering unit in Kurnool.

February 4, 2021||Kochi||Covid fatalities surpass accident deaths in Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Deaths in the state from road accidents and other communicable diseases were less than Covid-19-related fatalities in 2020. The overall death rate also dropped by around 10% between 2019 and 2020, as per latest data from the civil registration system. The latest figures contain information on deaths from all parts of the state, except 153 gram panchayats where a new system is in place and for which data has not been compiled yet. Kerala recorded 2,37,407 deaths in 2020 compared with 2,63,983 the previous year – translating to a 26,576 drop. According to sources, even if data from the remaining panchayats is included, the figure will be significantly lower than in the previous year. In the case of communicable diseases, 2020 saw the lowest mortality of the past five years, at 90. This was down 61% from the previous year. Even road-accident deaths fell by 32%, and the figure of 2,979 was the lowest recorded in the past five years. Last year, Kerala reported 3,074 Covid-19 deaths. This was the first time that fatalities from an infectious disease outnumbered accident deaths in Kerala. The cumulative deaths from communicable diseases have always been lower than that of accident deaths. “Assuming that most of the deaths from 2020 are already registered, some of this reduction can still be a result of deaths averted by decreased economic activity, mobility and the overall lockdown resulting in reduced road traffic or industrial accidents, or even reduced number of deaths from infectious diseases. However, fact remains that Kerala historically had a very low proportion of deaths due to infectious diseases,” said health researcher Oommen C Kurian in a technical paper published by Observer Research Foundation. Also for the first time in five years, Kerala managed to bring down the fatality due to other communicable diseases below 100 in 2020. The most significant drop was noted in H1N1 deaths. In 2018 and 2019 Kerala recorded 50 and 45 HIN1 deaths, respectively, while in 2020 only two deaths were recorded due to H1N1. Medical practitioners attribute such a sharp dip in H1N1 mortality to widespread use of masks, which reduced chances of respiratory infection. Covid-19 remained the major and solo respiratory viral threat for Keralites in 2020, infectious disease specialists said. Commenting on the data, health minister K K Shailaja said interventions by health department and other departments with a focus on saving lives seem to have yielded results. Even districts with the highest number of Covid-19 deaths and which have recorded more than 300 deaths showed a dip in total number of deaths in 2020. In Thiruvananthapuram, which has had the highest Covid-19 mortality, death rate dropped by 11% while that of Ernakulam and Thrissur came down by 10%. “We will get the full picture only after data compilation from 153 local bodies as well which is being recorded in a new system,” said M Ramankutty, chief registrar, births and deaths, panchayat department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-fatalities-surpass-accident-deaths/articleshow/80679964.cms||Aswin J Kumar

February 4, 2021||Surat||Gujarat: 63-year-old woman’s organs save three lives||SURAT: A 63-year-old brain dead woman has injected new life into three patients who received her organs and gave eyesight to two others. Prabha Bhuva, who lived in Shantivan Society in Varachha of Surat, suddenly collapsed while returning home after attending a religious sermon on February 1. She was referred to Venus Hospital for further treatment where doctors detected brain haemorrhage. On Tuesday, medical experts declared her brain dead. Hospital’s resident medical officer (RMO) Dr. Kalpna Savani informed Donate life, an NGO which works to create awareness about cadaver donation. “We immediately reached the hospital and met her family members. They agreed for cadaver donation after we explained to them how it could save lives,’‘ Nilesh Mandlewala of Donate Life said. The State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO)’s convener Dr. Pranjal Modi was alerted about liver and kidney donation. A team from Ahmedabad-based Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC) reached Surat and harvested both kidneys and a liver. The three organs were transplanted into three patients in IKDRC on Wednesday. A team from Lok Drashti Eye bank collected the donated cornea. “Bhuva’s sons , Sanjay and Vijay, who are diamond polishers told us that their mother was a religious person and whenever she read news about such cadaver donations, she would tell everyone around her that everybody should donate organs,’‘ Mandlewala said. Bhuva is native of Mota Dadva in Gondal taluka of Rajkot district. Her elder son Sanjay works with S Vinod company while younger son Vijay is employed with Karp Impex in the city. Her husband Dhirubhai leads a retired life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/63-yr-old-womans-organs-save-three-lives/articleshow/80673894.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Pune||PMPML staffers likely to be among first beneficiaries||Pune: Employees of the transport utility Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) are likely to be first among the frontline workers to get the vaccine. Their vaccination is expected to begin simultaneously with health care workers. Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department has designated Bharati Medical College & Hospital’s Ayurveda Hospital as a dedicated centre for vaccinating PMPML staff, including drivers, mechanics, and administrative staff.“Among registered frontline workers in the city, we are initially considering vaccination of PMPML staff at Bharati Ayurveda Hospital in Dhankawadi. We will assess how it goes and accordingly plan to vaccinate other listed frontline workers,” said Ashish Bharati, chief of PMC’s health department.Deputy medical director of Bharati Hospital Jitendra Oswal said, “Our Ayurveda hospital has a staff 400 doctors. The facility is well-equipped. It can function as a vaccination centre for frontline workers.”Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of the state health department, Pune region, said, “We are planning to start at least one vaccination centre in every area for frontline workers. In Pune district, municipal corporations of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad should have one dedicated centre for frontline workers. Besides, there will be an independent vaccination centre for frontline workers in rural areas of Pune.” However, Pune currently doesn’t have enough doses in stock to simultaneously vaccinate its health care and frontline workforce against Covid-19. Hence, officials are wary about hastily starting vaccination of frontline workers.However, state authorities said they are hopeful of getting the required number of doses from the Union government in a few days. “We received 86,000 doses for areas under PMC limits. With the two-dose regimen, we can inoculate about 38,000 to 40,000 individuals from the priority groups. So it would be difficult to vaccinate frontline workers alongside health care staff, unless we have the required volume of doses,” Bharati said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-staffers-likely-to-be-among-first-beneficiaries/articleshow/80677334.cms||Umesh Isalkar

At least 10 students reported minor side effects and were sent back after observation for a couple of hours. AMC officials said that to facilitate those left out, the AMC had given a last chance to the healthcare workers to get vaccinated. The officials said many queued up to get themselves vaccinated once they were sure of absence of major side effects. “We had decided to give at least a week’s time to those who had not registered themselves, but now wanted to get vaccinated. On Monday, 5,883 including 2,298 women health workers got themselves vaccinated. We will be closing the walk-in vaccination facility,” said Bhavin Solanki the medical health officer of AMC. Centres where large numbers of health workers got vaccinated include Pandit Dindayal Hall ( 1,458 including 771 women) near SG Road and Tagore Hall (957). Another 643 health workers took the vaccine at Mangal Pandey Hall, Nikol. AMC officials said that the more women health workers than males took the shot at Pandit Dindayal Hall. A doctor said that he had got himself registered, but when he’d got the call for vaccination, not much data was available. “And now when we know that the vaccine is pretty safe, I decided to get myself vaccinated,” he said. An officer at the Pandit Dindayal Hall said, “Several students were sent to the centre today in groups and 10 young girls among them had reported giddiness and uneasiness.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/5443-health-workers-take-the-jab-on-last-day-of-walk-in/articleshow/80677386.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Vijayawada||Adani Group bags 5 solar projects in AP||AMARAVATI: Adani Renewable Energy Holding Twelve Limited, a firm owned by Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL), has bagged five solar power projects in the state. The Adani Group clinched five projects with a total capacity of 3,000 megawatt. The government finalised the successful bidders after the reverse auction process was completed on Wednesday. However, the government will award the contracts after pending cases in the high court are cleared. Adani Group emerged the successful bidder for solar parks to be set up in M Kambaladinne (Kadapa), Pendlimarri (Kadapa), Rudrasamudram (Prakasam), CS Puram (Prakasam) and Madibugga (Ananthapuram). Each solar park will have an installed capacity of 600 megawatt. The government has decided to set up 10 solar power parks with a total capacity of 6,400 megawatt to exclusively meet demand in the agriculture sector. The government plans to switch over entirely to solar power to supply free power to the sector. While NTPC bagged the 600 MW Chakrayapet (Kadapa) project, the lesser-known Shirdi Sai Electricals won bids for 400 MW Thondur (Kadapa) and three 600 MW projects at Urchintala (Ananthapuram), Kambadur (Ananthapuram) and Kolimigundla (Kurnool).

February 4, 2021||Gurgaon||Plan to reduce road fatalities in Gurugram by 50%||GURUGRAM: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will draft a road safety action plan in order to bring down the number of road fatalities in the city by 50% over the next decade. Once the action plan has been prepared, roles will be assigned to specific officers who will be held accountable in case of a loophole. GMDA is working with several road safety experts and organisations for drafting the action plan and its implementation. The plan is expected to address several road safety issues such as identification of black spots, corrective measures at these spots, focus on non-motorable transport (NMT) and pedestrians during road development, and redesigning of intersections wherever required. According to GMDA officials, the main objective of the road safety action plan will be to reduce road deaths by half by the year 2030. According to Haryana Vision Zero, Gurugram witnessed 375 road accident deaths in 2020, a dip from 403 in 2019 and 465 in 2018. “We will be working with NGOs and other organisations concerned to collect and analyse the data from black spots across the city and take preventive measures as required,” said GMDA chief VS Kundu. He added that all new roads in the city will be developed keeping in mind the safety of pedestrians as well as NMT users. City-based road safety expert Sarika Panda, who is working with the metropolitan authority for the action plan, said fatalities can be reduced by 50% just by identification of black spots and taking corrective measures at these spots. “Gurugram has around 22 black spots, and 70% of the road fatalities happen on these black spots. If we just address these areas, we will see a significant drop in road accident deaths,” Panda said. She quoted Bilaspur Chowk as an example. Although the stretch witnesses many accidents every year, no corrective measures have been undertaken there, she said. It is a similar story with Golf Course Road. “In the last three years, 40 people have died due to road accidents on Golf Course Road. If we address the road safety issues on this single road, fatalities will come down by 30%,” Panda said. According to GMDA’s comprehensive mobility plan, Gurugram reported the maximum number of accidents in Haryana in 2018. “The main reasons for the accidents observed are speeding and careless driving. There is a need to rationalise the present speed limits in GMDA areas and policy level speed limits have been recommended in the city,” states the mobility plan. The plan further suggests that in order to improve road safety in Gurugram, there is a need to assess the problem and set targets for casualty reductions, create a safer road environment and raise public awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/plan-to-reduce-road-fatalities-by-50/articleshow/80678317.cms||Shubhra Pant

Upgraded footpaths will be provided with barrier-free design, demarcated entry/exit points, with ramps and bollards, street furniture and street art,” BMC chief Iqbal Chahal said in the budget. Over the last couple of years, the BMC had allocated Rs 100 crore for footpath repairs. A policy was also framed two years ago to make pavements pedestrian-friendly. The BMC intended to replace paver blocks with concrete as it is long-lasting and can’t be dislodged easily. Under the plan, 128 traffic islands will be beautified by carrying out horticultural and landscaping works, creative railings, sculptures and medians. The BMC will also upgrade 42 spaces below flyovers with wall paintings, ornamental plants and aesthetic designs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/recipe-for-khao-gullies-a-touch-of-street-aesthetics/articleshow/80677416.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

On Wednesday — the first day of catch-up round — only 30% of the left out 1.09 lakh health workers turned up for vaccination. Highest vaccination turnout of 76% was reported from Dindori district while Shajapur witnessed the lowest vaccination turnout of 8%. A total of 32346 health workers were vaccinated on Wednesday.

Thus, till Wednesday, a total of 331107 health workers out of around 4.17 lakh health workers who were to be vaccinated, could get the jab. When contacted, managing director of Madhya Pradesh National Health Mission, Chhavi Bhardwaj said, “This was a mop-up round. Only those who were left outs or no-shows in the earlier sessions were planned. We have the highest percentage of health workers vaccinated in the country”. Sources from the department, however, said that it is not possible to achieve 100% target of vaccination due to several exclusion criteria, like if some one has been a Covid-19 positive patient in past, if someone is having high fever now, or some home having other exclusion criteria like pregnancy and others. In Bhopal, the turnout remained at 30% while in Jabalpur it was 27% and 29% in Gwalior. In Indore, of a total of 14688 beneficiaries, only 4326 turned up. The vaccination was held at 1081 centres across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/30-get-gift-of-jab-on-1st-catch-up-day-mp-target-shoots-up-to-79/articleshow/80675706.cms||Amarjeet Singh

February 4, 2021||Vijayawada||Ruling party factions clash in Kurnool||Tirupati: Factionalism within the YSRC came to the fore on Wednesday after Nandikotkur legislator Arthur Toguru and his followers clashed with followers of constituency in-charge Byreddi Siddharth Reddy at a party meeting attended by four ministers and a Rajya Sabha MP at a private hotel in Kurnool. It was learnt that Arthur and Siddharth Reddy entered into an argument when the topic of selection of sarpanches for Nandikotkur assembly constituency came up for discussion during the meeting. Followers of both leaders rushed to the spot and were about to clash but were pacified by the ministers, Rajya Sabha MP Vemireddy Prabhakar Reddy and ruling party legislators of Kurnool district. After chaotic scenes at the party meet went viral, minister Botcha Satyanarayana lashed out at opposition parties for exaggerating the issue. “There are no differences within the party between any leaders. The TDP, which is staring at an imminent defeat in panchayat polls, is resorting to cheap tactics to divert people’s attention,” said the minister. — Sandeep Raghavan||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ruling-party-factions-clash-in-kurnool/articleshow/80674440.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
February 4, 2021||Pune||82-year-old man, paediatrician son take Covaxin shots||Pune: A father-son duo got vaccinated at the District Hospital, Aundh, the district’s only Covaxin site, on Wednesday. Mahabaleshwar Hegde (82), director, Centre for innovation in Nutrition Health and Disease, at Interactive Research School for Health Affairs (IRSHA) of Bharati Vidyapeeth, and his son Dr Vishnu Hegde (59), a paediatrician at Shashwat Hospital in Kothrud, said they felt no hesitation about receiving the vaccine and felt fine after getting the shot. Dr Vishnu Hegde had undergone heart transplantation last year in February. He decided to take the Covaxin after mentioning his heart condition in the consent form. “There was no hesitancy about the vaccine or the consent form. Covaxin uses old technology, it contains a dead virus. Just like the influenza vaccine, it can instruct the immune system to start a defensive action against an infection, which I, as a medical practitioner, prefer. My cardiologist also recommended the same vaccine,” Hegde said. Sharing his experience, Mahabaleshwar Hegde said he had no apprehension about the vaccine. The retired professor and head of the chemistry department said he was well aware of the vaccine and its composition. Mahabaleshwar Hegde added that he was proud of both the Indian vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/82-year-old-man-paediatrician-son-take-covaxin-shots/articleshow/80677373.cms||Piyush Bhusari
February 4, 2021||Kochi||Kerala: After 98 days, Sivasankar walks out||KOCHI: Ninety-eight days after he was first arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the CM’s former principal secretary, M Sivasankar, was released from prison on Wednesday after securing bail in all three cases for which he was booked. On Wednesday, the Ernakulam additional chief judicial magistrate (economic offences) court granted him bail in the currency-smuggling case registered by customs. He had earlier received bail in the Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling case as well as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case, both registered by ED. The court, on Wednesday, granted bail on condition that he furnishes a bond for Rs 1 lakh and two sureties for the same sum, and with the direction to appear before the investigating officer as and when required, until the filing of the complaint (chargesheet). He was released from Ernakulam district prison around 3pm after he executed the bail conditions. “Having regard to the nature of alleged minimal complicity of the petitioner and stage of the investigation, I am of the view that the further detention of the petitioner (Sivasankar) is no longer essential for the successful future investigation of the case,” the judge’s order said. “The investigation officer has not sought custody of the petitioner in the case at hand, obviously for the reason that detention in custody is not required. Presumably, a major part of investigation in relation to the petitioner’s alleged limited role is complete. In the result, I am inclined to release the petitioner on bail,” the court observed. Even as the court allowed his petition for bail in the currency-smuggling case, the court noted that the offence alleged against the petitioner is serious in nature and requires intensive investigation. “I have meticulously gone through the statements of crucial witnesses and prime accused …The conjoint scanning of the statements, would spell out that petitioner has sufficient knowledge with regard to the smuggling of foreign currencies perpetrated with the help of prime accused. Such knowledge and his culpable failure to bring the smuggling into the notice of appropriate authority despite the fact that he was a senior civil servant during relevant time, shall be viewed seriously,” the order said The court also referred to the HC order granting bail to Sivasankar in the PMLA case in which it observed the applicant is neither a flight risk nor has he any propensity to tamper with evidence or influencing witnesses in view of the fact that the statements of accused and crucial witnesses were already taken. The order granting bail also refers to the HC ruling considering the health condition of the petitioner being a cancer survivor who had undergone surgery and was further advised regular follow-up visits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/after-98-days-sivasankar-walks-out/articleshow/80675708.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Pune||Pune district’s tally mismatch spikes Maharashtra’s case count||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope has sought Covid-19 data reconciliation on the health department website following a huge mismatch between the figures given by the Pune district authorities and those on the online portal, which resulted in Maharashtra’s overall active cases showing a spike. While the authorities said there were only 4,971 active cases in the district on Tuesday, the figure on the health department website was 13,487. The district thus showed the highest number of cases in the state, followed by Thane and Mumbai at 6,552 and 5,530 cases respectively. While Maharashtra along with Kerala was accounting for almost 70% of the total active cases in the country, the lack of regular updates and data reconciliation on the website ensured that the state’s active cases were on the higher side, a state health official admitted. “This (data mismatch) is serious and I have directed the officials concerned to immediately carry out the necessary corrections,” Tope told TOI. In a late Wednesday evening development, officials began updating the website data, which resulted in Pune district’s active count decreasing to 9,123. “Further correction is expected to happen soon,” a state official said. On Tuesday, Maharashtra had registered 41,586 active cases, while Kerala’s figure stood at 71,000. Pune, Thane, Mumbai and Nagpur districts have four-digit active cases while the others have three-digit tallies, the state data showed. “We have told the officials concerned to carry out necessary changes and work has already begun,” said S Deshmukh, deputy director of health services for Pune region. Another senior health department official, who did not wish to be named, said the active tally on the website included even patients from Pune district who had recovered. “This could be happening with other districts too. The Union government has sent mitigation teams to states with higher active tallies based on the data reflected on the website,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/districts-tally-mismatch-spikes-states-case-count/articleshow/80677408.cms||Nisha Nambiar
February 4, 2021||Kochi||Where’s Jesna? Man targets HC judge’s car||Kochi: A 55-year-old man was arrested after he allegedly poured motor oil onto the car of a high court judge in Kochi on Wednesday. The incident happened at 9.30am when judge V Shircy was entering high court premises. The accused, Reghunathan Nair of Erumeli in Kottayam district, splashed oil onto the car while raising slogans demanding investigation into the disappearance of Jesna Maria James, who has been missing from Pathanamthitta since March 2018, Central police said. Nair had a letter seeking a better probe into the woman’s disappearance and drawing attention to alleged apathetic handling of the case, police said. The accused was somehow convinced that Jesna was murdered and wanted it to be investigated accordingly. The man was in possession of a placard which stated that the disappearance was not an incident of elopement but murder, police said. Police said Nair was not associated with any action council formed as part of the cause for seeking justice to the woman. Police were also yet to confirm if the protest was in connection with any particular case at high court. Police said the protest seems to be a venture of the accused alone. The act seemed to be an attempt to put out his message rather than a planned attack on any particular judge, police said. Cops said the man seems to have splashed the oil at the first opportunity that he got. Nair was charged with provisions of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and sections 353 and 427 of the IPC.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/wheres-jesna-man-targets-hc-judges-car/articleshow/80675740.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||‘Patient flow back to normal at GCRI’||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI), city’s biggest cancer treatment centre, had reported 43% drop in admission of patients and 47% drop in OPDs during 2020. The numbers were still lower during the lockdown period. “But the patients resumed, and several procedures which were put on hold also increased. Now we receive almost the same number as pre-Covid period,” said Dr Shashank Pandya, director of GCRI. Analysis of the cancers reveal that 22% male patients were of head and neck cancer, 11% had tongue cancer, 10% had lung cancer and 4% had stomach cancer. Among the female patients, 22% had breast cancer, 14% had cervical cancer, 8% had head and neck cancer and 5% had tongue cancer. During the pandemic period, 10,199 cancer cases were recorded that included 570 children. The period also witnessed 1,409 surgeries, 18,996 chemotherapy and 2,575 radiation therapy patients. Dr Pariseema Dave, deputy director of GCRI, said that awareness about cancer and regular inspection of possible sites of cancer is crucial for quicker identification and early intervention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/patient-flow-back-to-normal-at-gcri/articleshow/80677445.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Goa||Fmr naval chief staff flags concern about rising garbage problem||Panaji: Goa’s garbage problem has assumed alarming proportions, said former chief of naval staff Admiral Arun Prakash and asked the government to take steps to arrest the rapidly deteriorating situation. In a letter to waste management minister Michael Lobo, Prakash has said that unless Goa acknowledges the magnitude of the problem and tackles it on a war-footing, garbage will overwhelm Goa and defeat the purpose of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The naval veteran, who resides close to the naval air station at Dabolim, said that the government needs to implement the Rural Garbage Scheme 2005 and the District Environment Plan 2020, while also strictly enforcing the Goa Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 1996. “Within Vasco limits, one sees household garbage dumped in huge piles by the roadside, and occasionally a few municipal personnel, struggling to clear a limited amount,” Prakash stated in a letter to Lobo. “The citizen wonders at the inability or unwillingness of the state administration as well as local civic authorities to tackle this problem which is assuming alarming proportions.” He stated that it has become standard practice for shopkeepers and households to dump their garbage along the roadside. Glass bottles, often broken, are being dumped along the roadside, he stated. The garbage piling-up in public places and along roads is a huge health hazard for the state and could also deter foreign tourists from visiting Goa. “If no action is taken to address the situation, foreign tourists will certainly switch to destinations like Sri Lanka, Thailand or Vietnam — which are not only far cleaner, but also cheaper than Goa,” Prakash stated. The current neglect towards solid-waste management could soon make it impossible to collect and dispose the huge amount of accumulated legacy solid-waste, Prakash said. “Once the practice of casual garbage disposal gets embedded in the public psyche, it will be extremely difficult to re-educate people or make them change habits,” he stated. The former naval chief still sees hope and stated that Goa, as India’s smallest state, could become a paradise of cleanliness if there is “political impetus and administrative resolve”. “Till the door-to-door collection scheme can be implemented universally, facilities should be created for depositing household garbage in a central place in each locality, to preclude dumping on roadsides. This will require the construction, locality-wise, of a network of garbage disposal sites where vehicles can remove garbage on a daily or weekly basis,” Prakash stated. He stated that garbage collection should be outsourced to private contractors and that garbage bins should be installed in public places and cleared on a daily basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fmr-naval-chief-staff-flags-concern-about-rising-garbage-problem/articleshow/80677965.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||This BMC budget just showing dreams, says Congress leader||MUMBAI: The Opposition dubbed the BMC budget as dreamworks that won’t be fulfilled. The Congress, BJP and the Samajwadi Party hit out at the BMC over the budget. Opposition leader in the BMC and Congress corporator Ravi Raja said, “This budget is just showing dreams to the people of Mumbai that won’t ever be fulfilled. The budget is the same old story in a new budget book ...There is no new plan for parks, and other civic amenities....” SP MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh called the budget “hyperambitious”. “Taking a loan of over Rs 5,000 crore and financial re-appropriation of Rs 4,000 crore and despite this, the budget has laid out Rs 18,000 crore for capital expenditure. This is being overambitious...In fact, apart from taking loans, there is no concrete plan to raise finances.” BJP group leader in the BMC Prabhakar Shinde said the budget was a jugglery of numbers. “The expenditure for the current financial year has been cut by 28% and only 48% has been spent on development works, how can the commissioner then claim they have spent more?” BJP’s Rajhans Singh said the entire budget begins and ends with Worli. “It centres around Aaditya Thackeray.” BJP MLA Parag Alavani said that most infrastructure works are ongoing and “are only being continued”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/this-budget-just-showing-dreams-says-cong-leader/articleshow/80677460.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||Corona necessity becomes mother of invention||Ahmedabad: The Covid-19 pandemic brought the routine medical procedures to a grinding halt in March last year. But several cancer patients could not wait for the lockdown to be lifted, or could not sustain only on medicines. While the patients were afraid to enter the medical setting fearing Covid-19 infection, it was equally distressing times for the surgeons who were exposed to the aerosols generated by the patients during the procedures.Dr Kaustubh Patel, senior city-based surgical oncologist (head & neck), said that the initial phase of the pandemic was the most difficult. “After September, the patients started trickling in, and after December, we saw the regular numbers resuming. But in the initial phase, the viral infection was new for us all and we decided to perform life-saving surgeries despite understanding the risk involved,” he said.For the surgical procedures, the team devised a ‘shield’ in-house. “The moulded hard plastic apparatus had an opening on one side and two holes on the other. After the apparatus is kept on the patient’s head, the surgeon can see the process through transparent plastic sheet. We performed several procedures with the shield,” said Dr Patel.Another indigenous development for the oncologists was ‘aerosol collector.’ Dr Dushyant Mandlik, surgical oncologist, said that the instrument was designed in a way that it could arrest all the aerosols generated from the patient’s mouth during a surgery. “The surgeries take a long time, and generation of aerosols was natural. Thus, the instrument would be used along with the probe to ensure that there are no aerosols – which could contain the virus – in the operation theatre,” he said.The city-based experts also devised ways to perform surgeries where exposure could be reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corona-necessity-becomes-mother-of-invention/articleshow/80677449.cms||Parth Shastri
February 4, 2021||Pune||Celebrating Panditji, a voice both sublime and supreme||The birth centenary year of Kirana gharana doyen Bhimsen Joshi begins today. A maestro who rules the hearts of music lovers, his life, his love for cars and driving and his pahadi voice are legendary. His son Shrinivas Joshi; vocalist Rahul Deshpande whose grandfather Vasantrao shared a deep friendship with him, and compere Anand Deshmukh share their memories with Manjiri Damle. Father & Guru Pune: A sensitive father, who never wore the mantle of his vast musical stature inside the house, and a guru who gave equal importance to aesthetics and technique is how Shrinivas Joshi, son and disciple, describes Kirana gharana doyen Bhimsen Joshi. “Baba was especially fond of me as I was the youngest. He was a father just like others. He would play with us, speak his mind, but was never an enforcer. He was a simple man despite his greatness as a vocalist and he treated everybody equally – be it his fans or the President of the country,” Joshi recalled. When he secured admission to IIT, the doting father accompanied him and helped him set up his room in the hostel. “My classmates were shocked to see the great Bhimsen Joshi carry my belongings,” he said. As guru, he taught Shrinivas everything, even tuning the taanpura. “He shared his insights. He was the best performer too, so he taught me how to capture the mind and the heart of the audience. In keeping with the Kirana gharana style, the focus was equally on the grammar and emotions, technique and aesthetics,” Joshi said, adding that Baba would guide his disciples as per their natural propensity and grasping power. Joshi said his father’s bond with his fans was unique. “Whenever something good happened to him, they felt happy. After he passed away, people would come to our house and stand at the gate with folded hands. The adulation bordered on devotion and I still remember how emotional the audience became when Baba performed at Sawai Gandharva Mahotsav for the last time,” Joshi recalled. A Complete Vocalist For vocalist, composer and actor Rahul Deshpande, Bhimsenkaka as he used to call him, was a complete vocalist. “I met him first when I had participated in ‘Nakshtranche Dene’ programme based on my grandfather Vasantrao Deshpande. He told me I sang the natyageet just like Dada, as he used to call my grandfather, and that he now wanted to listen to me sing classical. When I performed for the first time at Sawai Gandharva Mahotsav in 2006, I sought his blessings first, and he spoke to me at length about music,” Deshpande said. The name Bhimsen suited him, Deshpande added. “He had operatic strength. His singing was not just about his trademark taan. He was a thinker who captured even the minutest detail and nuance. His voice was earthy, but it could also become delicate. Bhimsenkaka had mastered all the dynamics of music,” he said. One of his most striking qualities that appealed to Deshpande was how the Kirana gharana maestro could quickly tune the taanpuras. “It is the most difficult task. Equally striking was the way his voice used to reach the audience even when he used to have the accompaniment of four taanpuras. It is no mean achievement,” he added. Lofty like the Himalayas Compere Anand Deshmukh , long associated with the Sawai Gandharava Bhimsen Mahotsav for the last 30 years, said the love he received from Bhimsenji is his most treasured possession. “It was my first time at the mahotsav. It was 2.30am and I was told that Bhimsenji wanted to meet me. I thought I have erred. He was sitting at a tea stall. When I went there he offered me salted peanuts….kha..aawajala changle asatat (eat..they are good for the voice). Then he said, “Deshmukh, you are doing a good job..and it is so because you are speaking less,” he recalled. “Whenever he was on stage to perform, he would call me and share which raga he was going to present, so that I could include it in my introduction. He was such a great artist, yet so humble. He changed my life,” Deshmukh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/celebrating-panditji-a-voice-both-sublime-and-supreme/articleshow/80677468.cms||Manjiri Damle
February 4, 2021||Nagpur||Private hospital uses extra doses in vials, covers 14 more workers||Nagpur: In a remarkable initiative, city’s Alexis Hospital has started to utilize extra doses available in the vials of Covid-19 vaccine, allowing it to vaccinate 14 additional health care workers in two days. As per state government guidelines, also highlighted on the vials, each vial of Covishield comprises of 5ml vaccine, with each beneficiary to be administered 0.5ml. Thus, each vial is supposed to have 10 doses. Infectious diseases specialist from Alexis Hospital Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) permitted vaccination centre at our hospital on January 29. The team at vaccination centre is highly experienced and found some quantity of vaccine remains in the vial after administering 0.5ml to 10 beneficiaries. Director (medical) Dr Tushar Gawad took the initiative and asked the team to utilize the extra dose too. Thus, our team went on to administer vaccine to 141 health care workers from 13 vials on February 1. We also vaccinated 153 using 15 vials on February 3.” Dr Shinde said Alexis Hospital will continue to save extra doses through out the vaccination drive. “This vaccine is very important as all have witnessed the severity of the pandemic. Therefore, our motive is to ensure vaccination to more and more people,” he said. Director of Orange City Hospital and Research Institute (OCHRI) Dr Anup Marar also confirmed that extra dose is available in the vial of Covishield. “Sometimes air enters the syringe when dose is being filled. There are chances of some vaccine being wasted while removing the air. Therefore, there might be extra vaccine in all vials. Experienced staff ensure no air enters syringe, allowing usage of extra doses,” he said. Alexis had vaccinated 100 on first day on January 29. Thus, the hospital also ensured no wastage of doses in three days. OCHRI has maintained its record by ensuring no wastage of doses on fifth consecutive day. On Wednesday, 180 took the jab at the centre situated in this hospital for which 18 vials were utilized. The government had allowed up to 10% wastage. It is estimated that wastage is around 6% in 11 districts of Vidarbha. The experts had time and again opined that wastage can be minimized through proper planning, which the two private hospitals proved. Also, the hospital has broken its own record of covering highest health care staff in a centre in a single day. On February 1, the hospital had covered 170, which was a record. Dr Marar said, “NMC scheduled 200 at the centre of which 70 turned up. We ensured vaccination of 110 registered health care workers by availing on-the-spot scheduling with due permission from NMC and following all government guidelines.” Many centres have been unable to achieve even target of 100%. OCHRI has covered 670 as against target of 500 for a turnout of 134%. Alexis is at second spot in the city with achievement of 131.33% (394/300) followed by NMC’s Isolation Centre at 113% (678/600) and Kingsway Hospital at 110.6% (553/500). Centre started at Mure Memorial Hospital on Wednesday and covered 135 as against target of 100. Remaining 13 centres have achieved below 100%. Every drop counts* Each vial of Covishield has 5ml vaccine as per government and label on it * 0.5ml is to be administered to each beneficiary * Alexis Hospital’s team found some vaccine remaining after giving jabs to 10 from one vial * Hospital started to utilize extra dose and covered 14 health care workers using it in two days * Hospital also ensured no wastage of doses for third consecutive day * OCHRI too ensured zero wastage for fifth consecutive day * OCHRI broke its own record of highest vaccination at a centre in single day * OCHRI covered 180 as against its earlier record of 170||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/private-hospital-uses-extra-doses-in-vials-covers-14-more-workers/articleshow/80675856.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||13-day highest jump in Covid cases in Mumbai, Maharashtra on Wednesday||MUMBAI: Both the state and city reported an increase in daily Covid-19 cases on Wednesday. Maharashtra reported 2,992 cases and 30 deaths on Wednesday taking the total cases to 20,33,266 and the total fatalities to 51,169. Wednesday’s addition of cases was the highest in 13 days. In Mumbai, cases on Wednesday surged beyond 500 (504) after a fortnight. The last single-day tally of more than 500 cases was on January 21 (527). The daily toll was below 10 with the BMC registering seven deaths on Wednesday. The BMC tally has risen to 3.1 lakh and the toll to 11,375 since March 2020. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said while the infection is on a decline in the state, there are small surges on some days from densely populated districts. “This could be due to clusters where functions or meetings take place without people wearing proper masks or maintaining social distance,” he said. Meanwhile, the state reported a significant drop in active cases on Wednesday. It discharged 7,030 people, which reduced the active cases to 37,516, of which 5,628 are in Mumbai. The total discharges in the state stood at 19.43 lakh and the rate of recovery is over 95.5%. Thane crossed 10 lakh Covid tests on Wednesday which means nearly 45% of the city’s population has been tested till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/13-day-highest-jump-in-covid-cases-in-city-state-on-wed/articleshow/80675863.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Nagpur||4 engineers who teach people how to do everything but engineering||Nagpur: For engineering students, who feel they are also-rans in the flock, most of the soul searching happens on the eve of examination. That’s what happened with a group of four second year students of the city in 2013. Eight years later, the idea that germinated that night has found a place in ‘Forbes 30 Under 30’ list. MyCaptain, the brainchild of city’s Mohammed Zeeshan, Sameer Ramesh, Fatema Hussain and Ruhan Nagesh, all in their 20s, has grown by leaps and bounds in the last eight years and sits pretty in the list that has upcoming batting star Shubman Gill headlining it. A mentoring platform for youngsters who wish to explore alternate careers, such as stand-up comedy, writing, filmmaking, music production, entrepreneurship, photography and more, MyCaptain has helped more than a lakh students give an ear to their inner calling. And all this without any major funding. Having got a special mention in the prestigious list has delighted the founders, more so because the company is completely bootstrapped. “None of us had interest in engineering. I wanted to be an astronomer, one friend wanted to be a writer while another an economist. We realized there isn’t any guidance for those who want to take offbeat career options. That’s how MyCaptain, initially named ‘The Climber’, was born. We wanted to bring a societal mindset shift around how careers are looked at in India,” says Zeeshan. MyCaptain is a team of around 200 and works from Bangalore. “Freshers are welcome in our office,” he adds. The company offers over 40 different courses in varying fields that are taught by ‘captains’, who are young professionals in that area. “Stand-up comics like Vir Das, Tanmay Bhat and other celebrities like former ICC elite panel umpire Simon Taufel and fashion designer Neeta Lulla have taken sessions for our students,” he adds. MyCaptain has also been recognized by United Nations in 2017 as one of the top 50 youth-led innovations in the world. “Forbes is a major boost,” says Sameer, a co-founder. “It is a testament to the work we are doing and the impact we have had,” he adds. The pandemic was a blessing in disguise for the company. “We saw 15,000 students enrolled in a shot span of time. Not only youngsters, even homemakers and those in their 40s and 50s took the classes,” says Sameer. The founders hope that post-pandemic, the numbers would shoot up. “We aren’t getting carried away with this achievement. We have bigger plans and hope to bring a paradigm shift in the society,” says Zeeshan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-engineers-who-teach-people-how-to-do-everything-but-engineering/articleshow/80694893.cms||Sudhanshu Bisen
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Lost Australian citizen’s family traced to Sydney||Kolkata: Family and friends of Ashoke Chakravorty, who is now admitted to Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital in Kolkata, have been traced to Sydney in Australia. Chakravorty, an Australian citizen, was rescued from the streets of Kolkata a few weeks ago and admitted to the hospital. He possessed nothing save for photocopies of his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) certificate and a bank passbook. He also suffers from a mental ailment and can only recall his name and that he lived in Australia. TOI had reported his plight on Friday. “The Australian High Commission got in touch with the hospital and Chakravorty. We contacted amateur radio operators (hams) in Australia who checked with the Indian community there. We were able to get in touch with Gorachand Ghosh, an Australian citizen, who helped us locate Chakravorty’s wife and daughter. His daughter is a doctor there. Even she and her mother were unable to provide details of what happened to Chakravorty in India over the last few years,” said Ambarish Nag Biswas, secretary, West Bengal Radio Club (WBRC).Chakravorty had spoken of his daughter in Sydney, but was unable to provide any detail about his stay in India or correct address.Biswas and his team also succeeded in getting in touch with Chakravorty’s brother in north Bengal. It was from there that it came to be known how Chakravorty, who sold his house near Baranagar for several lakhs a few years ago might have been cheated by a business partner. How and where he spent the last few months of his life continues to remain a mystery though.“There are indications that he lived in an old age home in Baranagar after selling his property. He also stayed at a rented accommodation in Uttarpara. There is reason to suspect that some people who knew him well stole whatever he had after he started suffering from a mental ailment and dumped him on a pavement in Kolkata,” Nag Biswas said. “Fortunately, his relatives have now agreed to take care of his treatment. The Indian community in Australia is also providing assistance,” he added. While Chakravorty may not be able to return to Australia anytime soon, he is likely to receive proper medical assistance in the days to come till his condition improves. Ghosh spoke to TOI from Australia and said how the Bengali community there is monitoring Chakravorty’s condition and ensuring that his family takes care of his medical needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lost-australian-citizens-family-traced-to-sydney/articleshow/80675880.cms||Jayanta Gupta
February 4, 2021||Pune||Experts for faster vax use to curb waste||PUNE: Vaccine doses available with the government will not be wasted and will be utilised within the shelf life, assured central government health officials with the country facing the challenge to administer the vaccines in stock before they cross their six-month expiry date. "The vaccination pace will be increased multifold in the coming weeks and so the fear of vaccine wastage can be put off. We will consume all the available vaccines well before the expiry date," said Dr Vinod Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog on Wednesday. Paul said that he has directed all the states to scale up vaccination drive in the coming weeks and carry out simultaneous vaccination of health workers followed by frontline workers and then those above 50 years. He told TOI that the fear of vaccine stocks available with us not being utilised is uncalled for as we are aware of the shelf life and it will be consumed well before time frame. "So states will have to increase vaccination sites to carry out simultaneous vaccinations of all these groups under the priority population," he said. With the country off to a sluggish start in the vaccination drive, even the two companies that are supplying vaccines are hoping that the consumption scale is increased It was learn't from SII that the existing stock of Covishield vaccine has a short expiry period ranging from April-June and therefore it must be utilised quickly. There has been follow up to to scale up consumption and take this as the top most priority, stated the sources While a statement issued from Bharat Biotech said that the targeted shelf life is 24 months, the current approved shelf life is 6 months. Currently, Serum Institute has manufactured 102 million doses of this about 20 million doses are already supplied to the government of India. Another 14.4 million doses were exported. Officials had told TOI that currently the institute is manufacturing 50-60 million doses per month and this capacity will go up to 100 million per month from April onwards. While in case of Bharat Biotech they have assured the government that they would be scaling up manufacturing to four facilities in India and they were planning around 200 million doses per year in Hyderabad and 500 million doses in other cities and by mid of this year, the company is expected to have 700 million doses of capacity Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor, head lifecourse epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, Bengaluru said that despite the initial laurels India is far behind in terms of meeting it's immense potential and the need of covering greater proportion of the population. "In order to cover 300 million people with comorbidities and elderly over the next 3 months it may be necessary to cover at least 3 million people each day. The vaccines have a limited shelf-life and the supplies in December might expire by the end of May. Therefore there is an urgent need to speed up the vaccine coverage to cover the vulnerable population. Inorder to do this, decentralised and bottom up micro planning is needed. While accounting each dose of vaccine is important, greater amount of flexibility to state government can speed up the process" he said State technical expert Dr Subhash Salunkhe told TOI that there is a need for the state to get more freedom to carry out the vaccination process and ensure that the available doses are utilised at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/focus-on-vaccination-rate-to-curb-wastage/articleshow/80677513.cms||Nisha Nambiar
February 4, 2021||Pune||Maharashtra colleges to reopen from February 15 at 50% attendance||PUNE: Colleges across the state will reopen on February 15 for physical classes after a hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, higher education minister Uday Samant said on his social media handle on Wednesday. Universities and institutes in the city said they were ready with all precautions and standard operating procedures for the reopening. The Savitribai Phule Pune University has some 800 colleges under it in Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik. “Colleges will reopen allowing 50% attendance of students at a time and hostels will start in the second phase. The universities will conduct examinations in both online and offline mode. The compulsory 75% attendance rule to appear for an examination has been scrapped, and universities will come up with a rule on attendance based on both online and offline presence. Institutes that are reopening will have to follow University Grants Commission guidelines on the reopening and should also discuss with the local administration before they start,” Samant said. Principal Sanjay Kharat of Modern College, Ganeshkhind, said, “Colleges have to reopen since practical sessions for students are pending. We have drawn up batches of 50 students for laboratory sessions and we will begin immediately.” Students, who have been demanding the reopening of colleges, were happy about the development. The higher education department has been receiving flak both online and offline for the delay in announcing the reopening, especially after the state decided to start schools for standards IX to XII from November 23 last year and for standards V to VIII from January 27 this year. Student activist Dayanand Shinde said there should be a decision on hostels soon because many students coming to SPPU are from outside Pune city and they all stay in hostels. SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said they are ready to reopen based on the safety guidelines from the UGC, Union and state governments. “We had already created an SoP based on the guidelines sent by UGC and we have all preparations in place. The classes will be held in a hybrid mode, but for their practicals, students need to come to the laboratories. Examinations will be held in offline-online mode,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-to-reopen-from-feb-15-at-50-attendance/articleshow/80677514.cms||Ardhra Nair

Confirming the development, Congress district president Dharmendra Gupta said, “We have been informed that Priyanka Gandhi is expected to arrive in Rampur to meet the family of Navreet Singh in Dibdiba village, but we are yet to receive the itinerary of her visit. We have, however, informed our party workers to be present on the occasion.” Additional SP Sansaar Singh told TOI, "We don't have any information about Priyanka Gandhi's visit to Rampur. We are yet to receive any official programme." The family had alleged that Navreet died due to a bullet injury, but the autopsy report confirmed that he had died of shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem head injuries. One of the injuries suggested that Navreet’s brain matter spilt out of an ‘everted’ wound on the right ear, which indicated that the impact of the injury was inside out, underlined the autopsy report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/priyanka-may-attend-last-rites-of-rampur-farmer-who-died-in-delhi-tractor-rally/articleshow/80674488.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

February 4, 2021||Chennai||Chennai: Two weeks after reopening, schools are half empty||CHENNAI: It has been nearly two weeks since schools reopened for students of Classes X and XII. After spending close to a year at home, students turned up in full attendance on the first day, but their enthusiasm began dissipating slowly. Many find it difficult to get back to their routine and adjust to the new norms. “Waking up early, getting dressed, and coming to school have become a challenge today. I see children putting in a lot of effort,” said K Shanmuganathan, principal of Balalok Matriculation Higher Secondary School.  Due to the pandemic, the classes are now held between 8.30am and 12.30pm. Since students do not have to go to schools compulsorily every day, several schools are witnessing only about 50%-60% attendance on campus. While a few have set up live streaming facilities, the others are reaching out to them through their peers or teachers to keep them updated with their lessons. “The teachers are overworked. They are taking extra effort to finish the lessons before the exams,” said Shanmuganathan. He said that a few students that came to school also complained of ‘homesickness’. “We are still figuring out how to address such issues when its coming from class 12 students." Enforcing safety protocols and social distancing has also become an ordeal. While schools have deployed staff to ensure that the norms are followed students often complain of discomfort and breathlessness for being masked all day. To avoid this, schools like Hindustan International have allotted a two-minute- breathing time for students every 20 minutes or so. “We ask them to go to the corridor, take out their masks and breathe. We do it regularly, or whenever they ask,” said C Bharathi Lakshmi, the school’s principal. "We have asked students to wear disposable surgical face masks instead of cloth ones to avoid suffocation. We also give them one if they done have," said a teacher from the Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Ashok Nagar.  Shobha Raman, principal of Vidya Mandir said that they have also prepared a special module comprising of stretches and exercises to help students get fit, as several returned overweight due to the lockdown. Despite the measures, principals said many parents remain hesitant and insist on having only online classes for the rest of the year. Neuropsychologist B S Virudhagirinathan said this is the right time for schools to reopen and asked principals to explain to parents about the safety measures taken on campus. “Once the schools take responsibility for students' safety, parents will become confident and send them back. Children need personal and social development, which is only possible inside schools. Attending online classes for prolonged periods can cause mental health issues, headaches, and sleep disturbances,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/two-weeks-after-reopening-schools-are-half-empty/articleshow/80675919.cms||Aditi R

February 4, 2021||Pune||More than 600 schools in PCMC areas start today||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Only 14,062 consent forms have been received from the parents of students from standards V to VIII in schools run by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation even though the strength is 1.32 lakh. The education department of the civic body is also plagued by issues of the incomplete Covid tests of the teaching staff. According to the data, only 2,707 teachers had undergone the test by Wednesday evening as against a total teacher strength of 3,311 for these classes. Parag Mundhe, acting education officer in PCMC, told TOI, “ No teacher has tested positive so far in the Covid tests we conducted. The remaining will be told to get their tests done at the earliest.” Mundhe added there are 128 civic schools in Pimpri and Chinchwad with 24,000 students and 519 private schools with over 1.10 lakh pupils. These are expected to open on Thursday. According to Mundhe, teaching will be held in two sessions, from 8am to 11am and from 1pm to 4pm with 50% students in a class. An official from the education department said around 10% of civic schools lack the mandatory thermal guns and have been told to arrange for those at the earliest. Mundhe said the students will be provided with sanitisers and masks for safety against the contagion. “Preparations have been made with sanitization of the classes and equipment. Once the parents get confident about the safety measures, the submission of consent forms will increase,” he said.

February 4, 2021||India||Can't presume couple in locked house to be in an immoral relationship: HC||CHENNAI: A man and a woman found inside a locked house cannot be presumed to be in an immoral relationship, Madras high court has said. "This kind of presumption prevailing in the society cannot be the basis for initiating disciplinary action and inflicting punishment," said Justice R Suresh Kumar. He made the observation while quashing the termination of service of an armed reserve police constable on the ground of 'moral turpitude', because he was found inside a locked house along with a woman constable. Constable K Saravana Babu was found inside his quarters with the company of a woman constable in 1998. On October 10, 1998, a woman constable entered the residential quarters of Babu and the door was found locked from inside when their neighbours knocked. According to Saravanan, the woman constable had come to his home asking for the keys of her house located close by. While they were talking, someone locked the door from outside and then pretended to knock on the door, he added. "There was absolutely no eyewitness or any other concrete evidence to prove that the two constables were found in a compromising position", the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-presume-couple-in-locked-house-to-be-in-an-immoral-relationship-hc/articleshow/80679003.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Pune||Road-widening plan based on flawed thinking: Parisar||Pune: Non-government organisation Parisar lashed out at the civic body’s nine-metre road-widening plan, claiming that it was based on “flawed thinking” and was against the National Urban Transport Policy as well as the Comprehensive Mobility Plan for Pune, both adopted by the municipal corporation. The lane-widening plan incentivised personal vehicles and would have an adverse impact on these policies aimed at promoting public transport and non-motorised transport, including cycling and walking, Parisar said in its objection letter issued to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). “Most European nations have made conscious efforts to retain the old narrow lanes in their cities. Such a random decision to widen all lanes in a city is not urban planning. The idea should be to make cities more liveable,” Sujit Patwardhan, the trustee of Parisar, told TOI. Formed in early 1980s with an aim to create environment awareness among citizens, Parisar has been spearheading the campaigns against “unsustainable transport policies and transport infrastructure” since 1995 as it believes these are the foremost threat to urban environment and quality of life for most of the citizens. Patwardhan said many tourists visiting the European cities make it a point to have a look and feel of the old streets where non-motorised modes of travel, including cycling and walking, are promoted to keep the old charm of these streets alive. “Explain how the road-widening will help and make it safer for walking and cycling — the two zero pollution transport modes — and how it will not increase the number of vehicles that add to the pollution,” Parisar said in the objection letter. Referring to the assurances given by the political party leaders and the administration that it would drop the plan to widen a street in an area if majority of the residents from that area object to it, Patwardhan said this further underlined the civic body’s flawed thinking. “The decision to widen the roads should be based on unbiased scientific data and not merely on demand from individuals living adjacent to these roads. Have any surveys been done to find out how the proposed road-widening will benefit the citizens or the traffic conditions?” the Parisar’s objection letter to the PMC seeks to know. Admitting that the traffic problems in Pune are increasing by leaps and bounds, Parisar said the PMC was allowing the cancerous growth in the number of personal auto vehicles by promoting wider roads. It argued that the city needed more efficient public transport and a “strong disincentives” for the use of personal auto vehicles like cars and two-wheelers. “Although the PMC often pays lip service to these concepts, in reality, most of their energy and budget are spent on non-sustainable personal vehicles,” Parisar said. Also, there were several examples across the city illustrating that the actual carriage width of the newly widened streets continued to be narrow because of on-street parking, Patwardhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/road-widening-plan-based-on-flawed-thinking-parisar/articleshow/80677551.cms||Abhijit Atre
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Dhananjay Munde case: Elder sister seeks custody of two kids||MUMBAI: A week after a woman withdrew her complaint against social justice minister Dhananjay Munde, he appears to be in fresh trouble as her elder sister, who was in a relationship with him, has demanded custody of her two children, who are with him. The elder sister approached the police commissioner and director-general of police to press for her demand. She complained that Munde has been harassing her and the children are in his illegal custody. In her five-page complaint to the police commissioner, she narrated the sequence of events since she first me him. “My children are in illegal custody of Munde, he is not allowing me to talk to or meet them. I am worried about their security and safety,’’ she said. Her younger sister had on January 12 lodged a complaint against Munde, claiming she was sexually assaulted over a prolonged period. She withdrew her complaint after two leading politicians, including Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Krishna Hegde, disclosed that she had been blackmailing him for three to four years. Munde denied the charges, saying, following a petition filed by him, the high court has referred the case for mediation by V K Tahilramani, former Chief Justice of Madras HC, it was wrong to approach the media against him.  “All issues, including custody of children, are being mediated. Under such circumstances, the case is sub judice. The decision by the judge will be final and binding on us,’’ Munde said in a statement. Munde said he had approached Bombay high court to resolve the dispute between him and the woman, so a mediator was also appointed. “Justice Tahilramani held two meetings, while the third is scheduled on February 13. I am sure the row over custody will be resolved at the meeting. Under such circumstances, the complaint to the police chief was an attempt to defame me and resort to a media trial,’’ Munde said. A senior police official said the original complaint had been entrusted to a female assistant commissioner of police for investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/munde-case-elder-sister-seeks-custody-of-two-kids/articleshow/80678374.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
February 4, 2021||Pune||UGC hostel rules run into host of practical problems||Pune: The standard operating procedures for colleges to reopen, published by University Grants Commission last year in the wake of Covid 19 pandemic, is causing stress to universities and higher education institutions as it stipulates only one person per hostel room. Every institution should regularly monitor the health of its students, faculty, and staff who should also be sensitized on self-monitoring of their health, the rules said.The hostels in the universities and colleges are woefully short, and most rooms are shared by more than three students. However, UGC vice-chairman, Bhushan Patwardhan, said these were guidelines and decisions can be taken at the local level based on the conditions and safety of students.Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor of SPPU, said while the university is already prepared for the reopening and has an SoP for all sections of the campus, the problematic part would be the hostels. “We have a large number of students coming from outside the city and even if we keep theory classes online as much as possible, there is no alternative to practical classes in the laboratory. For students living in other districts or states, it will not be feasible and will also be risky if they have to be called in batches and have to travel frequently. Hence, staying in hostels is the only option. But if the one person per room rule is applied, then we will be short of rooms. So, we are going to write to the UGC appealing for an amendment in that clause so that when colleges reopen, students have a secure place to stay,” Karmalkar said. Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society, said at the moment they have reopened the Symbiosis Medical College for Women, and are providing accommodation as per one person per room norm. “However, these are young women who have just completed their standard XII and many of them are new to the city and living away from their parents for the first time. Hence, they want to have room mates so that there is no feeling of loneliness. Our hostel rooms are big enough to accommodate two people while maintaining enough social distancing. We would also be writing to the UGC to see if two persons per room will be allowed especially when there is enough space in the room,” Yeravdekar said.Patwardhan said they are not revisiting the guidelines. “We have given enough freedom to universities to make local decisions based on the situation in the area. They can also innovate. If they decide to keep two students in a room and their Covid-19 test is negative, then there is no problem. There is flexibility and freedom given to them and they can decide to keep the best interest of students,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ugc-hostel-rules-run-into-host-of-practical-problems/articleshow/80677560.cms||Ardhra Nair
February 4, 2021||Nagpur||No proof: Bombay HC acquits rape accused||NAGPUR: Holding that it can’t convict an accused merely on the basis of a girl’s allegations of multiple sexual intercourse, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court acquitted a 27-year-old man accused of sexually exploiting a 17-year-old repeatedly for two months and impregnating her. The Hinganghat sessions court had convicted petitioner Jageshwar Kawle under IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, and awarded 10 years of rigorous imprisonment on November 12, 2019. The HC acquitted him, stating that there’s no conclusive evidence that the survivor conceived from the accused and prosecution was silent as regards DNA test and what happened to her pregnancy. “Except the survivor’s statement, with regard to sexual intercourse at the house of accused’s sister, there’s absolutely nothing supporting prosecution’s case of rape. Only on the basis of allegation with regard to commitment of sexual intercourse on many occasions, it would be highly irrational to convict the accused to 10 years’ imprisonment,” justice Pushpa Ganediwala ruled. The survivor, who hails from Umari village in Samudrapur of Wardha district, was staying on rent at Hinganghat in Wardha district for her Std XII classes, where she met Kawle in 2015. One day, he took her to his parents’ village at Gosikhurd in Chandrapur district, and then to his sister’s home for a couple of months, where she alleged that the accused had sexual intercourse with her many times. After the girl went missing from Hinganghat, her parents lodged a complaint with Girad police station on May 8, 2015. When the police brought the couple to Hinganghat, the girl was sent for medical examination. When she refused, the magistrate sent her to the Child Welfare Committee in Wardha. During her urine pregnancy test (UPT) she was found positive and a charge of rape was added to the FIR. She was 17 years and nine months old at that time. After completion of investigation, the special Pocso court convicted Kalwe, which he challenged in HC. Justice Ganediwala pointed out that as per birth certificate and her father’s testimony, the girl was born on August 1, 1997. “At the relevant time, she was just three months short of attaining majority. A perusal of her testimony would reflect that she has vividly described her love relationship with the accused. This omission is so much material in nature that it has strength to decide the case’s fate. She has not stated before police the incidents of sexual relations between them at his sister’s place.” The judge noted that the girl didn’t depose with regard to dates, time, who were present in the house at the relevant time, how other members permitted the unmarried boy and girl to sleep together, how many rooms were there in the house, how could she and accused get privacy, and under what circumstances was she forced to establish physical relationship. “No doubt, her testimony is sufficient for conviction, however, the same ought to inspire HC’s confidence. Given the facts and circumstances, this court is of the opinion that the prosecution couldn’t establish, beyond reasonable doubt, the offence of rape against the accused,” justice Ganediwala said before releasing the accused.

February 4, 2021||Chennai||‘Will soon pay arrears of land acquisition cost’||CHENNAI: Nudged by the Madras high court, which pointed out that land acquisition arrears amounting to Rs 1,053crore remained unpaid to land-losers, the chief secretary of Tamil Nadu has assured the court that steps would be taken to release the arrears soon. Justice N Seshasayee, who had summoned chief secretary Rajiv Ranjan to appear in court through video-conferencing, said: “I have collected statistics of all the execution petitions pending in all the courts in the state. As per the report, the total arrears payable to various land owners comes to around Rs 1,053 crore,” the court said. “It was about Rs 800 crore a few years back. Now it has swelled to Rs 1,053 crore,” Justice Seshasayee added. Ranjan said steps would be taken to release pending compensations for people whose land was acquired by the state for public purposes. Justice Seshasayee had summoned the top official in view of the large number of cases pending at various levels of the courts in connection with disbursal of due compensation for the land acquired by the state government for public projects under the Land Acquisition and other legislations. “We have got cases where the government has entered or squatted or did not utilise the land without acquiring it. Today we have a case in which lands were occupied for the Aliyar project for 35 years and converted for government purposes without even acquiring them,” Justice Seshasayee said. In all such cases without acquisition somebody wants to enter possession that is saddening, Justice Seshasayee said. “Right to property has to be extremely valued as it is part of the constitutional right of the citizen. There is no justification for keeping the acquisition pending for 35 years and making the owner of the property penniless”, the judge added. Noting that the court is extremely disappointed in the manner such cases are handled, the judge said, “the state is neither acquiring the lands that have been used by the government nor paying compensation to the land owners. This may not be the right approach the way citizens' right to property has to be dealt with.” Also, pointing out that litigations are pending even for petty compensations like Rs 14,000 the court suggested the government to come up with a policy decision not to litigate cases involving petty amounts. “Since this is a budget session I expect some allocations for the issue,” Justice Seshasayee added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/will-soon-pay-arrears-of-land-acquisition-cost/articleshow/80675952.cms||Suresh Kumar
February 4, 2021||Chennai||Man kills ex-colleague over loss of job||Chennai: Police on Wednesday arrested a 44-year-old man in connection with the murder of his former colleague at Peerkankaranai two days ago. On Saturday, police found the body of a man identified as Johnrajasingh, 68, of Mangadu. The victim, who was a cashier at an iron ore manufacturing company at Annanur, had multiple injuries. Police said the accused, Kovilraj, was also employed at the same firm. Kovilraj seemed uninterested in the work and would often dodge any project that came his way, an investigating officer said. This behaviour irked his colleagues, who complained about him to Johnrajasingh. When joining duty, Kovilraj had informed Johnrajasingh that he was sacked from his previous job at a firm in Hosur for being lazy. He had also been warned by employers at his other workplaces. Irked over Kovilraj’s irresponsible ways, Johnrajasingh complained about him to the owner and Kovilraj was fired. Police said Kovilraj had been furious with Johnrajasingh ever since. On Saturday night, when the victim was heading home, Kovilraj intercepted him. He told Johnrajasingh that it had been difficult for him to make ends meet without a job and asked the victim to drop him at Perungalathur bus stop so he could leave Chennai for his native village in Tuticorin district. On the way to the bus stop, Kovilraj suggested a pitstop at a Tasmac shop in Tambaram. The two bought some alcohol and got drunk near a lake in Peerkankaranai. Kovilraj picked up a fight with Johnrajasingh and stabbed him to death. He escaped with the victim’s bike. Police, after recovering the body, launched a search for the victim’s bike and caught the accused. Kovilraj was booked under murder charges and a court sent him to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-kills-ex-colleague-over-loss-of-job/articleshow/80675974.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Pune||Pune: Minimum temperature plunges to 10.7 degrees Celsius, more dip likely||PUNE: Citizens on Wednesday woke up to the coldest morning since over a month with the mercury dropping to 10.7ºC, a sharp 2-3 notch overnight plunge. An India Meteorological Department (IMD) official said the last time the city’s minimum temperature had fallen closer to Wednesday’s plunge was during the December 21-24, 2020 period. The minimums in Shivajinagar had then fallen to 8-9ºC. Since then, the city has been mostly recording higher night temperatures. An IMD forecast stated that Pune was likely to see a further dip in minimum temperature during the next few days to 8-9ºC. Skymet Weather Services president G P Sharma told TOI: “The minimum temperatures have recently dropped in several areas, including parts of Gujarat up till Maharashtra, due to the influence of the cold northerly winds. What is happening up north is trickling further south till the central parts of the country in terms of the influence of northerly winds.” Sharma, however, said rainfall activity in parts of north India, as a result of a western disturbance and an induced cyclonic circulation during the next day or two, would momentarily prevent a further drop in temperatures in parts of Maharashtra. “These dual systems are causing snow in the mountains and rain in the plains of north India. This is likely to last on Thursday. Direct flow of cold, dry northerly winds into Maharashtra will be arrested for a day or two due to the influence of these systems, after which these winds may resume over parts of the state. This may cause a drop in minimums even up to cities such as Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar and Dhule,” said Sharma. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature in Lohegaon was 13.4ºC and 12ºC in Pashan. The minimums on Tuesday in Shivajinagar, Lohegaon and Pashan were 13.4ºC, 16.5ºC and 15.2ºC, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/minimum-temp-plunges-to-10-7c-more-dip-likely/articleshow/80677574.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Pune||Downsizing may affect 130 edu training officers||Pune: Over 130 officers working at the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) having doctorate degrees, clear NET/SET exams and even civil services are fighting to keep their jobs with the new state government notification to reduce work strength. The institute works for improving the quality of primary education, research and conducts teachers’ training. The DIET was started in 1995 with 100% grants from the Union government which was reduced to 60% over a period of time. A letter from the assistant section officer of the state government Santosh Mamdapure to the state education commissioner and the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training said that DIET had four sections and each section had an appointment of one or two project directors. “There are a total of 33 DIET units in Maharashtra, but a lot of the responsibilities undertaken by the DIET units had either become outdated or divided to other state government organisations. As a result, the pressure of work on DIET had reduced considerably as against the number of appointments,” it said. Mamdapure said the Union government had reduced the grant for DIET by 40%, and reducing the workforce would ensure that the salaries of the officers were paid on time, and hence the proposal to reduce two senior lecturers and two lecturer posts has been submitted to the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/downsizing-may-affect-130-edu-training-officers/articleshow/80677575.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
February 4, 2021||Pune||PMC to present its stand on TDR order to state||Pune: The state urban development department might issue a set of guidelines on the utilisation of the transfer of development rights (TDR) instead of premium floor space index (FSI) after hearing a detailed report on the TDR proposal approved by the Pune Municipal Corporation. The state has cancelled the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s order, asking the builders to utilise the TDR before going for the premium FSI. Against this backdrop, the government convened a meeting on Wednesday. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, urban development department minister Eknath Shinde, and senior officials of the state and the urban development department participated in it. No final decision was taken on revoking the state’s cancellation order, but a report was sought. Officials in the deputy chief minister’s office said the issue would be discussed with the chief minister’s office for the final nod. The civic officials stated that the unified development control rules had given priority to the usage of premium FSI. It might reduce the importance of the TDR. So, the PMC had issued orders giving priority to the utilisation of the TDR — one of the big sources of land acquisition for the civic body. According to sources, the civic administration presented its version on promoting the TDR in the meeting. “That the PMC depends more on the TDR allocation than cash compensation was one of the reasons cited by the civic body,” said a source. “The PMC presented its logic behind issuing the TDR orders. The state government is positive on the PMC’s stand. The state may issue orders accordingly,” Prashant Waghmare, the city engineer of Pune, told TOI. The state urban development secretary, Bhushan Gagrani said blanket revocation of the TDR cancellation order would not be possible. “If the civic body presents a specific case such as amenity space development, we may consider it. If the TDR is kept blanket priority, it will defeat the purpose of unified development control rules,” he said. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar could not be contacted despite repeated attempt. He did not reply to the SMS sent by TOI either till going to press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-present-its-stand-on-tdr-order-to-state/articleshow/80677566.cms||---

Police recovered 38 cards from them as well.According to police, the fraudsters would target technologically challenged individuals and in the pretext of helping them, would take their card and withdraw money for them. But in the meanwhile, they would stealthily copy private data and exchange the ATM cards.Amroha superintendent of police Suniti said, “We were tipped off about the gang, who would target gullible people in long queues at ATMs. On the pretext of helping them, members of the gang exchanged their ATM card after copying its data. Later on, they would withdraw money from the victim’s bank account.”Late in the evening on Tuesday, police busted the gang, arresting three members — Iqbaal, Shahrukh and Mustafa — from Chitta under Salempur police station of Bulandshahr district. The SP said they have recovered 38 ATM cards of different banks, a luxury car, three knives and Rs 7,500 in cash from their possession.

February 4, 2021||Nagpur||Better injected than infected, say experts on vaccination||Are the vaccine shots safe? The panel broached the trillion dollar question right off the bat. Paediatrician Dr Sanjay Marathe, who has taken the jab, said all Covid-19 vaccines are safe enough to protect humans from serious complications. “The emergency use authorization (EUA) was granted by national regulatory authorities all over the world based on assessment of safety and immunogenicity data. All vaccines are safe. The choice is simple — get vaccinated or get infected.” He added, “The biggest worry for people is whether the vaccine’s availability in the shortest possible time frame compromises safety, but that’s not the case. The timeline was telescoped given the unprecedented situation at hand. We couldn’t have waited 6-8 years for a vaccine as there is not a single anti-viral in the world that can cure the disease. Vaccine is the only hope.” To help overcome public scepticism, said infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, healthcare workers need to lead by example. “When people see their peers coming forward and taking the doses, the fear just goes away,” he said. Dr Shinde pointed out that this was not the first time that there is vaccine hesitancy. “Pneumonia and influenza vaccines came up after 10 years of research, yet there were apprehensions. Whenever anything new comes, there’s hesitancy; it’s human behaviour,” he said. Paediatrician Dr Vinky Rughwani, who is also the vice-president of Maharashtra Medical Council, said very few healthcare workers were unwilling to get the shot. “Majority of them are eager to get vaccinated,” he stated. Given that the second countrywide sero survey showed “just 6% positivity, and the upcoming third one was likely to reveal around 20% positivity”, said Dr Rughwani, “80% of our population still stands vulnerable to the virus, and it is clear that vaccination is the only way out.” While the indispensability of vaccines was not lost on any panellist, some expressed reservations about the lack of rigour in the data released by the government. Advocate Ankita Shah said that considering the decline in Covid-19 cases, the government would be better served taking another 3-4 months and releasing exhaustive data about the vaccine’s efficacy and reactions to existing medication, before mass roll-out. She added, “Everyone wants to take vaccine shots, but with confidence. As of now, Covaxin’s phase-3 trials are incomplete and the data proffered inadequate.” Adarsh Vidya Mandir principal Ashnarayan Tiwari concurred with Shah. “Scientists have done a commendable job in bringing vaccines to us in such a short span of time. But it is necessary to counsel healthcare workers properly before undertaking the vaccination programme,” he said. In response to Shah’s concerns, Dr Shinde cited the example of Russia where the Sputnik V vaccine was rolled out 2 months ago. “The phase-2 results came out yesterday, and its efficacy level is 91%. All six authorized vaccines are still in the process of publishing their data. Unless the expert committee tasked with approval was satisfied, it wouldn’t have given an EUA,” he said. Dr Marathe chimed in, “The priority all over the world is to protect the protectors (front-line workers) and then in the second phase, those at higher risk. By the time the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI, head of the department responsible for vaccine approval in India) gets the complete information, it will be made available for the general public and for companies to sell.” Paediatrician Dr Vagish Katariya said the numerous Covid-19 mutations should not be taken lightly. “It is better to get vaccinated than to suffer hefty hospital bills,” he said. On the logistics front, said additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, neither storage nor transportation is a challenge. “One vial is sufficient for 10 doses. We are targeting vaccination of about 100 people in each centre, which comes up to just 10 vials per centre.” The actual turnout, however, tells a different tale. Only 55% of the registered healthcare workers have been inoculated so far in Vidarbha, raising the question of whether other citizens willing to take the vaccine be moved up the queue. The panel was all for it. Dr Shinde said, “Schools are a priority. It makes sense to vaccinate teachers who will be invigilating board exams, so that every parent feels safe.” Unfortunately, as per Joshi, civic authorities like the Nagpur Municipal Corporation do not have a provision to do that. Finally, the importance of vaccine awareness was highlighted. Dr Marathe said medical fraternity leaders would be the right choice to spearhead the campaign. “The likes of Dr VK Paul (adviser to the national health commission) and Dr Randeep Guleria (AIIMS director) would be the ideal role models, not Shah Rukh Khan or Amitabh Bachchan,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/better-injected-than-infected-say-experts-on-vaccination/articleshow/80676104.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Chennai||Leak at metro stn creates pool, commuters hassled||Chennai: Even during the dry season, commuters have to deal with leak at Thousand Lights metro station, an issue that hints at poor quality construction. Commuters using the entry point near Spencer’s Plaza have to be on guard for a pool of stagnant water while moving to the ticketing level. This leak was reported more than a year back while leaks from the roofs and walls in underground stations on Anna Salai have been a major issue since the stations were opened in February 2019. However, the problems remain unresolved. A commuter, who on Wednesday took a picture of the stagnant water near the stairs at an entry point in Thousand Lights station, said the tile covering the wall nearby seems to be broken, leaving the inner concrete layers exposed. This, they said, indicated that workers had tried but seemed to be unable to fix the leak. “We were forced to step on the water as there are barricades near the wall that was leaking, leaving very little space for us. We can’t use the escalator nearby as it is only for people leaving the station,” said M Rajan, a commuter. The wall in question ran from the ticketing to the platform level below so there are pools of water on both levels. While barricades were placed at both spots, the station staff said the leak had been an issue since operations began, but they were not aware of its source. In March 2020, some portions of the wall were barricaded due to water seepage. CMRL officials said the contractor who built the station was fixing the snag. Over the last two monsoon seasons, commuters had complained of leaking roofs at stations such as LIC and Nandanam. Last year, CMRL said a team was deployed to spot leaks in stations, but commuters said the issue is yet to be fixed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/leak-at-metro-stn-creates-pool-commuters-hassled/articleshow/80676018.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A senior official with the RTO told TOI that without a permit, two-wheelers cannot operate in the city as bike taxis. “We had prior information about some two-wheelers operating in the city as bike taxi service offered by Uber,” said an RTO official. Deputy RTO Sanjiv Bhor said that Uber will be questioned about the matter. “The company will be asked to explain why and how they started the service in the city without the necessary permissions. The process will be initiated on Thursday. Presently, we cannot comment on whether any fines or penalties will be levied,” he said. An official response from Uber was awaited until the time of going to press. Requesting anonymity, an Uber official said, “We will have to check this.

Bijnor’s superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said, “Narpal alias Sonu, resident of Mauzampur Raipur under Kiratpur police station of Bijnor district, was serving life term after being convicted in a rape and murder case. He escaped from Bareilly Central Jail by scaling the wall on Monday morning.” Inspector General of police, Bareilly zone, had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 on any information leading to Narpal’s arrest.

February 4, 2021||Pune||Forest dept to form dedicated wildlife rescue teams||Pune: The Pune forest circle has decided to form dedicated animal rescue teams at its four divisions — Pune, Junnar, Bhor and Solapur — for carrying out scientific wildlife animal rescue operations.As of now, the forest department is mainly dependent on private NGOs which are equipped with latest material and equipment used in rescue operations. The decision comes in the wake of some recent incidents of wild animals straying into the city limits and villages falling under the jurisdiction of the Pune forest circle. Rahul Patil, the deputy conservator of forest of the Pune division, said the team would be trained by some NGOs and experienced personnel. “We will have a dedicated control room where calls related to wildlife would be attended to and addressed. Besides, our team would be equipped with necessary equipment, protective gears, tranquilising gun and vehicles for carrying out operation in our limits,” he said.The forest department is in the process of procuring drone cameras, tranquilizing guns, trap cameras, etc. “We are chalking out a comprehensive plan of rescue operation for each animal. The team will have 18 to 20 members. We will carry out mock drills every week scientifically. This will come handy while carrying out actual operation,” Patil added.The forest department had to use drone and trap cameras while tracking down the movement of man-eater leopard in Solapur district last year. Dhairyashil Patil, deputy conservator of forests of Solapur division, who led the operation, said, “Use of drone cameras is essential while carrying out operation in difficult terrain or near water bodies that are difficult to access easily. We will train our rescue teams as per the demand of the division.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/forest-dept-to-form-dedicated-wildlife-rescue-teams/articleshow/80677602.cms||Sandip Dighe
February 4, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: CM Arvind Kejriwal vows to trace missing farmers||NEW DELHI: Stepping in to help trace dozens of protesting farmers missing since the Republic Day tractor parade, CM Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said it was the responsibility of every government to find missing people and intimate their families regarding the same. Delhi government has released a list of 115 farmers jailed post the R-Day violence and urged the public to check it for those who are still missing. The farmer unions have claimed that dozens of protesters missing since the violence cannot be traced by their family members. “Many farmer unions reached out to Delhi government and me to trace the missing protesters. I can understand the pain and suffering of those who are unable to connect with their family members and children. Many people were jailed after being arrested for the unfortunate violence on January 26,” said Kejriwal. A delegation of Samyukta Kisan Morcha had met him on Tuesday for the release of the jailed protesters. The list contains name, father’s name, address, date of arrest, police station under whose jurisdiction the arrest was made, FIR number and the IPC sections invoked against the arrested people. “It’s possible that many of those missing were arrested in connection with the chaos at Red Fort and haven’t been able to connect with their families. Those whose family members are missing can scan the list to know if they are among the arrested people. In this way, they will get to know the jail they have been lodged in. I hope many missing people can be traced through this list,” said the CM. Kejriwal assured the farmer leaders that he would try his best to trace the missing if Delhi government received reports even after the list was issued. “If required, I will talk to the lieutenant governor and the central government in this regard,” he added. The farmer leaders had submitted a list of 29 missing youths to the CM on Tuesday and demanded humanitarian facilities to those lodged in the jails. They also demanded the constitution of a medical board and said the investigation would expose the brutality done by police on farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-vows-to-trace-missing-farmers/articleshow/80676044.cms||AlokKNMishra
February 4, 2021||Delhi||Delhi govt nod must for police use of DTC buses||NEW DELHI: With 45 public transport buses getting damaged on January 26 during the farmers’ tractor rally, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has been asked to take the government’s permission before providing buses on hire. On the Republic Day, 40 buses of DTC and five buses of the Cluster Scheme were damaged when protesting farmers deviated from the pre-decided routes for the tractor rally. “Many of these buses were hired by Delhi Police for transportation of its personnel but were also used as barricades to stop protesters. As a result, the buses sustained damages and are being repaired,” a source said. Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot, who is also chairman of the DTC board, has directed that from now on, DTC’s buses can only be provided on “special hire” after approval from Delhi government. A substantial percentage of the DTC fleet of 3,762 buses are provided on hire, including to Delhi Police for transportation of its personnel during security arrangements, said a source. Beside this, Gahlot also confirmed to TOI that Delhi government had directed that Delhi Police could explore other arrangements in view of the damage faced by DTC buses on the Republic Day. In view of the reduced capacity of buses due to strict social distancing measures to fight Covid-19, giving out vehicles on hire reduces the number of buses available for public transport, a source pointed out. “While the DTC fleet size is 3,762, usually up to 3,400 vehicles are deployed for operations, and since January 26 was a national holiday, only 1,975 buses were outshedded as demand was expected to be low,” the source said. Out of these buses, 40 got damaged and these buses belonged to different depots such as Sarojini Nagar, Wazirpur and Ghazipur, he added. “In view of the damage of these buses, only 900 buses were deployed in the evening,” the source said. “DTC has only low-floor buses in its fleet and, apart from their large size, moving these buses is nearly impossible when the engine is off. Probably that is why these are preferred for blocking roads at a short notice,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-nod-must-for-police-use-of-dtc-buses/articleshow/80676139.cms||Sidharatha Roy
February 4, 2021||Nashik||Waste segregation crosses 90%||Nashik: As the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has begun its preparations for the Swachh Survekshan: 2021, conducted by the Union government, the civic administration said the solid waste management in scientific disposal of the garbage has improved in the city.  Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav told TOI the segregation of dry and wet waste at source in the city has crossed 90%. Jadhav said NMC has initiated several measures like raising awareness among city residents, penalising people for not segregating waste at source, etc, which has yielded positive results. According to the solid waste department of the NMC, the segregation of the waste was around 60% around a year ago. The target is to ensure 100% segregation of waste by the end of this year. Jadhav said he has already chaired several meetings and preparations are on to maintain cleanliness in the city. For this year’s survey, the NMC is aiming to be among the top five cleanest cities, he said. “We started the new garbage vans with separate compartments for dry and wet waste in 2015. Since then, we had started the segregation of waste at source but the response was poor initially. We had to create awareness and constantly appeal to the citizens to segregate the waste at source,” said Kalpana Kute, the director of NMC’s solid waste management. “We also penalised the citizens for not segregating the waste into dry and wet. Now, the segregation has increased over 90%,” said Kute. The civic body has penalised 243 erring citizens so far during the current financial year and collected fine of Rs 1.20 lakh. NMC, which is preparing for the Swachh Survekshan: 2021, has improved its cleanliness ranking from 67 in 2019 to 11th rank last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/waste-segregation-crosses-90/articleshow/80677611.cms||Tushar Pawar

The high court (HC) issued notice to Khattar in his capacity as the chairman of Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). While issuing notice, Justice H S Sidhu of the high court also asked the Haryana government to file a compliance report on the issue. The matter has now been fixed for March 24 when chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has to file his reply on the issue. The matter reached the high court in the wake of a petition filed by Haryana City Gas Distribution Ltd seeking initiation of contempt of court proceedings against Khattar for not taking any action on their representation despite directions issued by the high court on September 23, 2020. “The petitioner claims to have made numerous representations to HSVP as regards the issue of allocation of land for setting up CNG stations at Sector 49, Gurugram, the dividing road of Sectors 49 and 50, Gurugram and in certain other sectors in Gurugram. The grievance of the petitioner is that none of the representations of the petitioner have been decided by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran… It is directed that the representations of the petitioner, copies of which are enclosed with the present petition, be decided by the respondent (Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran ) not later than December 1, 2020 and the decision thereon be communicated to the petitioner not later than December 8, 2020. If aggrieved by such a decision, it will be open to the petitioner to seek appropriate remedies in accordance with law,” a division bench of the HC had observed in its order dated September 23. In a contempt plea on Wednesday, the petitioner submitted that despite clear directions by this high court in September last year to decide their representations not later than December 1, 2020, the contemnor (Manohar Lal Khattar) is in clear willful contempt has been sitting over the their representation thereby delaying causing immense financial hardship to the petitioner company who deals in essential services of CNG hence the urgency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-haryana-cm-on-contempt-of-court-plea/articleshow/80677609.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Chandigarh||BJP candidates to contest 1,235 seats||Chandigarh: BJP candidates in Punjab have filed their nomination papers on the party symbol in 1,235 wards of class ‘A’ and ‘B’ municipal corporations for the February 14 municipal bodies’ elections. Punjab BJP general secretary Jeevan Gupta said there are 1,630 wards of class ‘A’ and ‘B’ municipal corporations across the state. “Our party decided to contest the election on party symbol in ‘A’ and ‘B’ class municipal bodies. The party had exempted the candidates willing to contest in the ‘C’ class municipal bodies and nagar panchayats from contesting on party symbol. They were allowed to contest on election symbol on their own choice,” he said. The BJP leader said that candidates were selected by the core committee chaired by the state party president Ashwani Sharma after deliberations with party leaders. He said that the BJP candidates were contesting the municipal bodies’ elections in the entire state fearlessly. Gupta also said although the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government and other party leaders of the ruling Congress were adopting every tactic in order to stop the opposition at any cost by indulging in the murder of democracy, the public was seeing everything and will answer to it in the form of its votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-candidates-to-contest-1235-seats/articleshow/80677604.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Pune||PCMC uses data analytics to streamline water supply||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), which supplies around 500 million litres of water a day (MLD) to its residents, is using data analytics to plug leakages in the system through water meters.While the metering system has been place for more than a decade, the civic body partnered with data analytics firm Cranberry since 2013 to run its water metering and monitoring system using geo-tagged meters, crunching supply data to various “water districts” in real time, and controlling supply to them using water data audits, and also finding leakages in the process.“Using the meter system, we can count the actual amount of water consumed by each society or building, and with the data from water meters, we can also conduct water audits, which is the summation of all water consumed. We can also expand that for each and every water district and compare it to the amount of water supplied in that area. The difference of that would be the non-revenue water, which is either stolen, or goes through non-functional meters, or can also be leakages, and we can address that situation,” said Ramdas Tambe, PCMC’s joint city engineer for water supply, drainage and environment.The firm said the situation they encountered when they started was difficult, with a lack of coordination between department, low revenues, and many disputes.“The water department’s revenue was only around Rs18-Rs20 crores, and there were many metering disputes, non-metered connections, and reports of thefts. We addressed these situations with the help of various PCMC departments, and 15-16,000 unauthorised and non-metered connections were found. A system was then put in place to help people with water meters, and each of them was geo-tagged. On-ground staff, with the help of a mobile app, now capture the meter-reading and bill for each of the societies or buildings on the spot. Within a year, the revenues went up to around Rs33 crore,” said Shishir Thakur, co-founder, Cranberry.Thakur added that the geo-tagged meters and data analytics are also helping to future-proof the area.“If we know how much water is being consumed in an area and if it’s on an upward trend, we can figure out that population is going up in the area. It will give the PCMC an idea about the future water infrastructure needs in that particular area,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-uses-data-analytics-to-streamline-water-supply/articleshow/80677608.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
February 4, 2021||Delhi||Delhi LG appoints team of lawyers for PILs on farmer agitation||NEW DELHI: In a move that may create yet another flashpoint between the Centre and the AAP government, the lieutenant governor on Wednesday appointed a new legal team to represent Delhi Police in all matters relating to the farmers’ agitation before Delhi High Court. Delhi Police has decided to rope in Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to appear for them in all cases relating to the agitation and the protests that rocked the capital on Republic Day. The move comes in the wake of a rash of public interest petitions being filed in connection with the agitation. A letter to DCP (Legal Cell) of the city police from the home department read, “I am directed to convey the approval of Hon’ble Lt Governor, Delhi for the appointment of Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General, SV Raju, ASG, Amit Mahajan, Advocate and Rajat Nair, Advocate to represent Delhi Police in the matter of Dhananjai Jain vs UOI and other PILs, writ petitions related to farmers’ agitation.” The same legal team is representing Delhi Police in the northeast Delhi riots case, with only ASG Raju the new entrant. A day after large-scale violence hit the national capital on Republic Day, petitions started getting filed in the Delhi high court on the issue. The one by Jain sought to remove people squatting under the garb of farmers’ agitation and clear all the roads and public places while also seeking a direction to remove the Delhi Police commissioner from his position with immediate effect and punish all the police officers who allegedly failed in discharging their duties relating to the Red Fort incident. On Tuesday, the high court had rejected a PIL demanding immediate release of all those arrested or detained after the Republic Day agitation. Some other petitions are likely to come up for hearing later this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-appoints-team-of-lawyers-for-pils-on-farmer-agitation/articleshow/80676053.cms||Abhinav Garg
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Banyan at Chowpatty junction axed to ‘clear view of hoardings’||MUMBAI: A massive banyan tree was illegally hacked at Girgaum chowpatty on Wednesday allegedly to clear the view for commercial hoardings at the traffic junction. After locals complained, the BMC filed a written complaint at MRA Marg police station, stating that the tree was hacked illegally to clear the view for commercial hoardings. BMC has asked the police to book the advertising firms that hacked the tree. The tree stood at Tambe Chowk while the billboards are erected on the terrace of New Sriniketan Building and an adjacent petrol pump. TimesViewThe hacking of a fully grown tree at Girgaum Chowpatty is an example of how people hack trees with impunity in the city. While the BMC has filed a police complaint after locals and activists raised an alarm, BMC should have prevented the brazen hacking of a tree in such a prime area. The incident highlights that tree protection laws are not taken seriously since there is no action from BMC and the police. The BMC must cancel the licence of the hoarding owners if the tree were hacked to clear the view for the hoarding.Green activists said that the fully grown tree was over two decades old and was hacked under the guise of trimming. Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said he had spoken to the police and that the culprits would not be spared. “...It has been illegally hacked by someone and those culprits won’t be spared, whoever it is. I have spoken to Jt CP L&O Vishwas Nangre Patil and Asst Comm Prashant Gaikwad. We will act strongly,” Aaditya tweeted. “A majestic banyan Tree has been hacked at Chowpatty, Mumbai, so that signboards get better visibility... The majestic Banyan tree was mercilessly hacked this morning at Chowpatty Signal, by BMC, in the guise of ‘trimming’... ” green activist Zoru Bhathena tweeted on Wednesday. According to BMC norms, permission from BMC’s Tree Authority is needed to hack any tree. BMC gave a written complaint and asked the police to register an offence under sections 8 and 21 of Maharashtra Preservation of Trees Act, 1971. BMC’s junior tree officer who filed the complaint told the police that the hacking was a serious offence and police must take action. South Mumbai resident Dr Anahita Pundole had complained to BMC. “No BMC official was on site. Workers hacked the most beautiful banyan tree which has withstood every storm at the traffic light at Chowpatty. It was an iconic tree. The workers had no permission letter and there was not a single official from BMC’s D ward office to monitor this so-called trimming of the tree. This tree has been cut in the past to increase visibility of hoardings for the traffic coming from Marine Drive to Chowpatty,” Dr Pundole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/banyan-at-chowpatty-junction-axed-to-clear-view-of-hoardings/articleshow/80673636.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Sidhu, a Punjabi actor-turned-activist; Jugraj, Gurjot and Gurjant allegedly either hoisted flags at Red Fort or were involved in the act. Investigating officials have identified them on the basis of mobile video clippings and CCTV footage. At least 200 experts from National Forensic Science Laboratory have been roped in to help police with evidence. Another suspect, Dharmendra Singh Herman, who was allegedly instigating the crowd to unfurl the flag while sitting atop his car, was arrested by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police on Wednesday. He was also telecasting the assault live on social media. Delhi Police had given permission for a tractor rally to the farmers protesting against the central farm laws, but many of the protesters did not stick to the routes and hundreds of tractors ended up at the Red Fort. Officials privy to the investigations said Jugraj had hoisted a religious flag and a farmer union one atop the fort. Many protesters had even climbed up the domes and damaged the property inside, including scanning machines. A video of security personnel jumping into the fort ditch as protesters clashed with them had also gone viral on social media. So far, at least 123 people have been arrested and 44 cases registered in connection with the violence across the capital. Even as police officials carried out raids in Punjab and Bihar, Sidhu recently posted a video on social media, in which he said he had left everything behind for the protest. “What wrong did I do? I left my work, my relations and came to support you in your fight. I was raising a voice for you all, now I have been labelled as a traitor...” Claiming that there were five lakh people at the Red Fort, but only he was called a traitor, Sidhu added, “Did I carry people on my back and bring them? I am not bothered by what the government thinks, but I am hurt about what you all are thinking.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-police-announces-cash-reward-of-rs-1-lakh-on-deep-sidhu-and-others/articleshow/80676063.cms||---

Industry and commerce minister Sunder Sham Arora said some industrial units missed the chance to claim the sanctioned subsidy under various industrial policies due to its closure or for any other reasons. The minister said that eligible industrial units can claim their sanctioned subsidy request after checking the waiting list published by the department on the website pbindustries.gov.in and mail it to br.incentive@gmail.com or through concerned general manager of district industries centers. Out of the total 1,500 closed units, the government has decided the cases of first 400 units on the basis of seniority, out of which 123 eligible units have been allotted the sanctioned amount of subsidy, said Arora. In 2017, about 1,500 closed units had arrears of Rs 100 crore. In view of the efforts and promises made by the state government from time to time, a subsidy of about Rs 30 crore has been disbursed since 2017 and payments have been made to around 500 units, he added.

February 4, 2021||Chandigarh||Thakur inaugurates Swarnim Vatika||Shimla: As part of celebrations of 50 years of full statehood of Himachal Pradesh, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Wednesday planted a cherry blossom tree, commonly known as Pajja, at Kareru forest near Shimla and inaugurated the year-long celebrations by the forest department to establish the Swarnim Vatikas in the state. He said forest department has taken the initiative to establish ‘Swarnim Vatikas’ in each assembly constituency to commemorate 50 years. CM Thakur said this would create aesthetic spots for people to relax and enjoy as well as get them educated regarding significance of nature and its conservation. He said that this initiative would also enhance forest cover of the state and would sensitise and educate the people of the urban and semi urban community about the importance of forests and its conservation by involving them in the plantation activities. Urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj said local community, especially the people living in urban and semi-urban areas, need to be associated with the causes of environment and forests. Forest minister Rakesh Pathania said at least 68 Swarnim Vatika would be established in the state this year.

February 4, 2021||Chandigarh||Off in Hry, Mahila Police Volunteer Scheme set for take-off in 5 states||Chandigarh: The Mahila Police Volunteer Scheme, which was discontinued in Haryana around two years back after being launched as pilot project despite its success, is now going to be initiated by the Centre in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Mizoram, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka. According to the budget plan, it is likely to be extended to other states as well. Haryana had been awaiting the Union government’s nod for the past over two years for extension of the scheme in the state, especially in view of the rise in crime against women cases in the state at an alarming rate. In 2020, Haryana saw 13,481 cases, including 2,697 kidnappings and 216 cases of rape attempts. The scheme was launched as a pilot project in Karnal and Mahendragarh districts of the state in December 2016. Following this, 967 women registered as police volunteers in both districts and were paid an honorarium of Rs 1,000 per month until the centrally-funded project ended in 2018. According to the scheme, one to three women volunteers, depending upon the size of village, were attached with a police station of that area. Besides generating awareness about crime against women, these volunteers used to share information related to crime and act as facilitators for the villagers, especially for the women folk who were chary of approaching the police. "This two-year pilot project yielded good results. We had sought an extension, but the Centre informed us about its implementation across the country. We are hopeful of its revival in the state,’’ said Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) Kala Ram Chandaran, who heads the Crime Against Women wing of Haryana police and was monitoring the project Enquiries in the two Haryana districts showed that the scheme was well accepted and appreciated. "Their (volunteers) presence in village was an added advantage for the panchayat. At times they were even included in meetings to settle disputes of villagers. The volunteer of our village had little work but her presence was important,’’ said Sinil Kumar, sarpanch of Kaimla village. An inspector posted in Karnal district, who had 60 such women volunteers under his police station, said they acted as a link between police and villagers. “Timely reaction of police is the most important factor when it comes to effective policing. Hence, this system was really helpful, especially in remote villages. Presence of these volunteers saved our efforts and time in many cases. If the disputes were not serious, we would ask the volunteer to go there and brief us,’’ said the cop. Sunita Rani, a private teacher who had signed up as a volunteer for Bastali village of Nissing police station of Karnal, rued the fact that the scheme was discontinued. “It was a platform for women to serve society. We worked for closure of sale of illicit liquor outlets and ran a women awareness campaign,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/off-in-hry-mahila-police-volunteer-scheme-set-for-take-off-in-5-states/articleshow/80677616.cms||Manvir Saini
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena ambition behind BMC desire to be sole plan body||MUMBAI: In a major indication that the Shiv Sena is looking to expand its presence in the city and regain control of the various administrative agencies, municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal on Wednesday announced that the BMC would request the state government to notify the BMC as the single planning authority for the city. On the powers that would be vested with the BMC if it were allowed to become the single planning authority for the city, Chahal said that the municipal corporation would in such a case be the one to decide on land use. If the state government accepts the proposal, then the BMC would become the only agency in the city and powers of other agencies like the MMRDA, Mhada, MIDC and MSRDC, which executive projects worth hundreds of crores each year, will be diverted to the BMC. “These authorities are authorised to plan the development of the layouts in their possession. There is no control of the BMC on these authorities while the BMC is providing all infrastructural facilities. This leads to loss of revenue to the BMC and, citizens have to suffer any obstacles,” Chahal said. “It is felt necessary and advisable that the BMC should be the single planning authority, which will facilitate speedy development and also solve the problems with regard to infrastructural facilities of citizens residing in these layouts, under one roof. Considering the pros and cons of this decision, the BMC is requesting the state government to reconsider its earlier decision and appoint the BMC as the single planning authority,” Chahal said. Political analysts said that the Congress-NCP government led by the late Vilasrao Deshmukh had diverted key projects to the MMRDA to downsize the BMC which has been controlled by the Shiv Sena for close to three decades. “The Congress-NCP and later, after 2014, the BJP controlled the state government while the Shiv Sena has always been in power in the BMC. In fact, the Shiv Sena’s main focus has been in the BMC and it draws all its power from there. So over a period of time, various state governments tried to take away more powers and financial resources from the BMC and divert them to other agencies,” a former municipal commissioner said. While the MMRDA is carrying out major infrastructure projects in the city, including metro projects, other agencies like the MSDRC and the MIDC are also planning authorities. Besides, all slum redevelopment projects are regulated and controlled by the SRA. In 2018, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had notified Mhada as a planning authority for all future government housing schemes in the city and its surrounding metropolitan region. “The Shiv Sena is in power now, but this is not the Shiv Sena’s main power centre. The party will use its position in the state government to restore the BMC’s status as the main planning authority in the city. This is a political move more than an administrative move. This is also a way to get more funds for the BMC since a large chunk of funds are being used by the SRA, the MMDRA and other agencies,” the former municipal commissioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sena-ambition-behind-bmc-desire-to-be-sole-plan-body/articleshow/80677731.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
February 4, 2021||Delhi||At 40.2%, Delhi's lowest Covid vaccine turnout||NEW DELHI: While the frontline workers will start getting vaccinated from Thursday, Delhi on Wednesday reported its lowest turnout for vaccination at 40.2%. Out of the 18,300 healthcare personnel who were to get the shot, 7,365 turned up across 183 vaccination centres. However, only 17 people reported adverse events. Explaining the dip, an official said the government had increased the number of vaccination centres from 106 to 183 a day ago and many healthcare workers could not have reached the new centres. “Initially the employees of the hospital where a vaccination centre was established were getting the shot. It resulted into higher turnout as healthcare workers managed to get sometime off their duty to get it,” the official said, adding that a large number of the staffers at many such hospitals has been vaccinated. The turnout has been dipping since touching a high of 91.5% over a week ago. “Opening the vaccination for the frontline workers is likely to push the turnout up,” said an official. In some of the centres like the one at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, some frontline workers were inoculated on Wednesday too. Delhi Police and civil defence personnel, and sanitation workers are among the frontline workers fighting Covid-19. Out of around 6 lakh frontline workers in the capital, around 3.5 lakh have registered for the shot. Over 81,000 of them have already been vaccinated. On Tuesday, too, the vaccination turnout stood at 51%, though the number of centres has been increased to accommodate more and more healthcare workers. The turnout has not touched even 85% since the government increased the number of vaccination centres from 81 to 106. Each centre is supposed to inoculate 100 healthcare workers every day. As part of the upscaling plan, the government slowly wants to increase the number of vaccination centres. Only 17 adverse events were reported across 11 districts on Wednesday, with Central reporting four cases and South East and West districts, three each. New Delhi, North East, North West and South West districts did not report even a single adverse event. As the vaccinated healthcare workers started, directly and indirectly, inspiring many of their colleagues who were in two minds, the turnout in Delhi rose from 53% on the first day of the drive to 91.5% before starting to decline again. To improve the turnout and the reach, the government has now decided to run the vaccination drive on six days a week, instead of four days. A health department official said hospitals had been asked to encourage healthcare workers to turn out for getting the shot. “Overall, the number of healthcare workers turning out at many of the newly opened vaccination centres is on the lower side. We hope that in a couple of days, these centres will also start witnessing a growth in turnout,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-40-2-citys-lowest-vax-turnout/articleshow/80677684.cms||AlokKNMishra
February 4, 2021||Chennai||Health workers can’t sign up anymore, says Tamil Nadu on day 10,500 took vaccine||CHENNAI: On the day the state vaccinated 10,476 people – the highest number in the vaccine drive that began on Jan 16 – public health officials announced they would not offer the vaccine to people whose names are not on the centralised Cowin portal. The portal is no longer open for registering names of healthcare providers but names of frontline workers can be uploaded till February 7. This means, if clinical establishments in the state have not handed over names of all their staff to the local health authorities, they may no longer be on the priority list. Until now, healthcare providers who were not listed on the portal were given the vaccine after which their names were added to the portal. “This can’t be done anymore,” said joint director (immunisation) Dr K Vinay Kumar, who spearheads the immunisation drive in the state. “We are making last ditch attempts to collect the names of doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and other hospital workers so they can once again request the Centre to add their names to the portal,” he said. Until Wednesday, the state had enlisted 5.62 lakh healthcare providers on the portal against its estimate of 6 lakh. Meanwhile, the state is sourcing names of employees in home, local administration and revenue department from across the state. “All beneficiaries will receive messages about the venue and time a day before the schedule. But if people walk in before they receive these messages, we still give them the vaccine as long as their names are on the portal,” Dr Vinay said. On Wednesday, the recipient tally in the state moved to 1,30,943. Of these, 2,213 people are frontline workers who began taking the vaccine since Tuesday. In an attempt to boost attendance, the public health department added 55 more vaccination centres, taking the total number of centres in the state to 400 and opened 465 sessions. With this, the state could have vaccinated 46,500 people on Wednesday but by 6.30pm, 10,313 people took Covishield and 163 Covaxin. Vaccination officers at the six centres where Covaxin is offered say the hesitancy towards the indigenous vaccine seemed higher. Of the 1.3 lakh recipients, 2,945 people have opted for Covaxin, though the state had the capacity to vaccinate more than one lakh people. “Our target is just 600 a day across the state, while the target for Covishield has increased from 16,000 to 45,900 in the past 18 days. We were able to meet 27% of the target. Covishield vaccinators say they have met about 32% of the target. In absolute numbers, they are way ahead,” said a vaccination officer from Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/health-workers-cant-sign-up-anymore-says-state-on-day-10500-took-vaccine/articleshow/80676091.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Cops crack down on ‘propaganda on internet to incite violence’||NEW DELHI: A 29-year-old man was arrested for allegedly circulating an old video and spreading fake news of 200 police personnel resigning from their job. Another person was apprehended from Bharatpur in Rajasthan for allegedly spreading fake news. While four cases have been filed against several social media accounts, cops have sent requests to the respective online platforms to get the offensive and unlawful posts removed. The arrested man, Om Prakash Dhetarwal, is a resident of Churu in Rajasthan. Several other people indulging in similar activities have been identified and they may be arrested soon. Police have also sent notices to four people asking them to join the investigation. Action will be taken against them based on their deposition. Delhi Police PRO DCP Chinmoy Biswal said, “The accounts and handles through which the fake, offensive and provocative content was posted, have been escalated to the platforms concerned to get their basic subscriber information. We have also sought removal of the posts. Citizens are advised to avoid sharing or posting any fake news and unverified content on social media.” Biswal added that despite over 500 police personnel getting injured during the violence on January 26 by rampaging mobs, fake news was being spread about incidents of cops opening fire on the protesters. “We came across fake news about resignation by 200 police personnel in support of the farmers’ protest, which can spread disaffection in the rank and file of Delhi Police. Old images and videos of law and order action unrelated to the current situation in Delhi are being peddled to generate resentment against the administration,” said the DCP. Police claimed that public safety measures, such as barricading and preventive steps, including restrictions on internet in affected hotspots, was being projected as preparation for a large-scale crackdown. Bogus claims causing disrepute about bona fide legal processes, such as autopsy reports generated by a medical board, were also being noticed. “Several social media accounts are being used to push a false and alarming narrative without any user bio, which is generally observed in bot accounts. Many attachments in social media posts were found to be manipulated and the same was being pushed in the guise of news reports,” said Biswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-crack-down-on-propaganda-on-net-to-incite-violence/articleshow/80676072.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Delhi||AAP targets BJP, Congress over farmers’ stir on Delhi borders||NEW DELHI: AAP MP Sanjay Singh on Wednesday claimed that “Congress had made a backdoor deal with BJP to not raise the issue of farmers’ protest aggressively inside the Parliament.” In a presser, the AAP functionary said that when AAP MPs were marshalled out from the Rajya Sabha, Congress remained a mute spectator. He asked the party to disclose its stand on the farmers’ protest. “In the Rajya Sabha today, AAP was the only party, which demanded discussion on farmers’ issues before all and also demanded immediate rollback of the laws. BJP is unable to see the pain of these poor farmers,” Singh said, adding that Rajya Sabha chairman and LOP Ghulam Nabi Azad took a stand against AAP MPs. Delhi Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt said that AAP and BJP had reached a secret deal on the farmers’ issue. “Delhi government provided dozens of buses to police to create barriers to prevent farmers from taking out the tractor rally and it continues to provide buses for erecting barriers,” said Dutt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-targets-bjp-cong-over-farmers-stir/articleshow/80676098.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Jaipur||In 2nd phase, Rajasthan revenue dept employees to get vaccine today||JAIPUR: Sticking to the Centre’s guidelines on Covid-19 vaccination which gives priority to various categories of beneficiaries, the state health department is all set to launch its second phase of the drive on Thursday by vaccinating revenue department officials, who number about 22,520, first. Healthcare workers, who were covered in the first phase, will still receive priority in the second phase Vaccination sites are being set across the state for revenue officers. In Jaipur, the department will organise 67 sites for vaccinating frontline workers and healthcare workers simultaneously. “The messages have already been sent to frontline workers to be prepared for vaccination. They have been informed about their scheduled sessions on Thursday,” said chief medical health officer, Jaipur-I, who was inoculated on Wednesday. The department has included health workers in the second phase as some 33% of them are yet to receive the jab. If they are willing, they can get vaccinated at the sites. According to the department report, 3,63,521 healthcare workers have been vaccinated, which is 67% of the target set for the category. “We have received 1,77,340 Covaxin doses today and will get another 1,31,260 doses of Covishield on Thursday morning,” said Raghuraj Singh, state nodal officer (immunisation). But Wednesday was not an encouraging day for the drive, as only 24,303 beneficiaries from the targeted 58,581 turned up for vaccination. The single-day turnout percentage stood at 42%. Overall, the cumulative target remained at 67%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/in-2nd-phase-raj-revenue-dept-employees-to-get-vaccine-today/articleshow/80677744.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Kolkata||75% queue up for jabs in three Kolkata hospitals on Covaxin rollout day||KOLKATA: Covaxin rolled out in Bengal on Wednesday with senior health officials, including National Health Mission (NHM) director, Saumitra Mohan, director medical education (DME), Debasis Bhattacharyya and NHM project director, Smita Sanyal Sukla, taking the jab at IPGMER. The first day of the rollout from three centres in Kolkata — RG Kar Medical College, IPGMER (SSKM) and Medical College Kolkata — saw 45 recipients being vaccinated against a target of 60. The three centres had a target of at least 20 recipients each. While RG Kar Medical College vaccinated 32, IPGMER (SSKM) inoculated 13. Medical College Kolkata did not open a single vial as they did not get sufficient number of people to be vaccinated. “Most of the recipients in our site on Wednesday were doctors. From Thursday, we are planning to offer the Covaxin option to those who come to take Covishield,” said an administrator at RG Kar Medical College. While 436 recipients got the Covishield shot from four sites at IPGMER, only 13 healthcare workers took Covaxin from the lone session site. A few others who had come later were asked to report on Thursday as the authorities didn’t want to waste the other vial (containing 20 doses of the vaccine). “As per protocols, a vial has to be discarded four hours since it is opened. So, we could vaccinate 13 people in the first four hours. Two more beneficiaries turned up later but we didn’t want to waste so many doses of the vaccine by opening a fresh vial and have asked them to come the next day,” said an official of SSKM Hospital. Sayantan Mazumdar, a junior doctor who took Covaxin at IPGMER believes that people’s apprehension about Covaxin will ease off soon. Santanu Tripathi, an expert clinical pharmacologist and vaccinology advisor to Bengal government, said, “There is some reservation about its efficacy. But in the early phase of studies, its immunogenicity has been found to be adequately reassuring. Therefore it is unlikely to be not offering the desired protection.” Sources at the three medical colleges said the decision of Covaxin rollout was taken on Tuesday morning, so they did not get enough time to mobilise the recipients. “We could mobilise only seven persons overnight to take the Covaxin shot. A vial contains 20 doses. If we had opened it, 13 doses could have been wasted. We are trying to mobilise more people through the community medicine department,” said an official at Medical College Kolkata. Meanwhile on Wednesday morning, 44 boxes of Covaxin reached the Kolkata airport in an Air India flight from Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/75-queue-up-for-jabs-in-3-kol-hosps-on-covaxin-rollout-day/articleshow/80676107.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

February 4, 2021||Chennai||Budget makes room for Chennai rail network to grow||CHENNAI: With the Centre loosening purse strings for certain projects of the Southern Railway, the zone will be able to expedite projects already underway in the city, including doubling work along Beach-Korukkupet, Beach-Athipet, Tambaram-Chengalpet-Villupuram lines. The Centre sanctioned Rs 5 crore for Beach-Korukkupet line, Rs 40 crore for Beach-Athipet line and Rs 2 crore for Tiruvallur-Arakkonam line. Sources said the funds would help expand railway infrastructure in and around Chennai, which will mean more suburban trains and long-distance passenger trains, all without affecting traffic on the mainline. The budget, however, does not offer much scope to expand the railway network in the state as the allocation for new lines, including sanctioned work, is meagre to the extent of Rs 1,000 just to keep them alive. For instance, the new project line, Tiruvallur-Arakkonam - 4th line (26.83km), has been sanctioned Rs Rs1,000. Lines such as Tindivanam-Gingee-Tiruvannamalai, Tindivanam-Nagari, Athipattu-Puttur, Erore-Palani, Chennai-Cuddalore (via Mamallapuram), Sriperumbudur-Guduvancherry and Morappur-Dharmapuri too received meagre allocation to keep the projects alive. An official said projects that were under construction and those on the verge of completion have been sanctioned the maximum funds. The zone did not get much funds for new lines that were sanctioned or included in the budget over the past five years or more. Money is being allotted in such a way to quickly finish work that is already nearing completion and for priority work required for expansion of railway lines in the state. The new lines would get the required funds when work progresses, while the current allocation must be for surveys and preliminary work, said another official. Officials, however, said the current budget allocation is also not much. “It means that it will take decades for the ongoing work to get completed,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/budget-makes-room-for-city-rail-network-to-grow/articleshow/80676150.cms||---

However, he remained non-committal about the continuation of the party’s alliance for the assembly election. Prabhakaran’s ambiguous stand comes days after his mother Premalatha took a similar stand when she told reporters, “The alliance stands as of now.” Asked whether it would be “wise” for the DMDK to continue in the AIADMK-led alliance when there was “confusion in the party” in the wake of V K Sasikala’s release from Bengaluru prison, Prabhakaran said, “Only time will tell.” He added, “Sasikala madam is yet to return to Chennai. She should take care of her health and look into other issues.” On the possibility of his party aligning with the DMK, he said, “We don’t rule out joining hands with anyone concerned about the welfare of the people.” He said Vijayakant was bold enough to form a third front if people wanted change and supported the cause.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vijayakants-son-says-dmdk-not-decided-on-alliance-with-aiadmk/articleshow/80677700.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Nashik||NMC looks to increase cell tower tax revenue||Nashik: The town planning department of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has claimed that it is incurring a loss of about Rs 10 crore every year as it is not getting taxes from mobile towers that have been put up on different buildings across the city. There are over 200 mobile towers across the six divisions and according to the town planning department, they are currently getting a revenue of Rs 1 to Rs 2 crore, but they should be getting around Rs 10 crore a year. Taking note of the huge revenue loss, the civic body has now decided to appoint an agency that will be entrusted with the responsibility of finding out the exact number of mobile towers in the city, their locations, whether taxes are being paid by the mobile companies and also collecting taxes on behalf of the civic body. The civic body is facing a manpower shortage due to which it can’t undertake the activity on its own. “The agency concerned will give permission to the mobile towers and will also collect taxes from them. We are expecting a rise in revenue through mobile towers after deployment of the agency,” Raju Aher, executive engineer of the town planning department of NMC, said. Meanwhile, the civic body has already floated a tender for deployment of private agencies to conduct technical surveys of the mobile towers in the city and collect revenue from the mobile towers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-looks-to-increase-cell-tower-tax-revenue/articleshow/80677733.cms||Tushar Pawar
February 4, 2021||Delhi||Concrete walls, spikes on internal roads to thwart protesters at Tikri||NEW DELHI: Farmers agitating at Tikri border said on Wednesday that they would not resume talks with the central government until all missing farmers were traced and electricity and water supply restored at the protest sites. Charanjeet Singh, Shri Muktsar Sahib district president of All India Kisan Sabha, said this was the unanimous decision of all the farmers’ unions at Singhu border. “Many of our members are missing and the unions are making all effort to find them, including through correspondence/meetings with Delhi Police and government officials,” said Singh. “The central government is also trying to suppress the movement by cutting electricity and water supply. This is unfair and we will not resume talks unless these issues are addressed.” The farmers at Tikri also formed a seven-member legal committee to talk with the Centre and Delhi Police on behalf of families whose members were missing after the tractor rally of January 26. Prem Singh Bhangu, convenor of the legal panel, said, “We are trying to figure out the exact number of people in judicial or police custody and those still untraced. Our IT cell is also spreading awareness about the legal committee through social media. We met Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday and requested him to demand a judicial inquiry into the matter through a retired high court judge and to write to the Union home ministry about this.” In the rear of the protest dais at Singhu, three advocates are fielding queries from families and helping them with contacts. The panel is also working on bail for the farmers in police custody since January 26. On Wednesday, Delhi Police extended its security measures at Tikri border, including erection of a concrete wall and installing of spikes on the road, by barricading the internal roads too. Entry was allowed from select roads for two-wheelers and pedestrians only, causing a lot of inconvenience to the local residents. Internet services continued to be suspended. “Till January 26, we could at least bring our two wheelers here,” complained grocer Pawan Bansal, resident of Bahadurgarh in Haryana. “I now have to take Delhi Metro or public transport and walk to some extent. This wastes a lot of my time.” Rajesh, a Rohtak resident, similarly pointed to the two concrete slabs that now allowed only a two-wheeler or two people to use the lane in front of his footwear shop. “The situation has not only affected my sales, but also made commuting problematic,” he said. “After 5.30pm, there’s a traffic jam and people fight with each other even to cross the road.” The farmers at Tikri, meanwhile, claimed that though the Centre might have put up fortifications to stop their entry into Delhi, they would hold a 'chakka jam' in and around Delhi on February 6. “We are carrying out our protest peacefully, but police have unnecessarily created a ruckus by installing loud speakers near the dais to create disturbance,” said Satpal Singh, a farmer from Shri Muktsar Sahib district, Punjab. “We will anyhow carry out the chakka jam as decided to express our anger against the anti-farmers' laws and demand their repeal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/concrete-walls-spikes-on-internal-roads-to-thwart-protesters-at-tikri/articleshow/80676147.cms||Vibha Sharma

Her son received a message seeking help on his phone from her number,” said a police official. Villagers, however, told the police that Rathod did not know how to read or write so it is suspected that somebody else may have sent the message.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-panchayat-member-killed/articleshow/80674705.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: IPS officer files defamation complaint against Arnab Goswami||MUMBAI: An IPS officer of the city police has submitted a criminal defamation complaint against Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami, Goswami’s wife and the channel’s director Samyabrata Ray Goswami and ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, owner of Republic Media Network, for making allegedly disparaging remarks against him and Mumbai police in connection with the probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The plea, submitted by 2007 batch officer Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police (zone lX), urged the sessions court to take cognisance of offences relating to defamation and common intention and direct the accused to pay compensation and litigation costs. Referring to Arnab Goswami, the plea said freedom of speech and expression and freedom of press was not an absolute right and “was clothed with a sense of responsibility which the accused is duly accountable in law when he strays as a habitual offender.” It said the accused have “cunningly hidden behind the “nation wants to know” rhetoric to make their statements and get away from consequences of their wrongdoing.” Trimukhe had been granted sanction for the complaint by the state home department on October 23. Rajput’s death on June 14 last year was first probed by Bandra police. Trimukhe was the DCP supervising the inquiry. The probe was later taken over by the CBI on the SC’s orders. The plea said Arnab Goswami had made malicious and defamatory statements, which were telecast on his channel Republic Bharat and later published on its YouTube channel on August 7. “The same purports to be a panel discussion pertaining to the phone records of Rhea Chakraborty, in connection to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput. However, far from being a discussion conscribed by journalistic ethos, the defamatory telecast has accused breaking into a tirade of defamatory statements against the complainant (Trimukhe),” the plea said. It further said this was done with an intention to not just drag Trimukhe’s name “through the mud, but also cast aspersions on the conduct of Mumbai police.” “The averments also impute that Mumbai Police, and specifically the complainant (since his image was flashed for almost the entirety of the show) are actively helping Rhea Chakraborty (actor and Rajput’s girlfriend at the time of his death) in evading arrest and on how to go about destroying any evidence of alleged wrongdoings,” the plea said. The plea further alleged that graphics used throughout the show, along with Trimukhe’s name and picture, was a clear and deliberate attempt to “impute” that he was guilty of abusing his position as DCP to help perpetrators get away. The plea stated that allegations to the effect that “Mumbai Police is the greatest obstacle in Sushant’s path to justice” were defamatory. It added Goswami and his accomplices had sought to create an impression that instead of overseeing the investigation properly, Trimukhe was involved with the alleged accused as part of a larger conspiracy to scuttle it. The plea said these were false allegations. Naming a Twitter handle which, the plea claimed, belonged to Arnab, it alleged he had published several defamatory tweets and recirculated contents of the telecast to a larger audience. Trimukhe’s plea said the contents had caused severe prejudice to his reputation, goodwill and career and deep distress to his colleagues, juniors and family members. A statement by one of the legal advisors of Republic TV said, “Our initial reading of the defamation complaint is that the DCP refers to tweets from a fake Twitter handle impersonating Arnab. It is amusing that such a grave error has been made. Mr Goswami is not on social media… On the other parts, the Republic Media Network will respond legally, as per due process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ips-officer-files-defamation-complaint-against-goswami/articleshow/80676160.cms||Rebecca Samervel
February 4, 2021||Delhi||March turns into a sit-in as citizens run into police wall in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Perhaps the police presence to oversee the Citizens March for Farmers to Jantar Mantar on Wednesday was disproportionate to the number of protesters, but the low turnout in no way lessened the dismay of the participants at the fortification of the road space in Singhu and Ghazipur borders to deter the agitating farmers from reaching Delhi. While the march was called by left-wing student groups, sympathetic citizens also joined in. At 12.30pm, members of All India Students’ Association, Students’ Federation of India, National Students’ Union of India and Krantikari Yuva Sanghathan gathered at Barakhamba Road circle to march to Jantar Mantar. The organisations claimed that since colleges were only functioning online, students weren’t present in Delhi, accounting for the low turnout. When the protesters were about to begin their march, the Mandi House roundabout was barricaded and police asked them to disperse as they did not have the permission for the event. Engineering student Adira from Bihar was taken aback. “How can the cops stop us like this? I am a citizen of India and as a citizen, I can be here to support the protesting farmers,” the student said. Sasha Virk, a Delhiite who studies in California, USA, claimed to have expected police to stop the march. “Most of us are just students and are facing police armed with batons,” Virk said. “But I am an army officer's daughter and am not scared of the police. My father served this country and I know what is happening to the farmers is unconstitutional.” Many who came for the protest were concerned at the force being used to prevent the farmers’ protest, including the erection of concrete walls and installing of road spikes at the border crossings. Sanjeev Kumar, a tuition teacher, came with his family from Rohini for the march. Complaining that the police measures were creating “a sense of fear in citizens”, he said there was an attempt to defame and disrupt the farmers’ movement against the central farm laws. Satinder Singh, who wanted the organisers to avoid political party flags, said, “I have been regularly going to the Singhu and Ghazipur borders as well. Wherever there is a protest on the rights of farmers, I will go there.” Students Karan and Navjot also said they did not subscribe to any political ideology, but only wanted to support the farmers. The duo run a YouTube channel in which they “attempt to showcase facts about the farmers’ protest”. Navjot added, “As turbaned youths, the two of us are hearing negative comments from the public and police, which is a sad thing. But we are not scared and want the new farm laws repealed.” The sit-in by the protesters at the roundabout continued till the evening after many decided to stay put and raise slogans and give speeches against the farm laws. Kanwalpreet Kaur, head of Delhi AISA, declared that while the cops did not allow them permission to protest on Wednesday, “we will be back and will continue to express our dissent every week”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/march-turns-into-a-sit-in-as-citizens-run-into-police-wall/articleshow/80676120.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
February 4, 2021||Pune||Pune cops launch major offensive against vehicle vandalism||PUNE: The city police have started issuing written warnings to known offenders, besides carrying out combing operations in slum pockets to flush out miscreants, as a part of an exercise to check the rise in instances of vehicle vandalism. The police have also decided to book such offenders under more stringent legal provisions such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, offences of extortion, robbery and issuance of threats, as the case may be. Till date, these offenders were usually booked for the offence of mischief. A total of 58 cases of vehicle vandalism was registered in 2020 and in January this year. Nearly 178 people were arrested in these cases. “Most of the arrested were young men between the ages of 18 and 20 years, who did not even realize what they were doing but were driven by factors like running feud between two groups, a dare to enter and damage properties in another group’s area, establishing dominance in localities and terrorizing local shopkeepers for extortion or robbing them of money. Many of these men are school-dropouts,” said DCP (Crime) Bachchan Singh. Securing statements against these troublemakers remains a challenge and the police are now taking affected individuals into confidence to ensure that they record their statements and bring the culprits to justice. “We are checking the men who were previously involved in vehicle vandalism cases and have summoned them for questioning. In certain cases, we found that a few young men were repeatedly involved in vehicle vandalism. Crime branch officials, as well as local police officials, are questioning these men,” said Singh. The crime branch and local police officials have summoned the men involved in vandalism and are issuing written warnings asking them to refrain from participating in such activities. The police have prepared a list 350 such offenders, including 20 repeat-offenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-launch-major-offensive-against-vehicle-vandalism/articleshow/80676133.cms||---

Percentage-wise Nandurbar district registered its best performance till date even as Dhule registered a dip. However, Ahmednagar continued to remain at the bottom of the chart. In Ahmednagar, 1,878 doses were administered on Wednesday, but the percentage dropped given the fact that the target was increased from 2,900 to 3,600 as more vaccination centres have been opened in remote areas. Nashik district saw 1,492 people getting the vaccination as against the target of 1,900 — reduced from the earlier target of 2,500. In the district, Indira Gandhi Hospital in Nashik city administered jabs to 247 people as against its target of 200. In Nandurbar, 620 people got the shots as against its target of 700 with the centres at District Hospital and sub-district in Taloda registering 125 and 110 vaccinations, respectively.Jalgaon district also saw an increase in the number of people getting vaccinated. On Wednesday 1,049 people got the vaccination, beating the previous best figure of 867.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/5479-get-vax-in-nashik-division-on-wednesday/articleshow/80677755.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Rs 750 crore fillip for cash-strapped BEST, Mumbai to get more AC buses||MUMBAI: More than 25 lakh daily BEST commuters can now expect more AC buses with the BMC announcing a financial package of Rs 750 crore in its budget—which includes wet-leasing new buses, improving commuter experience, depot modernisation and intelligent transport management system for higher frequency of services. The budget also announced that the BMC will appoint a consultant to bring reforms to increase efficiency levels in the undertaking, keeping commuters in mind. “The BMC, which allocated Rs 918 crore last year, has once again given priority to commuters and public transport system in Mumbai by allocating such a huge amount,” said a senior BEST official. TimesViewAlthough BEST got a significant budgetary allocation as financial aid, it may still be insufficient as its annual losses projected for 2021-22 is Rs 1,888 crore. With Rs 750-crore funding for new buses, modernisation and clearing past loans, it will still fall short of money to run its fleet of nearly 5,000 buses unless it implements cost cuts suggested by BMC.The budget also says that “BEST should undergo major reforms to reduce their expenditure and to increase efficiency levels. They need to plan their activities as per revival plan...and reduce its deficit”. BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said that the consultant will help BEST achieve operational and financial efficiency. “A medium term business plan will also be prepared to revive the financial position of BEST,” he said, adding there will be no ‘privatisation’. Chahal said that 101 BEST staffers had died due to Covid-19 and made a budget provision of special ‘pandemic fund’ of Rs 60 crore to the transport undertaking for “the valuable service during lockdown” and another Rs 50 lakh each to the kin of deceased. The BEST will also get a loan of Rs 406 crore from the BMC for making pending gratuity payments to 3,649 employees. The Rs 9 crore GIS-based Utility Management project has been allocated Rs 2 crore in the budget, Chahal added. The BMC has also paid around Rs 50 crore to MSRTC for free emergency transport during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rs-750-crore-fillip-for-cash-strapped-best-city-to-get-more-ac-buses/articleshow/80677831.cms||Somit Sen

The suspicion only grew stronger after the assaulted man first got admitted into Veraval hospital and later fled from there. In all, 56 people were detained from various places in Gir-Somnath, Junagadh and Bhavnagar districts and four, including the man attacked by the lioness, are being interrogated. A red alert has been sounded by the forest department. Forest officials got a message about a lion cub being injured by some unidentified person in Khambha village near the coastal town of Sutrapada. On reaching the spot, the team found that the cub’s leg was stuck in a trap that was made using an iron clamp. The cub was treated for minor injuries and sent to Sasan animal care centre. Meanwhile, officials also got to know that when the cub was stuck in the trap, a lioness had attacked one person near-by, but he somehow managed to escape with injuries in the abdomen. The man, whose name was not revealed, got himself admitted in the Veraval Civil Hospital. However, before the forest officials could reach there, he fled the hospital. This only strengthened suspicion of poaching or some illegal activity in the forest area. He was later nabbed near Vadala in Junagadh district with the help of Gir-Somnath and Junagadh district police and shifted to Junagadh Civil Hospital. Later in the day, 26 people including some women, who were travelling in a truck from Una to Sihor in Bhavnagar, were detained in a joint operation by the forest and police departments. “On examining their mobile phones, it was found that they were in touch with these four people,” the officer told TOI. Another 26 people who were staying in and around Sihor was also detained immediately. Deputy conservator of forest, Junagadh, Sunil Berwal, told TOI: “We have detained four people and are interrogating them. We are hot on the trail of other members of the gang for which we are also taking support from the locals. We have asked people to alert the police or forest department if they find any unknown person in their area.” Officials said they look like snake charmers hailing from Surendranagar district who often move around in the forest area in search of small animals and medicinal plants. The alleged poachers might have sniffed a chance as lions move around in revenue (non-protected) areas in this district and are often spotted close to human habitations. It was in 2007 when a gang of 17 including women from Madhya Pradesh were arrested by the CID crime unit. The police had found evidence of six lions being poached then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lion-poaching-fear-returns-to-haunt-guj/articleshow/80673684.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Dehradun||To support on-going farmers’ protest, residents of village in Manglaur ‘ban’ entry of BJP leaders||Roorkee: Signs that read “BJP leaders are forbidden from entering this village. If they do, it’s at their own risk” recently came up at Narsan Kalan in Manglaur near Roorkee. The “warning”, written in Hindi, is signed by “all villagers”. Police have asked residents to immediately take down the signs. Villagers said they put up the signs after BKU leader Rakesh Tikait was booked on January 28 for the Republic Day violence in Delhi and asked to surrender before police. Referring to Tikait, 38-year-old Dhirendra Singh, a Narsan Kalan resident, said, “If he hadn’t made an emotional appeal to farmers of the country on January 28, the farmers’ protest would have died out. In fact, some residents of Narsan Kalan are also camping at Ghazipur border. We believe BJP leaders urged police to take action against Tikait. Why should we let them come to our village?” SP (rural) Pramendra Singh Dobhal said, “We have instructed the villagers to remove the signs immediately. We have learnt that some have already been removed. If they are found indulging in writing threatening messages again, we will take action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/to-support-on-going-farmers-protest-residents-of-village-in-manglaur-ban-entry-of-bjp-leaders/articleshow/80674666.cms||Tapan Susheel
February 4, 2021||Dehradun||Potholes & waterlogging giving Orchard Lane commuters a hard time||yyyDehradun: Residents of Orchard Lane — located right next to the IAS Officers’ Colony at Rajpur Road — say that the dilapidated condition of roads has made commuting a nightmare for people living here. The area houses many bungalows and a large number of senior citizens live here. The residents complain that there is no proper sewage system on the roadside and waterlogging is a perennial issue. The condition becomes worse after a rain spell. “Deep potholes line Orchard Lane and waterlogging is rampant. A large number of residents are above 70 years of age and it becomes very difficult for them to venture out of their homes. The lane is in a pitiable condition for the past many years,” said 75-year-old Colonel DP Dimri (retired). The local MLA Ganesh Joshi has also visited the area but done nothing to solve these issues, the residents said. Jaspal Singh, a resident, told TOI, “From the MLA to civic officials, various government personnel have come for inspection but no action has been taken on ground yet. The state of affairs is pitiable to say the least.” Meanwhile, an official at the PWD when queried about the matter, said that “work is ongoing to strengthen and maintain the sewage facility in the city and Orchard Lane work will also be taken up shortly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/potholes-waterlogging-giving-orchard-lane-commuters-a-hard-time/articleshow/80676123.cms||Mohammad Anab

This was the fourth accident that took place on the flyover in the past four days. Two of these accidents turned out to be fatal, according to the police. Both the deceased biker, Md Hasim, and the pillion rider, Md S Kajim, were wearing helmets at the time of the accident. They were coming from Coolotala Lane. “The traffic was slower than usual because of a political rally. The bus plying on the route 28 was neither running at a high speed nor was it competing with another bus. The driver misjudged the speed of the bike and rammed into it,” said a police officer. Hasim came under the wheels of the bus while Kajim fell on the road. Cops arrested the driver and seized the bus. The case has been handed over to the fatal squad of Kolkata Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hit-by-bus-biker-dies-on-sealdah-flyover/articleshow/80676136.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
February 4, 2021||Mangaluru||Karnataka: Dog survives night in a toilet with leopard||MANGALURU: Bollu now has a formidable reputation among the mongrels of Bilinele village in Dakshina Kannada, having survived a night and day with a leopard in a toilet, at the end of which he walked out while the leopard darted through the roof. The big cat had its own success story: it slunk beneath the very nets cast to trap it and returned to the forests. The dog with the ownerIf the encounter was video-worthy, so was the discovery. Jayalakshmi, the owner of the house, was at her relative’s on Tuesday night, when the leopard likely strayed in from the adjacent Kombaru reserve forest. Early Wednesday morning, a family member saw the stout tail of the leopard through the toilet door. Leopard & dog had marked territory in small toiletWithout skipping a beat, she locked the door and went on to call forest officials. What bystanders captured through the toilet window was intriguing: the leopard curled into a corner, and diagonally opposite was Bollu, each apparently having marked their territory in captivity. The house belongs to late Venkappa Gowda of Moolemane in Kaikamba. “It is located adjacent to Kombaru forest. The leopard may have entered human habitation chasing the dog at night. And while the dog took shelter in the toilet, the leopard probably followed it,” said Subrahmanya Range RFO HT Raghavendra. The two remained closeted, in a space barely 3 feet by four feet, until 1.45pm on Wednesday when the big cat made a dash for it. Through the morning, forest officials placed two layers of nets on the asbestos sheets that served as the toilet roof and got permission to dart the animal. “We realised it was a risky operation since the asbestos sheet was merely placed on top of the bathroom and wasn’t secured to anything. For a 100kg leopard, escaping through it was not an impossible task.” And that was what happened. The leopard shot through a hole in the asbestos sheet and ran beneath the nets to freedom. “No injury was caused to anyone in the house. The leopard was below five years of age and weighed 80-100kg,” the RFO said.

February 4, 2021||India||Govt may act tough to streamline old-age homes||NEW DELHI: With the rise in the population of the aged, the government is proposing to include a penalty clause in the revised version of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizen (Amendment) Bill, 2019 to ensure minimum standards at seniorcare institutions and provide for action against those that fail the registration norms. It is learnt that the ministry of social justice and empowerment has proposed the inclusion of a stringent penalty clause that could invite a jail term of one year for those working without registration or providing poor services. This proposal will require the approval of the law ministry and then will have to be sent to the Cabinet before the revised bill can be tabled in Parliament. Since the bill is listed among others as part of the business to be taken up in the ongoing budget session , it is likely that the revised bill may soon make it to the Cabinet for approval. The 2019 bill proposed to make not just biological children but adoptive children, step sons and daughters, son-in-law and daughter-in-law and minors through legal guardians, responsible for care of and providing maintenance to parents. Times ViewElders are the most vulnerable section of any population. According to the 2011 census, India had 104 million elderly, those of 60 years and over. Their number has grown since. The numbers of old age homes too has increased in recent years. In this backdrop, strict monitoring of such homes is imperative. Imposing a penalty should act as a deterrent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-may-act-tough-to-streamline-old-age-homes/articleshow/80679073.cms||Ambika Pandit

February 4, 2021||Pune||Electrification of Pune-Miraj single broad-gauge line to be completed by next year||PUNE: Work on electrification of the broad-gauge line between Pune and Miraj will be completed by 2022, a Central Railway (CR) senior official said. The Indian Railways have set a target of completing electrification work of all broad-gauge railway tracks in the country by 2023 as announced in the Union budget. During a recent interaction, Sanjeev Mittal, general manager, CR, said that work on doubling the 280km track and its electrification was simultaneously going on. The electrification of the single track, which is currently operational, will be completed by 2022 and the entire project will be completed by 2023. “The track doubling work is going on, but some issues regarding land acquisition remain. Around 78 hectares of land is still to be acquired,” Mittal said. Sources in the Pune rail division told TOI that the entire Pune-Miraj doubling project will be completed and commissioned by March 2023. Many trains, particularly those going towards Kolhapur, Karnataka and Goa, pass along the line. The track doubling and electrification project had been sanctioned in 2016-17 at a cost of Rs2436.56 crore. Manoj Jhawar, public relations officer, Pune rail division, said, “Electrification will help bring faster trains along the line. At present, one of the two trains moving on a single track need to stop to let the other pass through, which consumes a lot of time. Track doubling will end this problem.” The finance minister also mentioned in the budget about Vistadom coaches in LHB (Linke Hofmann Busch) rakes to be rolled out in tourist circuits. Railway sources said that there were chances of a rake running between Pune and Mumbai apart from the Konkan region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/electrification-of-pune-miraj-single-broad-gauge-line-to-be-completed-by-next-year/articleshow/80676156.cms||Joy Sengupta

The body of Balwinder was found just a kilometre away from the protest site on January 25. Investigating officers said the area was not manned by CCTV cameras, so they had been unable to establish the identity of the vehicle that had hit the protester. However, they were scanning the footage of cameras installed in the neighbouring areas. According to police, the accident occurred on the intervening night of January 24-25. A case of rash and negligent driving and death due to negligence was registered the same day. “Balwinder had come to UP Gate on January 24 to participate in the farmers’ stir. He was a part of the VM Singh group. He used to drive a combine harvester,” said DCP (East) Deepak Yadav. Cops had been given information about an unidentified body by their counterparts in Ghaziabad. Balwinder’s body was identified by his family members, following which it was handed over to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-yet-to-find-vehicle-8-days-after-hit-and-run-death/articleshow/80676157.cms||---

The burglary took place at Pachanatchi Amman temple opposite to Anna planetarium. The temple administration was private. The security guard Rathinavel, 63 from Kottapattu sustained injuries on his head in the attack. The Airport police took up the investigation. Preliminary enquiries revealed that Rathinavel reported to duty around 10 pm on Tuesday and the temple was closed at 8 pm. The police sources said that a couple of men came to the temple close to midnight. As they wielded a machete, Rathinavel raised an alarm but the duo launched a heavy blow on his head with the weapon. As he fainted, they tied his hands and legs with his dhothi. The burglars took away Rs 4,500 from his pocket and broke open the temple hundial which had Rs 2000. The accused then gained entry into the sanctum sanctorum and took away some jewellery. The accused also broke open a bureau in the temple and fled the scene. Rathinavel who later gained consciousness informed the Airport police. The police team visited the temple and took stock of the missing valuables on Wednesday. Rathinavel was admitted to a hospital. The Airport police said that they were yet to get a complaint from the temple administration about the details of the missing valuables.

February 4, 2021||Chennai||Rs 88L more for new ticketing machines while old ones rust||Chennai: The Centre has sanctioned Rs 88 lakh for the installation of automatic ticket vending machines at more stations. However, this push for more machines comes at a time when existing ones across stations, particularly suburban stations in Chennai, are hardly used. Many machines installed at suburban stations almost a decade ago have been collecting dust. As of March last year, railways has spent Rs 7 crore in installing and maintaining automatic ticket vending machine. However, a majority are non-operational or the public is unaware of their existence. On Wednesday, two machines were found abandoned in Egmore. They were kept away from ticket counters with chains blocking people from going near them. In pre-Covid-19 days, a volunteer would operate the machine and issue tickets to the passenger. Retired railway staff were roped in on contract basis for the task as commuters weren’t using the machines themselves. “Suburban commuters do not have much technological awareness to use these machines. Some awareness campaign or promotion is necessary to get people to use the machines. But no such activity has been undertaken,” said T Sadagopan, a consumer activist and regular commuter. He added that a majority of people who use the suburban trains are used to buying tickets at the counter and not purchasing a smart card nor using the machines. “They had kept a few machines near the counters at some of the busiest stations such as Egmore and Tambaram. Yet, the move did not take off. Railways should ensure that these machines are popular before spending more money on them,” Sadagopan said, adding that the machines have just been lying idle at Egmore, Ambattur, Avadi, Tambaram and other stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rs-88l-more-for-new-ticketing-machines-while-old-ones-rust/articleshow/80676162.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Command & control centre for safer bus travel to ‘go live’ soon||NEW DELHI: Travelling by buses is going to become safer for women commuters with a new command and control centre set up by Delhi government at Kashmere Gate all set to go live soon. All Delhi Transport Corporation and Cluster Scheme buses are getting fitted with CCTV cameras, GPS devices and panic buttons, and all “panic alerts” will be monitored from this centre and immediate action will be taken. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Wednesday tweeted that soon all buses in the capital would have these fully functional facilities connected to the centre with a crew trained in quick response. “Trial should begin any time now,” he told TOI. All new buses being inducted in Delhi’s public transport fleet come equipped with state-of-the-art IP-based CCTV surveillance cameras, GPS devices, video recorders and panic buttons, and older buses are being retrofitted. “Every depot has a roster of buses to be retrofitted and one maintenance and repair bay at every depot has been designated only for this work,” an official said. “The centre, which has been created especially with women safety in mind, will have a large screen that will display real-time position of buses thanks to GPS,” an official said. The centre will act as the surveillance system’s nerve centre, where all panic alerts — when the button is pressed by a passenger, driver or a conductor — will be filtered and Delhi Police will be immediately alerted and provided GPS coordinates of the bus. Delhi Fire Service or ambulance services will be alerted in appropriate cases. “Various alerts scenarios have been defined in the standard operating procedures and the operators have been trained to react in any emergency scenario,” he said. SMS and email alerts will also be sent to the authorities concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/command-control-centre-for-safer-bus-travel-to-go-live-soon/articleshow/80676168.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Delhi||Myanmar refugees in Delhi fear for their kin back home||NEW DELHI: As visuals of military vehicles moving towards the parliament building in Myanmar’s capital surfaced on the internet, a chill ran through a small community thousands of miles away. With the military again taking over power in the neighbouring country, the Burmese refugees in west Delhi were aghast. “My cell phone hasn’t stopped ringing,” said Ruata Fanai, 43, chairman of the Chin Refugee Committee, a community mobilisation group. “Everyone is concerned about the future of their loved ones in Chin province. The slow progress made over the last decade by the gradual democratisation may now be rolled back.” In their small office in west Delhi’s Mahindra Park, CRC members were busy drafting appeal letters and seeking police approval for a protest against the coup at Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Maidan. Around 3,200 residents of Chin, which abuts Mizoram, arrived in several waves after 1989, the year when the then military junta changed the country's name from Burma to Myanmar and killed thousands in a crackdown on a popular uprising. Most of the Chins are Christians and live in Vikaspuri, Budhela, Hastsal, Chanakya Place and Uttam Nagar. Fanai, who arrived in Delhi in 2004 and has a wife and daughter, revealed that the minorities were at a greater risk of facing repression under military rule. “If they like a woman, for instance, they will simply ask the family to hand her over to them. They can make life difficult by faking cases of collusion with the militants against you.” A couple of kilometres away in Budhela village, there used to be a community radio called DVB, or Democratic Voice of Burma. CRC members said the radio ceased operations in 2015 after funding, the seed money for which came from the Nobel peace prize amount of Aung San Suu Kyi, ran out and many refugees left for the US, Canada and Australia. In the Living Faith Baptist Church on the third floor of a commercial building there, Robert Sui Luan, 40, community organiser for the Falam tribe, ministers to 140 Burmese members. “Despite many having moved out, there still are around 300 Burmese refugees in Budhela. Everyone is feeling sad about what is happening in our country,” muttered Luan. Luan, who came to Delhi in 2008 and lives with his wife and two children, disclosed that the standard of living of the Burmese refugees had marginally improved in the last decade though they continue to face problems related to visa extensions, racism, bullying in schools and the biggest of them all, the language barrier. “Hardly 10% of our people can speak in English or Hindi,” said Luan. “This leads to the exploitation of the rest in the factories where they work. The few who can communicate often have to step in when there are emergency cases.” Most of the Burmese refugees work in unregistered factories in west Delhi. Others are employed as helpers in restaurants, Korean houses, as domestic staff or sell vegetables in the refugee market. More than half of the refugee population is under the age of 18 years. “Children born here can speak fluent Hindi, but they still face harassment in school due to their different looks. Many kids hesitate to go to school,” shrugged Luan. Burmese refugees that TOI spoke to admitted to being sympathetic with the Rohingyas for the way that community was treated in their country, but said the nature of their problem had a different historical background. Fanai said that on humanitarian grounds, the Rohingyas deserved commiseration for their pain and suffering. “The Rohingyas came from Bangladesh to settle in Burma, so the issue is different. But we do recognise the humanitarian problem,” he explained. Sitting near the donation box bearing the exhortation, ‘Serve one Another’, Danasty Kelnilen, 28, CRC secretary, talked with optimism, recalling his arrival in India as a 16-year-old. “I was incarcerated in a military camp but managed to escape. I was alone in India and did not know English or Hindi. People helped me and I studied in Roorkee and graduated from Shillong. I am now a teacher and assist my fellow refugees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/myanmar-refugees-fear-for-their-kin-back-home/articleshow/80676232.cms||Paras Singh

Confirming the development, Congress district president Dharmendra Gupta said, “We have been informed that Priyanka Gandhi is expected to arrive in Rampur to meet the family of Navreet Singh in Dibdiba village, but we are yet to receive the itinerary of her visit. We have, however, informed our party workers to be present on the occasion.”Additional SP Sansaar Singh told TOI, "We don't have any information about Priyanka Gandhi's visit to Rampur. We are yet to receive any official programme."The family had alleged that Navreet died due to a bullet injury, but the autopsy report confirmed that he had died of shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem head injuries. One of the injuries suggested that Navreet’s brain matter spilt out of an ‘everted’ wound on the right ear, which indicated that the impact of the injury was inside out, underlined the autopsy report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/priyanka-gandhi-likely-to-attend-last-rites-of-rampur-farmer-killed-in-tractor-rally/articleshow/80673690.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
February 4, 2021||Dehradun||Nainital residents allege forest personnel setting fire in jungles without permission, some private estates also damaged||Nainital: Several eminent residents of Nainital, including Nainital-based environmentalist Anup Sah, former director of Wildlife Institute of India (WII) GS Rawat and activist Shekhar Pathak, have written to the chief conservator of forests, complaining that few forest department personnel have been setting fire to forests in the hills without written permission. The forest department carries out controlled burning from November to March in order to keep forest fires from spreading in the summer but that requires written permission. The letter has asked the officials to constitute a team to look into why forests, even on private land, were being set ablaze and present its report. The residents said that the burning was damaging the ecology and affecting animals as well as migratory birds. Radhika Bhati of Jilling Estate in Padampuri area of Nainital told TOI that the forest department had started a fire in her estate last week, gutting one square kilometer of area. “When we asked the personnel to show the permission letter, they said they had oral orders from senior officials,” Bhati said. Anup Sah said that there had been barely any winter rains this season and the forests are already dry, which is why arbitrary burning of forests may prove to be dangerous. “The way in which the forest department has been setting fire to patches of forests is absolutely wrong. They have been burning the shrubs and smaller trees, which retain moisture and prevent big fires. After a month, when the highly inflammable pine needles start to fall, these shrubs would help prevent a forest fire but the forest department is destroying them already. We have therefore asked the forest department to immediately take steps to investigate the matter,” said Sah. Forest department officials when queried about the issue, said they will look into the complaints and take necessary action. “There is a prescribed protocol for controlled burning. A committee headed by the district magistrate decides on these issues and written permission is necessary for any burning. Controlled burning is necessary to limit the spread of bigger forest fires in summers. However, if local residents have complaints about forests being burnt without written authorisation, they will be looked into,” said Man Singh, nodal officer, forest fires.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nainital-residents-allege-forest-personnel-setting-fire-in-jungles-without-permission-some-private-estates-also-damaged/articleshow/80674681.cms||Prashant Jha
February 4, 2021||Chennai||Being in locked house not proof of affair: Madras high court||CHENNAI: An illicit sexual relationship cannot be presumed merely because a man and woman were found inside a locked house, the Madras high court has said. “Presence of two individuals of opposite sex inside a locked house need not necessarily lead to a presumption that they were in an immoral relationship. This kind of presumption prevailing in society cannot be the basis for initiating disciplinary action and inflicting punishment,” Justice R Suresh Kumar said. He made the observation while quashing the termination of service of an armed reserve police constable on the ground of ‘moral turpitude’, because he was found inside a locked house along with a woman constable. On October 10, 1998, a woman constable entered the residential quarters of constable K Saravana Babu and the door was found locked from inside when neighbours knocked. According to Saravanan, the woman constable had come to his home around 7.30pm asking for keys of her house located close by. While they were talking, someone locked the door from outside and then pretended to knock on it, he added. The judge pointed to statements of witnesses which said the door was locked from outside too. “There was absolutely no eyewitness or any other concrete evidence to prove that the two constables were found in a compromising position. Based on suspicion and conjectures, one cannot conclude that unlawful or immoral activities had taken place,” the judge said, quashing the termination of Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/being-in-locked-house-not-proof-of-affair-court/articleshow/80676199.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Chandigarh||Victims’ kin write to CM, remind him of promise||Jalandhar: On the eve of the 35th anniversary of Nakodar police firing in which four Sikh youths were killed when they were protesting against burning of Birs of Guru Granth Sahib in a gurdwara there on February 2, 1986, parents of one of the victims have written to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, reminding him of his promise during parliamentary polls to deliver justice. The firing had taken place on February 4, 1986. “Though the Punjab government has not been able to respond to the concerns of the family all these 35 years, we see hope only in the Punjab government to act on Justice Gurnam Singh’s commission of inquiry report, 1986, regarding the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib and subsequent extrajudicial killing of four Sikh youth by Punjab Police on February 4, 1986, at Nakodar in Jalandhar. We still await your next step on the public promise, covered by the media that you made in May 2019 parliament elections, that you will ensure justice to the family,” reads the letter written by Baldev Singh and Baldip Kaur, parents of victim Ravinder Singh of Littran village. They are the only surviving parents of the victim youths. The letter was sent to Punjab CM on January 30 last.

Civil surgeon Ratna Raokhande said, “We are seriously contemplating to add more beds for the casualty ward. There are 20 beds approved for the casualty ward for the civil hospital, but given the constant flow of patients in this ward, we struggle to accommodate new patients.” She added, “Since we cannot refuse admission to anyone because of shortage of beds, 10 beds have already been adjusted in the ward in the past but they too fall short at times.” Cases of accidents, poisoning, snake bites, among other medico legal cases like someone getting badly hurt in violent incidents are continuous at the civil hospital. The Nashik civil hospital is a 540-bed hospital and a large number of patients from across the district prefer coming here given the availability of number of specialty treatments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-of-beds-in-casualty-ward-to-go-up/articleshow/80677814.cms||Santosh Sonawane
February 4, 2021||Trichy||New cluster as 15 who attended wedding test +ve||TRICHY: A Thanjavur village has bucked the state’s recent trend of preventing Covid-19 clusters with 15 people who attended a wedding testing positive. They were among 30 from Nadukkadai near Thiruvaiyaru who were tested after two villagers who attended the wedding reported fever and other symptoms. Sources said relatives of the groom and bride from Thanjavur and neighbouring districts had participated in the ceremony. Subsequently, health department officials camped at the village and began screening the relatives as well as their contacts from the two families. Though only 15 of the 30 whose swabs were taken tested positive, 10 have been admitted to the government medical college hospital in Thanjavur. The others have opted for home quarantine with the health department’s approval. When contacted, Maruthu Durai, dean of government medical college hospital, said all the 15 who tested positive were undergoing treatment. The process of identifying the contacts is still going on. Meanwhile, the district administration has slapped a fine of ?50,000 on the owner of the marriage hall for violating standard operation procedures. “We have also initiated criminal action for violation of SOP. Parallel intensive contact tracing, testing and containment measures are being taken,” collector Govinda Rao told TOI. Meanwhile, a three-day holiday was declared for Indian Bank Orathanadu branch from February 2 after a staff member tested positive during medical examination on February 1.

February 4, 2021||Patna||‘Road rage’ led to murder of Rupesh Kumar Singh: Patna cops||PATNA: The Patna police on Wednesday claimed to have cracked the murder case of the IndiGo station manager Rupesh Kumar Singh with the arrest of a 28-year-old man. Police said Singh was killed by the arrested youth over a road rage incident that took place in November last year. The police paraded Rituraj, the accused, before media persons claiming the airline manager had thrashed him after which he held a grudge against Rupesh and later shot him dead on January 12. At a jam-packed press conference, SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said, “Rituraj was arrested from his father’s three-storey residence at Adarsh Colony under Ramkrishna Nagar police station area in Patna.” The SSP said Rituraj, who is “extremely short-tempered and is fond of weapons”, was tracked using CCTV camera footage due to which it took time to crack the case. Rituraj used to work at a private bank in Delhi, but returned Patna three years ago and got involved in bike theft. Sharma said Rituraj’s and his three associates were involved in the murder and they would be arrested soon. “Rituraj is tech-savvy and well educated. He always interacted with the trio and rest of his associates over WhatsApp calls to avoid surveillance,” he added. Rupesh (42) was shot dead inside his SUV near his apartment complex on Shankar Path at Punaichak around 7 pm on January 12. Six bullets were pumped in his chest. The killing resulted in a huge outcry. CM Nitish Kumar had to direct DGP SK Singhal to act promptly in the case after media highlighted it. Rupesh had good political and bureaucratic connections in the state. Giving details of the road rage incident between Rupesh and Rituraj, SSP Sharma said, the incident took place near LJP office next to the airport premises in November end. “Rupesh was travelling in his newly purchased SUV while Rituraj was on a stolen bike when they clashed. The station manager had thrashed him at that time. Rupesh had also shared this incident casually with family members after returning home,” he said. Sharma said the accused had memorised the last four digits of Rupesh’s SUV registration number and its model and had traced his address. “He had kept a grudge against the manager for thrashing him and was determined to take revenge by killing him and was looking for a chance which he finally got on January 12,” Sharma said quoting Rituraj’s confession. Sharma said police had not been able to trace any criminal antecedents of Rituraj in Patna district despite his involvement in several bike thefts in the past three years. “When he killed Rupesh, it was for the first time he had fired a pistol, he confessed to the police,” the SSP said. He said Rituraj also confessed that he realised who Rupesh was only after reading about his murder in the newspapers the next day followed by political statements. SSP Sharma said Rutiraj fled to Ranchi on January 13 after panicking and returned on January 28. “He had become relaxed after media aired the news that Rupesh was killed over tender disputes and police had no clue about his killers,” he said. The SSP said Rituraj’s lead a dual-faced life. “He had kept a rented lavish flat just a few paces away from his residence to enjoy with his partners in crime of bike theft. He also used to keep stolen bikes in the garage there. Locals told police that he kept changing bikes every ten days,” he said. He said Rituraj’s father owns a brick kiln at Naubatpur and his mother is a government teacher. “A few months back, Rituraj had even pulled a pistol at his father and threatened to shoot him over a family dispute. He is married with a one-and-half-year-old daughter,” the SSP said. Sharma said pistol used in the killing, four live cartridges, the stolen bike used to reach near Rupesh’s flat, cloths and helmet worn at the time of the crime and visible in CCTV footages have been recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cops-road-rage-led-to-rupesh-murder/articleshow/80676240.cms||Debashish Karmakar
February 4, 2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder virtually lays stone of new armed forces preparatory institute in Hoshiarpur||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday virtually laid the foundation stone of Sardar Bahadur Amin Chand Soni Armed Forces Preparatory Institute at Bajwara village, Hoshiarpur, to facilitate more youth from the state to take up defence services as a career. The project will be executed at a cost of Rs 27 crore over an area of 12.75 acres by the PWD (B&R) department and will be completed by the end of 2021. The upcoming institute would impart training to 270 candidates a year. The chief minister said the new armed forces preparatory institute would be instrumental in realising the dreams of youngsters to join the armed forces. At a time when women pilot officers are flying the Rafale and helicopters, and are actively involved in every field of the armed forces, the day will soon come when girls in India will be part of the fighting force like their counterparts in other countries, he added. Amarinder thanked MP Ambika Soni, the president of the Sardar Bahadur Amin Chand Soni Education Trust and Society, for providing land free of cost as a gift to the employment generation, skill development and training department to establish the institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-virtually-lays-stone-of-new-armed-forces-preparatory-institute-in-hoshiarpur/articleshow/80677833.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Mercury may rise in next 48 hours||Kolkata: The city continued to remain in the grip of chill even as the minimum temperature climbed marginally to 11.8°C on Wednesday. It may rise further over the next 48 hours till a “wind discontinuity” over Madhya Pradesh blocks the flow of the northwesterly wind and pulls the mercury up on Friday and Saturday when light rain has been predicted in Kolkata and south Bengal. “The system will generate clouds and may lead to drizzles in Kolkata. The cloud cover will pull the temperature up. But once they recede, the temperature will drop to around 13°C yet again,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director, GK Das. While it was still too early to predict if the mercury would rise again early next week, conditions would remain cool for several days, said weathermen. Last Monday, Kolkata had recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4°C, making it the coldest day since February 2, 2008 when the mercury had dropped to 10.8°C. Last week, cold wave conditions prevailed at one or two places in Malda, Jalpaiguri, Bankura, North and South 24 Parganas, East Midnapore, Nadia and Birbhum. In a warning issued last Monday, the RMC had predicted the temperature in Kolkata to drop below 10.5°C and said that though the cold was going to be “tolerable”. The mercury, however, stayed above 11 degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mercury-may-rise-in-next-48-hours/articleshow/80676210.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Rajkot||Lion poaching fear haunts Gujarat||Rajkot: A strong possibility of lion poaching kept the Gujarat forest department on its toes on Wednesday after a cub was found ensnared in a trap and the person suspected to be involved was attacked by the lioness in Gir-Somnath district. The suspicion only grew stronger after the assaulted man first got admitted into Veraval hospital and later fled from there.In all, 56 people were detained from various places in Gir-Somnath, Junagadh and Bhavnagar districts and four, including the man attacked by the lioness, are being interrogated. Forest officials got a message about a lion cub being injured by some unidentified person in Khambha village near the coastal town of Sutrapada. On reaching the spot, the team found that the cub’s leg was stuck in a trap that was made using an iron clamp. The cub was treated for minor injuries and sent to Sasan animal care centre. Meanwhile, officials also got to know that when the cub was stuck in the trap, a lioness had attacked one person near-by, but he somehow managed to escape with injuries in the abdomen. The man, whose name was not revealed, got himself admitted in the Veraval Civil Hospital. However, before the forest officials could reach there, he fled the hospital. This only strengthened suspicion of poaching or some illegal activity in the forest area.He was later nabbed near Vadala in Junagadh district with the help of Gir-Somnath and Junagadh district police and shifted to Junagadh Civil Hospital. Later in the day, 26 people including some women, who were travelling in a truck from Una to Sihor in Bhavnagar, were detained in a joint operation by the forest and police departments. “On examining their mobile phones, it was found that they were in touch with these four people,” the officer told TOI. Another 26 people who were staying in and around Sihor was also detained immediately. Deputy conservator of forest, Junagadh, Sunil Berwal, told TOI: “We have detained four people and are interrogating them. We are hot on the trail of other members of the gang for which we are also taking support from the locals. We have asked people to alert the police or forest department if they find any unknown person in their area.” Officials said they look like snake charmers hailing from Surendranagar district who often move around in the forest area in search of small animals and medicinal plants.The alleged poachers might have sniffed a chance as lions move around in revenue (non-protected) areas in this district and are often spotted close to human habitations. It was in 2007 when a gang of 17 including women from Madhya Pradesh were arrested by the CID crime unit. The police had found evidence of six lions being poached then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lion-poaching-fear-haunts-gujarat/articleshow/80673770.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Nagpur||Alexa, please start my classes: Online-only schools are the new frontier in edu sector||Nagpur: Like millions around the world, Std I school student Naksh Nayyar sits in front of his computer screen every morning for his online classes. But unlike million others, Naksh’s school exists only on computer servers and classrooms are just data packets zipping across through the information highway.Many like him are slowly shifting to online-only schools where they can continue their education regardless of where they are located on the map and at a much cheaper cost. It’s estimated that thousands of students in India have enrolled in various completely online schools which are considered to be the new frontier in the education sector. Yeshwanth Raj Parasmal, co-founder and principal director of 21K School, said, online schools offer ‘more bang for the buck’. “It works just like a regular school offering the NCERT curriculum. Here, students have their own sections, specific timings and learn things over and above what a traditional school set up has to offer as the best teachers from anywhere in the world can teach your kids,” said Parasmal who has more than 300 students enrolled in his online school.Mumbai resident Naksh’s mother Rupika agrees, saying fees charged by traditional schools do not offer the same value. “We are service class people. So why would we go to a physical school when the same syllabus and better quality education is being imparted to our kids at one-third of what the others schools are charging,” said Rupika. Since there is no provision of affiliating online-only schools by CBSE, CISCE or any other state board, students are currently enrolled up till V in most of these schools, with plans in place to take it all the way forward. Some schools are also in the process of exploring affiliation options with international boards so that by the time these students move in the next five years, they will have an accredited board certificate. Mumbai resident Goverdhan Kothari’son Tanish is enrolled in Std V of an online school. He says that online school is the best option this year. “Regular schools have started online teaching but they don’t even have the infrastructure. Online schools have an amazing set up and that enables much better teaching quality,” said Kothari. He plans to continue with online schooling even in the next session, when it’s assumed that the fear of the pandemic will be minimal. “I have seen improvement in my child’s learning abilities and now I feel that the three-hour class limit is not enough,” said Kothari. Aresha Arif, also from Mumbai, has her twins Azeen and Aiza in Std III and an elder child Azlan in Std V enrolled in an online school. “We are travelling abroad soon and I shall be at ease knowing that my children won’t miss school because of that. Another advantage of an online school is safety because we often get news about predators,” said Arif. Punjab resident Meenu Gakhar, whose daughter Trishita is studying in Std I, also likes the diversity in the classroom. “I see students coming from different states and that pan-India presence is something which appealed to us. We wanted her to study in such an environment,” said Gakhar. Acquaintances do wonder about the choices made by these parents, but Mumbai resident Agnes Lobo says it’s only because the concept is new. “Eventually people will adapt to digital and online schooling. The basic difference I see is that most of the parents who are going to work, for them this is difficult, but for a stay-home parent, the digital school is a better option,” said Lobo whose son Aaden is in KG-2. But traditional schools also shape social skills of students and help them navigate the real world in later years. Parasmal’s partner Santosh Kumar says that this is a misconception when put in perspective of this generation. “Today’s kids interact almost completely online. And they develop the same social skills as others because interaction remains the same, it’s only the mode which has changed. Also, kids interact in the physical world with children in the neighbourhood, family circle etc. So, to say that social skills are taught only in a physical set up is not entirely correct,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/alexa-please-start-my-classes-online-only-schools-are-the-new-frontier-in-edu-sector/articleshow/80676236.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
February 4, 2021||Coimbatore||Frontline workers give vaccine cold shoulder||Coimbatore: On Day 1 of vaccination of frontline workers against Covid-19, the number of police and local body staff who turned up for the jab were relatively low in the district on Wednesday.Despite vaccination being administered in 22 government centres, only 704 people from the government sector took the jab, according to data released by the health department. They included healthcare and frontline workers. However, the department refused to give the break-up of healthcare and frontline workers who took the jab on the day. As many as 551 took the jab at private hospitals, taking the total number of people vaccinated to 1,255.“CoWin app is down again. Hence, we are not able to give the break-up of government and frontline workers who were vaccinated,” deputy director of public health Dr G Ramesh Kumar said. “We saw some police, panchayat officers and corporation staff taking the shot,” he said.However, the absence of top cops and officials to take the vaccine was conspicuous. Meanwhile, two second year nursing students from Coimbatore Medical College Hospital who took the vaccine in the hospital on Wednesday afternoon experienced dizziness and mild breathing trouble. Doctors, who immediately gave them oxygen and took blood tests, said their reaction was not vaccine-related. They said the students were both anemic and had a panic reaction, but the blood tests and vitals were perfectly normal. Health officials had not recorded it as an adverse reaction.Speaking to TOI, CMCH dean-in-charge Dr P Kalidas admitted that two nursing students who took the shot at 2.45 pm began feeling faint and complained of mild breathing difficulty while being observed. “We immediately gave them oxygen and began stabilizing them. Once they stabilized, which was in a few minutes, we checked their vitals and blood, and found everything was normal except that they were anemic,” he said. “The fainting and breathing trouble were due to a panic attack they seemed to have. However, we are starting anemia treatment on Thursday. Both the students are fine and stable,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/frontline-workers-give-vaccine-cold-shoulder/articleshow/80676218.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Delhi||Satyendar Jain inaugurates smart power grid in Narela||NEW DELHI: Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday inaugurated a 66/11 kV smart power grid at Narela. The smart power grid has been built by the state government to provide reliable power supply to consumers in north Delhi. Jain said the power grid involves minimum input and gives maximum output, with zero human intervention. “I have inspected the entire power plant and found it to be outstanding. It is state of the art and maintenance-free, as it works on a centralised automated system,” the minister said after inaugurating the sub-station. The smart power grid is constructed to cater to chemical industries and solve the problem of overloading in the area, a statement from Jain’s office stated. The newly set up smart power grid is unmanned and operates from a centralised automated system, i.e. Supervisory Controlled and Data Acquisition Center (SCADA), it said, adding that this increases the durability of the plant and makes it maintenance-free. The smart power grid works in an environment-friendly manner by making use of Lithium-ion batteries and also has a specific area allocated for tree plantation and rainwater harvesting, Jain mentioned. He added, “Special care should be taken to harvest the rainwater and tree plantation in the area.” The power minister also emphasised that Delhi government was committed to providing a 24×7 electricity supply to the city and the smart power grid was a step ahead in that process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jain-inaugurates-smart-power-grid-in-narela/articleshow/80676246.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Additional FSI of one for rehabilitation of those affected by road widening||MUMBAI: The BMC will offer an additional floor space index of one to any developer who is willing to give alternative accommodation in place of protected and tolerated structures that obstruct road widening. The municipal corporation has proposed to spend Rs 18,000 crore on various infrastructure projects across the city. The provision for providing incentives in exchange for space has already been made in the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034, said municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday. The commissioner reiterated that BMC does not have the funds to acquire land reserved for various amenities and will offer transfer of development rights and accommodation reservation to make land available for public use. BMC has again budgeted Rs 100 crore to pay off small clusters of slum-dwellers — a small cluster is defined as 10 units to 20 units — when their dwellings obstruct the completion of an infrastructure project. The compensation will be paid in accordance with the ready reckoner rate. BJP MLA Parag Alavani said the compensation would be too meagre and not enough to buy a dwelling unit. "This has been proposed in the past but has not worked," the MLA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/additional-fsi-of-1-for-rehabilitation-of-those-affected-by-road-widening/articleshow/80677909.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Dehradun||We’ll ensure crystal-clear Ganga water, fit for drinking, during Kumbh: Uttarakhand CM||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, in an exclusive conversation with TOI on Wednesday, said that “crystal-clear Ganga water would be the USP” of the Maha Kumbh festival slated to take place in Haridwar. “Our USP for the Kumbh will be getting pilgrims to experience the crystal-clear water of Ganga river, which would be fit for bathing and drinking. The mesmerising view of Ganga river, clean water and beautiful ghats would be a lifelong cherishing experience for the pilgrims coming for the festival,” the chief minister said. He added that an amount of around Rs 1,500 crore is being spent on Kumbh-related works in Haridwar. “Majority of the projects are complete whereas some are on the verge of completion. For instance, the flyover at Ranipur is being given finishing touches and it would be dedicated to people by the middle of the month. Covid-19 has delayed our works by around three months. However, I am happy that overcoming all challenges, we have still been successful in completing projects in the stipulated time span,” the CM said. Elaborating on the challenges ahead for the mega festival, the CM said that putting a cap on the number of devotees remains a major concern. Besides, conducting RT-PCR test (which has been made mandatory by the Centre in its SOP released for the festival) for lakhs of pilgrims is likely to prove a daunting task. “We need to develop a mechanism to set a cap on the turnout, especially for the key bathing days. It will be difficult to stop devotees, especially those who are coming from far-off states. Therefore, we are also giving thought to a proposal to limit the duration of Kumbh,” the CM said. The mela would have four ‘shahi snans’ — on March 11 (Mahashivratri), April 12 (Somwati Amavasya), April 14 (Baisakhi Kumbh), and April 27 (Chaitra Poornima). Besides, there are also six 'parv snan', which commenced with Makar Sankranti (January 14). The other five 'parv snan' dates are – February 11 (Mauni Amawasya), February 16 (Basant Panchami), February 27 (Magh Poornima), April 13 (Navsamvratsar), and April 21 (Ramnavmi).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/well-ensure-crystal-clear-ganga-water-fit-for-drinking-during-kumbhcm-rawat/articleshow/80674709.cms||Kautilya Singh

This train will run on every Wednesday from Dhoraji station, said Bhavnagar division of railways. While the trade is old, the quicker mode of transport is new for the traders who will receive the goods in four days only instead of the usual six to seven days by road. As onion is a highly perishable commodity and it’s weight gets reduced with time, faster delivery becomes imperative for the traders. A special arrangement for onion transportation has been made by railway at the Dhoraji station and last year it was exported to Bangladesh for the first time from this station by railways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kisan-rail-chugs-to-guwahati-with-onions/articleshow/80674760.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 650 crore reserved for Harbour till Borivli, AC rakes in Budget||MUMBAI: The Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP), which includes extension of the Harbour line till Borivli, quadrupling of the Virar-Dahanu corridor and procurement of air-conditioned rakes, will receive a boost as the railway ministry has sanctioned Rs 650 crore for the purpose in Budget 2021-22—Rs 100 crore more than for 2020-21.  Budget documents were tabled in the Parliament on Wednesday, two days after the Union Budget was presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. MUTP projects are aimed at augmenting the capacity of trains to reduce overcrowding on the city’s lifeline. Last year, they had received Rs 550 crore, including Rs 200 crore for Phase II and Rs 300 crore for Phase III. While the amount sanctioned for these two phases is identical this year too, for Phase III-A, it is Rs 100 crore higher as only Rs 50 crore was sanctioned in the previous budget. Since Rs 650 crore has been allocated for MUTP projects, a similar amount will be allocated by the state government as these works are executed by the Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC), which is a 50:50 joint venture between the two. MRVC chairman and managing director R S Khurana said, “The ongoing MUTP projects are at different stages of implementation. We are happy that like the last few years, fund allocation has been as desired and works will get a further boost.” Substantial allocation has been made for bridges too. CR’s chief public relations officer Shivaji Sutar said, “Around 115 escalators have been sanctioned Rs 50 crore on CR, of which around 50% will be in Mumbai. For ROBs, around Rs 33 crore is sanctioned for seven locations.” WR’s chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur said, “We received around Rs 20 crore for FOBs and a substantial sum for escalators.” Rail Yatri Sangh’s Subash Gupta said, “The real issue is timely execution of projects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rs-650-cr-reserved-for-harbour-till-borivli-ac-rakes-in-budget/articleshow/80676585.cms||Manthank Mehta

Eight of the injured have been shifted to a hospital at Nagpur for specialized treatment. The company has been acquired by US-based CarVal Investors recently for Rs2,000 crore. District guardian minister Sunil Kedar has directed the administration to investigate the incident and take strict action.“I reached work at 8am and we were evacuating ash from blast furnace. A group of 4 workers was at each of the 16 points being evaluated. Suddenly, a steel jam failed on the hot ash, which causes burn injuries,” said Hariram Durga, a worker undergoing treatment at AVBRH, Sawangi. Durga, who belongs to Kalahandi district of Odisha, said, “Our sahab ignored that jam would fail. He sustained minor injuries on hands and face.”Pushpendra Patel, who belongs to Satna district of Madhya Pradesh, had joined the company on February 2, 2021. He said, “I joined the work just a day before, I do not understand what happened over there. But I got stuck in the belt when I tried to flee from the spot after the accident. I was evacuated later.” His right hand and right leg were burned in the incident and he is being treated at AVBRH, Sawangi.One more injured, Mangesh Chandankhede, said, “I saw blast of hot air and ash, and fled away from the spot. I don’t know what happened over there but around 80 workers were working there and all started rushing out.”The statement released by the company said the furnace had been shut down on Tuesday for annual maintenance and the furnace evacuation had been completed. A sudden outflow of hot air from the furnace injured 38 workers working in that area, it said.Out of the 38 injured, eight workers have been shifted to Orange City Hospital at Nagpur for specialized treatment, said the company, assuring that it is committed to providing the injured best medical care needed for their full recovery.District guardian minister Sunil Kedar, who directed the district administration to take strict action against those responsible, ordered an investigation under various laws for safety of workers and provisions of Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board.Sources said the company has been acquired by US-based CarVal Investors for Rs2,000 crore following insolvency and bankruptcy. “UK-based stressed assets management company Nithia Capital and CarVal had announced on Tuesday that they have completed the acquisition of Uttam Galva Metallics and Uttam Value Steels for a total purchase consideration of around Rs2,000 crore,” said sources.

He was 22 years old at the time of the accident and the regional medical board noted that he had suffered 80% disability. Taking note of the disability caused, petitioner’s age and loss of future income, the tribunal arrived at Rs 25.1 lakh compensation for Lokesh. Rajesh suffered multiple fractures and was hospitalised for more than a month. Considering the 25% disability he suffered, loss of income, medical expenses, the tribunal arrived at Rs 8.1 lakh for him, both compensations to be settled within two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/motorists-to-get-rs-33l-payout-for-2012-accident/articleshow/80676268.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Dehradun||Harish Rawat springs another surprise, says not keen to contest assembly polls||Dehradun: Known for his last-minute political surprises, former chief minister Harish Rawat has yet again stirred up the hornet’s nest in the Himalayan state by saying that he would not contest the next assembly elections. However, soon after his supporters urged him to reconsider, the former CM said that he would “abide by the decision taken by the national leadership regarding his candidature.” Earlier, Rawat had made a similar statement by saying he was not in the race for “group leadership”. The former CM, who is presently on a tour to Kumaon, however, said that as far as his personal wish went, he did not want to contest in the 2022 assembly elections. “The final decision, however, rests in the hands of the party’s national leadership. Being a loyal soldier of the Congress, I will follow whatever instructions are given to me,” Rawat said. The former CM has been on an aggressive poll campaign mode and in the last two months, has covered a number of districts and held interactions with a multitude of people. Also, for the past few weeks, he has been strongly backing the concept of having a CM face for the 2022 assembly polls. While a number of senior party members have supported him, two seniors – Congress state chief Pritam Singh and leader of opposition — Indira Hridayesh – have opposed this, saying, “the results of having a CM face were visible in the 2017 polls”. Hridayesh said, “We all know that we contested the 2017 assembly elections under a leadership and were reduced to mere 11 seats, which is not even one seat a district. Therefore, we need to follow the party tradition and contest the assembly election under the collective banner and after winning, a CM candidate would be finalised by seniors and elected MLAs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/harish-rawat-springs-another-surprise-says-not-keen-to-contest-assembly-polls/articleshow/80674734.cms||Kautilya Singh

Kamaraj, who was tested positive on January 5, subsequently tested negative after treatment for the viral infection and was discharged from a private hospital. But he was readmitted a couple of days later when he became symptomatic, developed fever and complained of discomfort. “Three days after readmission, his condition was critical. On advice from the government, we shifted him to a government hospital that has treated more than 25,000 Covid-19 patients,” Iniyan K, the minister’s son, told reporters. He was put on a ventilator at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and then moved to MGM hospital, which had critical care facilities including ECMO and facilities for a transplant. “His condition was critical when he came to the GH. He had severe cytokine storm and bacterial infection. Doctors there had to intubate him. We then shifted him to MGM when his x-ray was white and treatment was challenging. With effective co-ordination and stringent treatment protocol, they pulled him out from the jaws of death,” Vijayabaskar said. “This case is an example of how our state can help severely sick people recover from the viral infection,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/min-kamaraj-ready-to-be-discharged-says-vijayabaskar/articleshow/80676252.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Coimbatore||Vacant president post leaves consumer panel defunct||Coimbatore: The state government is yet to find a replacement for the post of the president of Coimbatore district consumer disputes redressal commission that fell vacant two weeks ago.After A P Balachandran took voluntary retirement on January 11, the number of pending cases has gone up significantly, an official said. “Last month, 200 fresh petitions were filed before the commission. It has over 1,600 pending cases. Without the president, the commission cannot hear cases or pronounce judgment. Due to the uncertainty, we have been adjourning cases.”The district consumer disputes redressal forum was upgraded to the commission under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, last July. “Even when the forum was handling cases for claims worth less than Rs 20 lakh, there was a struggle to dispose cases on time due to manpower shortage. Now that the cap limit has been raised to Rs 1 crore, the number of complaints has gone up considerably,” he said.Even when the president was hearing 70 cases a day, a case could be posted for hearing only once in 40 days and on an average, it would take 20 years to deliver a verdict. “Balachandran was given additional charge of the consumer courts in Nilgiris and Tirupur and as a result, he could hear cases in Coimbatore only for three days. Now that he is retired, courts in the neighbouring districts are also functioning without a president,” the official said.As per government norms, a suitable replacement should be identified at least two months before the president retires and the selected person should take charge the very next day, said K Kathirmathiyon, secretary of the Coimbatore Consumer Cause. “But it is not followed anywhere and the president’s posts remain vacant. It shows the insensitivity of the government towards consumers. Due to this, it has been taking up to two years to get a verdict. Now, what is the difference between a consumer court and civil court? Due to the delay, consumers are hesitant to approach the courts,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vacant-president-post-leaves-consumer-panel-defunct/articleshow/80676239.cms||Nivedha Selvam
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Telangana: No Covid test done, but 3 get negative report||HYDERABAD: Three students who went for a Covid-19 test got a negative report without even getting it done in Jogulamba Gadwal district. The group of students had gone to the government hospital in Gadwal on February 2 and duly filled in the forms. After waiting for sometime, they were told to come back on Wednesday as there were no test kits available. The students left the hospital without giving their swab samples for testing. However, the students from Kondapalli village received a preliminary test report on their mobile phones stating that they had tested negative for Covid-19. The rapid antigen test report, described as ‘interim test report’, was sent to a 17-yer-old student. In the specimen type column, it was mentioned that a nasopharyngeal swab was taken for testing. Another ‘system generated report’ also pertained to a 17-year-old student. District collector Shruti Ojha said an enquiry has been ordered. “We have initiated an enquiry to check if the reports were sent without a test being conducted. We will take stringent action against those responsible for it if it is true,” the collector said. Asked if there was a dearth of testing kits, the collector said there has never been a shortage of kits in the district. On Tuesday, nearly 200 students — both from college and schools — came to the hospital for the test. “Since the three students did not want to wait for their turn, they left the hospital,” an official said. “There was an error by a data entry operator due to which the reports were generated,” the official said, adding that further enquiry was on to identify who was accountable for the lapse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-covid-test-done-but-3-get-ve-report/articleshow/80678504.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
February 4, 2021||Navi-mumbai||793 frontline staff vaccinated as Phase 2 of drive begins in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Vaccination for frontline workers, mainly policemen and civic workers, began in a small way in the state on Wednesday. While 793 frontline workers in nine districts, including those in Thane city and Navi Mumbai in Thane district, got vaccinated, a total of 35,096 healthcare workers got vaccinated across Maharashtra on Wednesday. Together, they made up 62% of the day’s targeted beneficiaries (6,380). An attempt to start vaccinating frontline workers in Mumbai failed to take off as none of the intended beneficiaries got an SMS message from the Centre’s Co-WIN software managing the vaccination drive, said BMC officials. India’s mass vaccination drive against Covid-19 has been divided into four phases: healthcare workers in the first phase, frontline workers in the second, senior citizens in the third and the remaining in the fourth. The Centre had asked states to start on the second phase concurrently in the first week of February. The BMC on Wednesday vaccinated 76% (4,839) of the intended 6,380 healthcare workers. “About 4,600 of these were walk-in beneficiaries who had pre-registered,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. AMC Suresh Kakani said the drive for frontline workers in Mumbai would start on Thursday. “We plan to start it on a minimal scale. Depending on how the Co-WIN application responds, we will scale it up,” he said, adding that the names of 1.85 lakh frontline workers have already been registered in the software. Five sessions of 100 each are planned for frontline workers in four hospitals (Nair, Sion, Seven Hills & BKC jumbo) on Thursday, Dr Gomare added. In Mumbai, seven healthcare workers suffered from giddiness after taking the vaccine and were kept for observation for 30 minutes. The maximum number of vaccinations were carried out in Nair Hospital (828) followed by Shatabadi (791) and Rajawadi (710). Across the state, Akola with a target of 300 managed 107% of its target and Pune 94% of the intended workers. In districts such as Parbhani, Hingoli and Sangli, turnout was poor with 31%, 33% and 34% respectively. Meanwhile, 30 policemen, including Thane police commissioner Vivek Phansalkar, were among the 774 people vaccinated in Thane on Wednesday.Phansalkar said, “I have taken the vaccine as a police chief and I urge the police department as well as citizens that, whenever their turn comes, they should not have any hesitation or apprehension in their mind about vaccination, nor should they fall for any rumours.” In Navi Mumbai, the NMMC started three centres for frontline workers such as security personnel, sanitation and NMMT drivers and conductors.

Congress MPs from Telangana — N Uttam Kumar Reddy, A Revanth Reddy and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy — on Wednesday told mediapersons in Delhi that KCR was insulting the farmers who have been agitating for over 70 days and condemned his decision to close down the procurement centres for purchase of paddy in the state. They alleged that while Narendra Modi government at the Centre is harassing the farmers, KCR regime in Telangana is exploiting them. Uttam, who is also president of Telangana Congress, said the Centre is misleading the nation by claiming that it enjoyed people’s support on the new farm laws to override the state APMC Acts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcrs-silence-an-insult-to-farmers-says-cong/articleshow/80676280.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Kolhapur||KMC polls: Parties bank on survey for right candidates||Kolhapur: Political parties have conducted multiple surveys to zero in on the right candidates so that their chances for victory in the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC)  are bright. Parties generally rely on political workers to find the right candidates, but have roped in private surveyors this time around because the mood swings of voters and biased views of workers. The KMC election is expected to take place in the first week of April. Rohan Swami, who has conducted surveys for parties as well as individual candidates for the KMC election, said feedback is taken from voters about the performance of the sitting corporator and their inclination towards those who have shown interest to contest the election. “The parties, which have almost got the surveys done, are ensuring that the candidates who get tickets to contest will emerge victorious. Based on the surveys, serious aspirants have already started campaigning. The mood of the voters continues to change till the last minute. Hence, parties need the details from every ward updated several times,” he said. Based on the surveys, the prospective candidates are being wooed by parties and offered all sorts of help for campaigning. The candidates are also switching sides based on the survey results. For instance, former mayor and NCP corporator Sarita More and her husband Nandkumar, a former corporator, joined Shiv Sena despite rush of candidates to the NCP for tickets. More said, “We found that joining Shiv Sena will help us win this time. The Sena leaders have assured us that their committed workers will back us.” The sitting corporators are also resorting to surveys to gauge the mood of voters. Many have to switch wards due to the ward reservation system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-polls-parties-bank-on-survey-for-right-candidates/articleshow/80677886.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, it has been holding talks with India for several years for a railway connectivity with India that will not only aid in tourism and easier transit for people, who travel on business, but also freight for the landlocked country. Much of Bhutan’s imports arrive through the Kolkata port and moves by road. Mujnai in Chapaguri, is already connected by rail,” said a senior railway official. The ministry of railways claimed to have allocated Rs 6,636 crore for projects fully or partly in Bengal. This includes funds for new lines as well as augmentation of existing facilities.

February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Revanth writes to Shah, seeks central security cover||Hyderabad: Telangana Congress working president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy has urged Union home minister Amit Shah to provide him with ‘four plus four’ gunmen along with an escort vehicle from the central agencies or any other independent agency as he faces threat from the ruling TRS. In a letter to Shah, Revanth said: “The state government’s security cover makes me more vulnerable and my safety is at a higher risk. So, I request you to immediately implement the direction given by(WP No. 4673 of 2020) Telangana high court.” Though the state government has provided security cover to Revanth on the directions of MHA last year, Revanth said security from the state government is nothing but 24x7 surveillance on him. “I have apprehensions of serious threat to my life from my political opponents as they are in government in the state,” Revanth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-writes-to-shah-seeks-central-security-cover/articleshow/80676272.cms||---

Police said the body bore strangulation marks around the neck. The body was sent for the post-mortem examination, said police, adding that a probe was initiated. The child had gone missing mysteriously while playing outside the house around 3 pm on Tuesday, and his body was spotted by the family and locals a few meters away from the residence later in the night. Thakurdwara police station SHO Satendra Pawar said, “It appears that the boy was strangled due to personal enmity. Family members have, however, denied having a rivalry with anyone.” “The case is being probed from all angles and the body was sent for autopsy. An FIR was registered against an unidentified person under section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code,” added the SHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/body-of-boy-3-found-dumped-near-his-house-7-hours-after-kidnapping/articleshow/80673076.cms||Maria Khan
February 4, 2021||Dehradun||At mahapanchayats, call for each family to 'give' one person for protests||ROORKEE/MATHURA: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders, who addressed thousands at two mahapanchayats in Mathura and Roorkee on Wednesday afternoon, virtually asked each farmer family to send one person to protest sites in and around Delhi. Giving out this call, the mahapanchayat at Mathura said about 5,000 people from Mathura alone are likely to reach the Ghazipur border in the next two days. Echoing the same sentiment and terming the laws brought by the Central government “death warrants” for farmers of the country, BKU chief Naresh Tikait said in Roorkee that people will not sit at home till the Acts are repealed. “We are very clear on it…that till the farm laws are not repealed we will not withdraw from our protest. This time, a strong movement of farmers is being built. We are going among farmers day after day asking them to join the agitation,” Tikait said, adding that the protests will be peaceful even in the face of the gravest provocation. “We farmers are essentially non-violent people. We will continue to protest in a peaceful manner. And even if the government resorts to firing, we will respond to them without violence,” Tikait told farmers at Gud Mandi, about 9-km from Roorkee city. About 300km away in Mathura, his son and BKU’s youth wing president Guarav Tikait addressed an even bigger crowd and said, “Bill wapasi nahi to ghar vapasi nahi (No one will go back home till the farm laws are repealed).” BKU’s district president Raj Kumar Tomar said, “Movement to Ghazipur border will not be in groups now. Police are not allowing farmers to join protests at the border and have barricaded the routes. Individuals will go to the border on their own now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/at-mahapanchayats-call-for-each-family-to-give-one-person-for-protests/articleshow/80674780.cms||Tapan Susheel
February 4, 2021||Delhi||Congress to start padyatra for Delhi municipal bypolls||NEW DELHI: Delhi Congress workers, under the leadership of DPCC president Chaudhary Anil Kumar, will carry out campaigning through a ‘Pol Khol’ padayatra for the upcoming municipal bypolls, which is due later this month in five wards. Kumar said the byelections would be an opportunity for the people of Delhi to express their ire at both the BJP and the AAP governments, who he alleged have been indulging in shadow boxing, trading charges and counter charges in the past seven years, without doing any work. He added that even during the pandemic, Corona Warriors like doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitation workers and teachers had to protest to get their salaries and arrears. “The civic bodies have alleged that they could not pay the wages to the employees due to non-transfer of pending funds by the Kejriwal government. Even now, a section of sanitation workers are on strike demanding salary, while Delhi stinks with piled up garbage everywhere,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cong-to-start-padyatra-for-municipal-bypolls/articleshow/80676291.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Patna||JD(U) backs farm laws, but favours talks with farmers||PATNA: BJP ally JD(U) on Wednesday backed the farm laws but advised the central government to adopt a conciliatory approach towards the farmers keeping in view their agitation on Delhi border for the last more than two months. Speaking in favour of the motion of thanks to the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, JD(U) president RCP Singh said the three farm legislations were not “anti-farmers from any angle” and if the agitating farmers felt the need of more improvement in the law, their leaders should come forward for talks. Talking to TOI over the phone from Delhi, JD(U)’s national secretary general K C Tyagi asked the NDA government to give the agitating farmers more opportunities of dialogue. Tyagi said his party had supported the three farm bills in Parliament, but farmers have raised some questions and launched agitation near Delhi seeking rollback of the three legislations. “In such a situation, JD(U) is of the opinion that the Centre should adopt a conciliatory, and not a confrontationist, approach towards farmers and take necessary steps to engage their leaders in further talks,” Tyagi said. He also pointed out that majority of the farmers in north India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, vote for BJP and its allies. “Hence, the farmers should be treated like friends and not as enemies. They should be provided a friendly atmosphere for talks,” Tyagi said. JD(U) chief and Rajya Sabha member Singh also said in the Upper House, “Veteran socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia used to talk about rising above the politics of confrontation. As per the Supreme Court’s order, the Centre is inviting the farmer leaders for talks. But they are blaming the Union government. After all, who is stopping you from holding talks? Please come on the table and hold talks on how to improve the income of farmers. Hold talks on how to make agriculture a beneficial profession,” Singh said while exhorting the farmer leaders to resume talks with the Centre. Recounting his experience as a former IAS officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre and now working in Bihar, Singh said, “The agriculture marketing yards in both the states used to be a den of corruption. We abolished the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act in Bihar in 2006 soon after the NDA government came to power in the state.” Singh also said the APMC Act abolition led to increase of production of farm produce in Bihar. “In 2005, the total production of foodgrains in Bihar was 81 lakh ton. Today it is 181 lakh ton. Government procurement was also very low in 2005. Today, 45 lakh ton is our target only for paddy procurement. As far as the productivity is concerned, maze production has increased by 135%, paddy 119% and wheat by 118%,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-backs-farm-laws-but-favours-talks-with-farmers/articleshow/80676281.cms||Madan Kumar
February 4, 2021||Nagpur||Two-wheeler rider with 40 unpaid challans caught in Nagpur, Rs 9,000 recovered||NAGPUR: The Nagpur traffic police on Tuesday caught a two-wheeler rider who had 40 pending challans for violating various traffic rules since 2019. The Sadar traffic police, who caught the man, recovered pending fines of Rs9,000 from him, said DCP (traffic) Sarang Awad. ASI Vijay Pande from Sadar traffic zone, who was deployed at Zingabai Takli junction, intercepted the owner of a two-wheeler registered at Thane regional transport office. Pande was part of the special ‘Smart Nakabandi’ drive to recover pending challans for violation of traffic rules and regulations. When the cop checked the vehicle number in the state database, it showed that the motorist had many traffic related offences against him, including driving without helmet and wrong side driving. The Smart Nakabandi was launched by city traffic police from January 13 to recover unpaid fine from motorists. Most fines have been slapped through the CCTV camera monitoring system, said the DCP. With the online system integrated with RTOs across the country, traffic police can easily get details of the history of the motorist and the vehicle. Until recently, violators had a free run. The enforcement officers used to be unaware of who the violators were. With the new online system, which is integrated with Vahan and Sarathi apps, the traffic police ensure that an erring motorist not only gets a challan but pays up earlier fines as well. DCP Awad has appealed to motorists who have not paid their earlier fines to come forward and pay the same. Police have so far collected Rs1.26 crore from 15,983 motorists since January 13. However, a majority of fines still remain unpaid for the challans generated through 6,688 CCTV cameras installed in the city. The highest amount of fine from unpaid challans under the special drive was recovered by the Sitabuldi zone – Rs22.49 lakh from 2,094 violators, followed by Lakadganj zone (Rs14.53 lakh from 2,717 motorists), Sonegaon zone (Rs13.84 lakh from 1,568 motorists), Sadar zone (Rs13.22 lakh from 2,515 motorists), Cotton Market (Rs12.47 lakh from 1,404 motorists), Ajni zone (Rs10.07 lakh fine from 1,008 motorist), Sakkardara zone (Rs9.62 lakh from 1,093 motorists), Indora (Rs10.06 lakh from 1,163 motorists), Kamptee (Rs6.56 lakh fine from 880 motorists) and MIDC zone (Rs13.19lakh from 1,540 motorists).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-wheeler-rider-with-40-unpaid-challans-caught-rs9000-recovered/articleshow/80676316.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
February 4, 2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rare sighting of blue bird at low altitude||DEHRADUN: An expedition organised by the forest department recently to conduct a recce of the Bhagirathi valley found sightings of flocks of the Grandala coelicolor bird at low altitudes of around 2000 feet. This surprised experts who were part of the three-day expedition, as Grandala coelicolor, which has a distinctive royal blue colour, is usually spotted at altitudes of 9000 feet and above. A popular haunt of the bird is Lachen in North Sikkim. which is at an altitude of around 9,000 feet and attracts birding enthusiasts, many of whom come specifically to look at the Grandala. Enthused by the sighting, the Uttarakhand forest department now plans to exploit this opportunity and convert the Bhagirathi valley into a winter tourism destination where birders and nature lovers can witness a variety of flora and fauna. “Winter tourism in Bhagirathi valley has a huge scope ranging from snow leopard tours to winter bird watching. We will certainly facilitate these eco-tourism initiatives and provide licences to birders for birdwatching even in the innerline areas too,” said Rajiv Bhartari, head of forest force, Uttarakhand. Birding experts Sheela Rawat and Rajesh Panwar, who specialise in organising birdwatching tours and were part of the forest department expedition, while commenting on the presence of the Grandala at low altitudes, said, “The movement of the birds from higher mountains to valleys is a winter migratory pattern and the birds come down to the valley area when it snows in the higher altitudes. However, in Uttarakhand, there has never been a flock of these birds sighted at low altitudes.” Incidentally, sightings of a few other birds like white-throated bushtit, white –cheeked nuthatch and Goldcrest were also reported from the Bhagirathi valley.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/grandala-coelicolor-birds-having-royal-blue-color-sighted-for-first-time-at-low-altitudes-in-ukhands-bhagirathi-valley/articleshow/80674759.cms||Shivani Azad
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||£35 million Nizam Fund share not for 2 grandsons alone: Ex-princess||HYDERABAD: Shafiya Sakina, great granddaughter of Nizam VII Mir Osman Ali Khan, filed a case in Telangana high court on Wednesday urging it to declare as illegal the way the central government conceded a major portion of the Nizam Fund locked up in a London bank to the grandsons, Mukarram Jah and Muffakham Jah. She said the agreement between the Union of India and the two grandsons is shrouded in secrecy and is non-transparent. On this ground alone, the secret settlement has to be invalidated as arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, she added. The Nizam Money or Hyderabad Funds, which grew to 35 million Pounds after being locked in a legal battle in the London high court for about seven decades, was decided in favour of the Indian government, and the grandsons in 2019. The share between the government and the two grandsons has not been disclosed. Shafiya Sakina is the granddaughter of Moazzam Jah, the second son of Nizam VII. In her petition she said the allocation of the Nizam money to the two male heirs was detrimental to scores of other heirs like her. She said the Centre gave away 98% of the fund to Mukarram Jah and Muffakham Jah. She alleged that the Centre was acting in a discriminatory manner towards women. She contended that the Nizam had set up as many 28 trusts to look after various assets and welfare measures and named his kin as trustees of those trusts. All these trustees are the legal heirs. In fact, it is Nizam trust, that should inherit the Hyderabad fund and not just two of the male heirs, she argued. She also found fault with the secret way in which the fund was appropriated. All trusts of the Nizam were validated by the Nizam’s Trust Deeds (Validation) Act, 1950. “My mother Princess Fatima Fouzia and her sister Amina Merzia are the beneficiaries in the “Wedding Gifts Trust of the Nizam’s two granddaughters. I and my sister Princess Naqiya Zainab are the ultimate beneficiaries of the said Trust,” Princess Shafiya said in her plea. The Union of India has no authority to appropriate any of the amounts which are the subject matter of the litigation in the British courts. The money was sent from Hyderabad to London during the Police Action in 1948 and that this money belonged to Nizam VII and not to the Union of India, she said. No court in India has declared the two alleged heirs as the sole successors of the funds lying in the British bank, Shafiya said. They have not obtained any succession certificate in respect of this amount lying in the British bank, she claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/35m-nizam-fund-share-not-for-2-grandsons-alone-ex-princess/articleshow/80678511.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Telangana yet to file DPRs on projects despite Centre’s reminders||HYDERABAD: Telangana has not submitted a single detailed project report (DPR) of irrigation projects undertaken by it despite the Centre asking for submission of DPRs. It was in October 2020 that Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had asked both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to submit DPRs of the irrigation projects constructed or taken up on Krishna and Godavari basins. Of the 34 projects, including the contentious ones upon which both states filed complaints against each other, only three DPRs were submitted. AP submitted the three DPRs till date. “The KRMB has been writing to the states to submit the DPRs at the earliest,” KRMB member Harikesh Meena told TOI on Tuesday. Sources in the board said the AP government submitted DPRs pertaining to Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme, Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme and Vedavathi Lift Irrigation Scheme. Telangana water resources department principal secretary Rajat Kumar said a committee of officials had been constituted to prepare DPRs. “Preparation of DPRs takes time. It is done as per the guidelines of the Central Water Commission (CWC). The other reason for delay is some projects had been conceived and launched back in 2001 like the Devadula project. There have been many changes in the project, including contours, and those need to be incorporated in the DPRs,” Rajat Kumar said. A senior KRMB official said the board has no powers to take action against Telangana. “Since jurisdiction of the KRMB and even Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) has not been decided, we do not have powers to take action against the states except writing reminders and seek submission of the DPRs,” he said. Jal shakti’s apex council, headed by the Union minister, issued directions to both Telugu states seeking filing of DPRs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-yet-to-file-dprs-on-projects-centres-despite-reminders/articleshow/80676286.cms||Koride Mahesh

February 4, 2021||Trichy||Curb 2GB data for students: Teachers||Trichy: With the state government launching the free internet data scheme for college students a few days ahead of reopening colleges, teachers have raised apprehensions on its possible misuse by students if internet access is not restricted. The number of intended beneficiaries has come down in recent months as many students have managed to get smart phones and gained internet. Open access to internet may do more harm than good as a resource is made available for students unnecessarily when colleges will be reopening on February 8, said teachers. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had made the announcement last month to enable students to attend online classes. However, the government had come under criticism for announcing the scheme specially for college students ahead of the assembly election as many among the beneficiaries are first-time voters. Under the scheme, 2GB data will be given every day to students of government and aided colleges besides those in self-financing colleges who get scholarship from the government, till April this year. According to A Mekala, regional joint direct of collegiate education (RJDCE) Trichy, the scheme will benefit roughly 58,000 students across 80 colleges in the region comprising four districts. “Along with the information of students willing to avail of the scheme, we were asked to send details of mobile phone service providers of each student. However, there wasn’t any discussion on restricted internet access to the students,” she said. “The scheme would have been ideal if it was rolled out soon after the lockdown was imposed when many students could not attend online classes over lack of internet access,” said S Mathan, a student from a city arts and science college. Now that the offline classes are returning, there is every chance of the free data being misused without restrictions, he said. “The scheme could still help at least 40% of college students who were either not having internet access or struggling to spend for it for online classes. The internet access should be restricted for safe use,” said S Senthil Kumar, assistant professor, Botany department, National College Trichy. Saying that the government could have come to the rescue of student a few months earlier, an engineering college teacher said the institutions were clueless about academic activity when lockdown was imposed. Some teachers said the scheme will benefit students if the colleges don’t reopen. “Indeed, the reopening is not certain as colleges may have to switch back to online classes if Covid-19 positive cases are reported on campuses,” said the state vice-president of Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers Association (TNGCTA) G Ramesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/curb-2gb-data-for-students-teachers/articleshow/80677953.cms||Sampath Kumar

However, hailstorm is forecast at isolated places, while very light rain is likely on Friday. Video: Parts of Delhi received light rainfall today morning; visuals from ISBT road area. India Meteorological Depa… https://t.co/tDO3Wfhy3U— TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1612409448000Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist, IMD, and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “As the western disturbance is expected to pass on Friday, there is a possibility of very light rain only during the morning hours.” The minimum temperature recorded on Wednesday was 10.4 degrees Celsius — two notches above normal — while the maximum settled at 26.1 degrees —four degrees above normal. A Met official said the minimum temperature might rise to 11 degrees on Thursday, while maximum could drop to 24 degrees. “The minimum temperature is expected to dip from February 6 to 8 degrees Celsius. It will remain one degree below normal. However, the night-time temperature will not be as cold as January. There is no prediction of cold wave in the next few days,” said the official. The maximum was likely to hover around 24-25 degrees Celsius from February 6, and mostly remain a notch above the normal temperature. At 330, the overall Air Quality Index on Wednesday remained in the “very poor” category. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research said, “Surface winds have improved as predicted and are east north-easterly in direction. The improved ventilation is likely to influence AQI positively for the next three days. It is likely to improve to the lower end of the ‘very poor-poor’ category for the next two days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/brace-for-rain-and-hail-today/articleshow/80676383.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Telangana: Of 20k cancer cases in 2020, 20% related to head & neck||HYDERABAD: Despite being in the thick of the pandemic, Telangana recorded 10,328 new cases of cancer in the single largest state-run tertiary centre, MNJ Institute of Oncology and Regional Cancer Centre, alone and nearly an equal number in private centres last year. Of the estimated 20,000 new cases in the state, including government and private hospitals, nearly 4,000 to 4,500 are head and neck cancers, estimate authorities. These cancers, including cancer of mouth, tongue, oral cavity, pharynx and buccal mucosa, are primarily a result of consumption of tobacco and tobacco products. Dr N Jayalatha, director, MNJ Institute of Oncology and Regional Cancer Centre, said, “as compared to 2019 statistics, there was a 20% decrease in 2020. That might be due to Covid-19, as the daily number of cases has increased from 450 to 650 during January this year. We are seeing an increase in head and neck cancers. In 2020, 20% to 25% of the cases at our institute were of head and neck cancers, which are the most prevalent type of cancers now. Earlier, breast and cervical cancers were most prevalent while head and neck cancers were third most prevalent.” Almost all cases at government hospitals in districts are referred to the institute. The number of cases at the institute in 2019 was around 15,000. Further, head and neck cancers are being seen in much younger people, which might be a cause for concern. “Of late, we are seeing this in young adults of 30 to 35 years of age too. This is primarily due to bad habits like consumption of tobacco and tobacco products. “Avoiding the risk factors like obesity, alcohol beyond permissible limits, which is 14 units per week, tobacco in any form and physical carcinogens such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation is recommended,” said Dr Vinodh Maddireddy, director of radiation oncology, Medicover Cancer Institute. Meanwhile, smoking and alcohol are the most common causes of cancer. “Smoking accounts for almost one-fifth of premature deaths due to various diseases including cancer. Most common cancers caused by tobacco and alcohol are oral cancer, lung cancer, throat and stomach cancers. Lack of physical exercise, sedentary lifestyle and obesity can cause hormonal changes which cause increased propensity towards certain malignancies. Breast cancers and gynaecological cancers are common among the obese. A diet rich in smoked meat can also cause colon cancer. Similarly, exposure to radiation and other harmful chemicals may lead to certain types of cancers,” said Dr Geeta Nagasree, consultant surgical oncologist, Care Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/of-20k-cancer-cases-in-2020-20-related-to-head-neck/articleshow/80676279.cms||Amrita Didyala

Since January 16, Uttarakhand has organised 870 vaccination sessions, among which the maximum were organised in Dehradun. “Hill districts are performing better than plains,” said Dr Saroj Naithani, director of National Health Mission (NHM). “Among all 13 districts, Tehri topped in the number of vaccinations, with the district having vaccinated 3,697 healthcare workers in 43 sessions so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/active-cases-of-covid-19-dip-below-1000-for-the-1st-time-in-6-months/articleshow/80674771.cms||Ishita Mishra

February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Former Karnataka CM’s missing relative found murdered in AP||A day after exhuming the decomposed body of a 28-year-old man from the forests of Nellore in AP, city police have picked up a few of his family members, including a woman, for questioning. Siddarth Devender Singh, a close relative of former Karnataka CM , late Dharam Singh, was suspected to have been murdered over personal vendetta. He passed out of Delhi Public School and studied commerce at St Joseph’s college. Then he flew to New York where he earned an MBA-finance degree. Till 2019, he worked in different companies in New York as well as Bengaluru. Since 2019-end, he was in the city and had planned to float his own firm. According to Devender Singh, Siddarth went missing on January 19. “He sent a message on WhatsApp around 5am saying he was flying to US to meet friends. However, later we realised he had not gone there. He didn’t return home and his mobile was switched off,” the missing person’s complaint filed on January 25 said. “Family enquired with airport officials whether Siddarth had flown to New York and found he hadn’t. Only then his father filed the complaint,” an investigating officer said. Siddarth received calls from two mobile numbers before his disappearance. “They belonged to Shyam Sundar Reddy and Vinod from Tirupati,” cops said, adding: “We called them over the phone and enquired about Siddarth. They pleaded ignorance and switched off their mobile phones.” Soon, a police team reached Tirupati and learnt that one suspect had committed suicide while another had attempted to end his life. “Reddy hanged himself from a tree on a deserted stretch in Tirupati. Local police found the body on February 1. The public saved another suspect identified as Vinod when he tried to jump before a train in Tirupati last week. It was Vinod who revealed what had happened and took us to the place where they had buried Siddarth’s body in Napore forests,” police said. “Reddy, from Korlagunta, is a BE graduate and became friends with Siddarth when he lived in the city for a while in 2014. It is evident that Reddy and Vinod abducted Siddarth and took him to Nellore where they murdered him. We have to question Vinod to find out the reason,” police said.

February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Telangana govt borrowings cause for concern, flags finance panel||HYDERABAD: Telangana may be bracketed among the wealthier states with Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Gujarat but its borrowings as guarantees is a huge cause for concern, the 15th finance commission report has said. The report tabled in Parliament in the current session observed that interest repayment at 13% of Total Revenue Expenses (TRE) in 2018–19 was higher than average and is also growing fast. “If off-budget borrowings of the state amounting to Rs 29,965 crore in 2016–17 are accounted for, the Debt–GSDP ratio would jump by more than 5 percentage points to 24.9% in the same year,” the report based on Controller and Auditor General (CAG) findings said. According to experts, in such a scenario, the fiscal condition will be tight and will leave very limited space for the state to take up any growth or welfare-related activities in a big way. “Budget borrowings are always better than guarantees given. Now unless we increase the revenue, the debt repayment ratio will increase. The government sometimes sells land and public-sector undertakings to generate own revenue to overcome such situations,” said Dr Krishna Reddy Ch, assistant professor, school of economics, University of Hyderabad. State governments are increasingly borrowing indirectly by floating corporations and giving guarantees to them for raising loans. The commission observed that the state registered revenue surplus of Rs 1,386 crore during 2016–17. “The revenue surplus was overstated by Rs 6,778 crore because of irregular accounting. Thus, the state had, in fact, a revenue deficit of Rs 5,392 crore in 2016–17,” the report said. Highlighting that the state’s fiscal situation remains a major challenge, the commission pointed out that at an estimated cost of Rs 80,000 crore the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project would not be financial viable in the absence of guaranteed revenue stream. Comparing Maharashtra, the report said revenues from stamp duty are very low (8% of Own Tax Revenue against 15% in Maharashtra). But state government officials put up a brave front. “Debt is not a problem as debt- GSDP ratio is one of the lowest among states and most borrowings are meant for long term repayment,” said one official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-borrowings-cause-for-concern-flags-finance-panel/articleshow/80678522.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

February 4, 2021||Dehradun||Higher edu dept shortlists 10 degree colleges for establishing hostels||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand higher education department has shortlisted 10 degree colleges, in the initial phase, for establishing hostels inside its campuses. The decision comes after the department has taken note of the commuting problems faced by the students, especially those residing in the hilly regions of the state. The department is primarily going to focus on establishing hostels for girl students.Each hostel is likely to accommodate 50 students. In this regard, the department is going to send a proposal to the Centre soon. Notably, degree colleges in regions like Barkot, Karnaprayag, Gairsain, Lohaghat, and Kotdwar among others, have been identified for establishing hostels. Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand Open University received an approval from its three-member internal committee to offer MA (Development Studies) course from the next session. The university is also going to offer distance certificate and diploma courses — six months and one year long respectively — in development studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/higher-edu-dept-shortlists-10-degree-colleges-for-establishing-hostels/articleshow/80674824.cms||Mohammad Anab
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||UoH students violated Covid safety norms||Hyderabad: A day after three of its students tested Covid-19 positive, the University of Hyderabad (UoH) on Wednesday found several violations by students after the campus was reopened for laboratory/practical work. Three Master of Science students in the School of Life Sciences have tested Covid-19 positive in the last six days. So far, the university has permitted over 700 research scholars and Master’s students to return to the campus to resume essential academic work and are currently preparing a road map for further normalisation over the next couple of months. The UoH task force had insisted on returning students presenting a Covid-19 negative report and staying in isolation at the designated facility on campus for seven days before they commence their academic work. However, authorities have found several instances of violations of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour by the students. “Mixing in close proximity with other students without facial masks and leaving the isolation facility for departments before the mandatory seven-day period ends are some of the violations committed. This is not acceptable,” said professor Vinod Pavarala, head of UoH task force. “If there is any escalation in cases on our campus, the university would be compelled to return to a stricter policy regarding in-person classes. Needless to say, this will also slow down the approach of the task force in recommending a gradual, staggered return to the campus by all students,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uoh-students-violated-covid-safety-norms/articleshow/80676282.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Colleges reopen with full full fee demand, parents cry foul||Hyderabad: Reopening of colleges has ignited a fee row among parents and institutions, with managements pressurising people to pay full fees upfront for this academic year. After a break of 10 months, the Telangana government reopened schools and colleges for physical classes from February 1. Many parents have started receiving calls and messages from college managements asking them to pay remaining fee upfront, failing which their wards are neither being allowed to attend classes nor register for the ensuing exams. “The college management has threatened us to pay fees of Rs 1.2 lakh. While I have paid almost 50%, the management is asking me to clear the remaining amount failing which they are not going to allow my son to appear for exams,” said Mohammed Qadeer, parent of an intermediate student. The government in its guidelines has stated that no students should be denied to write exams due to lack of attendance. However, lack of clarity on fees has left many parents in the lurch. “The government has not mentioned anything about fees in its guidelines issued recently. How does it expect parents to shell out huge amounts during a pandemic,” said Rajeshwar Koneti, parent of an engineering student. Officials said they have not got any instructions from the government over fee relaxations. “Colleges argue that they cannot pay teachers if parents delay fee payments and if there are relaxations. Many colleges are struggling to stay afloat because of the delay in payment of fees. Hence, the government is not expected to come up with any fee relaxations,” said a higher education department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/colleges-reopen-with-full-full-fee-demand-parents-cry-foul/articleshow/80676429.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Kolkata: In election year, four Metro links get Rs 2,263 crore boost||KOLKATA: For poll-bound Bengal, there has been an enhanced allocation in the Budget for the city’s Metro projects this time. The outlay is Rs 2,263 crore against last year’s Rs 1,542 crore. The Noapara-Barasat corridor via Airport has emerged a gainer for the 2021-22 fiscal in the Budget, with an allocation of Rs 520 crore as against last Budget’s Rs 204 crore. But percentage-wise, a substantial amount has come for the Joka-Esplanade Metro project that had received just Rs 99 crore in the last Budget. This time, Rs 350 crore has been allocated for the project, as the 8.5km Joka-Taratala section is progressing with a December-2021 internal deadline. But with the Majerhat bridge completed, work is on in full swing to complete Phase 2 or the 2.6km Taratala-Mominpur stretch by December 2022. The allocation for the New Garia-Airport project is a disappointment, even though it is Rs 22 crore more than last year. The Rs 350 crore allocated this time, officials said, is grossly insufficient because they were expecting a 2.5 times larger share — something around Rs 700crore this time — given the 32-km corridor (unrevised Rs 4,259.50 crore estimate) is eyeing a truncated 5km Garia-Ruby operations in December, this year.  Officials of implementing agency Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) were anxiously hoping the government, while giving a realistic outlay in the pandemic year, wouldn’t withhold the higher sum, since the corridor has gained momentum at last. The project, when it was given Rs 328crore last year, was mired in land logjams. East-West Metro has got Rs 900 crore against last year’s Rs 905crore. East-West Metro has Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica), which is lending 48% of the total Rs 8,575crore cost, as the principal funding agency. The 7-km Sector V-Phoolbagan section is likely to extend to Sealdah by the year end, and the entire 16km Sector V-Howrah Maidan stretch, via the Hooghly river, may be operational by March. Officials expected more funds for the Noapara-Barasat line. The 7-km Noapara-Airport section, of which 2km is underground, too, has a December 2021 deadline. The 4-km Dakshineswar extension of the north-south corridor has been given only Rs 1crore since it’s about to be commissioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-election-year-4-metro-links-get-rs-2-2k-cr-boost/articleshow/80676433.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Waqf board raises concern over land encroachments||Hyderabad: The Telangana State Waqf Board (TSWB) on Wednesday urged the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) authorities to explain how it permitted construction of buildings on Waqf properties in Attapur. Mohammed Saleem, chairman, TSWB expressed concern on the mushrooming of illegal structures on Waqf land. “We had some information about the encroachments. The illegal structures will be razed down at any cost and we have written letters to the officials concerned seeking strict action and registration of criminal cases against the accused. It is a gazetted seven-acres and 10 guntas Waqf land, despite this, illegal construction was carried out,’’ said Saleem. Finding fault with GHMC officials, he said that all illegal structures will be removed in a couple of days and a meeting will be held soon with GHMC officials to find out how the constructions were permitted. “We have asked the collector and the police to deal firmly in such cases,” said the TSWB chairman. Some of the properties that were encroached upon include Dargah Hazrat Syed Ibrahim Hussaini, Qutub Shahi mosque and graveyard, seven acres and 10 guntas land at Survey No.389 at Attapur village. A GHMC official said that they will examine the plaint and look into the issue. “There is a distinct possibility of the civic body being kept in the dark about the extent of Waqf land in the region,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/waqf-board-raises-concern-over-land-encroachments/articleshow/80676362.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Delhi||Delhi court dismisses Jamia Millia Islamia’s plea on use of excessive force by police||NEW DELHI: The plea of Jamia Millia Islamia seeking action against the use of “excessive force” by police against the varsity’s staff and students in December 2019 was dismissed by a city court on Wednesday. It held that the police action was “connected to their official duties” and FIR couldn’t be ordered for want of sanction under law, though “some of the said actions might be questionable”. In its plea, Jamia had urged the court to order an FIR under Section 156(3) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). “This court has no hesitation in holding that acts allegedly committed by the respondents fall within the purview of Section 197 CrPC in discharge of official duties,” noted Metropolitan Magistrate Rajat Goyal. The court added that it couldn’t order an FIR without a prior sanction required to prosecute public servants. It observed that it was an “undisputed fact” that police were acting to control the law and order situation that had stemmed from protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. “It is also an undisputed fact that many students were also protesting against CAA. It cannot be denied that the said protests had taken a violent turn and that the law and order situation had become tense,” the order stated. The university had submitted that the violence was due to some anti-social elements and the protests by Jamia students were largely peaceful. The court said, “The argument is not relevant here as it is not for this court to determine this issue in the present proceedings. But one aspect which is clear is that some of the protests had become violent and police were acting to prevent the law and order situation from deteriorating further.” The judge highlighted that though it could be argued that police allegedly exceeded their jurisdiction and used more force than necessary in some instances, it cannot be said, by any stretch of imagination, that its action was “wholly unconnected” to its official duty. “Likewise, it could also be argued that the situation, perhaps, could have been handled by the respondents in a better way and that some restraint should have been shown by police to differentiate between peaceful student protesters and anti-social elements who had attempted to hijack the entire movement. However, the lack of such restraint exhibited by police and excesses committed in trying to control the situation are very much related to their official duties,” the court added. It further observed, “Thus, the actions of the respondents in doing so are clearly connected to their official duties, though some of the said actions might be questionable.” On January 22, 2020, police at Jamia Nagar was directed to file an action taken report on the varsity’s plea alleging “excessive and arbitrary force” by cops in its campus on December 15, 2019. The plea alleged that police caused destruction of the university property, fired teargas shells and conducted lathi-charge, besides hurting religious sentiments of locals by entering the university mosque. Delhi Police had refuted the claims and justified its action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-dismisses-jamias-plea-on-use-of-excessive-force-by-police/articleshow/80676442.cms||Aamir Khan
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Traffic cops help transport organs in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: The traffic police created four green corridors across the city on Wednesday to transport the organs of a brain dead man to different hospitals. A 45-year-old farmer, Balaiah, from Kodair village in Kurnool district, had met with a road accident on January 31. However, he was declared brain dead while undergoing treatment at Continental Hospitals in the city.

February 4, 2021||Dehradun||In a first, AI to be used for social distancing at Haridwar Kumbh||Haridwar: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology will be used for the first time in Haridwar Maha Kumbh to maintain social distancing, particularly during royal bathing rituals. Kumbh Mela police have identified a total of 50 locations, including main ghats of Har-ki-Pauri region, where the systems will be installed to monitor the number of pilgrims. Kumbh Mela police chief Sanjay Gunjyal said that through AI, it will be possible to detect whether social distancing norms are being properly followed by the pilgrims. “We have around two lakh sqm area on 107 river banks. This includes Har-ki-Pauri. In the wake of social distancing norms, we have assessed that around 1.8 lakh people can take bath at a time. To implement the rule, we are going to introduce AI for the first time in Kumbh history to count the number of pilgrims." Fifty points have been selected covering most of the river banks and parking places, where this system can be installed along with CCTV cameras, Gunjyal said, adding that it will indicate, automatically, when it exceeds the number of pilgrims. Modern technology will be also used for crowd management and identifying any anti-social elements. Gunjyal said, “We have installed around 450 cameras across the Kumbh region in Haridwar and Rishikesh covering all the strategic points from Narsan border to Har-ki-Pauri. Hi-tech police surveillance control centre is being established. We can get live footage through the cameras and take quick decisions. A sharp mechanism to implement the commands by the ground teams is also in place.” Earlier, the government allocated around Rs 55 crore for the project with one year annual maintenance contract, but Kumbh Mela police hired an agency through a bid to complete this project in Rs 13.50 crore, with three years annual maintenance contract, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-a-first-ai-to-be-used-for-social-distancing-at-haridwar-kumbh/articleshow/80674855.cms||MS Nawaz

In the RTI, Vijay Gopal, FAC founder sought information on fees being levied by degree colleges and penalties for those flouting norms. In its response, the TSCHE stated that “the information does not come under the functions of the degree online services Telangana”. “It’s unfortunate that the authorities do not even have penalties for such violations by colleges. It only goes on to show its complacency on initiating action against errant colleges,” said Vijay Gopal, FAC founder. The Telangana Education Act, 1983 clearly states that educational institutions levying excess fee than prescribed are liable to refund the amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rti-shows-no-clear-penalty-for-higher-fee/articleshow/80676435.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Eatala urges Centre to rethink on farm laws||Hyderabad: While chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has remained silent on the ongoing farmers’ agitation, health minister Eatala Rajender has stirred up a hornet’s nest by urging the Centre to rethink on the farm laws. Asking the Centre to pay heed to the demands of the agitating farmers across India, he said that governments have a moral responsibility to protect the farming community. “Is it not the responsibility of the governments to look into reports submitted by Jayathi Ghosh and P Ramchandran Commission after several farmer suicides?” he said after dedicating a Rythu Vedika cluster in Huzurabad on Wednesday. Asserting that the farmers’ demands were genuine, he said it was legitimate to demand the government to implement the rates as fixed by the price fixation committee. “Why would farmers protest in cold weather? Farmers cannot sell their produce by going to another state. The Centre should think about all these issues,” he said. He said Telangana made giant strides in paddy production with Food Corporation of India buying more than 64 lakh tonnes from the state. “Earlier, we used to import wheat from US. Now, we are proud to export rice from our soil,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-urges-centre-to-rethink-on-farm-laws/articleshow/80676439.cms||---

There is no mention about electrification of track passing via Pattukottai in Thanjavur district up to Karaikudi. Out of the Rs 1.10 lakh crore announced for railways in the Union budget 2021-22, less than Rs 3,500 crore has been allotted for projects in Southern Railway, which covers Tamil Nadu and Kerala states and Puducherry, A Giri, secretary of Thanjavur District Rail Users' Association and member of Divisional Railway Users’ Consultative Committee (DRUCC) said. “Demand for new lines such as Needamangalam-Kumbakonam, Pattukottai-Ariyalur (via Thanjavur), Mayiladuthurai-Tarangampadi-Karaikal etc has not been approved. Funds needed for early completion of the projects such as Mannargudi-Pattukottai, Nagapattinam-Thirukuvalai-Thiruthuraipoondi has also not been allowed. However, adequate funds to the tune of Rs775 crore has been allotted for doubling works connecting Nagarcoil eying the by-election,” Giri said.

February 4, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Bail to riot accused over lengthy delay in recording eyewitness statement||NEW DELHI: Pointing out the “humongous delay” in recording of an eyewitness’s statement by police, a Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to a man accused in a February 2020 rioting case. The accused, Kuldeep Singh, argued that the policemen who had identified him in the case would visit his dairy to have tea regularly and his counsel used the term “dhoodh me patti” to assert the proximity of the policemen and the applicant. His counsel, Gaurav Kochar, submitted that statements of police constables or beat officers who had identified Singh couldn’t be considered authentic or reliable for it was recorded after a long gap. The lawyer argued that Singh was “very well known” to them. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav noted, “He has used the expression ‘doodh mein patti’ to point out the proximity between applicant and the aforesaid police officers on account of their daily interaction.” Special public prosecutor Naresh Kumar Gaur contested the bail plea and argued the case pertained to the “brutal murder” of an innocent young auto driver namely Babbu. He stated that a video clip of the victim’s murder had been recorded by BBC and the investigating officer of the case had written to the broadcaster to provide them with the video footage. The same was in the process of being delivered to the IO, the prosecutor added. It was argued that an independent public witness had identified Singh. The court noted that the incident took place on February 25, 2020 and the statement of a witness was recorded by the IO on May 18, 2020 “i.e., after a humongous delay of about 83 days”. The court said, “The prosecution has not been able to accord any cogent explanation for such a huge delay in recording the statement of said witness.” “The identification of applicant by the aforesaid police officers is hardly of any consequence, as this court is not able to comprehend why the said beat officers waited till the recording of their statements/supplementary statements…to name the applicant when they had seen and identified the applicant indulging in riots on the date of incident. Being cops, what stopped them from reporting the matter then. This cast a serious doubt on the credibility,” the court observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-to-riot-accused-over-lengthy-delay-in-recording-eyewitness-statement/articleshow/80676525.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Kochhar appears to have misused her post: PMLA court||Mumbai: In a detailed order, a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court has held that it appeared former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar had misused her official position in granting loans to V N Dhoot of Videocon group companies and got illegal gains through her husband Deepak Kochhar. Taking cognisance of the Enforcement Directorate’s chargesheet against the trio, the court said the material produced by the investigating agency constitutes offences under PMLA. “I am of the opinion that this material is sufficient to proceed against the accused persons,” the court said. It also said ED was granted leave to continue with the investigation and take action as per the law. While Deepak Kochhar is in custody, Chanda Kochhar and Dhoot will have to appear before the court on February 12. Chanda Kochhar took charge of ICICI Bank as its MD and CEO in May 2009, after which she allegedly illegally sanctioned loans to Videocon companies. The loans of Rs 1,875 crore allegedly turned into non-performing assets in 2017 and caused losses to the bank. It is alleged in lieu of the loans, she received Rs 64 crore kickbacks through her husband’s company Nupower Renewables from Videocon. “The flat at CCI, Mumbai, was purchased by the family trust of Chanda Kochhar from proceeds of the crime for a minuscule sum of Rs 11 lakh when its actual price was around Rs 5 crore,” ED alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kochhar-appears-to-have-misused-her-post-pmla-court/articleshow/80678537.cms||Rebecca Samervel
February 4, 2021||Trichy||‘Scientific documentation key to protecting fauna’||Trichy: Conservation scientist A Kumaraguru from the Biodiversity Conservation Foundation on Wednesday said that the lack of baseline data has been preventing scientific documentation of various wildlife species found in protected areas across the state. He was speaking on the last day of the three-day workshop on International Wetlands Day 2021 organised at Point Calimere Bird and Wildlife Sanctuary, Nagapattinam on Wednesday. This workshop was jointly organized by Tamil Nadu forest department and biodiversity conservation foundation (BCF) India for forest guards, anti-poaching watchers (APW), field staffs and forest ranger officers. ‘Wetlands and water- inseparable and vital for life’ was the theme of the workshop this year. While speaking at the event, Kumaraguru said that updating the field staff on various scientific approaches used for documenting wildlife is also necessary, which will help in transferring the knowledge to younger generation while paving way for effective conservation activities in future. He said sanctuaries were created in the state for protecting wildlife but there was no authentic data collected after scientific study of the wildlife and their migratory pattern throughout the year. Synchronised bird and wildlife census conducted by forest department along with BCF over the last three years across the state was a step towards achieving that objective, he said. Speaking on the role of wetlands in the conservation of migratory bird, S Balachandran, deputy director, Bombay natural history society, Mumbai (BNHS) said there is a decline in the arrival of migratory birds over the last five decades. Inaugurating the workshop, S Ramasubramanian, chief conservator of forests, Trichy forest circle, spoke on wetlands and conservation of birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/scientific-documentation-key-to-protecting-fauna/articleshow/80678016.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Chennai||Coming soon: 1,000 small forests to give Chennai bigger green cover||CHENNAI: In January 2019, when the regional deputy commissioner of south zone, Chennai, Alby Jhon, decided to convert a 2,200sqm patch of corporation land into a Miyawaki forest, little did he realise that within a year it would become a movement. Buoyed by its success and that of other such urban forests on open space reserve (OSR) lands across the city, Greater Chennai Corporation has now decided to set up 1,000 Miyawaki forests to increase Chennai’s tree cover that now stands at 19%. According to the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change, the ideal green cover for Chennai should be 33%. The corporation is inviting public and corporates to adopt OSR plots and set up such forests to improve the air quality of the area, increase biodiversity and stop illegal usage of vacant plots. So far, 30 such forests have come up with 60,000 saplings being maintained by the civic body. Another 20 forests are being developed. Recalling the transformation of a patch behind the Kotturpuram station, Jhon said, “Garbage was being dumped and burnt. We were getting complaints. Cleaning it and fencing it twice didn’t help. A suggestion to plant trees came up and we decided to follow the Miyawaki method which I had already done in Tuticorin.” Corporation commissioner G Prakash has asked all RDCs, zonal officials to begin identifying land to set up the 1,000 forests. “These forests will improve the quality of air in that area and bring in birds, insects, reptiles. Also, illegal activities will stop,” he said. The small forest also has a positive impact on the area’s micro climate. R Rajmohan, deputy conservator of forest and principal of Tamil Nadu Forestry Training College near Vaigai dam, said: “Miyawaki method not just increases tree cover quickly but also provides dense canopy cover in urban areas that helps reduce the impact of solar radiation and reduces wind velocity. Roots of these trees bind the soil and facilitates seepage of rainwater. Transpiration from these trees also create micro climate as they cool the environment. However, selection of species is vital.” A normal sapling takes about seven to 20 years to grow, but in the Miyawaki method, closely planted native species compete with one another for sunlight, nutrition and water resulting in more vigorous growth. The sapling becomes a tree within four to 10 years, increasing the tree cover quickly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/coming-soon-1000-small-foreststo-give-chennai-bigger-green-cover/articleshow/80674924.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Many pressured to buy books, uniforms||HYDERABAD: Hardly three days since schools have reopened, managements have started pressurizing parents to buy books, uniforms, and clear the entire fees. Parents said that at the fag end of the academic year, schools are asking them to buy entire book sets shelling thousands of rupees. The same is said to be the case with uniforms and other stationery. “My son’s books hardly cost a couple of thousands in the open market. The school, however, is asking us to pay Rs 10,000 for books, which also includes material for IIT and medical entrance coaching,” said S Raju, whose son is studying in class 9 at a corporate school. He questioned how the management is planning to conduct coaching when there is hardly any time left to teach regular subjects. Teachers and parents said that managements are also forcing students to buy study material, integrated books along with textbooks prescribed by respective boards. Similarly, students are being forced to buy all notebooks, whether or not there is a need. “At the time when the state and central government has reduced syllabus to 70%, schools are forcing parents to buy additional material, which can be used for reference and is not part of the syllabus,” said Surya Bhaskar, a private teacher adding teachers have no option but to follow managements. Many also complained schools are asking them to clear entire year fees to ensure their wards are allowed into physical or virtual classrooms. Private school managements said although they have been asking students to clear fee dues, when it comes to books and uniforms they are not forcing anyone to buy them. “Water and electricity connections in many budget schools have been disconnected as managements were unable to clear dues. Our expenses increased as we have to follow Covid-19 guidelines. So, it is true we are asking students to clear this year and last year’s fee dues,” said S Madhusudhan Reddy, general secretary, Telangana Recognized Schools Managements Association. He said budget schools are following Go 46 and are asking for tuition fees on monthly basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-pressured-to-buy-books-uniforms/articleshow/80676523.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

February 4, 2021||Goa||Rise in accidents near bus stand worries Bicholim locals||Bicholim: The road junction behind the KTC bus stand at Bicholim, leading towards Maulinguem, is proving to be unsafe due to rash driving and speeding by motorists, with an increasing number of accidents reported at the location in recent weeks. Residents of Bicholim have, therefore, demanded that the Bicholim traffic cell should appoint a traffic police personnel at the spot. The junction, where four roads culminate, has become an accident prone zone, as vehicles coming here from the bypass road, which begins from the Chhatrapati Shivaji junction, tend to come at a high speed. Vehicles coming from the Maulingem road are unable to spot the vehicles in time due to overgrowth of bushes by the road side and the hurdles of parked vehicles, leading to increasing collisions at the spot. In one such accident on Saturday, two motorcycle riders were injured. One rider coming from Maulinguem was knocked down by another motorbike rider approaching from the main bypass road as both could not spot each other in time. Residents of Bicholim have therefore demanded with the administration to either clear the roadside hurdles or to station traffic personnel at the spot immediately. Praveen Teli from Bicholim said traffic cell should immediately appoint a police personnel near this junction to control the traffic until the administration clears the hurdles on the main bypass road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rise-in-accidents-near-bus-stand-worries-bicholim-locals/articleshow/80678018.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The exercise assumes significance considering that it is the golden jubilee year of Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Rahul Pandey, chief conservator of forests and wildlife, said around 14.47 lakh hectre area are under wetlands in the state. “We have been assessing the wetlands and have identified 31 such areas so far in collaboration with WWF-Hyderabad. Some are protected wetlands while others are community-managed,” he said. Pandey further said the department has also started mangrove afforestation in Krishna estuarine area. “Over the years, wetlands have been shrinking due to anthropogenic pressure like over-exploitation of flora and fauna, excessive fishing, agricultural activities, road construction through the areas, fragmentation of the lakes and pollution,” he said. There are five well-recognised wetlands in the state, including protected sanctuaries such as Koringa, Kolleru, Krishna, Pulikat and Nelapattu bird sanctuaries. Home to the endangered Olive Ridley turtles and fishing cats, one can also sight several species of birds, including migratory ones, in these areas.

February 4, 2021||Vijayawada||Deadlock over IAS appointments ends||Amaravati: The state election commission has given green signal for the appointment of Vivek Yadav as the district collector of Guntur. The 2008-batch IAS officer would be relieving joint collector AS Dinesh Kumar from additional charge. Yadav is presently serving as a member secretary of the AP Pollution Control Board (PCB) and had worked as joint collector in Guntur in the past. The SEC had initially rejected the panel sent by the government for the appointment of the Guntur district collector and had proposed the name of TTD’s joint executive officer, Basanth Kumar, for the post. However, the government did not relent and refuse to issue a GO appointing Basanth Kumar as district collector as his name was not in the panel sent by the government. Stating that SEC had to pick up one of the officers from the panel sent by the government, chief secretary Dr Aditya Nath Das sent a fresh panel to the SEC. Ending the suspense, SEC agreed for the appointment of Vivek Yadav as district collector. The appointment of a new collector was necessitated following the transfer of incumbent collector Samuel Anand Kumar by SEC. The SEC had also transferred Chittoor district collector Narayana Bharath Gupta and Tirupati urban SP Avula Ramesh Reddy. While Ch Appala Naidu was appointed as Tirupati urban SP, SEC had delayed clearing the panel for Chittoor collector as well. Subsequently, it cleared the name of Harinarayan as new collector to handle the elections to local bodies. Meanwhile, the government has asked environment secretary GSRKR Vijay Kumar to take additional charge of member secretary of APPCB. He was relieved from the post of commissioner and director of municipal administration (CDMA). Municipal administration principal secretary Y Srilakshmi was asked to handle additional charge of CDMA till further orders. Special chief secretary (revenue) Rajath Bhargav was asked to take additional charge of commissioner, excise and prohibition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/deadlock-over-ias-appointments-ends/articleshow/80675854.cms||Samdani MN
February 4, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: No HC relief for man who faked identity to sexually exploit woman||NEW DELHI: A man who faked his identity to allegedly sexually exploit a woman for years on the false promise of marriage will now be tried for rape, even though the couple claimed to have reached a compromise. Delhi High Court this week dismissed a plea to quash the FIR registered for rape and forgery, after it found that the accused, Akhtar, not only forged his marriage certificate but also Aadhaar card. “It is the allegation of the complainant that the petitioner Akhtar falsely represented himself as Shiva and promised marriage to her and had a physical relationship with her. The marriage certificate is found to be a fake one and in any event, the petitioner could not have married her in Arya Samaj Mandir according to Hindu Vedic rites and customs,” justice Subramonium Prasad noted, rejecting the compromise bid. The couple cited a compromise deed where the woman said she had accepted her fate and wanted a peaceful married life with Akhtar. But the court was not convinced. Justice Prasad observed that “it is evident that the petitioner has been accused of serious offences like rape and forgery having a bearing on vital societal interest and these offences cannot be construed to be merely private or civil disputes but rather will have an effect on the society at large. In crimes, which seriously endanger the well-being of the society, it is not safe to leave the crime doer only because he and the victim have settled the dispute amicably.” According to the FIR lodged in December last year at Prem Nagar police station, the woman complained that Akhtar met her posing as Shiva and he promised to marry her five years ago. The couple had a physical relationship but the woman was shocked to realise his identity as Akhtar when he disclosed it after marrying her at a temple. The woman also claimed in the FIR that after the marriage, the accused started demanding money and when she visited his parents, she was driven away by them. Nearly a month after recording her statement before a magistrate, the woman agreed to a compromise deed. In its probe report, police told the court that the accused hid his identity and was sexually exploiting the victim for five years. They further alleged Akhtar even forged his marriage certificate and had two Aadhar cards—one in the name of Shiva and the other as Akhtar. “This court is not in a position to quash the FIR on the basis of compromise entered into between the parties where it is stated that the accused and the complaint have decided to stay as husband and wife and lead their peaceful marital life,” the high court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-hc-relief-for-man-who-faked-identity-to-sexually-exploit-woman/articleshow/80676589.cms||Abhinav Garg

February 4, 2021||Vijayawada||Treasure gangs target ancient idols in AP & Telangana||VIJAYAWADA: Police have revealed that several inter-state treasure trove gangs are on the prowl between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. During the interrogation of the seven-member treasure trove gang involved in vandalising the Nandi idol of Makapet Kasi Visweswara temple, police personnel learnt that several inter-state treasure trove gangs are operating across the Telugu states. Speaking at the press conference on January 22, Krishna district SP M Ravindranath Babu said that they have identified around 100 people indulging in treasure hunting across the region. However, cops explained that the number of people indulging in this type of illegal activity could be close to 300 as they believe several miscreants come in from other neighbouring states as well. Police acknowledge that treasure trove gangs usually operate in Rayalaseema but have now expanded across Guntur and Krishna region. During the press conference, cops showed the video footage taken by the seven-member gang which not includes the Nandi idol but also other temples in Guntur district. “We have taken cognizance of these gangs whom we found conducting recces across different temples believing in myths and superstitions,” Ravindranath Babu said. Explaining the modus operandi, cops said that some of these gangs don’t just focus on digging up the temple premises but also to break the idols to see if there are any treasures within them. “By and large they have been unsuccessful but perhaps in one or two cases they may get something like coins and other valuables which may not be worth the effort,” a senior police officer said. Among the 44 temple-related cases focused by the Special Investigation Team (SIT), seven of them so far have been committed by treasure trove gangs where over 42 persons have already been arrested. “Some of the false myths are being circulated amongst villagers where they believe that some of these ancient temples might have been built with hidden treasures kept as its foundation by different kinds of dynasties. So far, nothing has been detected by the criminals officials,” the senior police officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/treasure-gangs-target-ancient-idols-in-ap-t/articleshow/80675386.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
February 4, 2021||Vadodara||Baroda skipper hopes for IPL call after a decade||Vadodara: He created history when he became the first player in the country to reach the 2,000 runs milestone in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy (SMAT) this season. Baroda skipper, Kedar Devdhar didn’t just play some brilliant knocks but also took his team to the finals displaying some fine captaincy skills. And Devdhar is expecting that the Indian Premier League (IPL) teams will finally sit up and take notice of his consistent performance in the shortest version of the game. “I am hoping that at least in this year’s auction, some team will pick me up. I played some good knocks and became second highest run getter by scoring 349 runs from eight matches this season,” Devdhar told TOI. The 31-year-old, who opens for Baroda, played a smashing innings to score an unbeaten 99 from 71 deliveries against Maharashtra. But when the target was low, Devdhar controlled his strokes against Chandigarh and scored an important 44 runs off 41 balls. What made his performance special this season was that Baroda team had suffered two setbacks during the tourney. Vice-captain Deepak Hooda had walked out of the team on the eve of the tournament due to differences with skipper Krunal Pandya. And Krunal had to leave the team after three games as his father had passed away. “I took up the mantle of skipper and told the boys to play their natural game. It was important to instill confidence in the team,” Devdhar said. The wicket-keeper batsman was picked up by Deccan Chargers in 2011 where he was included in playing 11 for just one game. After that season, Devdhar couldn’t make it to any other team. Despite being highest run scorer in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy three seasons ago, no team noticed his performance. “I was disappointed as such BCCI tournaments are organized for players to showcase their talent. I don’t know why I was ignored by the IPL teams despite performing well with bat. May be, they had different requirements as per their team combination,” he added. “Devdhar is a skilled batsman who can open the innings and keep the wickets too. He would be an asset to any IPL team as he is a thinking cricketer. I hope that he makes it to the IPL this time,” said Shishir Hattangadi, CEO, Baroda Cricket Association (BCA). Devdhar began playing cricket at the age of 14 and picked up cricketing skills at Hindu Gymkhana before switching to Alembic Company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/baroda-skipper-hopes-for-ipl-call-after-a-decade/articleshow/80675012.cms||Tushar Tere

February 4, 2021||Vijayawada||Plea against e-watch app in AP high court||Vijayawada: An advocate moved a lunch motion petition in the high court on Wednesday challenging the usage of e-watch app, which was launched by state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar earlier in the day, and sought urgent hearing on the matter. Advocate Sudhakar sought directions from the court to stop the launch of the app, arguing that the app was developed by private persons and does not have requisite authorisations from regulatory bodies. Any app used by a government agency should be verified by the authorities concerned for safety audit, he said. He further stated that there are other apps in use for lodging complaints during the election process. “While the Election Commission of India had launched an application during the general elections, the state government also developed another app for the same purpose. When two apps are already in use, there is no need for another app,” he argued. Expressing concerns over the app’s safety features, he said its data would be stored in private servers and there is no clarity on what data the app is collecting and what security protocols are in place to prevent data breach and safeguard information. The high court posted the petition for hearing on Thursday. YSRC general secretary Lella Appireddy also filed a complaint with SEC against the app, alleging that it was developed without following regulations. He said the government developed Nigha app during MPTC and ZPTC elections after taking the approval of SEC last year. Earlier, Ramesh Kumar launched the e-watch mobile application to promote accountability in the elections. People can raise complaints concerning panchayat polls through the app and the SEC will take necessary action within the stipulated time, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/plea-against-e-watch-app-in-ap-high-court/articleshow/80675431.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Goa||AAP: CM put party before Mhadei||Panaji: The Aam Aadmi party (AAP) on Tuesday protested in front of the chief minister’s residence in Panaji over the Mhadei issue. The party alleged Sawant “sacrificed Mhadei river for the sake of his party politics”. In a letter to the chief minister, AAP demanded that the document containing written instructions by the state government to counsel Arvind Datar be made public within 24 hours. “If your government claims that the government advocate acted so brazenly without instructions, we seek answers from you on why the Goa government did not make an application to the Supreme Court. Additionally, why has no action been initiated against the lawyer under section 36 of the Advocates Act of the Indian Penal Code?” stated the letter. Goa AAP convenor Rahul Mhambre said the state government has surrendered Goa’s interest and right over Mhadei waters at the behest of the ruling party’s leadership in Delhi. “Mhadei, Goa’s lifeline is being sold to Karnataka just so that the BJP can gain grounds in the state. It is unacceptable that the interests of Goas are being overlooked in order to gain political brownie points,” the letter stated. Mhambre said that it was clear that the government instructed Datar not to appeal against the notification of the Mhadei award before the apex court and stated that no lawyer would take or make a statement without the government’s consent. He also demanded that AAP be a part to the all-party delegation that will call on the Centre over the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-cm-put-party-before-mhadei/articleshow/80678043.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||‘Auxiliary units a lifeline for toy making’||Ahmedabad: Amid a greater push from the government to make India a toy manufacturing hub, The All India Toy Manufacturers’ Association (TAITMA) chief, Manish Kukreja, emphasized on setting up auxiliary units in the country. Kukreja, while addressing a session on ‘Capacity Building in Toy Manufacturing’ at the second edition of the Ahmedabad Design Week (ADW) mentioned that there is hardly any capacity in India to make components for toys and that is a major sector with a huge potential to help the toy market flourish. “Apart from less innovations, one of the key reasons why the manufacturing of toys in India hasn’t picked up pace is the lack of ecosystem around it. In India, we hardly have any manufacturers for toy components and therefore, there is an urgent need to scale up the auxiliary industry in the toy manufacturing set-up,” said the TAITMA chief. Lack of innovations in toy making is hampering the industry’s growth. Design institutes across India have a key role to play in helping toy and game designers get a patent for their innovations, Kukreja said. “The government has done enough by announcing toy manufacturing parks, rationalizing GST rates on toys and even enabling startups to foray into the toy design and manufacturing sector. The onus now lies upon the industry to leverage the opportunity and effectively utilize the ecosystem and platform to help turn India into a global toy manufacturing centre,” he further added. Indian toy manufacturing has a market size of roughly Rs 7,000 crore per annum, and Indian players have barely 10-15% market share in the total consumption here, according to the TAITMA president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/auxiliary-units-a-lifeline-for-toy-making/articleshow/80676619.cms||Niyati Parikh
February 4, 2021||Delhi||Delhi: Gangster who shot cop killed in face-off||NEW DELHI: Five months after a constable was killed during a robbery, Special Cell of Delhi Police tracked down notorious interstate gangster Javed Rashid and shot him dead during a face-off late on Tuesday. The encounter took place in Baraut of Uttar Pradesh. A 9mm carbine and a .32 bore pistol was seized by a team led by ACP Attar Singh and inspector Shiv Kumar, along with over two dozen bullets amid heavy gunfire with the gangster that lasted for three-four minutes. Rashid was wanted in 21 cases of murder and robbery, 13 of them being in Delhi. This led to UP Police declaring a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head. In 2019, Rashid was involved in the gang rape of a girl at gunpoint in northeast Delhi. The manhunt intensified after September 7, 2020, when he gunned down constable Manish Yadav. Rashid and his three associates — Imran, Nadeem and Hasan — had waylaid Yadav in Singhawali of Baghpat. The constable was going to his village on his bike after finishing his duty. The accused threatened Yadav at gunpoint and asked him to hand over his belongings. When the policeman resisted, the goons fired at him and looted his pistol, Rs 20,000 and other articles, including his service ID card. Leaving the severely injured cop bleeding, the criminals fled the spot on two bikes. Yadav was later rushed to a hospital, but was declared dead. A non-bailable warrant was issued against the gang and inspector Kumar and his team started conducting raids to nab the gangster. Surveillance was kept on Rashid’s possible hideouts and his associates in Delhi and UP. After more than three months, he was traced to Baraut. At 10.25pm on Tuesday, an informer identified Rashid in a Santro, after which it was flagged down by a police team. The driver tried to speed away from the police cordon, but he was cornered after a chase. Subsequently, Rashid and his associate got off the car and started firing at the policemen. While his associate managed to escape in the dark, Rashid got hit in retaliatory firing by police. Though Rashid was rushed to the nearest hospital, he could not survive. Police are now hunting for his associates. Investigation revealed that in the week that Rashid had killed the constable, he committed two other robberies during which he brutally attacked the victims to instil fear in their mind. The first incident took place on September 1 and the other on September 6. Rashid took to crime in 2001 and was arrested for possession of an illegal weapon. Subsequently, he took to serious crimes after making contacts in jail. He was arrested multiple times in the last two decades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gangster-who-shot-cop-killed-in-face-off/articleshow/80676734.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||BDMA members upset over steep hike in trade licence fee||Hyderabad: Bulk Drug Manufacturers’ Association members are upset with the industries department over the steep hike in licence fee. The state has hiked trade licence fee from Rs 7,000 per year to Rs 37 lakh per year, depending on the area. Pharma players say “the hike is too exorbitant and it will wean away pharma industries” from the state. Telangana had recently fixed trade licence fee. Industrial establishments have to pay minimum rate of licence fee, which is Rs 4 per square feet to Rs 7 per square feet for built up area, including manufacturing blocks, quality control buildings, sheds, solvent storage area, boiler house and administrative blocks, depending on the size of the unit—small, medium or large. “Bulk drug and pharma is the core industry in the state producing essential drugs meeting the national demand and also exporting to various countries. We are in the core sector and the biggest contributor to the state revenue in terms of manufacturing and taxes,” BDMA national president V V Krishna Reddy said. “The factory area in bulk drug and pharma units range from one acre to around 20 acres depending on the size of the unit. Assuming 60% constructed area of factory buildings and utility blocks, the area for calculation of trade licence as per the new GO works out to 0.6 to 12 acres, which translates to 26,136 to 5,22,720 sq ft. The new annual trade licence as per the GO works out as Rs 26,136 to Rs 36 lakh,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bdma-members-upset-over-steep-hike-in-trade-licence-fee/articleshow/80676622.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

It found only two ineligible bidders last month, forcing the administration to recall the tender on Friday and issue fresh dates for submission of bids. Civic officials said the project was initiated in 2016 but an expression of interest was issued only in 2019, and then too NMMC dragged its feet. A CCTV component-maker wrote to state officials alleging that tender conditions favoured select original equipment manufacturers. NMMC had to issue several corrigenda following the allegations and local public representatives got into the fray. TimesViewProjects with larger public interest cannot be held ransom to bureaucratic delays and vested interests. CCTV surveillance projects are not among the most complicated to execute, as cities across the country and world have executed them well. For a city, which is next door to Mumbai, and touts itself to be a smart city, CCTV surveillance should have been an integral part of the city long back.The surveillance project entails installing 1,500 cameras, which include high definition (HD) and high-speed (HS) cameras, besides cameras with automatic number plate recognition features at entry/exit points of the city and across the city. While CCTV projects have helped control crime and traffic in cities, NMMC till recently did not show urgency in executing the project. The pre-bid meeting was attended by 120 prospective bidders but after the request for proposal was issued, some sought relaxation in conditions. A component manufacturer alleged the project was not approved by state home department and information technology department, and tender conditions were manipulated by NMMC officials to favour some original equipment manufacturers. NMMC officials claimed the project was being financed using corporation funds and the project did not require state government approval; Navi Mumbai Police have been involved in stipulating conditions and specifications for the project too. “We ensured the tender document is according to government guidelines, with stringent quality norms. We will ensure due process is followed in letter and spirit,” said NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar.

February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||Wife learns of man’s affair, deserted||Ahmedabad: A 30-year-old woman from Chandkheda on Tuesday filed a police complaint alleging that her husband abandoned her and their one-and-a-half-year-old daughter after she found out that he had an extra-marital relationship in December. According to the woman’s complaint, she worked for a private firm near Income Tax Circle since 2016 where she met the accused. They fell in love and got married in January 2018. They then moved to the husband’s place in Bhavnagar. Soon after the wedding, her husband began staying away from home. Whenever she asked him, he told her he had to travel for work and it was not possible for him to stay home all the time. Meanwhile, her mother-in-law, who was aggrieved about her son’s marriage, used to taunt her about her looks and for not getting a big enough dowry. She alleged that her mother-in-law used to instigate the accused to beat her and she was often subjected to domestic violence. She stated that her husband dropped her off at her mother’s place in June 2020, saying he would get her back once his mother calmed down. As he did not take her home for six months, she checked his emails and found objectionable pictures of him with another woman. When she raised this issue, he threatened her and said he would never take her to his home. The woman waited for long to settle the issue but her husband continued to maintain his relationship with the other woman. She then approached Chandkheda police and filed a complaint of domestic violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wife-learns-of-mans-affair-deserted/articleshow/80676665.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Aurangabad||Manohare is Aurangabad smart city’s full-time CEO||Aurangabad: The state government has issued orders transferring Nagpur revenue divisional commissionerate-based assistant director of municipal councils Babasaheb Manohare as the full-time CEO of the Aurangabad smart city. The order signed by state additional secretary Sachin Sahastrabudhe was issued on February 1. Manohare, who has been promoted and posted, said, “As per the state government orders as well as directives from the urban development department, I have reached the city to take charge as CEO of Aurangabad Smart City. I will take forward all the good works that have been initiated by Astik Kumar Pandey.” However, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation officials said that Pandey, on Wednesday, wrote a letter to the urban development department registering his objection to the orders appointing Manohare as the fulltime CEO of the smart city. Pandey is said to have sent the letter citing a communication (dated June 18, 2016) and stating that the post of the smart city CEO on priority will remain with an officer of IAS cadre. Since taking charge of the AMC in December 2019, Pandey has been shouldering the additional charge of the smart city. During his term, he launched a series of projects including the smart city headquarters operations command centre (OCC), integrated municipal e-governance system, smart mobility, master system integrator, construction of 150 bus shelters on PPP basis, conservation of historical gates as well as Shahgunj clock tower.  The smart city team, during the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, had also played a very crucial role in identification and admission of the people infected with the coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/manohare-is-aurangabad-smart-citys-full-time-ceo/articleshow/80673880.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

February 4, 2021||Goa||Violent behaviour can’t be part of police force: HC||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has upheld the decision of the government to scrap the selection of a candidate to the post of sub inspector even though he was exonerated by court in three criminal cases registered against him. The court observed that “violent behaviour” of a candidate would not justify his appointment in the disciplined police force. Referring to the petitioner’s plea that the incidents had occurred at the spur of the moment, a division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and Bharati H Dangre held that the cases registered against the petitioner in which he had a tiff with law is reflective of his errant, unruly, rebellious behaviour demonstrating no respect for law. The court noted that the verification of character and the antecedents is one of the important criteria to test whether the candidate is suitable for appointment in the police department. The court remarked that just because he was acquitted or discharged in a criminal case does not exonerate him completely but on the benefit of doubt he has secured the acquittal. It further said that “at a situation, police personnel would have to retain his poise and stature even if he is dealing with the most heinous and cantankerous criminal. The nature of hostility is not affordable to police personnel.” Netajirao Prabhudessai had approached the court after he was not selected under the category of the freedom fighters in 2013. His name appeared in the select list and he was given an offer of appointment. The petition states that when 87 selected candidates were directed to report for training by letter dated Dec 25, 2013, he was not issued an order of appointment. On July 16, 2014, it was informed to the petitioner that a decision has been taken not to appoint him. Petitioner’s counsel Ryan Menezes argued that his client was acquitted in one case and has been discharged in the other case. In the third case, there was a compromise effected and, therefore, the prosecution did not proceed, he added. He further said that perusal of the FIRs in all the cases would disclose that the incident had occurred at the spur of the moment and he is not, in any case, a hardened criminal but only a candidate with criminal antecedents. Additional government advocate, Sagar Dhargalkar pointed out that the criminal cases registered against the petitioner render him unfit for being appointed to a disciplined force like the police department. He said that a candidate, who is recruited to the police service, must be worthy of confidence, of impeccable character and integrity. He submitted that the persons who are likely to erode the credibility of the police ought not to enter the police force. “Though the justification offered by the petitioner that the incident had occurred at the spur of the moment, in the background of such a nature of the petitioner and which has been recorded in the noting to be a violent behaviour would not justify his appointment in a disciplined force,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/violent-behaviour-cant-be-part-of-police-force-hc/articleshow/80678050.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Munde case: Elder sister demands custody of 2 kids||Mumbai: A week after a woman withdrew her complaint against social justice minister Dhananjay Munde, he appears to be in fresh trouble as her elder sister, who was in a relationship with him, has demanded custody of her two children, who are with him. The elder sister approached the police commissioner and director-general of police to press for her demand. She complained that Munde has been harassing her and the children are in his illegal custody. In her five-page complaint to the police commissioner, she narrated the sequence of events since she first me him. “My children are in illegal custody of Munde, he is not allowing me to talk to or meet them. I am worried about their security and safety,’’ she said. Her younger sister had on January 12 lodged a complaint against Munde, claiming she was sexually assaulted over a prolonged period. She withdrew her complaint after two leading politicians, including BJP’s Krishna Hegde, disclosed that she was blackmailing him for three to four years. Munde denied the charges, saying, following a petition filed by him, the high court has referred the case for mediation by V K Tahilramani, former Chief Justice of Madras HC, it was wrong to approach the media against him. “All issues, including custody of children, are being mediated. Under such circumstances, the case is sub judice. The decision by the judge will be final and binding on us,’’ Munde said in a statement. Munde said he had approached Bombay HC to resolve the dispute between him and the woman, so a mediator was appointed. “Justice Tahilramani held two meetings, while the third is scheduled on February 13. I am sure the row over custody will be resolved at the meeting. Under such circumstances, the complaint to the police chief was an attempt to defame me and resort to a media trial,’’ Munde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/munde-case-elder-sister-demands-custody-of-2-kids/articleshow/80675973.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Chanda Kochhar appears to have misused her post: PMLA court||MUMBAI: In a detailed order, a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court has held that it appeared former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar had misused her official position in granting loans to V N Dhoot of Videocon group companies and got illegal gains through her husband, Deepak Kochhar. Taking cognisance of the Enforcement Directorate’s chargesheet against the trio, the court said the material gathered and produced by the investigating agency constitutes offences under PMLA. “I am of the opinion that this material is sufficient to proceed against the accused persons,” the court said. The court also said ED was granted leave to continue with the ongoing investigation and to take action as per law. While Deepak Kochhar is in custody, Chanda Kochhar and Dhoot will have to appear before the court on February 12. Chanda Kochhar took charge of ICICI Bank as its managing director and CEO in May 2009, after which she allegedly illegally sanctioned loans to Videocon group companies. The loans of Rs 1,875 crore to the Videocon group companies allegedly turned into non-performing assets (NPA) in 2017 and caused losses to the bank. It is alleged in lieu of the loans, Chanda Kochhar received Rs 64 crore kickbacks through her husband’s company Nupower Renewables from the Videocon group.  ED has alleged that Chanda Kochhar and her family had “enjoyed facilities” from the co-accused Dhoot. “The flat situated at CCI, Mumbai, was purchased by the family trust of Chanda Kochhar from proceeds of the crime for a minuscule sum of Rs 11 lakh, when the actual price of the flat was around Rs 5 crore,” ED alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kochhar-appears-to-have-misused-her-post-pmla-court/articleshow/80676709.cms||Rebecca Samervel
February 4, 2021||Gurgaon||Haryana: Rera says project not registered in notice to Adani firm, brokers||GURUGRAM: The state real estate regulator has issued a notice to Adani M2K Projects LLP and real estate brokers Neeraj Associates for allegedly violating the provisions of H-Rera Act. The real estate authority observed that the promoter has neither applied for registration of the project nor submitted the requisite documents of the property which is being built by them. The real estate agent also tried to sell projects that are not registered with the authority, it said. Taking serious note of the violations, the authority has ordered initiation of penal proceedings against the promoter and the brokers. For these violations, a penalty of Rs 12 crore may be imposed on the promoter and Rs 2.7 crore on the real estate agent. H-Rera chairman KK Khandelwal said an odd trend has been observed in the promoter’s advertisements, marketing and sale of the units — both online and offline. The real estate Act makes it mandatory for all commercial and residential real estate projects, which are built on plots over 500 sqm, to register with the authority before launching those in order to provide greater transparency. “It has been observed that promoters such as Adani M2K Projects LLP and various others despite falling within this category and having similar specifications of their properties are not getting their projects registered,” said Khandelwal. He said this clearly invites criminal proceedings against the promoters for non-compliance of the directions on the registry of the projects under Section 59(2) of the Rera Act. The authority served a show cause notice on the promoter and directed it to produce records pertaining to the property they have sold as required under Section 3 and also under Section 59(1) of the Rera Act. He also said not only the promoters but real estate agents are also getting involved in such “unscrupulous activities”. Adani Realty M2K spokesperson denied promoting its projects without necessary approvals. “Following the media reports on one of our projects in Gurugram, we have come to know about the concerns expressed by Haryana Rera. We will engage with the authorities to cooperate in the matter. Adani Realty M2K does not promote or market projects without the mandatory approvals from the respective authorities as per the standard operating procedures. Our well executed projects and track record are a testimony of our commitment towards the customers and established guidelines,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/rera-says-project-not-registered-in-notice-to-adani-firm-brokers/articleshow/80678058.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh
February 4, 2021||Aurangabad||Back from Pakistan jail, Aurangabad woman finds land encroached upon||AURANGABAD: Hasina Begam (65), jailed in Pakistan for 18 long years, had exclaimed that she felt like she had entered paradise when she got down from the train at the Aurangabad railway station on January 26. However, her joy was dampened a few days later when she learnt that her plot of land in Aurangabad, the records of which had helped the police establish her identity, has been encroached upon. Begam’s name had got deleted from the voters’ list over the years after she was not found to be residing at her husband’s home in Saharanpur (UP) or even in her native Aurangabad. In the absence of any identity proof, the police traced the registration of the 600 sq ft plot in her name to establish her identity and facilitate her return to India. She had purchased the land in 2000. “I fought the Pakistan government for 18 years. I will also fight the land sharks and get back my plot, which I had bought with my hard-earned money,” Begam told TOI. Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta said, “This is serious. We will coordinate with the Aurangabad municipal commissioner as well as the district collector to ensure that the encroachment is removed from the plot.” Since her return, Begam has been living with her nephew Zainuddin Chishti in a rented one-room-kitchen accomodation in the Rashidpura area of the city. Chishti said, “I could not remember the exact location of the plot that she had purchased. The police dug out copies of the registration and went to the plot, only to find that a suspected land shark has built his house there.” Chishti reached out to the police commissionerate and got his aunt’s application inwarded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/back-from-pak-jail-woman-finds-land-encroached-upon/articleshow/80673886.cms||Mohammed Akhef

February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Only 6 papers for SSC students||Hyderabad: Providing a little relief to students, the Telangana government has reduced the number of papers in SSC Public Examinations from 11 to six in view of Covid-19.

February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vehicles charged entry fee at airport cargo complex; one held||MUMBAI: One person was arrested and released on bail, while two are absconding following complaints against them for extorting money after stopping vehicles registered outside Mumbai from entering the airport cargo complex here. The arrests came after two truck drivers complained that transport unions at the complex were illegally charging an entry fee of Rs1,000 from each truck with a non-Mumbai registration number. “The money was collected to buy sanitizers and other equipment, claimed Mahesh Singh (49), who was arrested for extortion. Two more are wanted. The duo applied for interim bail,” police said. Singh was released on bail four days after he was arrested on January 22. Sahar police senior inspector Dinkar Shilvate said investigations were in a preliminary stage. An aviation source said, “Four transport union leaders, belonging to political parties, met at a local five-star hotel in January and decided to charge the illegal entry fee.” It was arbitrary, he said, adding that a union leader who belongs to a major political party has 40 vehicles registered outside Mumbai. “He complained about it to the syndicate and they let his vehicles in free. Others were stopped from entering the complex,’’ said the source. The unions collected around Rs50,000 a day, the source added. Cargo agents and others filed a complaint with the chief commissioner of Customs. Deputy commissioner of customs Venkatesh Jadhav took up the matter with the deputy commissioner of police on January 19. “Some are obstructing entry of trucks and tempos, which is affecting clearance in Customs. They are demanding unauthorised fees for entry into the air cargo complex,’’ Jadhav wrote to police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vehicles-from-outside-mumbai-charged-entry-fee-at-airport-cargo-complex-1-held/articleshow/80675975.cms||Manju V

The library, which is a brainchild of Class VI student Mariam Mirza, has a collection of around 300 books exclusively for children.Mirza Abdul Kayam of ‘Read and Lead Foundation’ said his daughter had a collection of books, which she decided to utilise for the benefit of the public.“I am associated with the movement aimed at increasing reading habits among the people and readily agreed with Mariam’s idea.

February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||Silver imports down 78% in January||Ahmedabad: As silver price inched upwards in January 2021, the imports of silver plunged to a four-month low level to settle at 0.29 metric tonnes. This means, silver imports declined 78% year-on-year against 1.34 MT imports in January 2020, according to data provided by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex. High price of silver which crossed Rs 70,000 per kg caused a sharp decline in imports of silver, with not just domestic but even industrial demand taking a hit. “As silver prices were up, fresh investments in silver declined drastically. Moreover, a significant chunk of silver is procured for industrial purposes as well, which also plunged. As a result, overall silver purchases showed a decline,” said an Ahmedabad-based bullion trader. Even month-on-month, silver imports declined by 81% against some 1.52 MT silver imported in December 2020. Silver price settled at Rs 67,500 per kg on Wednesday. This means silver price declined by Rs 5,500 against in merely two days from its peak of Rs 73,000 per kg on Monday – February 1. The recent reduction in the basic Customs duty on silver led to hefty profit booking by investors. Basic Customs duty on silver and gold was reduced from 12.5% to 7.5% in the recent Union budget announcement. However, agriculture infrastructure cess of 2.5% was also imposed on silver and gold. “As soon as the budget announcement came in, there was hefty profit booking of silver, as those who had invested during the time of demonetization, when price had skyrocketed, sold off silver heavily to book profits. Profit booking coupled with duty cut has started bringing down silver price,” said Hemant Choksi, a city-based bullion trader. If silver prices plunge further, bullion traders see better demand in the months to come. “With plunging prices, industrial demand may see a significant improvement. However, as far as investors are concerned, the situation is quite uncertain,” said Choksi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/silver-imports-down-78-in-january/articleshow/80676737.cms||Niyati Parikh
February 4, 2021||Chennai||In Ambattur, flora attracts the fauna||CHENNAI: A Miyawaki forest set up by Greater Chennai Corporation in Ambattur has drawn moths and other insects in neighbouring Kamarajar Nagar and Manoorpettai areas. While nearby residents said they were unable to keep their windows and doors open in the evening, the development has made nature enthusiasts happy as insects are a key contributor to biodiversity. Last year, around five acres of land belonging to Perambur Railway Integral Coach Factory was converted into a Miyawaki forest. P Mathiazhagan, a resident from Manoorpettai, said 40 houses at Kamrajar Nagar, 200m from the forest, have been affected as insects have now started to enter rooms. Complaints made to railways went unanswered and residents approached the corporation’s Ambattur zonal office. Residents said corporation workers sprayed insecticides which kept the insects away two days. “After that they returned. We have got plastic sprayers and spray detergent water on the insects to keep them away,” Mathiazhagan said. A senior corporation official from Ambattur zone said the houses were far away from the forest and it was not possible for the insects to fly that distance. He, however, said complaints will be resolved. Terming such complaints from residents “unacceptable”, G Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal, an environmental organisation, said it was natural for forests to attract insects. “Though some efforts can be taken to minimize the impact, people should accept the fact that biodiversity encompasses all living things including insects, birds, animals and human beings.” He, however, questioned the need to spend so much on the Miyawaki method. “Though corporation need not disown it, it can restrict Miyawaki method to areas where setting up natural forests is difficult,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/in-ambattur-flora-attracts-the-fauna/articleshow/80675161.cms||Ram Sundaram
February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||CNG sales in state dipped by 32% in April-Sept||Ahmedabad: The sales of compressed natural gas (CNG) declined by 32% across Gujarat during the first two quarters of the current fiscal. Consumption, however, has recovered in the third quarter, but it is yet to reach pre-Covid levels. The provisional sales of CNG within the state stood at 252 TMT (thousand metric tonnes) in April-September 2020, substantially down in comparison to the sales of 367 TMT for the same period in 2019, shows a report by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas (MoPNG). The CNG sales are primarily driven by autorickshaws, school vans, public transport, and cabs, including those operated by aggregators. All these modes of transport, according to the industry players, were hit hard due to the lockdown and subsequent restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus. The reduction in tourism activity coupled with the Covid-19 induced slowdown further dented the CNG sales. “The CNG sales were adversely impacted as a large number of rickshaws remained off-road during April-September period,” said Arvind Thakkar, president, Federation of Gujarat State Petroleum Dealers Associations (FGPDA). Rickshaws account for a significant chunk of CNG consumption. “At least 70% autorickshaws shuttle on select routes ferrying multiple passengers for little cost.  People have stopped moving out frequently or at least reduced their preference for autorickshaws. This leaves meagre earnings for autorickshaw drivers in Ahmedabad and the number of rickshaws ferrying on roads has declined,” said Rajvir Upadhyay, president, Jagrut Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union. “Apart from autos, CNG is widely used in vehicles, especially for vans ferrying school students. These have stopped since schools were closed. Tourism activity is also subdued, which has further contributed to the dampened sales of CNG,” he added. The impact on CNG sales was higher in cities such as Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot than in smaller towns and rural areas of the state, said industry players. The CNG consumption, however, has now started improving since September. According to Adani Total Gas Limited, one of the leading city gas distribution companies in India, its CNG sales were down by only 9% in the third quarter ended December 2020. The drop was steeper at 21% and 66% in the second and first quarter, respectively. At 709, Gujarat has the highest number of CNG stations in the country. With public movement gradually increasing following the reduction in Covid-19 cases and steady recovery in economy, the CNG sales are expected to get normalized from April, said market experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cng-sales-in-state-dipped-by-32-in-april-sept/articleshow/80676759.cms||Kalpesh Damor

February 4, 2021||Madurai||With lesser flights, hotel occupancy dips||Madurai:Occupancy of hotel rooms is yet to improve in Madurai city, although the food and beverages section is slowly picking up with family functions and events. People in the hotel industry said that room occupancy is still around 30% of the total capacity across a range of hotels in the city. There is no revival in sight as fewer domestic flights are being operated. It will take more time for international flight operations to begin. Hotel industry was disappointed as there was no relief given to the sector in the Union budget, although they had submitted a memorandum seeking relief through its national bodies. “People are still afraid of traveling outside the state as Covid-19 pandemic has not ended. Hotels in Madurai are seeing fewer bookings. It will take more time for the situation to improve,” S Senthil Nathan, director (operation) Germanus Hotel, Madurai city, said. G Raveendran, president of Travel Club said room occupancy goes up only on muhurtham days. He, however, said people book halls for hosting parties and conducting family functions. The government should carry out promotional activities to instill confidence among visitors, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/with-lesser-flights-hotel-occupancy-dips/articleshow/80678048.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Delhi||DPCC finds effluent treatment plants at just four parks in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Landowning agencies were directed in 2019 to include environmental management in their existing policies and to ensure effluent treatment plants (ETP) were installed in all parks and open grounds holding marriage and other functions. However, a recent inspection by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has found that no park is following the guidelines. The inspection found only four locations—all in Rajouri Garden—had installed the ETP. The pollution control committee has recommended the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to ensure compliance. Times ViewDelhi’s pollution problems make international headlines. Those in authority often speak of working towards reducing environmental hazards. But this is a glaring example of how nobody seems to walk the talk. Lax agencies must be taken to task and effluent treatment plants installed fast.In a report submitted to the NGT, DPCC said directions had been issued to all landowning agencies on December 13, 2019, asking them to ensure environmental management for all open grounds holding social, cultural, commercial and marriage or any other functions. “A reminder of the direction was issued on January 21, 2021 to the landowning agencies for submission of an action taken report along with the list of the grounds where such functions are allowed. However, no compliance report has been received till date,” said the DPCC report. Random inspections were carried out by DPCC teams in the months of December 2020 and January 2021 across Delhi, however, no compliance was observed. “During the inspections conducted, nowhere in the open grounds for marriages, ETP was found installed except at places in Rajouri Garden where tent houses have installed ETP and have also obtained consent from DPCC,” said DPCC in its letter. “At present, functions are being allowed with restrictions imposed by DDMA, which allows a maximum capacity of 50% of the total hall capacity in closed spaces,” the report adds. Such events have a ceiling of 200 people. Wearing of face masks and following other Covid norms are also required. The restrictions on gatherings in open spaces were lifted recently. A DPCC official said random inspections might take place again, however, landowning agencies were required to comply with the norms, for which a status report has been submitted to the NGT. “Based on our letters, the landowning agencies need to submit a report to us to show compliance. So far, no such reports have been received,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dpcc-finds-effluent-treatment-plants-at-just-four-parks-in-city/articleshow/80676767.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||Why not toys of Indian icons? Experts at ADW ask||Ahmedabad: Raising a poignant question as to why toys available in India represent characters like Hulk and Barbies but not Bheem, Eklavya or any of the national icons, experts present at the inaugural session of Ahmedabad Design Week (ADW) on Wednesday, underlined the need for references to Indian culture in toys. Pushing for ‘Designed in India’ and ‘Invented in India’ for toy manufacturing in the country, Dr Raghunath Mashelkar, president, Indian National Science Academy, emphasized on drawing inspiration for designing toys from Indian culture and heritage to make them distinctive. Mashelkar was the chief guest at the inaugural ceremony of the second edition of ADW held virtually on Wednesday, on the theme ‘Toying with Design’. “India can draw inspiration from its culture, heritage, its national icons and civilizations to bring in novelty in making toys,” he said, during the keynote address. “The country has given the world ancient texts, icons like Buddha, Rama, Krishna and legendary people like Gandhi and Sardar. It may also have toys that replicate these idols,” said Anju Sharma IAS, principal secretary, higher and technical education, government of Gujarat. Echoing a similar view, Dr Himanshu Pandya, vice-chancellor of Gujarat University, also said, “We must value our worth. We’re the biggest market in the world, but we must be the biggest producers of the world by indigenisation of our world. Why can’t we propagate Eklavya and Bheem through toys instead of Hulk? Our own understanding of being Indian is very important.” Raghunath also said, “The global scene is changing now, and people are moving away from China. We must leverage this opportunity with a combination of national initiative (from the industry) and through a sound policy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-not-toys-of-indian-icons-experts-at-adw-ask/articleshow/80676766.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Goa||Celebrate Mapusa Shigmo under tourism dept: Committee||Saligao: The Mapusa Shigmotsav Committee on Tuesday called upon local MLA Joshua D’Souza, demanding that he should request the chief minister that the Mapusa shigmo parade too should be celebrated under the tourism department. This year, the state government has announced that the Shigmostav in three places - Panaji, Ponda and Margao – would be celebrated under the tourism department. As the Shigmo parade of Mapusa town does not feature in the list, the chairperson of last year’s Shigmostav committee Gurudas Natekar met the MLA to raise the issue. Members of the Shigmotsav committee Sadanand Shet Narvekar, Mohan Kanekar and Prakash Dhumal were also present at the meeting with D’Souza, at his residence, on Tuesday morning. The delegation told the MLA that the Shigmostav is being celebrated in Mapusa under the tourism department for several years and this year the people of Mapusa and the surrounding villages are expressing their displeasure over the exclusion of the town. D’Souza assured the committee that he would take up the issue with chief minister Pramod Sawant and request him not move away from this tradition.

February 4, 2021||Aurangabad||Scholarships to be given on basis of online attendance||Aurangabad: The state social justice department, in a major relief to students belonging to the schedule caste (SC) category, on Wednesday announced that beneficiaries of different post-matric scholarships and free-ships will get their dues for the 2020-21 academic year on the basis of online attendance.In a letter addressed to the social welfare commissionerate, the state government has conveyed its resolve to this effect citing the outbreak of Covid-19. The eligible students having more than 75% online attendance in colleges will be granted the scholarships and free-ships.“Academic activities in institutions of higher learning have been started during the unlock procedure announced by the government in a phased manner. In a relaxed condition, the state government did not mandate physical presence of students in classroom and asked to conduct online classes. Therefore, such online attendance of students will be considered for issuing post-matric scholarships,” Chandrakant Wade, desk officer with the social justice department said in a communication with the social welfare commissionerate.Social activist Vishnu Dhobale said the decision to grant scholarships and free-ships to students on the basis of their virtual presence would boost the morale of beneficiary students belonging to the weaker section of the society. “The weaker sections of the society were worst hit due to Covid-19 and timely help from the government would ensure beneficiary students to continue their studies despite crisis situation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scholarships-to-be-given-on-basis-of-online-attendance/articleshow/80673922.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Chennai||Four, including preacher, kidnap truck driver; held||CHENNAI: Four people, including a preacher, were arrested for kidnapping a truck driver near Poonamallee on Tuesday night and demanding ransom, police said. Preacher Mohandoss, who runs a small church in Vyasarpadi, was on his way to Poonamallee when a truck brushed against his vehicle near Nazarethpet. Mohandoss chased down the truck and made the driver, Manikandan, pull over. Following a minor squabble, Manikandan agreed to compensate Mohandoss for the damage to his vehicle. He spoke to the truck owner and settled on a sum of Rs 3,000. Mohandoss refused the money, but asked Manikandan to accompany him to a mechanic shed at Madhavaram and pay for getting the car fixed. On the pretext of taking Manikandan to Madhavaram, Mohandoss took him to Vysarpadi. He then called the truck owner and demanded Rs 30,000 for the driver’s release. Mohandoss and his aides Issac, Jeeva and Anbu refused to negotiate with the owner. The owner informed police who traced the gang and nabbed the accused. The men were handed over to the Nazarethpet police. A kidnapping case was registered against all four accused and a court sent them to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/four-held-for-abducting-trucker-demanding-ransom/articleshow/80675168.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Aurangabad||Roll back fuel price hike: AAP||Aurangabad: The local unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) staged an agitation on Wednesday to protest against the latest hike in fuel prices. AAP Marathwada president Subhash Mane said the surge in fuel price has a cascading effect, leading to inflation. “The rise in the prices of diesel and petrol is directly linked to inflation as the transportation cost in general increases. While the Covid-19 outbreak has already broken the common man’s back, the fuel price hikes are proving to be an additional blow,” he said. Mane accused the Centre of acting in the benefit of a “chosen few” instead of protecting the interests of many. “Even if the fuel prices are impacted by global market forces, the government can intervene and minimise the effect for the benefit of the common man. The Centre, however, has no such intensions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/roll-back-fuel-price-hike-aap/articleshow/80673912.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Bhopal||Budget will pave way for Atmanirbhar MP, says Chouhan||Bhopal: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday said that this year's state budget will unleash revolutionary reforms in the economy of Madhya Pradesh and pave way for the creation of ‘Atmanirbhar MP’. Chouhan was holding pre-budget talks through video conferencing with economic experts and various stake-holders at the Mantralaya. He said that the valuable suggestions received from them would be incorporated in the budget. AIIMS Bhopal director Prof Sarman Singh suggested that three to four new oxygen plants should be installed in MP and pharma companies should be encouraged. MP Nursing Home Association president Dr Jitendra Jamdar, said efforts should be made to establish MP as a medical tourism destination. A virology institute should also be established in state, he added. Economist Sumit Bose suggested that social works and infrastructure development projects should be undertaken in the state on PPP mode and efforts should be made to get more CSR funds. Help from NGOs should be enlisted for social works. Central Bank of India MD Pallav Mahapatra, suggested provision of funds in the budget for agriculture infrastructure development. IIM Indore director Prof Himanshu Rai, suggested that fines and penalties for different violations should be raised to mop up revenue. Tax on foreign liquor and tobacco must also be hiked, he said.

February 4, 2021||Delhi||Advancing sowing of kharif crop may reduce farm fire impact on Delhi air||NEW DELHI: If kharif crop is sowed just about a month earlier that will advance stubble burning, the severity of its impact on the air quality of Delhi during winter will get significantly reduced due to a less hostile meteorological regime, claims a recent study. The study, which is based on the 2018 data, says emergency episodes that significantly reduced from 12 to nil under the proposed scenario may help in minimising adverse health impacts. The kharif crop stubble burning now starts around the first week of October and lasts up to the end of November. The research, conducted by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Utkal University and National Atmospheric Research Laboratory, states that the impact of stubble burning on the highly urbanised Delhi’s air quality does not necessarily depend on the amount of biomass burned in Punjab and Haryana, but on a combined effect of high wind speed with favourable wind direction, cool temperature and calm wind conditions in the city. “When stubble burning is advanced by a month, the number of days crossing the 200 micrograms per cubic metre mark was found to be none due to stubble burning owing to warmer temperature and faster winds,” says the study. According to it, the finding requires feasibility study along with policy-level intervention and, but if implemented, it may lead to significant improvement in the winter-time air quality and the impact of stubble burning-induced emergency episodes can be made ineffective for Delhi. “It is envisaged that the mitigation approach proposed in this work could be a potential option for policy planners. This may have significant implication in the health sector and may reduce the number of hospital visits related to respiratory system diseases and likely to reduce mortality and morbidity rates,” states the research. The study has been jointly done by Gufran Beig, A Rathod and B S Sandeepan of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, S K Sahu of Utkal University and V Singh of National Atmospheric Research Laboratory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/advancing-sowing-of-kharif-crop-may-reduce-farm-fire-impact-on-delhi-air/articleshow/80676807.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
February 4, 2021||Coimbatore||Bharatnet to connect 1/3rd villages in Tamil Nadu by March 31||CHENNAI: Governor Banwarilal Purohit, addressing the assembly on Tuesday, said Tamil Nadu was “one of the best administered states” in the country and reeled out various policy initiatives the EPS government had taken, including 7.5% Neet quota for government school students. In his one-hour long customary address, marking the beginning of the assembly session in the new year, Purohit said the government, under the “able stewardship” of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, continues to be guided by the spirit of the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa and has made tremendous strides towards realizing the vision of making Tamil Nadu the numero uno state in the country. “The consistent focus of the state government on providing good governance to the people is now widely recognised… Responsiveness in governance is the watchword of this government,” Purohit said, amid loud thumping of treasury benches. Incidentally, Purohit announced the rollout of the controversial ‘BharatNet project’ – the rural broadband connectivity programme -- to one third of the revenue villages in the state by March 31, and the remaining villages by November 30. On a complaint from Arappor Iyakkam, an NGO, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) of the Union government had scrapped the Rs 1,950 crore tender in June last year since the bid conditions of the state government were “restrictive and discriminatory” in nature. In November, the DPIIT again communicated to the state, following allegations of manipulations in tender conditions, not to finalise the latest bid until the inquiry was completed. By combining BharatNet with TNSWAN, TamilNet and TACTV’s broadcast infrastructure, a convergent digital service delivery platform – Unified Digital Infrastructure -- will be built to deliver high speed, scalable bandwidth to all households in the state, the governor said. The pro-active approach of the state in attracting an “unprecedented” Rs 60,674 crore worth investments through 73 MoUs, generating employment for one lakh people, all during the pandemic, came in for much praise. For its part, the state government also demanded that the Centre reject Karnataka’s Mekedatu dam project at the inter-state border, and not to allow Kerala to build a new dam across Periyar river. It sought Central assistance of Rs 5,264 crore for the damage meted out by two cyclones recently and urged the Centre to take up the fishermen issue with Sri Lanka. Purohit said the state received Rs 13,300 crore towards compensation from the Centre, including Rs 4,890 crore towards borrowings in lieu of compensation as per the mechanism put in place by the GST council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bharatnet-to-connect-1/3rd-villages-in-state-by-mar-31/articleshow/80662499.cms||Julie Mariappan

February 4, 2021||Chennai||HC: Shame that AU suspended courses due to fund crunch||Chennai: It is shame on part of Anna University to suspend MTech (biotechnology) and MTech (computational biology) courses citing want of funds, observed the Madras high court on Wednesday. “The courses may be sponsored by the Centre. If they are taking a stand to follow the reservation policy of the Centre in admission then the university should proceed further with the funds available with it,” Justice B Pugalendhi said. The courses sponsored by the central government were suspended as the Centre insisted on 49.5% communal reservation in admissions, and not 69% reservation followed in Tamil Nadu. In case of lack of funds, the state government can also consider stepping in, the judge added. Recording the submission of counsel for the AICTE that the courses are in existence for over two decades and that only 49.5% reservation was being followed all along, the court wondered as to why the university had grievance this year alone. The court then adjourned the hearing to February 8 for counsel for Tamil Nadu government to get instructions. The issue pertains to a plea moved by R Chitra, a student of the university, challenging the decision to suspend the courses for the current academic year. When the plea came up for hearing, advocate Vijaya Kumar, representing the university, submitted that till last year the entire admission to the courses were made by the central government through the department of biotechnology. “But this year, they have sent a merit list and asked us (university) to do the selection and the admission. Therefore, we wrote to the state government to clarify as to the reservation to be followed. The state instructed the university to follow 69% reservation but the AICTE insisted following 49.5% reservation. So, we decided to suspend the courses till the issue is settled,” Vijaya Kumar said. Representing the Tamil Nadu government, special government pleader E Manoharan sought time to get instructions from the state. “We do not want to stop any good courses”, he said. According to the petitioner, the central government’s insistence that the university follow only 49.5% reservation and not the state’s 69% quota policy in admission is arbitrary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-shame-that-au-suspended-courses-due-to-fund-crunch/articleshow/80675208.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

February 4, 2021||Madurai||Bharatnet to connect 1/3rd villages in Tamil Nadu by March 31||CHENNAI: Governor Banwarilal Purohit, addressing the assembly on Tuesday, said Tamil Nadu was “one of the best administered states” in the country and reeled out various policy initiatives the EPS government had taken, including 7.5% Neet quota for government school students. In his one-hour long customary address, marking the beginning of the assembly session in the new year, Purohit said the government, under the “able stewardship” of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, continues to be guided by the spirit of the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa and has made tremendous strides towards realizing the vision of making Tamil Nadu the numero uno state in the country. “The consistent focus of the state government on providing good governance to the people is now widely recognised… Responsiveness in governance is the watchword of this government,” Purohit said, amid loud thumping of treasury benches. Incidentally, Purohit announced the rollout of the controversial ‘BharatNet project’ – the rural broadband connectivity programme -- to one third of the revenue villages in the state by March 31, and the remaining villages by November 30.

February 4, 2021||Chennai||Pallavaram has toll free number for plaints, but no feedback||CHENNAI: Residents of areas under Pallavaram municipality have been given a toll free number they can call to complain about civic problems but they have no idea if anyone is taking action. Official data shows that the municipality on the city’s southern fringes on GST Road, which comprises 80,000 households, outsourced operation of toll free number 18004251600 to a private firm, which acts as the consultant. There are five public grievance operators and one supervisor in charge of ensuring complaints are taken from residents 24x7 in a system to maintain which the municipality pays Rs 15 lakh annually. Around 700 complaints are registered every month on the helpline but there is no feedback mechanism. Social activist David Manohar on January 27 raised a complaint about aggressive stray dogs on Pillaiyar Koil Street. “I have no idea whether the issue has been resolved or not. When we call the number, they ask us to contact the municipality official,” he said. A call to the number showed the process was exactly as Manohar said. The call centre executive gave the contact number of the sanitary inspector saying he would respond. Pallavaram municipality commissioner C Mathivanan told TOI resolution of complaints depended on the issue. “We got 248 complaints regarding street lights in January. A majority were regarding cables and were resolved within 48 hours,” he said. However, complaints about water supply or a block in the main sewage line are more complex and could take up to 15 days to resolve, Mathivanan said. The civic body was also in the process of collecting contact numbers of all households and linking them to their property tax numbers, so that they could be intimated when such issues were notified through the helpline, the commissioner added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pallavaram-has-toll-free-no-for-plaints-but-no-feedback/articleshow/80656014.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

Instead, the RPO will accept documents stored on DigiLocker, the Centre's online digitization service. The RPO Ahmedabad said that following a directive from the Ministry of External Affairs seeking to reduce the usage of physical documents, an applicant can now share documents issued by government agencies through DigiLocker. Officials said applicants can share the documents with passport seva kendras while filling the passport application form. “It can be done under the ‘self-declaration’ option and the ‘upload supporting documents’ option while filing the application,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rpos-to-accept-digilocker-docs/articleshow/80676792.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Bhopal||Departments must work together to optimise tax collection: MP CM||BHOPAL: Chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, said on Wednesday that departments of the state government responsible for tax collection should work in "mission mode" to optimise the tax collection. He said people should be made aware of the difficult financial circumstances created by the Coronavirus crisis and need for greater revenue collection to overcome the situation. Strict action should be taken against tax evaders. He said the officials of state and the central government should come together to optimise tax collection. He, however, greeted departments concerned for a remarkable hike in collection of GST and other taxes despite the pandemic. Chouhan was reviewing the revenue receipts of different departments concerned with tax collection at Mantralaya. Chouhan said that MP has done remarkably well in GST collection and it would get Rs 4,542 crore as state share. Rs 3,866 of this amount has already been received, which is a big relief during Corona times. There has also been an increase of 17% in VAT collection in the month of January compared to corresponding period last year and the trend is likely to continue. There has also been a rise in excise revenue as well in the month of January. It was Rs 839 crore in January last year but rose to Rs 928 crore in January this year. Revenue generated from sale of stamps and registration showed that dropping the registration duty by 2% in December led to 94% increase in revenue from registration in December compared to corresponding month last year. Revenue from mines and minerals has risen by 25% to 30% since September. Revenue from mines & minerals in January last year was Rs 438 crore, which rose to Rs 553 crore in January this year. Revenue from the transport sector has dropped in January this year. One major reason for this is the sale of lesser vehicles. Only the sale of tractors has increased, which attracts Rs 1 registration fee and zero road tax. Chouhan directed that the new mines should be allotted on priority and said the state government was contemplating starting online registration of property so that people don't have to go to the office of sub-registrar for registration. Chief secretary, Iqbal Singh Bains, said that for realisation of pending GST, a one-time settlement method should be adopted. Under the "Saral Samadhan" scheme, GST amount to the tune of Rs 146.53 crore has been realised so far, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/departments-must-works-to-optimise-tax-collection-cm/articleshow/80676790.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||More cancer patients returning to city for treatment since Dec||Mumbai: While the countrywide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic saw a dip in cancer patients seeking treatment, there has been an improvement in their numbers in the past two months, show statistics from Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), the country’s premier cancer-care hub located in Parel. While 45,000 new cancer patients register themselves for treatment at the Parel hospital every year, the corresponding number in 2020 was only 30,000, said TMH director Dr C Pramesh. “Only two-third of the usual number could make it to the hospital for treatment last year, mainly due to travel restrictions,” he said. Tata Memorial Hospital gets patients from across the country, with a sizeable number from the northeastern states. While it treats close to 70,000 new and old cancer patients every year, the overall numbers are not available as many patients sought tele or video consults last year. In December 2020, new registrations improved with almost 95% of the monthly average, said Dr Pramesh. “It was 110% in January,” the doctor added. According to the World Health Organisation data released on World Cancer Day (February 4) last year, India saw roughly 1.16 million new cancer cases in 2018. The WHO statistics suggested that one in 10 Indians would develop cancer during their lifetime and one in 15 would die of the disease. World Cancer Day is observed by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) to raise attention for a cancer-free future. In April 2020, Tata Memorial Centre director Dr Rajendra Badwe and Dr Pramesh wrote in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) about their hospital’s decision to keep treatment available despite the lockdown. Not providing treatment would be a bigger tragedy in India, they wrote. The hospital decided not to de-escalate services because the virus has been spreading “more slowly” in India than in other countries. The hospital decided to avoid complex surgeries requiring multiple blood transfusions or prolonged ICU care, it offered teleconsults, and restricted relatives in OPDs and in-patient wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/more-cancer-patients-returning-to-city-for-treatment-since-dec/articleshow/80676800.cms||Malathy Iyer
February 4, 2021||Madurai||Union Budget leaves Covid-hit tourism sector high and dry||Madurai:The tourism sector, which was one of the worst hit industries due to the Covid-19 outbreak and was expecting some relief and announcements to boost the business, has expressed disappointment with the Union Budget. Stakeholders in the sector say that though people have started travelling within the state, it has yet to convert into business. There is an urgent need to identify new places and promote existing tourist places by introducing new attractions. The infrastructure development proposals for the state in the budget will help in the long run, but there was nothing worth mentioning to energize the sector, they said.Travel agents said that the demand for the Madurai airport to be included in the point of call to enable foreign carriers to operate flights is getting louder. Although cheap carriers from South East Asian countries are ready to operate flights to Madurai, authorities are yet to provide the nod.BSG Mustafa, a tour operator, said most of the small agents have shut shops as there was no business. As business is slowly picking up momentum, a few travel agents have started opening service. At least a few of the issues the industry was facing could have been addressed in the budget.G Raveendran, president of Travel Club, Madurai, said, “We expected various soaps and had sent memorandums, but we feel let down as they were not considered. We expected tax relief for F1 bars attached to hotels and road tax and extension of insurance for tourist vehicles as they could not operate due to lockdown.”He added that at least the flight ticket refund issue should have been addressed as lakhs of rupees belonging to tour operators are stuck with the flight operators in the credit shell scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/union-budget-leaves-covid-hit-tourism-sector-high-and-dry/articleshow/80678070.cms||V Devanathan
February 4, 2021||Goa||South Western Railway completes underpass work at Curchorem||Margao: The South Western Railway (SWR) on Wednesday completed the construction work of the railway underpass at Curchorem after effecting a 5-hour-long rail traffic block along the Margao-Sanvordem section. Train movement in this stretch was suspended from 10am to 3pm to enable Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) to install the precast panels of the underpass by cut-and-cover method. Vasco-Nizamuddin Goa Express was the first passenger train to pass through the section at 4pm after the track fit certificate was issued by SWR upon restoration of the track, closely followed by a freight train. Altogether six underpasses are being constructed along the Collem-Vasco stretch of the SWR’s double tracking project in Goa — one at Curchorem, one in Kamral and two in Dhadem at Sanvordem, and one each at Chandor and Sao Jose de Areal. The underpasses are fully funded by the Indian Railways as part of the double tracking project, unlike the earlier practice of 50:50 expenditure sharing plan where half of the expenditure had to be contributed by the state government. The cut-and-cover method of underpass construction employed at the Curchorem site entailed digging an underground trench beneath and across the width of the railway track up to a specified depth. A number of precast RCC panels — composite structures consisting of side walls and roof of the underpass — were lowered inside the trench by a heavy duty crane after removal of the affected portion of the rail length, ballast and sleepers. The precast panels were glued together by concrete canvas — an innovative construction product that consists of a flexible, concrete-impregnated geofabric that hardens when hydrated to form a thin, durable, waterproof and fire resistant concrete layer. Once the subway structure was put in place, the excavated trench was covered with backfill material, while the railway track was restored by placing the rail, ballast and sleepers in the original position. Rest of the underpasses will also be launched during the next few weeks by a similar method, RVNL officials informed. The underpasses are expected to facilitate smooth movement of road traffic once the level crossings are eliminated and approach roads constructed. RVNL general manager Shashibhushan Sahoo, senior RVNL official John Shilshi, project manager Venkat, SWR traffic inspector Mehra Fernandes, and other senior officials of the Indian Railways closely supervised the operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-western-railway-completes-underpass-work-at-curchorem/articleshow/80678144.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 12-year-old girl raped in Kalol taluka||AHMEDABAD: A 45-year-old man allegedly raped a 12-year-old girl, a resident of his neighbourhood in Kalol taluka, after luring her to his house with chocolates, said an officer of Santej police where the FIR was registered. The alleged offence took place on Tuesday afternoon when Uttam Singh, a resident of a slum in the Rakanpur GIDC who worked as security guard, came to the victim’s house and told her she could have chocolates which he had at his home. He then took her to his home where he confined her and raped her twice. He let her to go after threatening to kill her if she told anyone about the incident. She went home, bleeding severely, and told her mother what had happened. The victim’s parents approached police and filed a complaint of rape along with charges under the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act against Singh. Santej police reached the accused’s place and detained him on Tuesday evening. “As the accused knew the victim’s parents, who are labourers, they did not doubt his intentions. Singh used to visit the victim’s family very often,” said Inspector Vanrajsinh Manjaria of Santej police. Manjaria said the medical examination confirmed rape and the victim is still in hospital. He said the accused was sent to judicial custody in Sabarmati Central Jail and further investigation is under way.

February 4, 2021||Puducherry||Union Budget neglected Puducherry: CM||PUDUCHERRY: Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy on Tuesday said that the Union budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman completely neglected the Union territory of Puducherry. He said that the Centre allotted funds to other poll-bound states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Assam but failed to allocate any funds to the Union territory. "It is unfortunate. It reveals that the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre does not give any attention to the Union territory," he said. Narayanasamy said Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, during his visit to Puducherry last year, had announced that the ministry will launch nine projects (total 297km) at a cost of Rs10,819 crore to improve road connectivity between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. "However, there was no mention of the projects in the budget," Narayanasamy said. He said BJP national president J P Nadda, during his last visit to Puducherry, had said that the Centre will provide adequate funds for the Union territory. "But nothing was given," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/union-budget-neglected-pondy-cm/articleshow/80656055.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Chennai||DMK walks out of assembly, to boycott session||CHENNAI: The DMK, the principal opposition, staged a walkout when governor Banwarilal Purohit started his address to the state assembly on Tuesday. The party was protesting against the governor’s inaction on the petition it had submitted listing out corruption charges against the ruling establishment. The party also questioned the governor’s inaction over a cabinet resolution urging the release of the seven convicts undergoing imprisonment in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. “When the governor started his address, I drew his attention to the petition that we have submitted to him, listing corruption charges against the chief minister (Edappadi K Palaniswami), deputy chief minister (O Panneerselvam) and a few other ministers in the cabinet,” Stalin told reporters, at Kalaivanar Arangam, where the assembly session was held to ensure Covid protocols such as social distancing. “He neither acted on our petition nor on the cabinet resolution seeking release of the convicts held in the Rajiv Gandhi case,” Stalin said. Instead of responding to the DMK’s questions, the governor referred to the central budget and the announcement of Rs 1 lakh crore for the highways project, he said. “I have already termed the central budget a lollipop. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced setting up of AIIMS, Madurai in 2015. They enacted a drama of laying the foundation stone ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But not even a brick has been moved there so far,” Stalin said. “Hence, we have decided to boycott the entire assembly session,” he added. PMK founder S Ramadoss too felt the governor’s address did not have anything new to offer, other than praising the state government for its efforts during Covid-19 and attracting industrial investments. “Other than giving a telephone number ‘1100’ to enable people to address their grievances, there was nothing new in the address. I hope there will be new announcements at least in the reply to the governor’s address,” Ramadoss said. MDMK general secretary Vaiko said the governor’s address merely reflected the failures of AIADMK’s 10-year rule in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dmk-walks-out-of-assembly-to-boycott-session/articleshow/80656048.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Delhi||SC questions panel’s move to seal shops in Delhi's Defence Colony||NEW DELHI: Shops auctioned over 60 years ago in the upscale Defence Colony have been sealed by the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for alleged illegal change of ‘user’ status from residential to commercial, the top court was informed on Wednesday. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian expressed surprise over the development after senior advocate P S Narasimha, appearing for Defence Colony Market Welfare Association, said many shops purchased for commercial use were sealed by the monitoring committee on the ground that there was unauthorised diversion of ‘user’ status of the shops. The panel had sealed the shops on the charge that they were originally purchased as residential units, but were now used for commercial purpose. Narasimha presented the ‘certificate of sale’ showing that the premises were originally purchased as shops. He said a notice for auction dated November 20, 1957, covered 14 shops in the Defence Colony and argued that this left little for doubt that these properties were identified for commercial use more than 60 years ago. The bench said, “If it is a fact that the premises that have been sealed on the ground of unauthorised change of user from residential to commercial, were actually sold as shops, we see no reason why the sealing should continue.” Stating that the matter involved the livelihood of shop owners, the bench tasked amicus curiae and advocate A D N Rao to examine the documents and file a report in four weeks. “It is important to ascertain which of the sealed premises were originally purchased as shops meant for commercial use. We accordingly consider it appropriate to direct that a list be prepared of all such premises, which were originally purchased as shops and have now been sealed. Rao will scrutinise all relevant documents,” it ordered. Senior advocate Sanjiv Sen, appearing for SDMC, was permitted to point out such documents, which would show the true status of the shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-questions-panels-move-to-seal-shops-in-def-col/articleshow/80676837.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
February 4, 2021||Goa||Centre freezes vaccine registration of healthcare workers in Goa||PANAJI: The Union ministry of health and family welfare has frozen the registration of healthcare workers for Covid-19 vaccination in Goa. The directorate of health services plans to complete giving the first dose of the vaccine to 18,277 healthcare workers, including 500 attached to the Centre’s health institutes, by February 12. Even as registration of medical staff has stopped, “the registration of frontline workers has begun,” said a health official. The DHS plans to complete the first phase of the vaccination by March 12. Till date, 5,644 healthcare workers in Goa have received the first dose. The official said they are yet to get an update on the total number of frontline workers for vaccine registration. He said the DHS wants to start vaccinating frontline workers this month itself, subject to availability of vaccines from the ministry. “Data about frontline workers is collected by their respective departments and will then be forwarded to the district collectors’ offices for uploading on the Co-Win portal,” he said. The official also denied receiving any communication from the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Goa, threatening to withdraw from the vaccination drive. “In fact, IMA representatives, at a meeting of the task force on Tuesday, extended full cooperation to the drive, and gave some suggestions to make it more effective,” he said. There were some reports on Tuesday that the IMA would not support the drive. However, IMA-Goa president Dr Vinayak Buvaji told TOI that neither he nor the IMA has issued any such statement. “There has been some miscommunication. The IMA has not told the government that it wants to exit from the drive,” Buvaji said. He, however, said that there has been some discontent in the medical fraternity over the non-inclusion of some names on the portal, and that now, registration has stopped. “After meeting the authorities, we submitted the fresh list that contained new as well as missing names, which may have been left out due to technical reasons. But since Monday, registration has been frozen,” he said. He said they have requested the DHS to communicate with the Union ministry to allow the registration of the remaining healthcare workers, so that most of the fraternity receives their first dose by February 12. Buvaji said that “it is difficult to say at this juncture why the registration has been frozen for healthcare workers, but it could be because they missed the deadline”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/centre-freezes-vaccine-regn-of-healthcare-workers-in-goa/articleshow/80678150.cms||Bindiya Chari

No sooner did the governor commence his customary address than DMK president and leader of opposition M K Stalin and his colleagues stood up to raise an issue. “Please hear me, yesterday (Monday), in the Union budget, Tamil Nadu got Rs 1.03 lakh crore. This is a day to rejoice,” Purohit said, evoking loud protest from DMK members. At one point, the visibly upset Purohit could be seen waving his left index finger as if in disapproval. Purohit continued to state that what he said was right.  “I am saying that this is a good thing to appreciate… Why are you shouting? Why are you getting angry? Don’t get angry with us,” the governor said. When the opposition members remained on their feet, Purohit said, “Mr Stalin, I have one request for you. This is the last session of this term. Respect it. And take full advantage of it and debate. Nobody stops you. I know all of you senior leaders are best orators.

He has also not disbanded the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM), Manian said in a statement. “If tomorrow Rajinikanth says he is entering politics, Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam will associate itself with him on his journey. If Rajinikanth does not enter politics also, it will continue to function as a sister organization,” Manian said. Interestingly, this was the first statement Manian made after December 30, 2020, when he had announced that he was quitting politics forever and would never return until his death. His statement came a day after Rajinikanth expressed his inability to enter electoral politics by launching his own party on December 29, 2020. “Political forces are trying to wean away RMM functionaries. While some of them have joined other parties, several others are looking for sanctuaries like migratory birds. While I do not want to fish in troubled waters, the party’s general council will meet on March 7 in Tirupur,” Manian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rajini-didnt-say-hes-quitting-politics-forever/articleshow/80656058.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Chennai||NEET fraud: Dentist, daughter get bail||CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday granted bail to a dentist and his MBBS aspirant daughter, who were arrested for forging NEET score to secure admission. Justice V Bharathidasan granted the relief while allowing the bail applications moved by K Balachandran and his daughter B Deeksha. Balachandran and Deeksha, natives of Paramakudi, had allegedly forged the NEET scorecard and the provisional rank list to secure a medical seat for Deeksha. The girl had scored only 27 marks in the test, but appeared for the counselling claiming to be another aspirant, who had scored 610 marks. They submitted fake documents to the selection committee of the Directorate of Medical Education to support their claim. However, the committee found that the documents were forged and filed a complaint with the Periamet police. Subsequently, the father-daughter duo failed to appear before the investigating officer despite repeated summons. On January 2, Balachandran was arrested from Bengaluru. When the bail applications came up for hearing, counsel for the petitioners submitted that Balachandran has been in jail for over 30 days now and even custodial inquiry of the duo was over. They further submitted to abide by any condition imposed by the court to enlarge them on bail.

February 4, 2021||Goa||Lobo: Must identify hinterland tourism spots for devpt||Calangute: Places of natural beauty in villages across Goa have to be identified and developed to give a boost to hinterland tourism in the state, rural development minister Michael Lobo said. Lobo, while inaugurating the Nag Tollem lotus pond in Candolim after its beautification on Tuesday evening, said there are many such scenic spots in the state which can be turned into tourist attractions. “We need to move beyond beach tourism and develop tourist attractions in all the talukas so that more people benefit from tourism,” The local MLA said. Today, Goans residing in the interior villages have to travel long distances to come to the coastal belt to work in the tourism industry. But if hinterland tourism takes off, then these villagers can start their own businesses and work in their area of residence itself, he said. “For that we have to develop tourist attractions in the hinterland areas,” he said. “Once spots of natural beauty are identified in rural areas and promoted by the tourism department, they too could become popular and give a boost hinterland tourism,” Lobo added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-must-identify-hinterland-tourism-spots-for-devpt/articleshow/80678174.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Aurangabad||Student unions: Why delay college reopening to Feb 15?||Aurangabad: While the colleges in Maharashtra are set to reopen from February 15, as announced by state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant, students’ unions have questioned the further delay in resuming the same.Lokesh Kamble, the leader of Students Federation of India (SFI), said the government must start the classes immediately in the next couple of days. “While an excess delay has already been made by the government in reopening these institutes in Maharashtra, it should not waste more time. It takes hardly 24 hours to get Covid testing done and allthe teaching and non-teaching staffers must be asked to undergo the same,” he said.  Samant said the institutes will run with 50% of the total capacity. ABVP leader Swapnil Begde said colleges must restart with 100% capacity. “With semester examinations around the corner, it makes no sense to run the colleges with half of the strength. The colleges instead must operate on a shift-basis to run with full strength daily,” he said. Students unions have also demanded all hostels to reopen soon along with colleges. “While some of the hostels are still being used as quarantine centres, the government must vacate the existing occupants for the benefit of students. As the spread of Covid is contained to a considerable extent, the government can easily identify other facilities for quarantine centres,” Begde said.Earlier, a day after ABVP staged a vigorous protest for reopening colleges, SFI on Wednesday staged dummy classes outside the university campus to highlight the demand of reopening of institutes of higher learning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/student-unions-why-delay-college-reopening-to-feb-15/articleshow/80673981.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||Man held for kidnapping||Ahmedabad: Manoj Vyas, the prime accused in the kidnapping of a Gandhidham-based businessman, was nabbed in Nagpur by local police there on Wednesday. Gujarat ATS had on Monday nabbed four of the five accused who had allegedly kidnapped Gandhidam businessman, Mukeshkumar Agrawal. Vyas, who is from Sikar in Rajasthan, was on the run. The accused kidnapped Agrawal at gunpoint when he was going to his sawmill at Mithipura near Gandhidham on January 1, 2021, and took him to various places in Rajasthan such as Sanchore, Jodhpur Road, and Jaipur, where they kept him confined to a room. Vyas used to work for a company owned by the victim’s brother in Vietnam about ten years ago, and knew that they could extort a lot of money from him. Vyas fled to Haryana after the kidnapped businessman’s family paid a ransom of Rs 35 lakh to him. Police were tracking his mobile location. Sources in the police said he was planning to go to Bengaluru where he has some friends and acquaintances. Nagpur police, led by DCP (Zone 4) Akshay Shinde, nabbed him in his car. A team of Kutch (East) police brought Vyas to Gandhidham for further interrogation. Police also recovered Rs 22 lakh of the ransom. It is suspected that Vyas was planning to flee the country as he has contacts in Vietnam. “We started tracking his location as we had a faint idea that he would try to reach Bengaluru as he has friends there,” said a senior police official. Kutch police had also started the procedure to block his passport and to have lookout notices issued to prevent him from leaving the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-held-for-kidnapping/articleshow/80676833.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Madurai||Madurai colleges keen to reopen, but cautious||MADURAI: With the state government permitting colleges to reopen for all students from February 8, city colleges in Madurai are keen to have students back to the campus. However, there is also an air of caution as colleges fear possible crowding on the campuses, which could lead to Covid-19 spread. “As of now, we are keen to reopen the school by February 8. Two days ago, we conducted Covid-19 tests for all our staff. Among the 290 staff members, none have tested Covid-19 positive. We believe the Covid-19 outbreak is under control but of course we need to ensure strict implementation of SOPs such as masks and sanitisation,” said Dr D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science. Students, especially first year students, are also looking forward to finally entering the campus on February 8. “We have been waiting for so long and we almost thought we were going to end the year without any offline classes. Covid-19 cases in Madurai have drastically reduced and our parents are also not as worried. They just want us to make sure to follow the Covid-19 safety SOPs to stay safe,” said N Srilakshmi, a first year BSc student at a city college. Another second year BA student, N Eswari, said that she is positive of returning to the campus soon as after the reopening of colleges for final year students and Class X and XII school students, there have been hardly any Covid-19 cases reported among them. At the same time, colleges are also concerned about possible crowding. “We have managed well so far even after the final year students are back and more than 100 students have also returned to the hostel. However, allowing all students on the campus at once may not be a good idea as the campus would be densely crowded. As long as the state government does not make it mandatory, we do want to continue with online classes for the first and second year students,” said Dr Christianna Singh, principal, Lady Doak College, which has more than 5,000 women students. Dr Davamani M Christober, principal, The American College, also echoed similar sentiments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-colleges-keen-to-reopen-but-cautious/articleshow/80678104.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
February 4, 2021||Surat||Online frauds dent textile market image||Surat: A Madhya Pradesh woman, who paid Rs 5,000 for a sari that she had ordered online, was rudely shocked when she finally received one that costs Rs 500 only. Feeling cheated, she lodged a complaint with Surat police on email requesting cops to start an inquiry. Upon receiving the plaint, city police commissioner Ajay Tomar order the Economic Offence Cell (EOC) to look for similar frauds that could be tarnishing the image of the city’s textile industry. “Police was alerted by a complainant over mail and it has also come to my knowledge that some unscrupulous elements are duping customers with inferior quality textile products after charging showing and them for costly products. This practice is a threat to the textile industry’s image should be stopped immediately,” said Tomar. Meantime, the EOC is trying to contact the complainant to find out more details of the seller. “We expect customers to approach us immediately if they detect any fraud so that we can take actions. Victims in such cases are mostly residents of different states and hence, avoid filing complaints for a trivial amounts,” said an EOC official. Cops are gathering details of multiple online trade channels including the shopping website. Textile products from the city are being sold through Youtube videos, Facebook, mobile applications, WhatsApp and Telegram. Due to quick responses and easy accessibility, customers generally use these online social platforms for purchases that make them vulnerable to frauds. Surat Mercantile Association (SMA), an association of textile traders, has raised the issue in recent past. “We are receiving complaints against local traders on daily basis. In a few such incidents, we have helped buyers in getting their money back. There is a need to regularise the online trade because such practice by frauds is tarnishing the image of Surat,” said Narendra Saboo, president SMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/online-frauds-dent-textile-market-image/articleshow/80674052.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Kolhapur||Route to Konkan to end by 2026||Kolhapur: The vision document of the railways has prescribed to complete the Kolhapur-Vaibhavwadi rail route of 108 km till 2026, however, the activists are doubtful as the government continues to neglect the project in the subsequent budgets since the project was approved in 2016. The railways have planned to commission several new rail routes between 2025 to 2030, including the route connecting Vaibhavwadi in Konkan to Kolhapur , which has an early deadline of 2026 for completion. The cost for this rail route project was estiamated at around Rs 3,400 crore in 2016. Recently, Sanjeev Mittal, the general manager of Central Railways (CR), had agreed that the project has been stuck due fund issues. He said there was no deadline set for its completion at first. The mention of the deadline in the vision document is the first such assurance given since the project was approved in 2016. Shivnath Biyani, a member of the divisional consultative committee of railways and activist said, “The railways has to follow several steps such as land acquisition, floating tender and appointing the contractor for the work before the groundwork begins. We expected these works to have been completed way back and by now with substantial fund allocation, the project work would have reached half-way. The vision document or any deadline has no meaning if there are no funds. Moreover, now the project has to be revised with the current costs of steel, cement and other required materials. The overall project cost will be much higher than estimated in 2016.” MP Sanjay Mandlik said he will soon meet railway minister Piyush Goyal and urge him to make some allocations in the budget. He also said after he arrives in Kolhapur, he will conduct meetings with local representatives and the officials .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/route-to-konkan-to-end-by-2026/articleshow/80673993.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Goa||Asked Centre for funds to promote tourism: Goa CM||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that he has written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking a special package for Goa to promote tourism activities — especially hinterland tourism — in a bigger way from next season. Sawant said after the closure of mining in Goa, tourism was a prime revenue-generating sector, but income from the tourism industry has been badly hit due to the pandemic. “Our state is dependent on four parameters: mining, tourism, industry and agriculture,” Sawant said. “The pandemic has affected tourism activity the most, and the state has lost income from tourism activities. Mining activity is already shut due to a ban by the Supreme Court. We have given the people whatever relief we could.” Sawant said Goa is now looking for the Centre’s assistance. “Now I have requested Sitharaman to give Goa a special package to promote tourism,” he said. “I have asked for a special package to promote hinterland tourism. I think we will definitely be provided with this assistance. We will try to promote tourism and hinterland tourism in a bigger way for the next season.” He said that during allotment of funds by the 15th Finance Commission, Goa sought to be treated differently from bigger states. “The 15th Finance Commission has already visited the state, and we should be treated differently from bigger states both in terms of population and area,” he said. “The way we are carrying out development and other works at the municipal and gram panchayat level, it is important to make special provisions for smaller states. This time around, the 15th Finance Commission will make a special provision for us, I think.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/asked-centre-for-funds-to-promote-tourism-cm/articleshow/80678169.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Goa||Goa pitches for national vulture conservation plan||PANAJI: Goa has taken initial steps in conservation of vultures which were once visible in the state and then disappeared mysteriously after the 1980s leaving birders wondering about their fate. In an important recent move to help conservation efforts, the directorate of animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) has urged the food and drugs administration (FDA) department to consider a ban on veterinary ketoprofen and aceclofenac for treatment of livestock animals in Goa. Both these substances are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and are used by veterinarians to treat pain, injuries and certain ailments in cattle, goats and other animals. NSAIDs are considered highly toxic to vultures and scavenging raptors and it has been so indicated in research pointing to the sharp decline in population of three scavengers, including vultures in south Asia. In India, too, the drastic loss in numbers of vultures a couple of decades back has been documented by researchers. Goa had a small population of these carnivorous birds, especially the Egyptian vultures which were mostly spotted near the Goa meat complex (GMC) at Usgao. They were known to feast on the slaughtered cattle waste dumped outside the meat complex. This practice has now been stopped since a while. Enterprising tour organizers had even taken to showing the vultures flock at their roosting site - a cluster of tall trees to tourists, near the complex in the late 1980s. The request to FDA follows a communication from department of animal husbandry and dairying (DAHD), New Delhi after a Rajasthan-based senior wildlife researcher, Dau Lal Bohra petitioned the central government against the veterinary use of NSAIDs. “We have received a communication from DAHD and our department has sent a letter to FDA for necessary action,” Dr Santosh Desai, director AHVS said. The Centre has drawn up a Rs 207-crore vulture conservation plan 2020-25 to reverse the extinction of three highly threatened species - the Oriental white-backed vulture (Gyps Bengalensis), slender-billed vulture (Gys tenuirostris) and long-billed vulture (Gyps indicus). The sudden disappearance of these rapacious birds, who are known to have amazing eyesight and sense of smell, still rankles Goan birders, as an entire class of birds is missing from Goa. “Vultures are not found in Goa and the rest of coastal western India. Ostensibly, they came to feed on carcasses and meat waste, which were disposed of in the open air behind the meat complex,” Savio Fonseca, chief naturalist at a bird tourism company said. In recent years only a few sightings have been reported in the state. “They were sighted in western ghats, especially Mhadei till introduction of diclofenac (used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases) in the 1980s affected their population. The dumping of meat waste in the open has also stopped,” Prasanna Parab, a birder said. India quickly banned diclofenac in 2006 after the disastrous impact of its use in poisoning cattle, which the large bird of prey feeds on, became evident. Fonseca said that these birds require a big animal carcass with substantial quantities of meat to feed on. “In western India there are fewer elephants or other animals,” he said. A Verna-based birder, Justino Rebello sighted a vagrant Egyptian vulture and another birder, Vivek Naik spotted one in Velim on the Verna plateau in November 2020. “After it was attacked by black kites it settled on an old structure. When it started flying, I could get good photographs of it in flight. I was surprised that it was an Egyptian vulture,” Rebello said. Some argue that the government itself should ban the toxic veterinary drugs instead of relying on states to do it. But R P Gupta, secretary, ministry of environment and forests unwittingly reveals the government’s passivity. “Banning vulture toxic drugs is cumbersome and time-consuming. So it is better to be judicious in using the drugs…” he states in the foreword to the action plan 2020-25. “If a couple of states take an initiative like Goa, then the centre may also consider some action and it would be useful for vulture conservation in southern part of India,” Bohra said, suggesting that Goa could be woven into the plan. “Goa has good climate and bird diversity. This induces migration of vultures and raptors from nearby Maharashtra and Karnataka to Goa,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-pitches-for-natl-vulture-conservation-plan/articleshow/80678189.cms||Paul Fernandes
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||BMC prescription for city — a ‘spendemic’||MUMBAI: Amidst the pandemic, the allocation for healthcare has increased by 11% in the civic budget, of which the majority has been earmarked for hospital infrastructure creation and upgrade. Health allocations made up for 12% of the overall budget estimates (Rs 39,038 crore) of the country’s richest corporation. Experts said a focus on building primary infrastructure was once again missing. The BMC allocated Rs 4728 crore for health in the 2021-22 budget, an increase of Rs 468 crore compared to previous financial year’s Rs 4,260 crore. Of the Rs 4,728 crore, Rs 3522 crore has been set aside for revenue expenditure, which includes payment of salaries and maintenance, while Rs 1,206 crore has been allocated towards capital expenditure. Plans are to upgrade eight peripheral hospitals, redevelop one medical college and reconstruct hostels with the allocation of Rs 1,206 crore. Actual health expenditure in 2020-21 increased by nearly Rs 2,000 crore compared to the previous financial year mostly due to Covid management. In 2019-20, a sum of Rs 3,273 crore was spent on health, which jumped to Rs 5,226 crore in 2020-21. Although there were expectations that infrastructure to tackle infectious diseases would find an impetus in the budget, no allocation has been made towards the same. The budget document simply said that a building would come up within the Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Chinchpokli where wards 13 and 15 would be demolished. A previous plan to build a 110-bed infectious diseases facility flopped last year. Allocations in the coming financial year will largely go towards redevelopment of LTMG Hospital in Sion and Bhagwati Hospital in Borivli. A sum of Rs 591 crore has been earmarked for Bhagwati, to be released over the next few years even as the project has been in the making for long. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the coming financial year will see a new peripheral hospital being commissioned in Chandivli and a super-speciality hospital in Bhandup. In addition, Kakani said, Bhabha Hospital in Bandra, MT Agarwal in Mulund, and Centenary Hospital in Govandi will see expansion. While the civic body has always fallen short of spending even 50% of the allocated sum under capital expenditure, it soared to nearly 80% in 2020-21. Compared to previous years, where the expenditure was in the range of Rs 290 crore to Rs 400 crore, it jumped to Rs 780.69 crore in the pandemic year. Kakani said that expenses incurred to build jumbo facilities for Covid-19 and complete infrastructure at SevenHills Hospital in Marol led to the optimum utilisation of funds. “We have only sought Rs 1,200 crore this year as we want to spend all of it rather than just make allocations,” he said. Milind Mhaske of Praja Foundation said the budget once again ignored the need to strengthen primary healthcare in the city. “The focus as always in on big-ticket projects whereas the city needs a good first line of healthcare defence,” he said, adding that the corporation must also look at utilising up to 80% of budgetary allocations which rarely exceed 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-prescription-for-city-a-spendemic/articleshow/80676860.cms||Sumitra Debroy

February 4, 2021||Mumbai||11-year-old out with dad to feed birds dies after two-wheeler rams their bike in Kandivli||MUMBAI: An 11-year-old girl seated pillion on her father’s bike died after a speeding two-wheeler rammed into them at Kandivli (East) on Monday. Teertha Patel and her father, Nitin, were out to feed some birds. They had just started to move when the crash occurred at Thakur Village. A patrolling police vehicle took the accused into custody. The Patels have demanded that the case be fast-tracked in court and the strictest punishment be handed out for dangerous driving. Teertha, a Class V student, lived at Asha Nagar in Kandivli with her parents and sister. Her father runs two shops. On Monday afternoon, Nitin picked up some grains as he started to leave home. Teertha immediately clung to him. “Her online exams were on and she had appeared for her Hindi paper that day. We had been careful to not take the children out during the lockdown. But since three or four days, Teertha had been pleading with us to let her step out for feeding birds. My wife did not relent until Monday,” said Nitin. The father-daughter duo headed to Thakur Village to finish an errand first. “I had to deliver my brother’s tiffin at his shop. We then fed pigeons and got on my bike. Teertha would usually plop in front of me but that day she sat pillion for the first time,” he added. There weren’t many vehicles on the street. Nitin had crossed a very short distance when a two-wheeler crashed into them on Ramnarayan Thakur Marg at 3.30pm. “Both of us fell. My helmet saved me from injury but Teertha wasn’t lucky. She started throwing up. I rushed her to a physician and he advised hospitalisation. We drove down to a Borivli hospital but she could not survive,” said Nitin. The accused, Yatish Terse, was picked up from the crash location by a patrolling police vehicle. Terse, 25, lives in Kandivli’s Janupada and was out with a friend. On Tuesday, a sea of well-wishers turned up for Teertha’s funeral. “Teertha was fun loving. Last week, she had asked her mother for money to throw a snack party for all her friends. She was very fond of drawing and cycling,” said a relative. “We suspect the accused was drunk and if any evidence is found, more serious charges should be applied,” said Sanjay Jaiswal of Thakur Complex Residents’ Association. Police said they are awaiting results of Terse’s blood tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/11-yr-old-out-with-dad-to-feed-birds-dies-after-2-wheeler-rams-their-bike/articleshow/80677026.cms||Nitasha Natu
February 4, 2021||Nashik||People should worship you: Guv to officials||Nashik: Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Wednesday exhorted government officials to use their powers and discharge their duties in a way that people start worshipping them. Koshyari was addressing a gathering at the National Association for the Blind (NAB), where he laid the foundation stone for a training-cum-research centre. “Today, I was in Baglan where people are contributing for the construction of a memorial of a government officer. They worship him. The government officials have powers that they can use for betterment of society,” he said. Yaswant Maharaj was a Tehsildar in the year 1870-71 in Baglan (Satana). The taluka faced drought and Yashwant Mahadeo Bhosekar opened the government coffers to help people to the extent that they started revering him as ‘god’ and hence people called him Dev (god) Mamledar. Koshyari went to Baglan to lay the foundation of the memorial and proceeded to Surgana to inaugurate Adivasi Sankritik Bhavan before coming to Nashik. The governor appealed to people to come forward and help organisations like NAB, saying that it has been doing outstanding work for visually-impaired children across Maharashtra. Earlier in the day, Koshyari visited the Bhint Ghar village in Surgana taluka, where all the houses are coloured pink as a symbol to women empowerment for the last four years. He inaugurated Adivasi Sanskritik Bhawan, which has been constructed through funds for Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) of the Integrated Tribal Development Plan (ITDP). Deputy Speaker Narhari Zhirwal, MLA Nitin Pawar and others greeted the governor on his arrival. “Coming here was home coming for me,” said the governor. “Acts like Panchayat’s Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) are bringing development to these regions and hence people should educate themselves and benefit from the same. They should come forth to benefit from the provisions and enrich the lives of the people around,” said Koshyari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/people-should-worship-you-guv-to-officials/articleshow/80674056.cms||Abhilash Botekar

February 4, 2021||Kolkata||At 96, Bantul’s creator sketches to ace cognitive test in hospital||Kolkata: Narayan Debnath, 96, on Wednesday passed the “higher mental function test” in hospital on Tuesday after he deftly managed to sketch his favourite character ‘Bantul’ sitting in his hospital bed. The legendary artist-illustrator was admitted to hospital last week, three days after he was conferred Padma Shri. He is being treated for urinary infection. A medical team has been set up for the nonagenarian patient, who has been the flag-bearer of cartoon stories in Bengali for the last six decades. “To check his cognitive system, we had asked Debnath-babu to do a sketch. And he instantly came up with Bantul. Thus, we were sure that his system is functioning well,” consultant neurologist Satyabrata Pulai told TOI on Wednesday. Even as his condition was quite stable till Tuesday, his blood pressure suddenly fell at night and Debnath had to be shifted to the ICU. “He is doing fine on Wednesday. He has had his breakfast. If we ask him to sketch Bantul again, he will readily do it,” Pulai said. The doctor and his son, nephrologist Smarto Pulai, physician Samarjit Naskar and interventional cardiologist SB Roy are part of the team set up to treat India’s only comics artist with a DLitt degree. All of the doctors have been looking after Debnath over the years. All are his fans, having grown up reading the comic strips that seemed to have acquired a cult status among Bengali children. “The doctors treating him are familiar to him and know his system very well. They are personally attached to him,” Debnath’s granddaughter Alicia said. “Bantul does seem to be its creator’s pet. For the last five years that I have been seeing him for age-related memory loss, the moment I found him illustrating Bantul, I knew that the brain’s orientation is fine. It’s easier to deal with his ailments when we are confident that the central nervous system is working fine,” said Pulai. On Tuesday, while doctors were checking Debnath’s mental functions, they were surprised when the 96-year-old mumbled to Naskar: “What’s your daughter’s name?” On being told, he quickly scribbled “Srishti”, dedicating the latest edition of the Bantul sketch to Naskar’s daughter. Debnath has tested negative for Covid. When the time came for vaccination, doctors said they would have to take extremely cautious decision on whether the 97-year-old should be inoculated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-96-bantuls-creator-sketches-to-ace-cognitive-test-in-hospital/articleshow/80675356.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||BMC rejigs parking lots in Salt Lake to weed out fleecing agents||Kolkata: All but one existing parking lots across Salt Lake have been dissolved by Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation authorities and fresh tenders have been floated to re-allot the zones to agencies. However, the parking agents, who had been engaged previously, continue to collect fees from a few places, according to the old chart. Civic officials said all existing fee parking zones in about 14 stretches of Salt Lake — included the area in front of AMRI Salt Lake, behind Big Bazar supermarket in IB Block, beside Rabindra Okakura Bhavan adjacent to City Centre Mall, the stretch connecting Anindita More to Broadway — have been dissolved. “Only one stretch has been renewed with the previous agency. As for the rest, we are calling fresh tenders to re-allot the parking zones to agencies for fee collection,” said a civic official. Though fee collection has stopped at most of the parking zones, TOI on Wednesday found at least two such stretches where the agents were still collecting parking fees in spite of not having credential documents. The agents are collecting Rs 20 for per hour from four-wheelers and Rs 10 per hour from bikes. At the stretch from Anindita More to Broadway, two parking agents were seen collecting parking fees from motorists claiming their contract had been renewed by the civic authorities. Another agent was seen collecting parking fees on the road beside Rabindra Okakura Bhavan. When asked, the agent said they had been told by their employers to continue collecting parking fees. “Parking fee collection was stopped during the lockdown. Our contract had been renewed by the civic authorities a few months back after the lockdown ended. The contract has not been renewed in most places. Many of us have lost our jobs following the lockdown,” said an agent. “Stern action will be taken against an offender if a complaint is lodged with the police,” said an officer of Bidhannagar police commissionarate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bmc-rejigs-parking-lots-in-salt-lake-to-weed-out-fleecing-agents/articleshow/80675390.cms||Suman Chakraborti
February 4, 2021||Goa||GFP draws Unesco’s attention to infra projects in Mollem||Margao: Goa Forward Party (GFP) president Vijai Sardesai has written to the director of Unesco World Heritage Centre, France, Mechtild Rossler, and director of IUCN World Heritage Programme, Switzerland, Peter Shadie, drawing their attention towards the threat posed to Mollem, the Unesco protected biodiversity hotspot by the three linear projects - double tracking of Tinaighat-Vasco railway line, four-laning of the National Highway 44 from Belgaum in Karnataka and laying of 400 kV transmission line and additional systems for the Goa-Tamnar project. Sardesai in his letter to the Unesco brass explained how “Goa's share of the lndia's Western Ghats will soon be home to a coal corridor.” Bhagwan Mahaveer wildlife sanctuary and Mollem National Park are part of India's Western Ghats, a Unesco protected World Heritage centre and is the world’s 8th hottest biodiversity hotspot. “These three linear projects cut through the entire width of Goa's tiger habitat, and in view of the importance of this tiger reserve for the ultimate survival of India's national animal, none of these projects should be allowed. These projects also threaten to destroy landscapes which are home to vast populations of other endangered species,” Sardesai said in the letter. Stating that studies, surveys and analysis have shown that the existing rail track and highway are currently under-utilised, Sardesai said any expansion to the highway or rail track would serve no development purpose, and only add to the air pollution leading to health issues. “The projects are established to increase coal transportation through Goa as private corporations have sought to expand their coal operations within the state,” the letter adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-draws-unescos-attention-to-infra-projects-in-mollem/articleshow/80676883.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Business||Coal India inks Rs 2.9kcr deal with Belarus co||Kolkata: Coal India (CIL) has finally signed a major procurement pact worth Rs 2,900 crore, for purchase of 96 dumpers of 240 tonne capacity each with Belaz, the Belarus-based mining equipment manufacturer. Earlier, in August 2020, CIL’s board has given its nod for their procurement. A CIL official said that these dumpers are of the highest capacity and currently operational in the country which play a critical role in opencast mines. The entire Rs.2,900 crore investment would be funded through CIL’s own finances and includes the cost of equipment along with the spares and consumables for eight years. “For CIL, whose 95% of the entire coal output is through opencast mines dumpers of such high capacity are pivotal in ferrying over burden (OB) from mine working face to dump yard. OB is the extraneous material that overlays the coal seam, removal of which makes the dry fuel’s production easier,” the official added. The batch of 96 dumpers would be deployed in two of the large opencast mines of South Eastern Coalfields (SECL), the highest coal-producing subsidiary of CIL, namely Gevra and Kusmunda. While 84 machines would be pressed into action in Gevra, the rest 12 would be operationalised in Kusmunda. The first lot of six dumpers would roll into Gevra OC expansion project within eight months from the signing of the contract. Thereafter on CIL’s green signal of their performance, after one year from the date of their commissioning, the rest 90 would follow at four machines per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coal-india-inks-rs-2-9kcr-deal-with-belarus-co/articleshow/80676882.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||Nizamabad turmeric farmers all set to take fight to Delhi||HYDERABAD: The turf of Nizamabad is getting spiced up with politics over turmeric playing out once again. If 492 nominations filed by turmeric farmers helped BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind defeat the ruling party’s Kalvakuntla Kavitha two years ago, the farmers this time have decided to take their fight to Delhi to seek a turmeric board and minimum support price (MSP) for their produce. The farmers’ joint action committee is holding a key meeting in the next few days to chart out an action plan, which includes staging protests in front of Jantar Mantar. With Congress leaders like A Revanth Reddy and T Jeevan Reddy expressing solidarity with the turmeric farmers, the issue has now taken a political colour. “We are even planning to stage a padayatra (walkathon) to Nizamabad market from here,” S Ravi, member of the JAC, told TOI. What has added more spice to the farmers’ cause is the ruling TRS also jumping into the bandwagon and demanding a turmeric board and attacking Arvind for his failure to get the board sanctioned by the Centre. The ruling party leaders recalled that Arvind ran his campaign primarily on the turmeric board issue and said he has gone back on his promise. Several farmers had also met the MP in this regard. However, Arvind asserted that he had never promised that he would get the turmeric board within a few days of getting elected as an MP. Arvind claimed that he would try to get a local spice board sanctioned for Nizamabad. Jagtial MLA Sanjay Kumar of the TRS, however, took potshots at the farmers for wanting to meet CM K Chandrasekhar Rao or TRS working president KT Rama Rao to represent their issues. Joining the issue, state Kisan Congress president Anvesh Reddy said farmers have every right to make a representation to the CM. Meanwhile, the turmeric produce is set for harvest. But, farmers complained that they are getting only Rs 5,000 per quintal as against an MSP of Rs 15,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nizamabad-turmeric-farmers-all-set-to-take-fight-to-delhi/articleshow/80676884.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

February 4, 2021||Nashik||2nd boy with learning difficulties also found||Nashik: The Mhasrool police on Tuesday tracked down the second boy, who had gone missing with his brother from a private residential school for children with learning difficulties on January 30.The two brothers — Gorakh Rajendra Apsunde (12) and Gopi (10) — had left the school at 10.30 am. The staff of the school tried to look for the boys themselves, but subsequently registered a police complaint on the night of January 31.While Gopi was traced at 5 pm on Tuesday following a tip-off from a restaurant owner. A few hours later, Gorakh too was found walking on the Dindori Road.Investigating officer API S B Ahire, of the Mhasrool police station, said Gorakh was spotted walking on the street when he and his team were patrolling the area around 8.30 pm. Ahire said it is difficult to communicate with the two brothers. “We have told the administration of the school to immediately beef up security measures given that they impart education to disabled children who may not be able to communicate properly,” he said.The school is located on the outskirts of Nashik city. Though most of the students had been sent home after the Covid outbreak, five-six students had stayed back. All the students in the school are from extremely poor financial background.Ahire said he would be visiting the school again after four days to check if the security arrangements are in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2nd-boy-with-learning-difficulties-also-found/articleshow/80674098.cms||Santosh Sonawane
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||BMC dips into own deposits for Rs 10,564 crore ‘loan’||MUMBAI: BMC will dip into its fixed deposits and withdraw Rs 10,564 crore as loan to meet its increasing expenditure. The 2020-21 estimated expenditure was Rs 33,441 crore, which has been increased to Rs, 39,039 (17%) for the coming financial year. Instead of raising money from the market through bonds, the administration will take an internal interest-free loan. BMC has fixed deposits of Rs 77,635 crore. Of the Rs 10,564 crore, Rs 5,876 crore will be raised as internal loan from money kept under two departments. BMC officials said Rs 3,500 crore will be from the garden development fund which is meant to create long-term assets and Rs 2,376 crore from the depreciation fund that also can be used for capital work. Additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu said, “We are taking loans from the two departments as these funds are meant for creating assets. In the coming years, from our revenue earning, we will restore the money in the funds.” BMC also will withdraw money from FDs attached to long-term infrastructure projects like infrastructure development fund. For creating mega infrastructure like the Coastal Road, BMC has Rs 50,952 crore in FDs, planned to be spent in the next few years. It is custodian of the remaining amount in fixed deposits (Rs 26,283 crore), which are in employees’ provident fund and pension accounts. BMC earns around Rs 1,800 crore in interest per year on FDs. This was reduced by Rs 700 crore in the current financial year due to a reduction in interest. Civic chief I S Chahal stated in his budget speech that BMC is facing various difficulties due to the pandemic, such as increased expenditure and affected revenue collection. BMC officials said that by taking an internal loan, BMC was avoiding raising money from the market at high rates of interest. But Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said, “This is a clear admission that BMC’s finances are heading into the red. It looks like BMC has avoided going for an infra bond since it would have exposed its real financial condition. But I guess it is a wise decision since an internal loan would be cheaper than raising money from the market.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/corpn-dips-into-own-deposits-for-rs-10564cr-loan/articleshow/80676889.cms||Vijay V Singh
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||More than a lakh winter birds recorded in 54 Bengal wetlands in just 3 weeks||Kolkata: Presence of almost 2% of global population of threatened great knot, a shorebird, on a Sunderbans island, a 1,000-plus rise in number of birds at Santragachhi and and the “first” sighting of black-necked grebe in the Sunderbans region are some of the biggest takeaways of the annual water bird census 2021, which covered 54 wetlands in Bengal and recorded 1,23,675 birds with more than 65 species. The exercise was conducted between January 12 and February 2 by the forest department in association with NGOs, a preliminary report of which was released on Tuesday — World Wetlands Day. One of the biggest observations, as per Prakriti Samsad’s Apurba Chakraborty, is the sighting of at least 3,000 great knots — an endangered species, whose population globally may be not more than 1,50,000 — on Jambudweep island. “So, finding 2% of the global population in Jambudweep is a reason to rejoice. They mainly breed in Russia and Mongolia. The sighting of this bird in such a huge number shows that Jambudweep is turning out to be a good feeding resource for these birds,” said Chakraborty. They also sighted a black-necked grebe on Matla river, which, as per Chakraborty, is probably its first record from the Sunderbans region. Sujan Chatterjee, secretary of Birdwatchers’ Society, which also took part in the census this year, said this bird had earlier been sighted in north Bengal. “But, its record in south Bengal is rare,” Chatterjee said, adding that the conservation efforts for the wetlands here are also yielding results. Arjan Basu Roy, secretary of Nature Mates, that, along with Prakriti Samsad, conducted the census at Santragachhi, said there has been a rise of more than 1,000 in number of birds visiting the Howrah water body this year. “On January 16, our members counted over 5,600 birds at Santragachhi and only seven days ago, on January 9, there were more than 6,000 birds there. Last year, we had counted 4,700-plus birds,” added Basu Roy. According to him, they also found birds in good number at East Midnapore and Nadia, where they took part in the exercise. “We observed pied avocet, ferruginous pochard and lesser whistling ducks in good numbers in East Midnapore. In Nadia water bodies, we recorded good presence of cotton pygmy goose,” Basu Roy said, adding that the final report from these two areas is awaited. Among other NGOs that took part is city-based Nature Environment and Wildlife Society (NEWS). The study recorded 1,522 birds in Kolkata’s Rabindra Sarovar. “This year, the department covered many lesser-known water bodies. More than 800 persons, including forest staff, NGO representatives and bird lovers took part,” said V K Yadav, chief wildlife warden. “In order to get an idea on health of wetlands through observation of migratory birds, we should not focus only on major wetland areas. We should also take into account other small water bodies that too are frequented by these birds,” said Basu Roy. In north Bengal, 7,000 water birds were noted in Fulbari barrage and over 7,000 in Gajoldoba. “In N Bengal, over 25 wetlands were covered. Rare species like Pallas’s fish eagle was sighted in a lesser-known water body like Cooch Behar’s Folimari,” said Animesh Bose of Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation. On being asked if the trend has anything to do with the Covid-induced lockdown, Chakraborty said: “These birds prefer to take rest during their journey. Less disturbance on their flyways this time, probably because of he Covid-induced lockdown, has perhaps resulted in better sighting compared to earlier years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-than-a-lakh-winter-birds-recorded-in-54-bengal-wetlands-in-just-3-weeks/articleshow/80656529.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee
February 4, 2021||Nagpur||Parents protest in front of school; mgmt says fees pending from 2019||Nagpur: Hundreds of parents gathered outside a CBSE school in Wardhaman Nagar after the management cut off the online class link of those who had not paid the fees. Parents of Swaminarayan School are demanding a 50% fee cut and majority have decided to stop paying fees till their demand is fulfilled. Rajkumar Tale, member of the Parents Teachers’ Association, said, “While our discussions with the school management were under way, they suddenly decided to block the online class link. That’s why we went to the school to protest.” The school management told TOI that there is another side to the story. Prakash Kothari, chairman of the school, said, “In May, we rolled back the 10% proposed hike after which we slashed another 25% of the fee. But even after an effective cut of 35%, parents want the fees halved. How is it possible to run such a huge set up in such conditions?.” He added that among the protesting parents, there are around 150 who have not cleared their dues since 2019. “In 2019, there was no pandemic, yet they did not pay their dues. Fees for 2020-21 are also pending. We told them to take as many instalments as they wish to but at least start paying. I even gave in writing that if the government orders a further fee cut then their money will be refunded. But a majority of them are refusing to pay,” said Kothari. After the protest on Wednesday, Tale said that some students have been given access to the online class. “We hope that the government takes over all private schools and runs them so that we have the concept of one-nation, one-school,” said Tale. When pointed out that these institutions would then effectively become ‘government schools’, which is where parents can take admission even today for free, Tale said, “Yes, that is also an option. But it’s better that the government takes over all private schools.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parents-protest-in-front-of-school-mgmt-says-fees-pending-from-2019/articleshow/80675399.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Headed by former Union minister Ramakant Khalap, the committee will meet in the morning in Panaji, at the party head office. Subsequently, the state executive committee and heads of frontal organisations will meet at the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the afternoon. Goa desk-in-charge and former Karnataka Congress chief Dinesh Gundu Rao will be present for the meeting along with Prakash Rathod, Mansoor Khan and Sunil Hanumannavar, the observers appointed by AICC. State Congress president Girish Chodankar, who has offered to step down from the post, will be present, along with South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha, opposition leader Digambar Kamat and the remaining Congress MLAs. Former chief ministers Pratapsingh Rane and Ravi Naik will also attend the meeting, even though they are not part of the state coordination committee. Chodankar took moral responsibility for the party’s debacle in the December 12 zilla panchayat polls and conveyed his decision to resign to interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The party, which finds itself stuck in a quagmire when it comes to its central leadership, has shown the same speed while taking a decision about its matters in Goa. The Congress party’s organisation has slumped into disarray after the exit of 10 Congress MLAs and the successive defeats in electoral politics, say party insiders.

February 4, 2021||Nashik||Demand for choice numbers lines Nashik RTO’s coffers||Nashik: The Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO) has earned more than Rs 2.4 crore from the sale of choice registration numbers in 2020. Senior RTO officials said while very few choice numbers were sold between April and September, the demand picked up in October. Vinay Ahire, the deputy RTO of Nashik, said, “Things have started looking up in October as the demand for choice numbers increased tremendously. Also, the registration of new vehicles increased.” In April 2020, only four choice numbers were sold and the RTO earned Rs 84,000 from them. The number increased to 24 in May and the revenue accordingly jumped to 1.9 lakh. As the unlock process began in June, the sale of vehicles picked up and even the demand for choice numbers increased. In June, the RTO earned Rs 16.12lakh, in July Rs 11.9 lakh, in August Rs 15.2 lakh and in September Rs 29.7 lakh. However, in October the revenue shot up to more than Rs 53 lakh, followed by Rs 61 lakh in November and Rs 51.5 lakh in December. Every time a new number series for vehicle registration comes out, the RTO makes a publication about the same. The price for the choice numbers range from Rs 3,000 to Rs 3 lakh. Numbers like 0001, 9999 etc. command a very high price. However, the maximum numbers are sold that the one available for Rs 5,000 and Rs 7,500. Ahire said the entire of getting a choice number is extremely transparent since the fees for the numbers are made public. If there are two or more applications for the same number, the number is sold through a bidding process with the person offering the higher amount getting the choice number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/demand-for-choice-numbers-lines-nashik-rtos-coffers/articleshow/80674120.cms||Santosh Sonawane
February 4, 2021||Nagpur||HC considers ‘criminal activity at mental level’ to uphold externment||Nagpur: Justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote of Nagpur bench of Bombay high court last month dismissed a petition by Chetan Meshram against his externment order after considering criminal activity at his ‘mental level’ if not in physical form, as evidenced by his crime soon after release from jail. Interestingly. the HC also asked the accused to ‘sit down quietly and contemplate, and improve himself’. While vacating ad-interim relief granted to Meshram, the court underlined the misuse of liberty granted to him earlier, by pointing at an offence registered against him in January this year. The high court, based on it’s judgement in Meshram’s case, has now dismissed yet another plea to quash externment order of Ramkumar Pal on Tuesday. Zonal DCP Neelotpal was instrumental in preparing the affidavits, filed through additional public prosecutor SM Ghodeshwar, to fight the two petitions challenging his externment orders. Meshram, through his counsel RH Rawlani, had challenged the externment order issued in 2017 but brought into operation in December last year. The counsel for the petitioner had challenged the order on various grounds, including the delay of two years before it was brought into operation. Meshram’s counsel had also argued that there was no offence registered between 2015 and 2017, following which the externment order was passed. The petitioner was in Latur jail from mid-2017 to May 2020. In January this year, Jaripatka police had arrested him under the Arms Act. Pointing at his arrest in January, the high court said the petitioner’s being in jail explained the interlude of calm in physical activity but not what was in his ‘mind’, as he was arrested for an offence soon after release. The court, referring to the crime, stated that ‘the criminal activity, if not seen in the physical world, was there always at the mental level of the petitioner and it manifested in physical form the moment physical leash was removed’. Further consolidating the ground for dismissing the petition, the court also intriguingly mentioned that the petitioner must sit down quietly and contemplate and ‘improve himself’ for his own benefit and also the society at large. The court also said rejecting the plea would also bring respite to the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-considers-criminal-activity-at-mental-level-to-uphold-externment/articleshow/80675412.cms||Soumitra Bose
February 4, 2021||Goa||Mapusa Urban set to release deposits to 45,268 A/C holders||Panaji: Offering partial relief to customers of the Mapusa Urban Co-operative Bank, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) has cleared the release of Rs 7.05 crore to settle claims of 45,268 depositors who have less than Rs 10,000 in their bank accounts. The funds, said MUCB general manager Shailendra Sawant, will be released in the coming days through digital transactions. In a letter dated February 1, DICGC issued in-principal approval to settle claims of depositors who have a single account and whose deposit balance does not exceed Rs 10,000 as on April 16, 2020, the day the cooperative bank lost its banking licence. “We have got the approval to release the funds, but it will happen within two or three days, probably by Saturday or Monday because it will go through the NEFT system,” said Sawant. DICGC, a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, agreed to relax the norms of verification for small amounts of up to Rs 10,000 after noticing that audit verification of the claims was taking longer than expected. DICGC issued instructions to the liquidator, former finance secretary Daulat Hawaldar, to prepare a list of insured depositors and to also draw up a list of all account holders with miniscule deposits. The total claims filed by 67,561 depositors with MUCB stand at Rs 262 crore, of which 45,268 depositors have less than Rs 10,000 each in the accounts. The stricken bank had 1.19 lakh shareholders and 2.48 lakh depositors. DICGC had observed in its letter that there were delays in submission of claims due to non-completion of statutory audit to confirm the balances till the last week of December 2020. “We have completed the audit and that is why the first disbursement is released,” said Sawant. The former bank, which had outstanding loans to the tune of Rs 50.9 crore in April has succeeded in recovering just Rs 8.5 crore. “As on February 2, the outstanding loans are at Rs 42.4 crore. During Covid times, nobody is paying the loans and nearly all the loans have become defaulters,” Sawant said. After letting go of 75 staff members and closing down branches that were operating out of rented premises, MUCB is expected to take up further cost-cutting measures. “From February 1, our staff from 16 branches have been retrenched, and in the coming days, the remaining staff will be let go too,” said Sawant. Aggrieved depositors of Mapusa Urban have been waiting for close to five years to completely withdraw their money. Ever since RBI imposed limits on withdrawals in July 2015 along with other financial strictures, the bank has been on a downward slide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-urban-set-to-release-deposits-to-45268-a/c-holders/articleshow/80676887.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Vadodara||Vadodara: Army major booked for dowry||VADODARA: Along with his parents, an army major living in Arunoday Society in Alkapuri were booked on Tuesday for harassment, domestic violence and seeking Rs 50 lakh as dowry from his wife. In her complaint, 30-year-old Rucha told the police that she got married to Meet Sutariya in December 2017, and the couple moved to Meerut in Uttar Pradesh where he was posted. A few months later, the husband allegedly started harassing Rucha as she would not wake up early. In 2018, during his training for posting in Imphal, Sutariya asked her to get Rs 50 lakh from her father as he wanted to renovate their house. When she refused, he beat her up. Rucha further said that when she approached her in-laws about the violence, they blamed her and told her to get the money as asked by their son. Sutariya allegedly continued with his demand and kept harassing her and in January last year, asked her to leave the house as she could not get the money. Following this, Rucha complained to his commanding officer, but withdrew her plaint when Suthariya romised to settle the issue amicably. But in May, he again started demanding money and hit Rucha. Two months later Rucha went to her parents’ house in Ahmedabad, but nobody asked her to return. Her mother -in-law also refused to return her jewelleries, she alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/army-major-booked-for-dowry/articleshow/80675202.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Goa||Ex-Navy chief flags concern about garbage issue in Goa||PANAJI: Goa’s garbage problem has assumed alarming proportions, said former chief of naval staff Admiral Arun Prakash and asked the government to take steps to arrest the rapidly deteriorating situation. In a letter to waste management minister Michael Lobo, Prakash has said that unless Goa acknowledges the magnitude of the problem and tackles it on a war-footing, garbage will overwhelm Goa and defeat the purpose of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The naval veteran, who resides close to the naval air station at Dabolim, said that the government needs to implement the Rural Garbage Scheme 2005 and the District Environment Plan 2020, while also strictly enforcing the Goa Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 1996. “Within Vasco limits, one sees household garbage dumped in huge piles by the roadside, and occasionally a few municipal personnel, struggling to clear a limited amount,” Prakash stated in a letter to Lobo. “The citizen wonders at the inability or unwillingness of the state administration as well as local civic authorities to tackle this problem which is assuming alarming proportions.” He stated that it has become standard practice for shopkeepers and households to dump their garbage along the roadside. Glass bottles, often broken, are being dumped along the roadside, he stated. The garbage piling-up in public places and along roads is a huge health hazard for the state and could also deter foreign tourists from visiting Goa. “If no action is taken to address the situation, foreign tourists will certainly switch to destinations like Sri Lanka, Thailand or Vietnam — which are not only far cleaner, but also cheaper than Goa,” Prakash stated. The current neglect towards solid-waste management could soon make it impossible to collect and dispose the huge amount of accumulated legacy solid-waste, Prakash said. “Once the practice of casual garbage disposal gets embedded in the public psyche, it will be extremely difficult to re-educate people or make them change habits,” he stated. The former naval chief still sees hope and stated that Goa, as India’s smallest state, could become a paradise of cleanliness if there is “political impetus and administrative resolve”. “Till the door-to-door collection scheme can be implemented universally, facilities should be created for depositing household garbage in a central place in each locality, to preclude dumping on roadsides. This will require the construction, locality-wise, of a network of garbage disposal sites where vehicles can remove garbage on a daily or weekly basis,” Prakash stated. He stated that garbage collection should be outsourced to private contractors and that garbage bins should be installed in public places and cleared on a daily basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ex-navy-chief-flags-concern-about-garbage-issue-in-state/articleshow/80678211.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Hyderabad||CPI meet censures Kanhaiya Kumar||HYDERABAD: The three-day national council meeting of the Communist Party of India, held here in the last week of January, passed a censure motion against Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of Jawaharlal Nehru University students’ union. He is presently a member of party’s national executive council. National leaders, including CPI national general secretary D Raja, attended the three-day meeting that concluded on January 31. The censure motion was taken up after Kanhaiya’s supporters had roughed up Indu Bhushan, the office secretary, in the party office at Patna on December 1. Local leaders said Bhushan was attacked because the Begusarai district council meeting had been postponed and Kanhaiya had not been informed about the change. CPI leaders said Kanhaiya needed to be cautioned as he had earlier issued statements about CPI having turned into “Confusion Party of India.” Kanhaiya had clarified later that he did not take part in the incident. He had also apologized for the action of his supporters. “Except for three members, all others in the meeting supported the censure motion. In all, 110 members were present when the motion was adopted against Kanhaiya,” CPI Telangana state secretary Chada Venkat Reddy told the TOI. Kumar did not attend the meeting on health grounds. “The censure motion was aimed at reprimanding the young leader and telling him to be careful in the future,” said Venkat Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cpi-meet-censures-kanhaiya/articleshow/80676898.cms||Roushan Ali

The vehicles were refuelled at a subsidised rate of Rs 50 per litre of petrol and diesel. GPCC vice-president Sankalp Amonkar demanded that the government cut down the taxes imposed on fuel. “BJP in 2014, before the elections, had assured to reduce the petrol prices to Rs 35 per litre. During the UPA governments, the price of crude oil was at around 100USD and the petrol price was around Rs 60. However, now the crude oil barrel is around 50USD and yet the petrol rate per litre is around Rs 83 in Goa,” Amonkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-fuels-up-100-pilots-autos/articleshow/80676893.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Nagpur||250 hectare forest gutted in Ambazari Biodiversity Park||Nagpur: In one of the biggest fires, over 250 hectares of forest in Ambazari Biodiversity Park was gutted in fire on Wednesday damaging rich grassland and biodiversity in the area.According to forest officials, the fire is said to have jumped from adjoining Nagpur University Campus where a fire engine was already at work to douse the fire. Ambazari forest is known for grassland and bird species accustomed to this habitat.“As the forest area is full of dry grass, the fire spread due to winds and the damage was heavy. The operation to extinguish the fire continued for nearly five hours from 2pm till 7pm. At least 10 fire engines were pressed into service. Over 25 forest staff with blowers were also involved,” said deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Prabhu Nath Shukla.“Ambazari forest despite having no tendu patta interest has always been prone to fires. Every year there are over dozen incidents of fires here. Fires are the greatest threats to grasslands and this has been proved in Ambazari time and again,” said former honorary wildlife warden Jaydeep Das.“If we do not take steps to remove sources of fire like people burning garbage on the fringes of the park or electric transmission lines passing through the forest, then these fires will continue to ignite Ambazari causing huge loss to revenue and biodiversity,” said Das.There are two legal cases going on in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Ambazari. One is after the high court suo motu cognisance of last year’s fire. Even as Ambazari is prone to fires, the MSETCL plans to lay transmission towers through the forest cutting over 1,000 trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/250-hectare-forest-gutted-in-ambazari-biodiversity-park/articleshow/80675427.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

February 4, 2021||Jaipur||Jodhpur varsity witnesses ugly scenes||Jodhpur: Ugly scenes were witnessed at Jai Narayan Vyas University on Wednesday when police resorted to lathicharge to disperse agitating students associated with ABVP ahead of their syndicate meeting. Some students including girls sustained minor injuries due to the lathicharge and stampede. The students had cordoned off the car of the vice-chancellor of the university who had reached the institute. Students blocked the path of his vehicle and lied down in front of the vehicle. Police later detained outgoing student union president Ravindra Singh Bhati but released him in the evening. Students had been protesting against the decision of the university administration to provide 34 bighas to JDA for construction of the convention centre. University students led by Bhati had assembled at the university office with two major demands which included the withdrawal of the decision to transfer university land to JDA and reduction of curriculum and fee on the ground that the university remained shut due to pandemic and there were no classes. Though, vice-chancellor PC Trivedi had invited Bhati and two of his aides for talks over these issues, but the students continued their demonstration after the meeting failed to arrive at any consensus and Trivedi left the office for syndicate meeting. Enraged students then shut the gate of the central office and sat there shouting slogans against the vice-chancellor. Bhati, after release from police detention, said he would immolate himself if the decision to provide the land to JDA was not withdrawn. “The land belongs to the university and could be used only by the university for any purpose, not by any other agency”, said Bhati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jodhpur-varsity-witnesses-ugly-scenes/articleshow/80676899.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||BMC to HC: Won’t hinder fishermen’s access to Lotus jetty||Mumbai: BMC assured Bombay high court on Wednesday it will not obstruct access of fishermen to Lotus jetty from where they carry out their fishing operations in the Haji Ali bay area due to reclamation work for constructing the coastal road. A bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and V G Bisht heard a petition by 10 fishermen who complained that BMC has obstructed them and others from operating their boats. Also, that the petitioners are threatened and intimidated to prevent them from carrying out their bona fide livelihood activities. They urged the court for unhindered access to the jetty. Their advocate, Meenaz Kakalia, argued that BMC has repeatedly stated before the court that fishing activities from Lotus jetty will not be impaired. Therefore, the petitioners seek the fulfilment of this assurance, she added. BMC’s reply, filed by the chief engineer (coastal road), denied the petitioners’ allegations and said reclamation work is some distance away from Lotus jetty and that it is building a navigational bridge for movement of boats of fishermen to and from the jetty. It annexed a plan to show that reclamation for the coastal road and construction of the navigational bridge do not prevent use of or access to the Lotus jetty. Senior advocate Aspi Chinoy for BMC submitted that if BMC wanted to obstruct the fishermen, then it would not build a navigational bridge. In their order, the judges recorded BMC’s assurance. While disposing of the petition, they also permitted fishermen to approach the Fisherfolk Rehabilitation Assessment Committee, set up by the state government, to settle their claim for damages to their fishing boats and related equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-to-hc-wont-hinder-fishermens-access-to-lotus-jetty/articleshow/80676930.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Nagpur||HC slams jail SP for not complying with its orders||Nagpur: Irked over non-compliance of its orders to release an accused, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday gave a dressing down to Central Jail superintendent Anup Kumre. A division bench comprising justices Zaka Haq and Amit Borkar on Tuesday had directed the SP to release an accused Ravishekhar Londekar. His relatives then approached the jail authorities with an order copy. However, the SP allegedly refused their requests and demanded sessions court’s orders for releasing the accused, ignoring the HC’s directives. The accused’s relatives then knocked HC’s doors through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar assisted by Saurabh Bhende. After hearing them, the judges summoned Kumre in the afternoon session, seeking an explanation on not obeying the HC’s orders. The public prosecutor explained that as per prison manual, no inmate can be released after 5pm. He added that the jail authorities had confirmed with the sessions’ court on HC’s directives and hence there was a delay in releasing Londekar. However, the prosecutor’s explanation failed to cut ice with the judges, who flayed the SP and directed him to remain present on Thursday with proper explanation on why HC’s orders weren’t followed. He was further told to clarify on how the prison manual and other related rules prevented him from complying with their clear orders of releasing the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-slams-jail-sp-for-not-complying-with-its-orders/articleshow/80675434.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

February 4, 2021||Jaipur||FIR against MLA Zahida Khan in Kaman, SHO relieved||Jaipur: Pahari police station in Kaman (Bharatpur) registered a case against MLA Kaman Zahida Khan for threatening and beating a local person on Tuesday leading to tension between the legislator and SHO Rajendra Sharma. The SHO has been relieved from the police station late on Wednesday. Complainant Akbar Khan alleged that on February 2 he was beaten up by three goons of Khan. The MLA called the complaint politically motivated and accused Sharma of registering it on false grounds. “I have been after SHO Sharma’s malpractices and have been demanding to release innocent persons arrested by him on January 31. He found an opportunity to settle scores with me by filing a police complaint,” said Khan. Reacting to the allegations, Sharma said Khan had been using her political clout to defend criminals creating obstacles in performing duties. “She has been staging a dharna to release two accused arrested under Section 151. Is this the job of the elected representative? I have been asking senior police officials to relieve me from Pahari police station since December due to the political interference. I have got the orders today and I have handed over the charge to the new SHO,” said Sharma. TOI repeatedly called up Bharatpur SP Devendra Kumar Bishnoi for his comments on the issue but was not available. Chaos prevailed at the SP office in Bharatpur on Wednesday after the supporters of Kaman MLA started raising slogans demanding action against the Pahari police station for filing a case against the MLA. Khan went to the SP office to meet DGP M L Lather who was taking a meeting with police officers of Bharatpur division. “The person who lodged an FIR against Khan was also present at the SP office trying to meet the DGP. Khan’s supporters got furious to see him and started demanding to drop the case against her,” said a police source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fir-against-mla-zahida-khan-in-kaman-sho-relieved/articleshow/80676906.cms||---

Chevella police said Dhanush Kumar died after his mother Parameshwari allegedly throttled him. Soon after boy’s father Shiva Kumar went to Moinabad, Parameshwari entered into a heated argument with her father-in-law Venkataiah over a petty issue. “Venkataiah is a paralytic patient. She took objection to his smoking and quarrelled with him,’’ Chevella inspector Ch Balakrishna said. She was drunk at that time. After the quarrel, when she was in another room along with Dhanush, for reasons unknown she killed the boy. The incident took place at around 5 pm.

February 4, 2021||Ludhiana||City’s senior citizens give thumbs down to ITR exemption||Ludhiana: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s decision to exempt senior citizens above the age of 75 years from filing income tax returns is being stated as one of the highlights of her budget, but city’s senior citizens seem totally unimpressed by the move. According to them, the announcement is not beneficial at all since no waiver in tax is being given to those who are eligible. Secondly, with such high age limit kept for inclusion in this scheme and only pensioners included, there are going to be hardly any beneficiaries of this scheme. Giving more information about the announcement, Ankur Gupta, a city-based chartered accountant, said, “As per the Budget announcement, senior citizens above the age of 75 years, having income from pension and interest, will be exempted from filing income tax returns. But no exemption in tax will be given if the income is falling in certain tax slabs. The exemption from filing of income tax returns will not be applicable if the senior citizen has income from any other source, except for pension and interest.” Speaking on the issue, Ravinder Pal Grover, a senior citizen, said, “This announcement cannot be termed as a benefit for the senior citizens when the condition of being a pensioner has been made mandatory to be eligible for this. Are those who are having income from business or rental income, etc. not senior citizens. Moreover, the move to include only those senior citizens who are above the age of 75 is shocking, as elsewhere like railways, which too is a government entity, people of 60 years and above are considered as senior citizens.” According to Usha Malhotra, a pensioiner, “This announcement as such is going to benefit very few senior citizens and pensioners due to such high age ceiling. Moreover, it is only exemption from filing the income tax return. Those persons who are earning more pension than the exemption limit under income tax will still be liable to pay income tax. It would have been better if all pensioners who have non-taxable income should have been given the exemption from filing of income tax returns.” Surinder Kaur, another pensioner, said that, “There is still a lot of confusion about the scheme as earlier there were reports that the persons above the age of 75 years have been exempted from income tax. But now it is being said that the exemption is from filing of income tax returns only and moreover there are conditions like having a pension account and an account in which interest is being earned in the same bank. The government must clear the confusion and also bring down the age for being covered under this exemption to 65 years at least.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/citys-senior-citizens-give-thumbs-down-to-itr-exemption/articleshow/80675442.cms||Mohit Behl
February 4, 2021||Nashik||Cops clueless in Lasalgaon murder case||Nashik: The rural police have still not got any clue in the Lasalgaon murder case in which a 70-year-old farmer died from alleged beating to him and his wife at their residence on the night of January 10. Police inspector Rahul Wagh of Lasalgaon police station said they are still trying to find out leads in the murder case. “The deceased has been identified as Karbhari Jagtap, while his wife Alka Jagtap (65) is still hospitalized and unable to speak. A surgery of her jaw has to be carried out. Hence, we are not getting any clue in the case,” he said. “From what we have understood from the signs that Alka made with her hand to inform us about that fateful night is that the couple were asleep when they were attacked by the unidentified suspects,” Wagh said, adding that they have alerted their informers to get information into the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cops-clueless-in-lasalgaon-murder-case/articleshow/80678215.cms||Santosh Sonawane
February 4, 2021||Jaipur||Independents to play key role in Bundi, Jhalawar districts||Kota: With considerable number of wards in their hands, independents have emerged as gamechangers in majority of the 11 municipal bodies — 6 in Bundi district and 5 in Jhalawar district, the home turf of BJP vice-president and ex-CM Vasundhara Raje. Both Congress and BJP are apprehensive of cross-voting in Bundi and Jhalawar. The election of municipality chairman and sabhapati (head) of the municipal council is scheduled to be held on February 7 for which the nominations process was over on Tuesday. The Congress, despite being in lead in Bundi with 28 of its councilors against BJP’s 24, in Lakheri with 17-10, Indergarh (9-7) and Kaperen (9–9) is likely to lose the head of some of its municipal bodies due discontentment among the local party workers over attempt of expansion of his foothold by minister Chandana with showcasing himself as the only leader of the party in the district. The independents — 8 each in Bundi and Lakheri, 5 in Indergarh, 7 in Kaperen, 4 in Keshoraipatan — have to play a decisive role in electing the chairman in each of the five municipal bodies of Bundi district while the ruling Congress is set to form its board in 25 wards in Nainwa municipality with its 15 councillors against BJP’s 10. Following the election of zila pramukh in Bundi, the ouster of three local BJP leaders namely ex-Bundi district BJP president Mahipat Singh Hada, panchayat councillor Shakti Singh Shawat and Omendra Singh Hada is seen to have played adverse for the saffron party that ruled Nainwa municipal board for three terms in the last 20 years. Since the ruling Congress and opposition BJP suffer from infighting within local spectrum in Bundi, speculations are high of formation of BJP board with 2015 strategy when despite being with fewer numbers of winning councilors, it succeeded to form the board and elected its sabhapati (head). “Congress is set to form its boards in at least 5 of the 6 local bodies in Bundi district,” Charmesh Sharma, Congress Bundi district vice-president said. In Jhalawar, BJP is safe to form the municipal board as it has 25 councillors out of a total of 45 wards. In Jhalrapatan municipal board too, the party is set to form the board. In Bhawanimandi municipal board, both the parties have 19 councillors each and therefore the two independents will play a decisive role. In Pedawa municipal board, Congress has a lead of just one councillor against the 9 councilors from the BJP which has supported nomination of an independent candidate for the post of chairman and is now attempting to use cross-voting to form its board. With 13 councillors, the Congress is in majority in Eklera municipality and is likely to form the board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/independents-to-play-key-role-in-bundi-jhalawar-districts/articleshow/80676970.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Agra||Little support for Sharjeel in AMU; dad, faculty at AMU, says proper probe needed||Agra: There is little support for Sharjeel Usmani, a former AMU student leader against whom Pune police filed a case for his utterances at the Elgar Parishad conclave in Pune held on January 30. On Tuesday, Pune police registered a case against Usmani under IPC section 153 (A) (promoting enmity between different groups on the ground religion, etc) for his alleged offensive remarks during the conclave. The opposition BJP in Maharashtra had demanded action against Usmani, accusing him of "hurting religious sentiments" with his speech at the event. “A few people can be wrong, but an entire community or religion cannot be branded in a particular way because of that," a research scholar and former AMU students’ union president Faizul Hassan said, adding," Just like the entire Muslim community can’t be responsible for a crime committed by a person from the minority group". However, Sharjeel's father, Dr Tariq Mahmood Usmani, a faculty member at AMU, told TOI that proper investigations should have been conducted before registering the FIR. Many other dignitaries were also present there when he had given the speech. “I don’t know where is he at present.” Another student, Farhan Zuberi, said Sharjeel's statement at Elgar Parishad was patently wrong. “He had given the statement with reference to mob lynching but we cannot hold an entire community responsible for the act of some who spread hatred. It's the same way Muslims feel bad when they are branded in a particular way." Some students, though, felt Sharjeel referred to "a particular group". Research scholar from AMU’s faculty of science Imran Khan said, “The message of his speech was to end hatred in society. However, it was interpreted as spreading hatred.” Ravish Ali Khan from the faculty of social work said Usmani’s message was for a particular group who were involved in mob lynching. “Many FIRs are registered on the basis of complaints but the court will decide whether it was illegal or not,” he said. Sharjeel was externed from Aligarh in October last year; he has been banned from entering the district for six months under the UP Control of Goondas Act. He was booked in four cases in December 2019 following the clash between AMU students, police and paramilitary forces during a protest against CAA. He has been charged for rioting, attempt to murder, promoting enmity between groups, among other things.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/little-support-for-sharjeel-in-amu-dad-faculty-at-amu-says-proper-probe-needed/articleshow/80674177.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

February 4, 2021||Jaipur||Jaipur: Civic body planning to take over trash collection from private firm||JAIPUR: The private firm responsible for door-to-door garbage collection in the city was reprimanded by JMC-Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar for their lackadaisical attitude towards sanitation. At a meeting on Tuesday, Gurjar expressed displeasure at the firm for not working as per the contract. She asked the firm to collect wet and dry waste separately according to the contract of BVG company, which till now hasn’t been implemented by the firm. Helper with vehicles are also not being arranged by the company. The mayor directed the representatives of the firm to fix the arrangement as per the contract in the next 7 days. “If the firm does not fix the arrangements as per the contract in the next seven days, then the agreement with the company would be cancelled,” said Gurjar. In the upcoming general body meeting, a discussion will be held on finding alternatives for garbage collection in the city. According to a senior JMC-Heritage official, the corporation was in the process of purchasing its own hoopers through which it will be able to manage the door-to-door garbage collection properly. “At present, the private firm was using 219 hoopers in Walled City. We have 100 hoopers of our own and we are planning to purchase around 100 more immediately. When needed we will purchase 50 more hoopers. We want to do away with this firm as the sanitation condition of the city is in a very bad shape,” said a JMC-Heritage official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/civic-body-planning-to-take-over-trash-collection-from-private-firm/articleshow/80676971.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Jaipur||AIIMS-Jodhpur introduces PET-CT scanner service||Jodhpur: In what can be termed a major leap in treatment of cancer, a PET-CT scanner service was introduced at the department of Nuclear Medicine in AIIMS-Jodhpur on Wednesday. First of its kind in any government hospital in Rajasthan, this facility will do away with the need for cancer patients to travel to other cities for PET scan. Director AIIMS, Sanjeev Misra said that the PET-CT scans are helpful in diagnosis, staging and follow-up of cancer patients and would be available to the patients at a cost lesser by 80-90% in private hospitals. Head of the Nuclear Medicine department, additional professor Rajesh Kumar said that PET-CT is functional imaging equipment which measures the metabolic activity of the cells. “It detects cancer at a very early stage along with the extent of its spread. It also helps in assessing the response of cancer treatment like chemotherapy and radiotherapy,” he said adding that it was helpful in planning the radiotherapy treatment also. Apart from cancer care, it is used for heart patients for deciding on treatment options like bypass surgery or angioplasty after heart attack, and brain imaging in patients with dementia, seizures and Parkinson’s disease etc. Kumar said that these procedures are safe with no significant side effects and the patient walks in the department and leaves after 2 to 3 hours when the procedure is complete. The department of Nuclear Medicine has also started working towards the creation of High Dose Radionuclide Therapy ward which will be of great advantage to many cancer patients requiring high dose radionuclide treatments under admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/aiims-jodhpur-introduces-pet-ct-scanner-service/articleshow/80676946.cms||---

It is a safe vaccine and by Thursday more cops will get it.” Agarwal said, “Our target is to get each cop of Ludhiana commissionerate vaccinated. We are motivating the cops for the same.

February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: No extra taxes, but more fees, charges||MUMBAI: Though municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal did not announce any new taxes or an increase in current taxes in the BMC budget on Wednesday, citizens will have to shell out more money for fees and charges. The BMC announced that it will soon begin collecting scrutiny fees for granting permission to provide fire and life safety measures in buildings and a fire service fee, and will soon set up a Fee Revision Authority to decide the increase in rates of BMC services. With the BMC facing a shortage in earnings, it is exploring other avenues of income. While the BMC is looking to recover its outstanding property tax dues, Chahal announced on Wednesday that the BMC will raise money from these new sources. The fire service fee will be based on the area of a building. “Only a gazette notification is awaited. Revenue of Rs 20 crore is expected from this,” Chahal said. The BMC is expecting to generate Rs 140 crore from scrutiny fees for granting permission to provide fire and life safety measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-extra-taxes-but-more-fees-charges/articleshow/80677002.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Property holders across the state will soon get an UID for their real estate, which will be required for carrying land-related work online including name transfer, map approvals and others. UDH principal secretary Bhaskar A Sawant said, “Initially, UID will be generated for properties where land owner is having a lease deed (patta). If the property record is reflected in UIT or development authorities record, the land work can be easily processed. Till date, we have a data of 9.5 lakh properties across the state and process is ongoing.” An official claimed the move was expected to not only streamline and organise the state’s outdated land records, but also reduce the burden on courts by enabling faster resolution of property disputes. Sources said the department would soon make the UID number mandatory for applying online in development authorities including Jaipur, Ajmer and Jodhpur. “Directions have been given to develop unique property identification generation system. To reduce fraudulent, the number would be required for any online transaction,” said a source. Sources said the system had been adopted in few cities of Punjab and Bihar, but it’s not operational full fledgedly. Ideally, UID should have details including address, type of construction, number of floors, purpose of use, whether residential or commercial and much more. Every UID will have the house number and codes for streets and wards, making it easier for officials to locate any house. Once a house is allotted UID, the owner will not have to carry property-related documents with him anywhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/unique-id-must-to-apply-for-any-land-related-work/articleshow/80679939.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Jaipur||Early detection and modern tech help improve cure rate of cancer||JAIPUR: From cancer diagnosis to treatment, modern technology and newer modalities of treatment have revolutionised cancer treatment and diagnosis for the benefit of the patients. Cancer is now a disease which one can find easily among families of friends, relatives or among near and dear ones. Despite all the misery and pain, there is a ray of hope. “With availability of newer modalities of treatment like targeted therapy & immuno-therapy, more and more patients are being controlled or cured of their disease and the number of cancer survivors is increasing,” said Dr Hemant Malhotra, director, cancer and super speciality centre at a private medical university in Jaipur. The grim reality is that cancer patients are growing in numbers, which is why the city has been witnessing more cancer care centres in government and private sectors in past one decade. “Now, every household has a cancer patient, cancer survivor or cancer mortality. There are several reasons for this — the ever increasing population and increased life span of our population and many more elderly subjects in the society (and cancer is a disease of the elderly), better diagnostic facilities, more awareness about the disease and possibly an actual increase in incidence due to our changing lifestyle and exposure to potential carcinogens,” said Malhotra. The good sign is that increasing number of patients and families wanting to take treatment for cancer. Also, many more cancers are diagnosed in early stages as compared to two or three decades ago and this is one of main reasons for our increasing cure rates, the doctors claimed. The patients are getting cured as they are diagnosed at an early stage. “There is tremendous change in diagnostics and therapeutics of cancer. Simple histo pathology to markers and molecular tests have revolutionised the way cancer is diagnosed. Similarly, basic chemotherapy is either replaced or added by target therapy and immuno-therapy. Muti laiting and radical surgeries are replaced with organ conservation surgeries. Newer radiation techniques like image guided and stereotactic have impacted positively on side effects and efficacy of radiation. And last but not the least, government schemes of supporting patients like ABMGSBY are game changers for our patients,” said Dr Naresh Somani, director and HOD-Medical Oncology, at a private hospital. Dr Kapil Dev Sheoran, surgical oncologist at a private hospital said, “Cancer incidence is increasing in younger age over the past few decades, which may be due to the lifestyle changes, environmental factors and may be genetic. With advancement in technology and development of healthcare infrastructure, the number of diagnosed cancer patients also increased along with longer survival, with better availability of cancer treatment in our country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/modern-technology-has-revolutionised-cancer-treatment-diagnosis-docs/articleshow/80677010.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

February 4, 2021||Nagpur||Bhandara begins vaccination of frontline staff, others to start today||Nagpur: Covid-19 vaccination of frontline workers started at Bhandara district on Wednesday, probably first among 11 districts in Vidarbha to launch Phase-II of vaccination programme. The turnout of healthcare workers declined to 59% in the region on Wednesday. The state government had uploaded names of frontline workers registered for vaccination in Co-WIN app on January 30. But the vaccination could not start for want of preparations at the centres. Superintendent of police Vasant Jadhav took the jab at Bhandara district general hospital. He was followed by additional SP Aniket Bharti. Deputy director of health, Nagpur Division, Dr Sanjay Jaiswal told TOI, “Vaccination of frontline workers will commence in remaining districts of the division from Thursday.” Vaccination will commence in Nagpur Rural from Thursday. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will begin to vaccinate frontline staff from Friday onwards. Preparations at Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital were over on Wednesday. Some more things remain to be done and will be finished on Thursday.” In all, 68,736 employees of urban local bodies, revenue department and agencies falling under ministry of home affairs had registered in six districts of Nagpur division. Highest number of 35,542 frontline workers has been registered in Nagpur district followed by 13,159 in Gadchiroli, 6,501 in Chandrapur, 4,866 in Bhandara, 4,472 in Wardha and 4,196 in Gondia. Registration of remaining staff is continuing. The number is likely to increase as the government permitted inclusion of staff of Panchayat institutions that is working in the pandemic. The Centre had announced vaccination of healthcare workers and frontline workers at the same time which was not executed. Vaccination of healthcare workers started on January 16. Till Wednesday, 69,718 (43.73%) of total registered healthcare workers of 1,59,427 had taken the jab in the region. The turnout was second lowest in a single day on Wednesday. As against target of 11,600, only 6,812 (58.72%) doctors, nurses, technicians, attendants etc turned up for the inoculation. Lowest was 57.62% recorded on January 19. Highest turnout was 95.3% on January 23. As reported by TOI earlier, actual turnout will be even less. The authorities are calculating the achievement considering target of 100 per centre. But scheduling of 120-150 healthcare staff is being done at all centres. In city, the NMC has further increased scheduling at centres. As against earlier 150, now scheduling of 200 people is being done at all centres. It is being done to complete first dose to all registered healthcare workers by government’s deadline of February 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bhandara-begins-vaccination-of-frontline-staff-others-to-start-today/articleshow/80675475.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

February 4, 2021||Jaipur||Finalised: Jaipur Metro phase-II to cover 23.5km, cost Rs 4.5Kcr||JAIPUR: Metro phase-II will between India Gate and Ambabari will run 23.5km and cost Rs 4,546 crore. The Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) has invited suggestions and objections after finalising the detailed project report (DPR). The corridor will be 23.51km having 21 elevated stations. In the revised route, the corporation has diverted the corridor from MI Road after a decision was taken to construct its corridor above the ground level. To make the project feasible, the (JMRC) had decided not to construct any underground tunnel as that would increase the project cost. Elevated corridor cannot be constructed on MI Road and near Ajmeri Gate as there are heritage buildings and structures. The JMRC has, therefore, diverted the corridor towards Ashok Marg and the train would reach Maharani’s College and SMS Hospital on Tonk Road via Ashok Marg. The DPR stated that the corridor runs from South to North. It connects different areas like Sitapura Industrial Area, Shatabdi Nagar, Pratap Nagar, Sanganer, Sitabari, Bapu Nagar, Rambagh, C Scheme, Chandpole, Bani Park, Sirampura, Ambabari, Prominent hospitals like SMS Hospital, Apollo Spectra, Zanana and also connects Jaipur International Airport. Sources said the nearest station from the airport will be B2 bypass station. “Between airport and B2 bypass station, there will be a distance of at least 600 metre as elevated road construction is restricted in the area for security reasons. “It is proposed to develop a dedicated corridor between Sanganer station and airport on surface where battery operated vehicles could be made operational,” a source added. An official source at JMRC said, “The state government should take up phase-II project as it would be more beneficial for the city in reducing congestion. The estimated ridership of Phase -II would be over 2,08,926 by 2031.” The JMRC had earlier appointed Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to review the detailed project report (DPR) of Jaipur Metro phase-II. “After terminating the contract of French company EGIS Rail SA, the corporation appointed DMRC for reviewing a revised DPR and bringing down the cost. In the DPR, DMRC has mentioned an estimated cost of Rs 4,546 crore,” an official said. Officials said, in the DPR prepared in 2014, it was mentioned that the project required land worth Rs 875 crore and construction cost to the tune of Rs 9,500 crore. But a rigorous exercise was conducted to bring down the cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/finalised-metro-phase-ii-to-cover-23-5km-cost-rs-4-5kcr/articleshow/80677037.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Medical colleges in six peripheral hospitals proposed||Plans to start mini medical colleges in six peripheral hospitals got a budgetary push of Rs 23 crore. It was announced in last year’s civic budget that Diplomate of National Board (DNB) courses will be started in peripheral hospitals, three each in the eastern and westerns suburbs. The move was primarily aimed at tackling the perennial shortage of teachers at these hospitals; 86 DNB courses in medicine, surgery, gynaecology, paediatrics, orthopaedics, ENT, ophthalmology, skin, anaesthesia, radiology and pathology will be started in six hospitals: Bhabha in Kurla, Rajawadi in Ghatkopar, Shatabdi in Govandi , Babasaheb Ambedkar in Kandivli, VN Desai in Santacruz and KB Bhabha in Bandra.

February 4, 2021||Kozhikode||Kunhalikutty quits LS seat||Kozhikode: IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty has resigned as member of Parliament, ostensibly to contest the upcoming assembly elections. Kunhalikutty submitted the resignation letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker in his chamber on Wednesday evening. He was representing the Malappuram Lok Sabha constituency. The IUML leader was elected to the assembly from Vengara in Malappuram in the 2016 elections. But he resigned and contested the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. Kunhalikutty’s return to state politics was formally announced at a news conference at Panakkad house in December 2020. The decision was later ratified by the national executive committee meeting in Kozhikode in the same month. There are rumblings within the party against Kunhalikutty’s return because he had claimed that he is going to Delhi to ‘strengthen the fight against fascism.’ Muslim Youth Legaue national vice-president and Panakkad Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal’s son Moyeen Ali Shihab Thangal had publicly expressed displeasure over Kunhalikutty’s comeback. Another IUML leader P V Abdul Wahab too indirectly spoke against Kunhalikutty’s return at a meeting to remember the party leader late E Ahamed in Kozhikode on Monday. Wahab said Ahamed did not return to Kerala without finishing the work entrusted to him. Kunhalikutty’s supporters say that the responsibility as MP was a hindrance for the leader to be actively involved in the affairs of UDF, which is in disarray. However, his detractors allege that Kunhalikutty’s hunger for power drove him to return. They say he opted for Lok Sabha hoping that UPA would come to power at the Centre and he would get a Cabinet berth. Some Christian groups had said that the ‘League eclipse’ of UDF will be complete once Kunhalikutty returns, especially after the dismal performance in local body elections. One of the front-runners for Malappuram Lok Sabha seat that falls vacant is MYL national general secretary C K Subair, who is now operating from Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kunhalikutty-quits-ls-seat/articleshow/80675532.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The protest at Palwal resumed on February 1 after it was briefly vacated due to “pressure” from the local authorities. Some of them had left after the January 26 clashes. Arun Jaildar, the head of 52 khaps who is leading the protest at NH-19 in Palwal, said, “The protest had resumed on Monday morning with just 12 people. In the next 48 hours, over 2,500 farmers from different districts of western UP, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana had arrived. These people, including women, are small farmers.” “We expect the numbers to rise. In the next few days, it will become a major protest site. Local residents are making contributions, someone is giving ration and the others are helping us set up tents. Now, 52 khap panchayats are backing the farmers’ protest. We will not back off till the central government withdraws the three farm laws and guarantee MSP to the farmers,” said Jaildar. Palwal-based farmer leader Chandan Singh Solanki said, “On January 30, farmers organized a mahapanchayat. Representatives of 52 khaps were present in the meeting. Decision was taken to resume protest under leadership of Arun Jaildar. We are getting overwhelming support from farmers of western UP, Punjab and Haryana. Soon farmers from different districts of Madhya Pradesh will also join us.” State president of BKU, Rajveer Singh Jadoun, said, “We are grateful to all the khap leaders for supporting us. The protest site at Palwal will see a huge gathering in the next few days. We have asked all farmers from Madhya Pradesh who want to actively participate in the protest to reach Palwal. Farmers from Agra and Aligarh division will also be strengthening the protest there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/after-ghazipur-protesters-from-western-up-have-a-new-address-palwal/articleshow/80674224.cms||Deepak Lavania
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||No bridge is too far: Allocation doubles||MUMBAI: The BMC Budget 2021-22 has given a big push to infrastructure projects. In fact, it has doubled the fund allocation for the bridges department to Rs 2,281 as against Rs 1,111 crore in the current fiscal. The BMC has made a provision of Rs 7,884 crore for infrastructure, which include planned projects such as bridges, rejuvenation of rivers, construction of pumping stations, road and various other similar works, which virtually stalled due to the pandemic. The administration said it wants to ensure these crucial projects do not suffer for lack of funds. Some of these works had already started or were about to start. The corporation will undertake demolition and reconstruction work of 21 brigades, major repairs of 47 and minor repairs of 144 brigades. About 60% of these works have been completed, but the BMC is yet to start some of the works on the Carnac Bridge and widening of bridge over Mithi River at Mahim Causeway. The BMC also proposed to start work on six major bridges in the coming financial year, mostly in the western suburbs adjoining the creek areas.he The BMC will also coordinate with the railways for the construction of 11 ROBs and a road under-bridge with a budget provision of Rs 200 crore. Priority will be given to ROBs at Dadar and Reay Road, said officials. It also plans to pay railways around Rs 962 crore for construction of ROBs, including at Lower Parel and Byculla. In 2021-22, the BMC aims to reconstruct the total road length of 157km in the city. Most of these will be cement-concrete including ones at C P Tank Road, Kalbadevi Road in South Mumbai and Link Road and SV Road in the western suburbs, Walji Laddha Road, and Lake Road in the eastern suburbs. The BMC also made Rs 1,300 crore provision for the Goregoan-Mulund Link Road, which will pass under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The BMC is in process to finalise the tendering process of tunnel work in a couple of months so that its work can be started just after the monsoon. It will be the biggest tunneling machine in the country, bigger than the one being used for the Mumbai Coastal Road work. The BMC has made provision of Rs 2,000 crore for the coastal road project, which started in 2018. Officials said 20% of the work has been completed so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-bridge-is-too-far-allocation-doubles/articleshow/80677181.cms||Vijay V Singh
February 4, 2021||Jaipur||States start road shows to boost domestic tourism||JAIPUR: Various state tourism departments have started doing road shows in various cities to revive the industry which has been affected the most by the pandemic. While Gujarat is trying to sell the Statue of Unity, Odisha is promoting religious and beach tourism products in markets like Rajasthan and Gujarat to attract domestic tourists. Rajasthan, which is currently working on a similar strategy, is participating in travel marts scheduled in February and March to attract domestic tourists as uncertainty hangs over the movement of international tourists. At a roadshow in Jaipur on Wednesday, Vishal Kumar Dev, principal secretary, Odisha tourism, said the eastern state is home to one of the eight blue flag beaches and number of watersports destinations which will be of interest for the people of the landocked state. “Besides the popular religious places like Jagannath temple in Puri, reputed places of worship in Bhubaneswar and other places, the state is rich in quality eco-tourism destinations which would be of great interest to the people of the desert state,” said Dev, at the event organised by Odisha tourism in association with FICCI. Throwing light on the post-Covid tourism plan, Dev said that in 2021 the focus will be on developing cruise tourism, homestays, heritage hospitality as well as upgrading of ecotourism facilities in the state. When TOI asked Alok Gupta, principal secretary tourism, Rajasthan, he said that they will lay out a plan for roadshows after getting feedback from the tourism marts the state is participating. “We are attending three travel marts where we will interact with the tour operators ans travels agents. Basing on their interest we will select places for the roadshows,” said Gupta. Director Rajasthan tourism Nishant Jain also floated the idea of harnessing synergies between the two states by cultural exchanges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/states-start-road-shows-to-boost-domestic-tourism/articleshow/80677127.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Jaipur||Jaipur youth beats paralysis, shines in CA exam||JAIPUR: Quadriplegic for two years, Mayank Singh (26) of Jaipur has beaten all odds to rank third in CA exam (old course) announced on Monday. Singh had met with an accident in August 2017 leading him to complete state paralysis till 2019-end. He recovered to his best with paralysis remaining below the waist. He was to appear in the CA final exam in 2017 but the accident postponed his plans till he started showing recovery signs in the upper parts of the body. “My spinal injury has left my body standstill. I couldn’t come to terms to the trauma caused by the accident for months. Every third day I felt I lost the battle. It was not easy to keep the spirits high but I made a resolve to keep going,” said Singh, who did his schooling from Army Public School. His parents— father Nonihal Singh and mother Nita Singh — stood by him like a rock and never allowed negative thoughts to come near him. His physiotherapy sessions have shown results and he started sitting on a wheelchair and on bed for a couple of hours at a stretch. “Then I realised that I should appear in the CA final exam in 2020. I opened my books and started taking online classes. Initially, it was difficult but soon I got into the groove,” said Singh. The result has filled him with confidence and he is hoping to get a job wherein he can work according to his medical condition. Learning a bitter lesson that rehabilitation of spinal cord injury is a challenge, he found a new purpose of opening a rehabilitation centre fulfilling the needs of patients. “Those down with such complex problems face a lot of mental trauma and depression. I am fortunate to be around with parents, family and friends who have doesn’t allow me to slip into depression,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/youth-beats-paralysis-shines-in-ca-exam/articleshow/80677100.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ protests blow into global social media war as celebs join in||NEW DELHI: The farmers’ strike escalated into a full-blown war on social media cutting across international borders on Wednesday. US vice-president Kamala Harris’s niece Meena Harris, climate activist Greta Thunberg, US House foreign affairs committee member Jim Costa, YouTuber Lilly Singh, poet Rupi Kaur, rapper Russ, former adult filmstar Mia Khalifa, UK MP Claudia Webbe and a host of others poured out in support of the ongoing agitation after Rihanna’s one-line post on Tuesday. “Why aren’t we talking about this?!,” the international popstar with a Twitter following of 101 million had written with the hashtag #FarmersProtest and a CNN report on the internet shutdown around Delhi. On the other side, actors Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn and Suniel Shetty, producer-directors Karan Johar and Ekta Kapoor, singers Lata Mangeshkar and Kailash Kher, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan and shuttler Saina Nehwal posted tweets with the hashtags India Together and India against Propaganda that MEA spokesman Anurag Srivastava had used while sharing a statement. “The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” MEA said, reacting indirectly to Rihanna’s tweet. The two hashtags had garnered over 759k and 821k tweets by 10.45pm and were the top trends globally around 10.30pm; #IndiaWithModi, was also among the top trends on the microblogging platform with over 262k tweets. Rihanna’s tweet made her the top trend in India on Wednesday with over 278k retweets and 634k likes around 8pm. The hashtag also drew 1.4 million mentions and reached the third spot on the global trend list at one point. Punjabi singer Diljit Dosanjh sang a song for her, which crossed nearly 560k views on YouTube just nine hours after its release. Through the day, Kangana Ranaut took several digs at Rihanna on social media. “Don’t fall for any false propaganda against India or Indian policies. It’s important to stand united at this hour w/o any infighting,” Devgn posted. Mangeshkar also posted with the two hashtags. “India is a glorious nation and we all Indians stand with our heads held high. As a proud Indian, I have full faith that any issues or problems that as a country we face, we are fully equipped to resolve them amicably, keeping the interest of our people in mind. Jai Hind,” she wrote. Meena Harris, daughter of Kamala Harris’s sister and a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School, while drawing parallels between the Capitol Hill siege when Donald Trump’s supporters attacked Capitol Hill, wrote: “It’s no coincidence that the world’s oldest democracy was attacked not even a month ago, and as we speak, the most populous democracy is under assault. This is related. We ALL should be outraged by India’s internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters.” She also shared a picture of women farmers holding up a placard that read “Stop Killing Farmers”. Harris’s tweet had over 40k likes and was shared by over 18k people. Tendulkar posted: “India’s sovereignty cannot be compromised. External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Let’s remain united as a nation.” By 10.45pm, it had received over 153k likes and over 65k retweets. Union home minister Amit Shah, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and other ministers like Hardeep Singh Puri and Gen V K Singh, and UP CM Yogi Aditya Nath also used the MEA hashtags to tweet their support to the farm laws. BJP president JP Nadda posted: “We stand together. We stand united against all attempts to malign India through propaganda and fake narratives.” Greta Thunberg, who has over 4.7 million followers on Twitter, also shared the CNN article initially posted by Rihanna. “We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India,” she wrote. Her tweet was also retweeted by 92k people and liked over 226k times. Replying to Thunberg, economist Shamika Ravi wrote, “The irony! Climate champion standing in support of farming practices that have led to poisoned land, vanishing water-table and the “cancer trains”. India can definitely do better. India is trying to do better by bringing in long awaited farm reforms. Pls don’t muddy the waters.” Other youth climate activists — Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, Jamie Margolin from the US, Elizabeth Wathuti from Kenya — all rallied behind the farmers after nine-year-old Delhi-based climate activist Licypriya Kangujam asked for their support. Global watchdog Human Rights Watch used its official, verified handle to share Rihanna’s tweet, while condemning the “politically motivated” cases against activists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-protests-blow-into-global-social-media-war-as-celebs-join-in/articleshow/80678234.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Short on revenue, BMC still goes big on health and infrastructure||MUMBAI: Dipping into reserves to meet a gaping shortfall in revenue, municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal has announced a big upgrade of public health facilities, including a new building for treating infectious diseases, and substantial allocations for infrastructure as part of the civic budget for Mumbai. The slowdown in real estate deprived the corporation of its biggest income sources – so far, property tax collected this year is a mere 17% of the targeted Rs 6,768 crore and building development charges are 70% less than the estimated Rs 3,880 crore. Despite this crunch, the budget has increased to Rs 39,038 crore, nearly 17% over last year's outlay. BMC plans to dip into its fixed deposit reserves to raise Rs 4,688 crore and take a Rs 5,876-crore internal loan to meet budget expectations. The health allocation of Rs 4,728 crore, which has increased by 11%, will be used to upgrade civic hospitals and other facilities. A new building for treating infectious disease in Kasturba Hospital will also be built. No new big-budget infra project unveiled by BMCIn infrastructure, no new mega project was announced; instead Chahal has stressed on completing ongoing and planned projects. BMC plans to spend Rs 14,111 crore on projects (last year it was Rs 9,963 crore) besides the Rs 2,007 crore set aside for the Coastal Road. BMC has also set aside Rs 3,659 crore for solid waste management which includes Rs 191 crore for waste to energy plants and the scientific closure of dumping grounds. While it has allotted Rs 2,231 crore for roads and traffic departments, Rs 200 crore will be earmarked for beautification of footpaths, traffic islands and creation of street food hubs. Chahal said BMC will demolish and reconstruct 21 bridges, repair 47 bridges and carry out minor repairs on 144 other bridges at an estimated cost of Rs 961 crore. “A huge amount will be required in future for completing these projects. Also, there will be a need for money for upkeep and upgradation of these facilities in the future. So, priority of capital works will be ascertained and projects which are not of immediate importance will be deferred,” Chahal said. With chief minister Uddhav Thackeray keen on making the city flood-free, BMC has also allocated Rs 1,699 crore for storm water drain works. This includes an allocation of Rs 50 crore for river rejuvenation and Rs 347 crore for reviving and beautifying Mithi river. Chahal said BMC would install mini pumping stations to mitigate flooding spots at 86 low lying areas in the city. The budget also sets aside Rs 670 crore for repairing water reservoirs and laying new water pipelines. Another Rs 542 crore will be for the Water Distribution Improvement Programme. Rs 1,346 crore was allotted for the planned seven Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) that would treat sewage before it is disposed into the sea. The administration had promised to roll out a new policy to manage parks and gardens, but only Rs 126 crore has been allotted for the garden department. Chahal has also announced a new hoarding policy for the city in a bid to increase the revenue it gets from advertisers. The BMC is worried about its falling revenues from property tax. Against the targeted Rs 6,768 crore from property tax, it still hopes to collect Rs 4,500 crore by March end, though it is an ambitious goal. Besides, Chahal said estimated revenue from the Development Plan (DP) department through building development charges had dropped from Rs 3,879 crore to Rs 1,199 crore. The BMC is also looking to generate income from newer sources like fire service fees and by carrying out a revision of municipal services fees in coming years. The BMC also said the Maharashtra government owes it Rs 5,274 crore in dues while other state agencies like the SRA and MMDRA owed it Rs 121 crore. In a significant move, Chahal has proposed that the BMC should be notified as a single planning authority for the city instead of having multiple authorities like SRA, MMRDA, Mhada, MIDC and MSRDC. Chahal said the BMC would request the state government to make it the city’s only planning authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/short-on-revenue-bmc-still-goes-big-on-health-infra/articleshow/80678239.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
February 4, 2021||Jaipur||No changes in Rajasthan cabinet till Budget session is over: AICC gen secy Ajay Maken||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has convinced the Congress central leadership in delaying state-level political appointments and making changes in the council of ministers until the Budget session gets over. Both the exercises may get further delayed as the party would be facing bypolls in four assembly constituencies after the Budget session, which is beginning from February 10 and may continue for a month. Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and his supporters wanted at least the political appointments in the state’s statutory boards and commission to be made before the assembly session. The party had even set January 31 as the deadline for these appointments. AICC general secretary in-charge for the state Ajay Maken, however, announced the party’s changed stand on Wednesday. Maken assured of just the district-level political appointments by the middle of February, but clearly ruled out any change in the council of ministers amid the session starting next week. “The Budget session has been called. Changes in council of ministers are never made amid an assembly session,” Maken told reporters after presiding over the PCC executive committee meeting at the party headquarters here. At the meeting, the newly appointed executive members were tasked to recommend names for district-level political appointments by February 10. The AICC general secretary was sent to the state capital amid reports that Gehlot and Pilot were once again at loggerheads over making political appointments and cabinet changes to accommodate more Congressmen in the state’s governance. Soon after he reached here late Tuesday evening, Maken met chief minister Gehlot at the latter’s residence. The meeting lasted over two hours. “The talks included upcoming bypolls and also about political appointments and cabinet reshuffle,” Maken told reporters. Earlier on Tuesday, AICC treasurer and former Union minister Pawan Bansal had come to Jaipur and met Gehlot. Party sources said Gehlot managed to make the two AICC leaders see his perspective against making any major changes in the state at this stage. Maken met Pilot before returning to Delhi late Wednesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-changes-in-raj-cabinet-till-budget-session-is-over-aicc-gen-secy-maken/articleshow/80677155.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Thiruvananthapuram||J P Nadda highlights Covid spike in BJP’s poll campaign launch||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/ THRISSUR: Launching a two-pronged attack on the ruling LDF and opposition UDF in the state, BJP national president J P Nadda said they are both corrupt and ideologically bankrupt – two sides of the same coin. Speaking at a news conference, here, on Wednesday, he said both the fronts are power seekers. While they are fighting against each other here, they are allies in West Bengal. This shows their lack of ideology. Both fronts come together wherever BJP is prominent. Nadda attacked both Pinarayi Vijayan and Oommen Chandy, under whose leaderships LDF and UDF are preparing to face the assembly polls. He said the involvement of CM’s office in the gold smuggling case is an embarrassment to all Keralites. Corruption is rampant under LDF rule, be it the gold smuggling case, Life Mission or Sprinklr deal. PSC has become a CPM recruitment agency, Nadda said. “Pinarayi Vijayan was the one who sought a probe by central agencies into the gold smuggling case, but when the heat reached his office he turned against those same agencies,” Nadda said, adding that LDF government under Vijayan is constantly attacking constitutional bodies. The resolution against CAG is dangerous. Corruption has patronage of highest office, he said. On the other side, Chandy is also mired in solar sex scandal and bar bribery allegations. The Congress has also backstabbed Ayyappa devotees, he said. “Till date, Rahul Gandhi has not uttered a single word in support of devotees whereas BJP state president K Surendran is facing over 200 cases in connection with the Sabarimala agitation to protect the faith of devotees. And now they are talking about bringing in legislation. This is the height of hypocrisy,” he said. Regarding the alarming rise of Covid-19 cases in the state, Nadda, the former Union minister of health, said it is the ineffectiveness of the political leadership here that has caused this debacle. Later in the day, Nadda inducted actor Krishnakumar into the party. Nadda in Thrissur todayOn Thursday, Nadda will be in Thrissur on a day’s visit to the district. He will meet party mandalam-level leaders in the morning. Subsequently, he will interact with the leaders of the various Sangh Parivar organisations and this will be followed by a meeting with leaders of social organizations in the afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nadda-highlights-covid-spike-in-bjps-poll-campaign-launch/articleshow/80675564.cms||---

At a press conference, ACP Ajay Pal Lamba said they recovered 41,874 poppy plants from a farmland in Shivdaspura. “Acting on a tip-off, Jaipur South team raided a farmland where wheat was being cultivated. Police found poppy plants in the guise of wheat cultivation and recovered poppy plants weighing 190 kilograms,” said Lamba. Two persons — Soorajmal and Kaluram— were arrested in this connection. Initial investigation said Kaluram had been raising the plants. Another raid was carried out by Harmada police leading to the arrest of three persons – Sonu Kumar, Harendra Kumar and Rajkumar — with 40kg of cannabis. “They were found to be running an inter-state drug racket. They were procuring cannabis from Hajipur in Patna for Rs 10,000 per kilo and were selling at Rs 18,000 kilogram per kilo,” said Lamba. During the investigation, the accused told police that cannabis they were procuring is called by name Agartala Cannabis which is high quality and much in demand.

February 4, 2021||Mumbai||More cancer patients returning to Mumbai for treatment since December||MUMBAI: While the countrywide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic saw a dip in cancer patients seeking treatment, there has been an improvement in their numbers in the past two months, show statistics from Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), the country’s premier cancer-care hub located in Parel. While 45,000 new cancer patients register themselves for treatment at the Parel hospital every year, the corresponding number in 2020 was only 30,000, said TMH director Dr C Pramesh. “Only two-third of the usual number could make it to the hospital for treatment last year, mainly due to travel restrictions,” he said. Tata Memorial Hospital gets patients from across the country, with a sizeable number from the northeastern states. While it treats close to 70,000 new and old cancer patients every year, the overall numbers are not available as many patients sought tele or video consults last year. In December 2020, new registrations improved with almost 95% of the monthly average, said Dr Pramesh. “It was 110% in January,” the doctor added. According to the World Health Organisation data released on World Cancer Day (February 4) last year, India saw roughly 1.16 million new cancer cases in 2018. The WHO statistics suggested that one in 10 Indians would develop cancer during their lifetime and one in 15 would die of the disease. World Cancer Day is observed by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) to raise attention for a cancer-free future. In April 2020, Tata Memorial Centre director Dr Rajendra Badwe and Dr Pramesh wrote in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) about their hospital’s decision to keep treatment available despite the lockdown. Not providing treatment would be a bigger tragedy in India, they wrote. The hospital decided not to de-escalate services because the virus has been spreading “more slowly” in India than in other countries. The hospital decided to avoid complex surgeries requiring multiple blood transfusions or prolonged ICU care, it offered teleconsults, and restricted relatives in OPDs and in-patient wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/more-cancer-patients-returning-to-city-for-treatment-since-dec/articleshow/80677184.cms||Malathy Iyer

February 4, 2021||Thiruvananthapuram||CPM, CPI stall NCP rebellion||T’puram: Timely intervention by national leaderships of CPI and CPM seems to have stalled the bid of NCP to exit LDF and join UDF. At the discussion convened by national president Sharad Pawar in Delhi on Wednesday it was decided that general secretary Praful Patel will hold talks with CPM state leadership and CM Pinarayi Vijayan to resolve the complaints raised by NCP state leadership. CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury also attended the meeting in which NCP state president TP Peethambaran, minister AK Saseendran and MLA Mani C Kappan participated. During the meet Kerala leaders insisted on contesting from four seats, including the three sitting seats in which NCP contested in 2016. Pala seat, which has become a bone of contention between NCP and new LDF entrant KC (M), came up during debate. It is learnt that Pawar endorsed Kerala unit’s demand and told Yechury to work out a formula to retain Pala seat. Sources said Pawar had a telephonic discussion with CPI general secretary D Raja on the issue and Raja also promised intervention to settle the issue amicably. Both CPM and CPI leaders told Pawar that chances for a second term in office are very high and all constituents needed to work together for that. On his part, Pawar wants to avoid a split in Kerala unit. Soon after the conclusion of talks in Delhi, KC(M) leader Jose K Mani told reporters in Kottayam that he never staked a public claim on Pala. "In LDF, seat sharing talk hasn’t begun. We will discuss all issues. I haven’t made public statement on Pala," he said. Meanwhile, UDF leadership is trying hard to rope in Kappan if they fail to win over NCP. Kappan has a good chance to win Pala seat and KC(Joseph faction) has already announced its willingness to give the seat to Kappan. On Tuesday, PJ Joseph expressed confidence that Kappan would join the front and contest from Pala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-cpi-stall-ncp-rebellion/articleshow/80675585.cms||---

The encounter took place in Baraut region near Mandi minutes before midnight.When contacted, Baghpat SP Abhishek Singh told TOI, "We had inputs from Delhi Police about the movement of wanted criminals in Baraut region. A joint team was deployed in the area and soon intercepted a car with no registration number plate. The car sped off and crashed after a distance. Instead of surrendering, the accused opened fire at the police team with a carbine and pistol. In retaliation, police left him critically injured. He was pronounced dead in the hospital.""Javed had 19 criminal cases registered against him. He had three cases in Baghpat alone.

February 4, 2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: You show me a flooding spot, I’ll show you the funds||MUMBAI: To keep its promise of a flood-free city during monsoon, the BMC, in a first, made a dedicated budget provision of Rs 150 crore for 58 chronic flooding spots. These are among the 386 flooding spots identified by civic body after a recent survey. This dedicated allocation may be increased later as the issue is on the BMC’s priority list. The civic body has already invited tenders worth Rs 720 crore for these 58 chronic flooding spots and work is expected to be completed in a year or two. Of the 386 chronic flooding spots, the BMC claims to have “fixed” 171 and plans complete work at 118 more before the 2022 monsoon. The work includes widening of nullahs, installing additional pumps, removing bottlenecks of drain system, and creating additional drains. Every monsoon, Mumbaikars face a tough time due to bad road patches, flooding and resultant traffic snarls. The BMC has failed to find a permanent solution, but spends thousands of crores on “superficial work”, said Faizan Aziz, a resident of Taximen’s Colony in Kurla, one of the chronic flooding spots near Mithi river. “Earlier too the BMC has spent so much money on Mithi river, but nothing has changed in our area. It still floods every time it pours. Also, there is no accountability where they spent the money. This time too, it will be the same; the spending will remain on paper,” he added. With an eye on the BMC elections scheduled in 2022, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has taken a personal interest in resolving the flooding issue, hence civic officials are rushing to complete maximum work before this monsoon. Recently, the BMC had made a presentation on the status of the work to ministers Aaditya Thackeray and Anil Parab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/you-show-me-a-flooding-spot-ill-show-you-the-funds/articleshow/80677240.cms||Vijay V Singh

February 4, 2021||Pune||Higher inoculation propels Maha to 3rd spot||Pune: After a slow start, Maharashtra’s vaccination drive has finally picked up pace, ensuring vaccination of over 3.19 lakh beneficiaries till February 2, the third highest after Uttar Pradesh (4.64 lakh) and Rajasthan (3.39 lakh). As per health and family welfare ministry data, Maharashtra occupied the fifth spot on the vaccination chart in the country till January 26. It had then vaccinated 1.37 lakh healthcare workers, much lower than states like Karnataka (2.32 lakh), Odisha (1.77 lakh), Rajasthan (1.61 lakh) and Andhra Pradesh (1.56 lakh). National Health Mission commissioner Dr Ramaswami N told TOI, “The number of sites in Maharashtra has gone up from 285 to more than 530 now. We have also witnessed more acceptability of the drive among the beneficiaries as time has passed. Besides, the ironing out of the initial glitches in Co-Win app has helped too.” He said while some centres were catering to a 75-80% of turnout daily, some others were crossing the 100%-mark in terms of daily vaccinations. “Per day planned vaccination is an average of over 120 beneficiaries currently. The number of beneficiaries immunised per day is likely to be scaled up further,” Dr Ramaswami said. Dr Archana Patil, director of state health services, said the state had been increasing the number of beneficiaries being vaccinated daily, apart from recently increasing the number of session sites to accommodate more beneficiaries. “On-the-spot vaccination also played a role,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/higher-inoculation-propels-maha-to-3rd-spot/articleshow/80677208.cms||Neha Madaan

February 4, 2021||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Spike in positivity rate in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: The daily Covid test positivity rate — percentage of people who are Covid-19 positive out of the total tested — in Punjab has recorded an increase in the recent days, moving up from 0.9% to 2.13%. From January 19 to February 2, 2,34,250 people were tested of which 2,737 were found infected, 182 cases a day on average. Barring a few days, the rate posted daily rise from January 19, touching 2.13% on February 2 when the test report of 205 out of 9,580 came positive. Mohali has the highest positivity rate with 11.5% of 171972 tests per million testing positive. Bathinda has a positivity rate of 6% followed by Ferozepur and Faridkot where 5.5% of total tests per million have been found positive. Patiala, Fazilka, Muktsar, Amritsar and Pathankot have a positivity rate over 4%. The districts with high positivity rate have been asked to ascertain the reasons and take corrective steps to check the spread. Conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and rapid antigen tests (RAT) are used to identify people infected with the virus. There has been wide variation in positivity rate of both the testing methods. The positivity rate of tests conducted by using RT-PCR tests ranged between 0.9% to 2.1% from January 19 to February 1 while during the same two-week period the positivity rate of antigen testing varied from 1.1% to 0.5%. There has also been a drop in testing. Punjab conducted 18,086 tests a day on average in January, the figure of which was 22,331 in December. In the first two days of February, 12,378 people were tested. Ferozepur, Fazilka, Moga, Muktsar and Faridkot are among the districts conducting least tests per million population. RT PCR TEST FOR STUDENTSThe Punjab education department has asked students of meritorious schools willing to resume classes to submit negative RT PCR reports. The state government has decided to allow re-opening of meritorious schools from February 9. They have also been asked to bring sanitiser, seven reusable masks and six pieces of soap. The students will be quarantined for 24 hours after joining the school. The school managements have been directed to have thermal scanners to screen everyone entering the school premises. They have been asked to ensure social distancing while allotting beds in hostels and seats in classrooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/spike-in-positivity-rate-in-punjab/articleshow/80678249.cms||Vinod Kumar
February 4, 2021||Vadodara||VMC budget in limbo due to delays in civic body election||Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is in a quandary regarding the budget for the ensuing financial year. With the elected wing in place, there is confusion regarding the authority to clear the annual budget.The budget is traditionally tabled before the elected wing by the municipal commissioner in the end of January. The standing committee of the civic body that comprises elected members discusses the budget and clears it with changes, if any.The last stage involves presenting the budget to the general board that deliberates over the budget. Once the budget is cleared by the general board, it can be implemented. Since the VMC elections were delayed this year due to the pandemic, the term of the elected wing came to an end. The VMC commissioner was made the chief executive of the civic body. But the state government gave the chief executive the powers of only the standing committee. Also, the commissioner in his position as the chief executive does not have the authority to make any policy decisions. The limited powers vested with the chief executive have put the budget in a grey area. A highly placed source pointed out that while the other provisions of the budget could be taken up later, it was important to clear the proposals regarding the tax and charges. “These are a part of the budget, but have to be cleared before February 20 as per the rules,” said an official.Even if the chief executive decides to take up the proposals for tax and charges, the model code of conduct can be a hurdle. “Any change in the charges or taxes can be challenged by the political parties if it is perceived to be benefiting someone,” said another official. He added that a way out was to seek permission to clear only the tax and charges proposals at the current rates without any changes.Sources said that the VMC has already written to the state government regarding the situation. It has sought clarification and guidance from the state government and a reply is awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmc-budget-in-limbo-due-to-delays-in-civic-body-election/articleshow/80674391.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: In this Vizag hamlet, unanimous polls the norm for 50 years||VILASAKANNAPALEM (PADMANABHAM): Amid the fierce ongoing battle for gram panchayat elections in Andhra Pradesh is a village in Visakhapatnam district where unanimous elections have been the norm for about 50 years. Located some 50 kilometres from Vizag city, Vilasakannapalem in Padmanabham mandal has chosen the sarpanch candidate unanimously for at least ten terms. When TOI visited Vilasakannapalem on Wednesday, the locals attributed the transformation of the village into a model one to the unanimous elections, which exerted a salutary effect on residents and kept the brotherhood intact for almost 50 years. R Appalaswamy alone served as the unanimous sarpanch candidate for five terms from 1969 to 1994. Surrounded by paddy, sugarcane and maize fields, several youth from the village are now serving in various state and central government organisations, while many have been elevated to higher positions in various MNCs in India and overseas. Giving a peek into the unanimous election tradition, Mokkapati Srinivas, a former cooperative society president of the village, whose house has been the meeting point for deciding the sarpanch candidates since his father’s time, said, “The majority of the villagers are farmers and agricultural labour. They are more interested in doing their own work rather than using their position to exercise authority. The unanimous election tradition started in the 1950s and continued till date. There was some competition for the sarpanch candidate for the last three terms. This time, we want to request the government to upgrade the primary school as upper primary school as the students have to travel three kilometres for the nearest high school in Maddi.” B Subhadra, who served as the sarpanch from 2013 to 2018, said the village has witnessed a lot of developmental activities in the last five decades. “We could develop cement roads in all streets and a good drainage system. We got a cash incentive of Rs 7 lakh from the state government for the unanimous election in 2013. The desire to serve the people and demonstrate his/her capacity in doing the best for the village would be accentuated once the candidate is elected without contest,” said Subhadra. Tummi Siva, a local youth, said there has been some competition between two candidates from the same political party this time. “But our villagers would sort it out to continue the unanimous election tradition,” Siva exuded confidence. Boni Srinu, an old-timer of the village, said the village has all infrastructure such as roads, drains, drinking water supply, electricity and moreover, good governance. “As the majority of the people belong to the same community, the villagers feel that the election battle may lead to concentration of political power or enmity among locals after spending huge sums of money,” said Srinu. This time, locals have demanded the government extend AP FiberNet to their village for better connectivity for students, in view of the Covid-19 experience. They also want the government to convert a library set up by the students in the village into a government library.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/in-this-hamlet-unanimous-polls-the-norm-for-50-years/articleshow/80674371.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
February 4, 2021||Pune||Covid acting like endemic disease: Top health official||PUNE: The Covid-19 positivity rate in Maharashtra has dropped to 4.5%, causing it to behave like an endemic disease as against a pandemic, Pradeep Awate, state disease surveillance officer, said on Wednesday. He said the positivity rate had stayed between 4.6%-4.5% for the last one week. “When the positivity rate consistently remains below 5%, it shows that the infection is under control,” Awate said. During the week ending January 19, Maharashtra’s test positivity rate was at 5.7%, which dropped slightly to 5.5% thereafter. The first and second weeks of January had registered a test positivity rate of 5.3%. As per estimates from the ministry of health and family welfare, though Maharashtra was among the eight states and Union Territories with weekly positivity rate higher than the national average (1.91%) by February 3, its weekly positivity rate has fallen to 4.5% recently as against 4.6% last week. Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid task force, told TOI, “In epidemics like Covid, there is a bell-shaped curve and a tail, the latter which in Maharashtra’s case has been thick. In terms of the disease spread, we are now tailing off. Cities like Mumbai and Pune witnessed a thick tail even after the pandemic began subsiding. They kept on recording a relatively higher but stable number of cases per day at one point in time, which has now started coming down further. The first large wave of India is almost gone, and the tail in some of the geographies, which had a larger prevalence, is taking a little longer to disappear. We hope that the tail vanishes in another month’s time.” Joshi said the tail has been thicker in case of Maharashtra due to the dip in temperatures. “We have to still avert another rise, for which masking and 6-ft distancing are key,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-acting-like-endemic-disease-top-health-official/articleshow/80677270.cms||Neha Madaan
February 4, 2021||Kozhikode||Cases filed against Aishwarya Kerala Yatra workers||Kozhikode: Police registered cases against UDF leaders and workers for violating Covid restrictions during Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala’s Aishwarya Kerala Yatra at Taliparamba and Sreekandapuram on Tuesday. Taliparamba deputy SP T K Rathnakumar told TOI that cases were registered under Kerala Epidemic Diseases Act against DCC president Satheesan Pacheni and 400 (identifiable) persons. Local UDF leaders were among the 100 accused in the case charged at Sreekandapuram. Reacting to the police action on Wednesday, Chennithala said that UDF will not be cowed down by strong-arm tactics. He said the Yatra will continue as planned and added that the Yatra has given a heartburn to LDF. Earlier addressing a news conference in Kalpetta, Chennithala denied minister AK Balan’s allegation that Covid protocol was not maintained during his Yatra. “Is there no violation of the protocols at the adalats being conducted by ministers?” he asked. Chennithala said both CPM and BJP are maintaining a silence on Sabarimala issue. “Both parties are not reacting because they fear that it will affect their new-found relationship,” he alleged, adding that it was the arrogance of Pinarayi Vijayan that led to the problems at Sabarimala, claimed Chennithala wanted to know whether LDF is ready to ask the Supreme Court to expedite hearing in the case. “PM Narendra Modi had stated that Centre would enact a law for the protection of faith in Sabarimala. We would like to know whether BJP leaders in state will take the initiative in this regard,” he said. Chennithala alleged that CPM is deliberately trying to create a communal divide by attacking IUML. “What wrong in Congress leaders visiting the house Panakkad Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal, who is the leader of UDF,” he said, adding that the CPM leaders are parroting the words of BJP.

February 4, 2021||Vijayawada||Teething troubles slow down doorstep delivery of rice||Amaravati: With the government’s doorstep delivery of rations scheme hitting roadblocks in many districts, top officials swung into action and initiated measures to clear hurdles. Problems faced by operators of the Mobile Dispensing Units (MDUs) that handle supplies hampered distribution of rice on the first two days following the launch of the scheme. The government had launched the doorstep delivery of quality rice in urban areas on Monday and is awaiting clearance from the State Election Commission (SEC) before kickstarting the programme in rural areas. Distribution, which was just around 10% on the first two days, picked up pace from Wednesday after the intervention of senior officials. Several operators of the MDUs reached the local tehsildar offices and handed over the vehicles and submitted representations stating they could not single-handedly carry out loading of rice bags, weighing, distribution to consumers and driving the vehicles. They added they would not continue services without the support of hamalis to at least load the stock onto the vehicle. Under the scheme designed by the civil supplies department, operators collect rice bags from ration dealers, drive the vehicles to areas assigned to them and distribute the stock to cardholders at their doorsteps. “These are teething troubles as the scheme is new and the operators of the MDUs are not experienced in handling such work. We are hopeful of clearing their grievances and apprehensions,” civil supplies commissioner Kona Sasidhar told TOI. Sasidhar said only about 10% of MDU operators had raised objections while others are continuing distribution. Rice was distributed to around 50% of cardholders by Wednesday, Sasidhar said, and the department expects to finish distribution soon. PDS dealers have been directed to cooperate with operators of MDUs by assigning helpers to load the stock onto the vehicles, he said. “Since many MDU operators are young, unemployed youth, they were unable to load the heavy bags into the vehicles,” he said, explaining that the department is also contemplating providing helper charges after an assessment of the situation once distribution in urban areas is complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/teething-troubles-slow-down-doorstep-delivery-of-rice/articleshow/80674386.cms||Samdani MN
February 4, 2021||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: 57% of Ahmedabad’s population got tested||AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) bought 34 lakh antigen kits and has 2.18 lakh left in stock. This means that — according to 2011 census figures — every second Amdavadi has themselves tested. A Right to Information Act (RTI) application by Ankur Sagar, a resident of Vasna, revealed that the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation spent Rs 130.3 crore on purchase of antigen kits between February 1, 2020 and December 15, 2020. Sagar said wanted to know how many tests were conducted and whether these kits were disposed of properly. Sagar claimed that in response to his RTI application, the AMC said that initially 32 lakh kits were purchased at the cost of Rs 121.13 crore, and another two lakh antigen kits were purchased at Rs 9.18 crore. Sagar said the 24 lakh kits were bought following approval of the AMC standing committee and another 10 lakh kits were purchased after due approvals. He said in response to his question about stock available, AMC officials have said it had 2.18 lakh kits left on December 15, 2020. Sagar further said that it appears that the AMC, from 2011 census figures, has tested 57% of the population as around 32 lakh kits have been used.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/57-of-citys-population-got-tested/articleshow/80677485.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
February 4, 2021||Pune||Pune: Mayor leads BJP team to CP for sedition charge against Usmani||PUNE: Mayor Murlidhar Mohol and city BJP president Jagdish Mulik on Wednesday led a party delegation to Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta and sought the invoking of the sedition charge against former Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) student leader Sharjeel Usmani for his alleged provocative speech at the “Elgar Parishad 2021”, besides action against the event’s organisers. Former Bombay high court judge B G Kolse-Patil, one of the main organisers of the Parishad, told TOI, “Let the Elgar Parishad 2021 organisers be prosecuted, I am not afraid of the police, prosecution and judiciary. Usmani had delivered a good speech but he made a mistake by mentioning a particular community.” Gupta, the Pune commissioner of police (CP), told TOI, “We shall seek legal opinion on certain points raised by the BJP leaders and whatever is correct will be done. For now, we are collecting evidence related to the FIR registered on Tuesday (night).” The police registered an FIR against Usmani under Section 153A IPC (promoting enmity between different groups) following a preliminary verification of a complaint application by BJP youth wing leader Pradeep Gavade, accusing him of giving a provocative speech. The conclave was organized by nearly 200 organisations involved in civil rights, social and cultural causes as a part of the “Koregaon Bhima Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyaan”. These include the Lokshashan Andolan, led by Kolse-Patil, and the Kabir Kala Manch (KKM), a Left-leaning cultural organisation, which the Pune police had claimed in the chargesheet filed in the Elgar 2017 case was a “frontal organisation of the banned CPI-Maoist outfit”. The Lal Sena, Santa Kala Manch, Bahujan Ekta Parishad, People’s Voice and Manav Mukti Mission are among the other organisations behind this year’s event. The 2017 event was followed by caste clashes at the Koregaon Bhima war memorial near Pune on January 1, 2018. The Pune police had claimed in their probe that provocative speeches at the Parishad then had contributed to the clashes. The police claimed that the 2017 event was a part of a larger conspiracy by the CPI-Maoist to foment trouble and overthrow the government. Sixteen activists, including three KKM members, have so far been arrested in the case, being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) now. Pune mayor Mohol told TOI, “We have appealed to Gupta to invoke the sedition charge against Usmani and arrest him at the earliest. He has made derogatory remarks not only against a particular community but also against the Indian judiciary, the police and the administration. This is a very serious matter. Usmani’s background is known to us. He was earlier arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police. We all have suffered because of the Elgar Parishad 2017. We want to know why the permission was given to organise the Elgar Parishad 2021.” Mulik said, “Usmani has shown disrespect to the Indian Constitution. No one can speak in such a manner. His speech was provocative and can cause tension in the society.” In a representation to Gupta, the BJP leaders also sought an inquiry into the sale of books (outside the conclave venue) which, they said, contained distorted versions of history and national leaders.

Senior inspector Sunil Takawale of crime branch unit 1 said, “We have transferred Thakur’s custody to deputy superintendent of police Sudhir Kumar of the CBI, Mumbai unit.” Takawale told TOI, “Thakur, who ran a real estate business, was taken into custody from his plush rented flat in a housing society at Tilekarnagar following a tip-off. He admitted that he had demanded, along with gangster Chhota Rajan and three others, Rs25 crore from a builder for settling a case relating to a land dispute in Pune.” Takawale said, “Thakur’s questioning has revealed that he stayed in Pune, Mumbai, and Navi Mumbai when he was on the run. Six cases relating to cheating, forgery and extortion have been registered against him at various places. He is also involved in 11 cheque-bounce cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rajan-aide-wanted-in-2015-extortion-case-held/articleshow/80677297.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Ranchi||Ranchi health worker dies of heart attack day after vaccine||RANCHI: A health worker at a private hospital in Ranchi, died of a suspected cardiac arrest on Tuesday night, a day after he was inoculated with the Covishield vaccine. While the family of Mannu Pahan (45), a housekeeping staff at Medanta Hospital, said he died because of some adverse effects of the vaccine, health officials said there were no complications caused to him by the vaccine. Pahan, a resident of Ranchi’s Ormanjhi block, collapsed at his home while having dinner on Tuesday night and was taken to Medanta around 10:30pm, where he was declared brought, his family members said. Pahan’s body was sent to Rims for autopsy and a Covid-19 test conducted on the corpse returned a negative result, a Rims official said. A medical team from Ranchi sadar sospital and a WHO consultant reached the hospital to examine the situation. Ranchi civil surgeon Dr V B Prasad said: “The vaccine is completely safe and the death has nothing to do from his inoculation. He (Pahan) was administered the vaccine around 11:50am on Monday and did not show any symptoms of adverse effects. He was healthy throughout the day and has also reported to work on Tuesday. We have sent a team of doctors to evaluate the situation and, as per preliminary findings, he suffered a heart attack.” However, Pahan’s family said he did not have any underlying ailments. His daughter-in-law Sabita Pahan said, “He did not suffer from any kind of heart ailment and was not on any medication. I believe he developed complications due to the vaccine.” Health department officials dismissed the family’s claims and said that they will preserve the viscera of the deceased and will send it for tests so that no one has any doubt about the vaccine. “Across the country, more than a dozen people have died after getting vaccinated, but nothing has been proved against the efficacy of the shots. We will do all that it takes to ascertain the reason for Pahan’s death,” Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-health-worker-dies-of-heart-attack-day-after-vaccine/articleshow/80675871.cms||Gaurav Pandey
February 4, 2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM attacks Centre for Delhi cordon, Badal meets Tikait||Ranchi: Chief minister Hemant Soren criticised the Union government on Wednesday for trying to prevent protesting farmers from congregating along the borders of the national capital. Tweeting a picture of a worker cementing nails on one of the roads along the Delhi border, Soren said, “There can’t be any picture as depressing as this one where the BJP-led government is doing war-like preparations to block our farmers. In BJP’s new India, farmers probably deserve this.” He added, “How many more borders (partitions) shall we make within the country? How many more divisions shall we have to see within... the society?” Notably, Soren’s cabinet colleague and Congress leader Badal Patralekh met Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait at the Ghazipur protest site on Tuesday. After returning to Ranchi on Wednesday morning, Badal said the mahagathbandhan government in the state was firmly backing the protesting farmers in their fight against the ‘black farm laws’. “I had also been to the protest site at the Singhu border about a month ago. Since I went to Delhi for some party-related work on Tuesday, I also thought it would be appropriate to personally meet Tikait-ji and tell the thousands of farmers who are on the roads for months now that come what may, we are with them,” Patralekh said. He reiterated that the new farm laws will not be implemented in Jharkhand as they were passed ‘undemocratically’ without due consultations with the state governments. Patralekh said during his conversation with Tikait, he briefed the latter about the mega tractor rally that Congress held last week in the Santhal Pargana and also about the farm loan waiver scheme rolled out by the state government. Meanwhile, Left-backed farmers’ unions in Jharkhand, too, on Wednesday announced to take part in the nationwide chakka jam called on February 6. Surjit Sinha, the general secretary of the Jharkhand Rajya Kisan Sabha (JRKS), said they will set up road blockades in 16 spots across seven districts. “We will block all prominent national and state highways of the state for three hours (12-3pm),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-cm-attacks-centre-for-delhi-cordon-badal-meets-tikait/articleshow/80675819.cms||ASRP Mukesh
February 4, 2021||Goa||Road safety council asks depts to identify future problems||Porvorim: The state road safety council, which met on Wednesday, directed Goa police’s traffic cell and PWD to ensure that accident prone zones (black spots) are resolved. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho, who chaired the meeting, also directed officials to identify potential traffic problems that could arise at a later stage once the ongoing infrastructure works are completed. During the meeting, it was also decided to investigate the cause for certain accidents in each of the districts and to also create a road safety fund where 50% of the fines collected for traffic violations will be deposited. “There were as many as 24 black spots, what we call accident prone zones but with the augmentation of the roads, widening of the roads and national highway coming in, 14 of the black spots have automatically been resolved,” Godinho said. “There are 10 spots which need rectification and the engineers are doing their bit to get these too resolved.” Godinho has asked the relevant authorities to submit the information and action taken report on the black spots at the next council meeting, the date of which has not been fixed. Stakeholders will also have to submit a report on the likely traffic problems that may arise in the coming years. “When you have one set of problems solved, say as it is announced that by May-end the Zuari bridge and the four lane road will be ready, traffic will move very fast but it could lead to a new problem of safety. We will identify these problems,” Godinho said. Goacan coordinator Roland Martins, who was present for the meeting, said that PWD’s road engineering cell has been asked to work closely with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to identify potential traffic hazards and accident zones so that mitigation measures can be taken before the problems arise. The council also asked authorities to collect information about the remaining black spots, particularly the steps being taken to address the problems by the PWD or NHAI contractors. Martins highlighted the danger posed by massive trucks parked along the roads as well as the plight of the drivers who live by the roadside. “We should take good care of the truckers by projecting where they need amenities. We must identify where the trucks will come. We have also recommended to create a scheme for creation of way side amenities, rest rooms,” said Martins. Another key issue that was discussed during the council meeting was the need for last mile connectivity in Goa. A meeting will be held at a later stage to try and connect the Konkan Railway stations with bus stands through Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited. “We need to create a new culture for public transport. Today we have recommended that the road safety fund should be created immediately and 50% of the fines collected must go into the road safety fund. It will help the traffic police,” said Martins. BOX Road safety council recommends implementation of new MV Act Porvorim: The state road safety council unanimously recommended that the new Motor Vehicles Act should be implemented in the state to improve traffic discipline and reduce the number of traffic accidents in the state. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho conveyed the council’s decision after attending the meeting and said that the recommendation would be conveyed to the chief minister. “This is a recommendation, I will put it up to the government. I will speak to the chief minister and it is up to him to put it up for the cabinet meeting and get it passed or not get it passed,” Goadinho said. During the meeting, stakeholders raised concerns about the rising number of traffic violations by tourists. “When the tourists come to Goa, they say that everywhere else in India the law is implemented but in Goa everything is free. Goa cannot be free or liberal so that there are accidents. We should follow the law in letter and spirit as the rest of the country is following,” Godinho said. Goacan coordinator Roland Martins said that delay in implementing the new Act creates ambiguity in the minds of the people. Martins has also requested Goa police to incorporate the existing traffic sentinels under the traffic warden scheme. Godinho said that even if the state implements the new Motor Vehicles Act, the fines would be kept the minimum possible under the act. “If the centre has given a range of Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000, what the state feels is that if certain offences will be committed time and again, those fines will be kept to the minimum so that we don’t tax the citizen. You don’t break the law, you don’t pay the fine,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/road-safety-council-asks-depts-to-identify-future-problems/articleshow/80677326.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Surat||‘Surat MMF sector losing out to China’||Surat: Surat may be the country’s largest man-made fabric (MMF) hub with the daily production of 3.5 crore meters, contributing to 40% of the country’s man-made fabric demand. But it is fast losing business to China. This was mainly due to higher polyester yarn price in India. This was revealed in a study carried out by the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) on the competitiveness of Surat’s MMF trade versus China. The study found that the average price of polyester filament yarn (PFY), a key raw material for the powerloom weavers in Surat, is 40% costlier compared to China. Due to the high cost of polyester yarn, the prices of fabrics manufactured in Surat is costlier by Rs 25-Rs 40 per meter compared to China, said SGCCI. India has a 5% share in the global MMF market pegged at $500 billion, while China is leading with 35% share. Surat is the largest consumer of polyester yarns in the country with total consumption pegged at 1.12 lakh tonne per month. Ashish Gujarati, vice-president of SGCCI, who led the study told TOI, “As the key raw material prices are on the higher side in India, Surat’s MMF sector is losing out to China. The prices of polyester yarn are about 40% higher in India than compared to China. If India is allowed to import polyester yarn at zero customs duty, then Surat’s MMF sector would get yarn at internationally competitive prices.” On one hand weavers are investing heavily in high-end machinery, but they are not getting internationally competitive rates of yarns. Machines including Air Jet, Water Jet and Rapier looms have started making their ways into Surat from China and Japan in huge numbers starting since June last year. While the conventional looms are priced at Rs 1.50 lakh, the automated machines costs between Rs 6 lakh to Rs 50 lakh. According to the industry estimates, about 300 modern looms were imported in the city from Japan and China per month—majority from China due to its low cost. This was against import of 50 such machines per month during pre-Covid times. Bharat Gandhi, chairman, Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI) said, “Weavers are investing in high-end machinery for increasing quality and quantity of production. But, it will go in vain if the weavers won’t get polyester yarn at internationally competitive rates. Therefore, it is required that the government must abolish the customs duty on yarn imports to end the monopolistic practices by a handful of yarn spinners in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-mmf-sector-losing-out-to-china/articleshow/80674655.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Ranchi||Phase-II of vax drive begins, 823 jabbed on Day-I||RANCHI/BOKARO: The second phase of Covid-19 vaccination, intended for the state’s frontline workers, began on Wednesday. A total of 823 frontline workers of the 2,279 intended for inoculation received the shots, there by posting a coverage of 49% on Day-I. Meanwhile, the vaccination drive for healthcare workers continued simultaneously, with a total of 50% (10,844) of the 21,547 scheduled healthcare workers turning up for vaccination. Talking to TOI, nodal officer for vaccination drive in state Dr Ajit Prasad said, “We have started a total of 235 session sites from the existing 183 across the state to ease the burden so that frontline workers can be vaccinated simultaneously. We have also made session sites at various centres which aren’t at healthcare facilities so that frontline workers can easily access those centres and get themselves vaccinated.” On being asked about any special arrangements made for vaccinating frontline workers, Dr Prasad said, “The vaccination drive for any category, be it healthcare worker or frontline, will be conducted as per the set protocols of the government of India and there is no change. Having said that, we have ensured that places like police lines in various districts have been allotted a session site as the numbers are more at those places.” In state capital Ranchi, the turnout at the session site for frontline workers continued to be dismal as a mere 38 of 100 turned up for the inoculation. On being asked about the lower turnout, a senior police official said pace will pick up in the coming days as many weren’t informed and we are holding counselling sessions for people who have been on the duty to come forward and get vaccinated. Inquired about the stocks of covishield and covaxin in state, Prasad said they have enough and replacements have been assured at the right time. “A total of 3.34 lakh doses of Covishield consignments have been received in two lots and a total of 1.54 lakh dosages of Covaxin have arrived in the state. The distribution of vaccines has been done based on the number of beneficiaries and we have been assured of the supply in advance from the Centre.” Meanwhile, the deputy commissioner and superintendent of police of Bokaro district along with other senior officials were administered the Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday as the phase two of vaccinations for frontline workers began. The drive was held at as many as 15 centres. Since the beginning of the drive, 6,200 beneficiaries have been inoculated. On Wednesday, 920 people were vaccinated across the district. Civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said they are working on ways to achieve the target to vaccinate all the 11,000 listed in the first phase by February 6. He said, “To speed up the coverage, we are setting up more vaccination centres. Starting with two, we now have 15 centres. On Thursday, three more will be added.” DC Rajesh Singh said rumours about the vaccine are false. “People should not pay attention to hearsay,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/phase-ii-of-vax-drive-begins-823-jabbed-on-day-i/articleshow/80675716.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Ranchi||Gathbandhan govt’s 2nd Budget on March 3||Ranchi: The state cabinet chaired by chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday approved the state cabinet coordination department’s proposal to convene the Budget session from February 26 to March 23. The session will have 16 working days. The government also informed that it will table its annual Budget on March 3. The ministerial council also gave its approval to amend the new Jharkhand Combined Civil Services Examination regulations. The amendments entail Jharkhand Public Service Commission can shortlist eligible candidates in SC/ST/OBC/EWS categories 15 times the number of vacancies for final examinations without any cut-off percentage. Earlier, it was decided that JPSC can shortlist candidates in reserved categories who scored up to 8% marks less than the cut off percentage. Also, the upper age limit of applicants was fixed on August 1, 2016 and the lowest age limit on March 1, 2021. The cabinet also approved the withdrawal of the erstwhile Raghubar Das government’s 2016 recruitment policy, under which candidates from 13 scheduled districts enjoyed 100% reservation in teaching jobs. Earlier in September last year, the Jharkhand high court had struck down the policy, saying it violated key principles of fundamental rights. “The recruitment in non-scheduled districts has also been withdrawn and fresh advertisements will be issued,” cabinet secretary Ajoy Kumar Singh said. In another decision, the cabinet approved a proposal to set up five handpumps in each tolas in all the 4,374 gram panchayats of the state to mitigate drinking water woes during summers. A total of Rs 184.31 crore was approved for its implementation. Another proposal to seek loans worth Rs 1,057.79 crore from Nabard to commence Soan-Kanhar irrigation project was also approved. The ministerial council approved the state health department’s approval to roll out a Jharkhand Good Samaritan’s Policy. The policy will entail that people who help road accident survivors to hospitals will be awarded a cash prize of Rs 2,000 and will be spared interrogation and heckling. The cabinet also approved a proposal whereby government hospitals and medical colleges can purchase 103 generic medicines from five PSU pharmaceutical companies. The cabinet also approved a new regulation for constituting a tribal advisory council in Jharkhand, replacing the one framed by the Bihar government in 1958. Under the new regulations, the council will be headed by CM and will have 18 members, of which 15 are MLAs from ST backgrounds. All TAC members will be appointed as per the CM’s nominations. In another decision, the cabinet approved the transport department’s proposal to permanently transfer 303.62 acre land to Airports Authority of India for expansion of Ranchi’s Birsa Munda International Airport. Another proposal to rope in Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) to set up a 300-metric tonne biodegradable waste processing plant in Ranchi was approved. GAIL will also be given an 8-acre land and a 22-year lease for producing gas and manure from biodegradable waste produced in Ranchi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/gathbandhan-govts-2nd-budget-on-march-3/articleshow/80675656.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Goa||No FIR will be filed in Mapusa zatra matter: BJP||Panaji: A day after the deputy collector for Bardez issued an order to the mamlatdar to file an FIR for violations at the ongoing Bodgeshwar zatra at Mapusa, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said that there will be no FIR filed or any action taken in the matter. Tanavade’s statement comes in the wake of criticism levelled against the government after the deputy collector ordered filing of an FIR with regards to the zatra. He said that the officer should have informed of the violation orally and that calling for an FIR is an extreme and unnecessary step. “Some play politics where one should not. How is the temple committee at fault? The Bodgeshwar zatra is major event and they have done whatever is within the legal parameters. There is absolutely no violation,” said Tanavade. In the run-up to the zatra, an inspection was carried out by chief officer of Mapusa municipal council Kabir Shirgaonkar, in the presence of the Shree Dev Bodgeshwar temple committee president, Anand Bhaidkar.  It was decided that only 75 stalls would be permitted at the zatra and a gap of around 10m would be maintained between stalls. Deputy collector Kapil Phadte on Tuesday called for an FIR to be filed in the matter, though it was not specified in the order against whom the FIR should be. “I spoke to the deputy collector and then the chief minister also spoke to him.,” said Tanavade. Phadte has clarified that he has not issued any notice to any of the temple committee members, Tanavade said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-fir-will-be-filed-in-mapusa-zatra-matter-bjp/articleshow/80677359.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Goa||‘FIR in Bodgini matter is anti-traders’||Saligao: AAP on Wednesday criticized the state government for the order issued by the Bardez deputy collector asking for an FIR to be filed for alleged violations at the ongoing Bodgeshwar (or Bodgini) temple zatra. AAP Goa convener Rahul Mhambre said the FIR asked to be filed would be against the common Goan, who is struggling to make a living in this trying period of a pandemic. “All small traders, like those selling sweets at feasts and zatras or those selling clothes and utensils, have been very badly affected as there were no fairs held for so long. Just when their trade was starting again, the government has hit them hard to cripple them further,” said Mhambre. He said it is mostly Goans who put up stalls at the Bodgeshwar zatra. “If the temple committee has violated the SOPs related to the pandemic, then what about the casinos which operated to capacity during the December season? Why no FIRs were filed against the casinos? What about the starred hotels that organise weekend parties?” said Mhambre. He said the government has not announced any relief for small traders .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fir-in-bodgini-matter-is-anti-traders/articleshow/80677418.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Business||Only a few PSUs to remain in strategic sectors: Niti Aayog CEO||NEW DELHI: Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant says there will be a few PSUs in strategic sectors once the public sector policy is rolled out and the Budget for 2021-22 has sent out a strong message about government's reformist zeal. Excerpts: There is a huge thrust on privatisation in Budget. Niti Aayog has worked on PSU privatisation policy. What is the strategy?Union Budget 2021-22: Complete coverageThe key challenge before the country is to enhance gross capital formation and this means private sector investment must rise. This necessitates that we bring in the private sector in areas where revenue streams are coming in. One key area was we push for asset monetisation in a very big way. The second big area was we push for privatisation so that there is overall enhancement of total factor productivity. This is very important if you have to grow at high rates on a sustained basis. The challenge before the Budget makers was not that we go back to pre-Covid levels but we accelerate the pace of growth to 8%-9%. That means we should continue to grow over long period of time by sheer efficiency and while Niti Aayog has already given five different sets of recommendations on disinvestment, many of which are at advanced stages, some were impacted due to Covid-19. But now the government is absolutely clear, which has been announced in the Budget that there will be only four key strategic sectors and in these key strategic sectors, there will be maximum of three or four public sector enterprises. In other areas, where there are PSUs, the government will get out of businesses and therefore there will be few public sector enterprises, in strategic areas only. In others, the government will bring in private sector enterprises and therefore there is a huge challenge before the country that we must be able to follow all due processes and we must be able to attract the best bids for these PSUs. Beyond the four sectors, every other area, the intention is that we should be able to bring in huge amount of private sector investment, enhance productivity and take India to a high growth trajectory. Budget said only few companies in strategic areas will remain. What is the time frame?We will immediately get down to this and very shortly Niti Aayog will do a complete analysis and make its recommendations. We are doing a lot of home work and we will do all the inter-ministerial consultations and based on those consultations with the ministry of finance and concerned ministries we will take a call on this as early as possible. How do you ensure that monopolies don't come up, for example, in steel or heavy engineering?Our objective should be two-fold. One is we should maximise value for government, which should be the key. Second, in majority of the sectors in which the public sector is operating, there are a vast number of private sector players both in India and abroad. If these deals are well structured - and I think that is the key challenge before the government to do due diligence, structure these deals well, promote these projects abroad and in India extensively and you will get a vast number of players and I do not see any monopoly in any one of these areas. There is no monopolistic character, there are a vast number of players, including in steel and many minerals sectors both in India and abroad, to bid for these PSUs. There has been a criticism that you are selling family silver and depending too much on privatisation to raise funds to boost growth...The greatest thing about this Budget to my mind is the reformist zeal which this government has demonstrated that it is willing to take on this criticism and accelerate the pace of growth. It is willing to make major structural reforms, which it did through a series of announcements under the Atmanirbhar package, major structural reforms which the country had not seen before and continues that pace in this Budget and send out a clear message that it is willing to touch hitherto untouched areas. It has sent out a clear message that this government is committed to long-term growth of India, rather than handing out mere doles. When do you see private investment picking up?I would give it close to about five-to-six months from the time all the PLIs (production-linked incentives) are announced. I have already seen investments picking up in both mobile and telecom. PLIs are close to about $26 billion, it should logically lead to enhanced production of over $500 billion in five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/only-a-few-psus-to-remain-in-strategic-sectors-niti-aayog-ceo/articleshow/80679463.cms||Surojit Gupta
February 4, 2021||Delhi||GMR, Adani among 9 in fray for Rs 6,500 crore New Delhi railway station revamp||NEW DELHI: Nine major players, including GMR Highways, Adani Railways and realtor Omaxe are in the fray for redevelopment of New Delhi railway station entailing an investment of around Rs 6,500 crore. Along with the modernisation of Mumbai’s Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), the capital’s key station is among the most prominent asset monetisation and railway modernisation programme being undertaken by the Centre. Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), which has been tasked to undertake the redevelopment, said BIF IV India Infrastructure Holding, ISQ Asia Infrastructure Investments, Anchorage Infrastructure Investments, Kalpataru Power Transmission, Arabian Construction Company and Elpis Ventures have also participated in the technical bidding for the station. At least five of the players — Adani, GMR, Kalpataru, Anchorage and ISQ Asia — are also in the fray for the modernisation of CSMT. “In these two cases, there is more interest in railway station modernisation that in the redevelopment or construction of some of the airports,” a government officer told TOI. This is the first stage of the process. After evaluation, the qualified bidders will be allowed to put their financial bids. Dome-shaped terminal buildings for rly stationThe RLDA said the efforts have borne results with reputed players participating in the technical bidding stage. Railway officials said the government would announce the user charges before floating the financial bids since the collection of user charges is expected to be a long-term source of revenue for the successful private player. The project is slated to be completed in four years from the day construction starts. The concession period is for 60 years. The redevelopment of New Delhi station will be a mix of retail, office and hospitality spread across 30 acres near Connaught Place. The RLDA is taking up the redevelopment project on Transit-Oriented Development. The project offers multiple revenue streams to the private player, including income from real estate rights The project will be redeveloped into a world-class station. It will have dome-shaped terminal buildings with two arrival and two departure points at the concourse level, two multimodal transport hubs on its every side, 40-floor high-rise twin towers (for hotels, offices and retail at podium) and pedestrian boulevard with highstreet shopping among the salient features, the Rail Land Development Authority said. Pedestrian movement, cycle tracks, green tracks and non-motorised vehicles have been integrated into the proposed development plan. The station has a master plan area of 120 hectares, out of which 88 hectares is being planned in the first phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gmr-adani-among-9-in-fray-for-rs-6500-crore-new-delhi-railway-station-revamp/articleshow/80679497.cms||---
February 4, 2021||India||Prioritise collection of public health data: Panel||NEW DELHI: The parliamentary standing committee on finance in its report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday on the statistics collection machinery in the country, has sought prioritisation of data collection related to public health for better policy formulation against the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic. The 31-member panel chaired by Jayant Sinha states that "in the aftermath of the global Covid-19 pandemic, public health as such has become all the more crucial, requiring government support and active intervention". "The committee would, therefore, reiterate their earlier recommendation that health-related data collection and surveys be taken up by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) on priority basis, as such statistical inputs would be of immense help to both the central and state governments in formulating appropriate policy responses," the panel stated. The report adopted by the committee in September last year was tabled in both Houses of parliament on Wednesday. On the action taken in this regard, MoSPI had informed the committee that besides regular surveys, NSSO takes up other subjects as and when requested by ministries. The health ministry itself is conducting some health-related surveys on regular basis. MoSPI cited the survey conducted by NSSO during July, 2017 to June, 2018 on 'Social consumption: Health' as the recent initiative to build on data on the subject. Further, the committee observes with concern that as on November 30, 2019 there were 785 vacant positions in the grade of senior statistical officer and junior statistical officer. While calling for urgently filling up all vacancies, the parliamentary panel has recommended that a study be conducted to figure out the reasons for high level of attrition from this sector. Times ViewHonest statistics may taste bitter, but they provide an accurate reflection of the ground reality, essential for sound policy making. The government must invest in adequate and quality manpower for statistics collection. Short cuts can lead to bad data and hence misguided policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prioritise-collection-of-public-health-data-panel/articleshow/80679500.cms||Ambika Pandit
February 4, 2021||Surat||‘Pay 4,800 blast-hit villagers Rs 25,000 each’||Surat: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the Dahej-based Yasashvi Rasayan Private Limited once again on Wednesday to deposit Rs 25,000 compensation each to the 4,800 villagers who were displaced in major blast that took place in the company in June 2020. Upholding its previous order, the green watchdog has asked the district collector of Bharuch to comply with the order within one month. In its reply, the company stated that Rs 3.10 crore was already paid as redressal and expressed its willingness to deposit further Rs 1.29 crore within two days. However, it raised objection to the order asking it to pay Rs 25,000 each to the 4,800 villagers displaced at the time of the incident. The major blast at Yashashvi Rasayan Private Limited at the Special Economic Zone (SEZ)-2 at Dahej industrial area had killed 12 workers and injured over 70 other workers and employees on June 3, 2020. Hearing a complaint filed by the Surat-based NGO, Aryavrat Foundation, the tribunal had constituted six-member committee under retired judge BC Patel to conduct an inquiry and submit a report within a month on June 8, 2020. The NGT had slapped Rs 25 crore penalty to the company owners. The panel examined the extent of damage to human and non-human life and public health and environment and steps taken for compensation. The affected people were asked to submit their queries to the district collector’s office in June. The committee comprises justice BC Patel, former chief justice of Delhi High Court as chairman including representative of union environment ministry, representative of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), head of Chemical engineering department of IIT Gandhinagar, representative of NEERI and representative from National Institute of Disaster Management, IIPA campus New Delhi. The panel found that the consumption of raw material in the company was much higher than mentioned on record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pay-4800-blast-hit-villagers-rs-25000-each/articleshow/80676006.cms||---

February 4, 2021||Nagpur||Come up with KP’s beautification & maintenance plans: HC||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday called on respondents to make concerted efforts and come out with a concrete plan for beautification and maintenance of Kasturchand Park keeping in view its future needs.A division bench comprising justices Nitin Jamdar and Anil Kilor directed all stakeholders to advance their scheduled February 18 meeting on the subject convened by Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC). The bench also asked collector Ravindra Thakare and State Public Works Department (PWD) officials to attend it.Earlier, NMC, through counsel Jemini Kasat, submitted a structural audit report of the Chhatri, a heritage structure at the historic place, as per HC directives. It also filed a detailed affidavit on the steps taken to comply with a slew of court directives since the last four years when the suo motu PIL was filed in 2017. The civic body listed various steps on conservation of the park, once used to host big political rallies, exhibitions and other events.Both documents were filed in response to a suo motu PIL, where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae, regarding gross misuse of historic place due to negligence of district administration, who often rent it out for commercial activities.On January 13, the judges had sought details of compliances of its orders and if there are impediments, the solutions from HCC. They also asked if any assistance or coordination is required from any department or organization in this regard.The bench had directed all the statutory authorities and the government departments to act in aid of the HCC for achieving the task of maintenance and preservation of the heritage structure and ground which is a precinct. If any assistance is suggested by HCC for this purpose, it shall be rendered.The HCC admitted before the court that it was under mandate to ensure that the heritage structures are preserved and maintained. It also accepted its responsibility to preserve and maintain the ground surrounding the structure being a precinct.“Since the regulations require HCC to maintain and preserve the structure as well as ground around it, we place responsibility for ensuring the compliance of court orders and preservation of structure and ground surrounding it on HCC as in any case, it’s duty bound to do so,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/come-up-with-kps-beautification-maintenance-plans-hc/articleshow/80676835.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
February 4, 2021||Business||Hospitality sector crestfallen after Budget ignore||Kolkata: The hospitality sector that is one of the largest employment generators and also one of the worst impacted by the pandemic is crestfallen at being overlooked in Monday’s Budget. With 25-30% hotels and 10-15% restaurants yet to be operational, the sector was hoping for succour from Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. But the expectations have come a cropper. The Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH) had in its pre-budget presentations made several proposals, including industry status for the tourism sector, to make them post-Covid-ready. It had also suggested the setting up a corpus to three verticals under the Incredible India tourism campaign: the first related to meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE), the second on adventure tourism and third on heritage tourism. “There was a need for 100% tax exemption and permission to write back income/TDS/GST to travel agents and tour operators on their transactions when airlines wind up or close down. This would have protected them and also Indian consumers,” rued FAITH chairman Nakul Anand. Hotel & Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) that has over 1,200 members in its fold is still struggling to emerge from the lockdown blues. This financial year, 70% hotels in Kolkata are operational and they are expected to do around 25% of business that was clocked in 2019-2020. The food and beverage industry (F&B) has fared better with 85-90% operational and 40% recovery in business. “Industry status would have led to lower electricity tariffs and lower rates of borrowing. Also, we were really hoping for a loan restructuring scheme or moratorium. But there was absolutely nothing,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar. Apart from liquidity support, National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) members were hoping for rationalisation of GST structure, including restoration of input tax credit. “It was disappointing to see that no specific announcements were made for the overall hospitality sector in the Budget,” said NRAI Kolkata chapter head Sagar Daryani. Many restaurateurs like the MD of Chowman, Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2, Debaditya Chaudhury, were looking forward to the Budget as a means of recovery. “Many restaurants are still shut and may never be able to open again without support,” he pointed out. Pradeep Rozario, owner of Kurry Klub Fusion and Mio Amore, also feels that even with existing structure input tax credit should have been introduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hospitality-sector-crestfallen-after-budget-ignore/articleshow/80676858.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: A puja at MGR temple for good luck in polls||CHENNAI: As elections near L Kalaivanan gets busy with special pujas and offerings at the Arulmigu MGR Aalayam in Tiruvallur. Located 45km from Chennai, the shrine is of MGR, the priest his most ardent fan and devotee and worshippers mostly aspiring politicians hoping to make it big in the election. A decade ago, Kalaivanan built the temple for MGR as he wanted a ‘peaceful’ resting place for his evergreen hero. Today, the temple practices all rituals offered just like any other temple, with childless couples also flocking to it to seek divine intervention. But the buzz before an election is unmatched. Candidates and political leaders queue up at the temple hoping for a windfall of votes. "The temple gets visitors once the election is declared, but I have to prepare the list of pujas being offered much before that. I finished it a couple of days ago," says Kalaivanan, who has designed a special puja this year that he believes will bring good fortune to the candidates. "It is called the seven ‘abhishekam’ as it is an offering which contains items such as milk, curd, honey, sandalwood paste, tender coconut water, kadamba powder and rose water. Those who offer the seven ‘abhishekam’ can achieve a great sense of confidence. It takes an hour to complete the process and it is followed by ‘anna danam’ (donation of food) to the needy," he said. Kalaivanan grew up watching MGR movies. He gradually felt a strong connection with his screen idol. It was after MGR’s death in 1987 that Kalaivanan began praying before MGR’s photographs. "Each movie of MGR that I watched was a lesson for me. It taught me basic things about life. I don’t believe in any other god, MGR is my god," says Kalaivanan, who built the temple in 2011. Over the years, the temple’s fame grew and people, especially political cadres, began to frequent it. K Bhupathi, an AIADMK functionary, says he offered puja at the temple when he believed the party was on a slippery track after J Jayalalithaa’s death. "I have been a regular since 2013. I prayed here for the AIADMK government’s stability when Amma (Jayalalithaa) passed away. There was a sense of uncertainty. The vacuum that Amma left was huge. My prayers were answered. I have a strong faith in the MGR idol here," said Bhupathi from Madurai. The temple has become a place of faith and shelter for all. "Donation of food is part of every offering keeping in mind people in need. This time I am trying to reach out to more people. The pandemic has wreaked havoc for many, particularly in the low-income group. There are many in and around Nathamedu who are struggling to make ends meet. We will try to cover as much as people through anna danam," he said. Even though a staunch devotee of MGR, Kalaivanan says the temple is for everyone. "It’s a secular place where people can find solace."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/a-puja-at-mgr-temple-for-good-luck-in-polls/articleshow/80679572.cms||M T Saju
February 4, 2021||Chennai||‘Success of Vel Yatra has made M K Stalin focus on Hindu vote bank’||BJP state president L Murugan has kept the BJP in the news ever since he took over the reins of the party last March. In an interview with Jayaraj Sivan, Murugan says the BJP’s efforts to consolidate Hindu votes in the past year have scared the DMK, so much so that M K Stalin now feels the need to wield Lord Muruga’s ‘vel’ to appease Hindus. Q: Is the BJP’s political course disturbed by Rajinikanth’s withdrawal from the electoral fray?Rajinikanth’s decision has not had any effect on our political stand. Ours is a party with a strong ideology and cadre base. Our course is not dependent on any particular individual’s stand. We did not plan Rajinikanth’s political plunge. He only planned and announced it. And he backed out on his own. BJP leaders were never in discussion with him on his political game plan. Q: Do you still hope Rajinikanth may take a political plunge?Rajinikanth has not said he will stay away from politics. He has a nationalist and spiritual approach. If he wants he can start his party any time. It is purely his decision. We have nothing to say. Q: Both Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam said at a meeting attended by Amit Shah that the AIADMK-BJP alliance would continue for the assembly polls. But why was there so much hesitation on the part of the BJP in confirming the alliance with the AIADMK and EPS as the CM candidate?Ours is an alliance formed in the last parliamentary elections and it is going strong. As regards accepting EPS as the chief ministerial candidate, we waited for the AIADMK general council to endorse his candidature. Immediately after that, we extended our support. Our national president J P Nadda, during his recent visit to Tamil Nadu, reiterated that we are very much in alliance with the AIADMK. There is no hesitation on our part. Q: In pursuit of Hindutva agenda, has your Vetrivel Yatra yielded dividends?Vel Yatra was a major success. One of our major demands was getting Thai Poosam declared as public holiday. We thank the state government, EPS and OPS for announcing that. More importantly, Vel yatra has scared the DMK leadership, which has remained anti-Hindu all along. They have never missed an opportunity to demean Hindu Gods. But now they fear the BJP is consolidating Hindu votes. After opposing our yatra, charging that it would cause violence, M K Stalin, who shunned Lord Muruga and his ‘vel’ in the past, went to the very same Thiruttani, from where I started my yatra, and took a ‘vel’ in his hands to appease the Hindu vote bank. It more than explains my yatra’s impact. Q: Have you been able to reach out to all sections of people?We have been in touch with farmers, explaining to them the benefits of the new farm laws. We organised meetings with farmers in 1,000 places across the state. Namma Oor Pongal celebrations, which involved womenfolk, was a major hit. We are organising 1,000 street-corner meetings in the state to explain the benefits of the Union budget for Tamil Nadu. We are planning regional conclaves of beneficiaries of Central government welfare programmes to create better awareness about the Union government schemes. Our national president J P Nadda recently launched the election campaign and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to address an election rally in Salem on February 21. Q: What are your promises to the people?Ours is a development agenda that promises 100% employment, women empowerment, women entrepreneurship, youth development, fishermen, farmer and SC/ST development under Atmanirbhar Bharat programmes. Q: What could be the impact of Sasikala’s release from prison on the electoral strategy of the AIADMK and the BJP, especially with regard to canvassing Thevar votes? Why has a section of leaders in the BJP advocated coming together of AIADMK and AMMK?It is too early to comment on Sasikala’s impact on the coming assembly election. She is still in Bengaluru. We have to wait till she returns to Tamil Nadu and see how people react. I would prefer to talk about the Sasikala factor only after that. We are not having any dialogue with Sasikala or her people and the BJP has not suggested any tie-up between the AIADMK and the AMMK. Q: Why hasn’t the BJP been able to grow as a major force in Tamil Nadu in the past 40 years though it has been in power in many other states? Do you see an opportunity for the BJP in 2026?Our future plan is to strengthen the party in all 234 assembly constituencies. We have been growing fast in recent times. People of Tamil Nadu have not rewarded us so far, but we are sure they will reward one day. We will wait for the right time. Q: What is your target in the coming assembly polls?The party is working with the sole objective of getting double digit MLAs elected to the assembly. Q: Will it be a coalition government if the NDA wins the polls?We cannot say anything now. It is to be decided after the poll results are out. We always uphold the alliance dharma. Even though we emerged as the single largest party in Bihar, abiding by the alliance dharma, we gave the chief ministerial post to Nitish Kumar. We will always stand by our allies. Q: PMK is flexing its muscles on the quota issue. DMDK leader Premalatha said at a party meeting that her party would not be present in a PMK-inclusive alliance. Is your front falling apart even before the polls are announced?PMK leaders are only raising their demands. You cannot term it as a threat to the alliance. We are hopeful that the talks between the PMK leadership and the government would yield positive results. As of now, no DMDK leader has made any public statement that they cannot work with the PMK. The DMDK is very much part of the NDA and will remain so for the forthcoming assembly polls too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/success-of-vel-yatra-has-made-stalin-focus-on-hindu-vote-bank/articleshow/80679573.cms||Jayaraj Sivan
February 4, 2021||Delhi||Union Cabinet clears proposal to give more power to LG||NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved some proposed amendments to the Government of NCT of Delhi Act to give more powers to the Lieutenant Governor and prescribe the time-lines for the elected government to send legislative and administrative proposals to the LG for his opinion, sources said. The Centre has included the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 for consideration and passage during the current Budget session of Parliament. Sources said one of the proposed amendments will add a category of bills that encroach upon matters, which fall outside the purview of the legislative assembly and which the LG must reserve for consideration of the President. Sources said the amendments are meant for “better governance” and reduce potential conflicts. ‘Send proposals to LG 15 days in advance’They added that the Constitution confers powers on the LG to refer a particular matter to the President for a decision where his views are different than that of the council of ministers and in cases where the President’s decision is pending, the LG may take immediate decision, if he is of the opinion that the matter is urgent. “But this constitutional provision has become inoperative after the SC observation that the city government need not obtain LG’s ‘concurrence’ in every issue of day-to-day governance, but need to inform him,” said the source. The proposed amendment specifies that the elected government needs to send legislative proposals to LG at least 15 days in advance to seek his opinion and avoid any delays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cabinet-clears-proposal-to-give-more-power-to-lg/articleshow/80679586.cms||Dipak K Dash
February 4, 2021||Thane||Maharashtra colleges to reopen from February 15 at 50% attendance||MUMBAI: University and college campuses in the state can reopen physically for students from February 15, after a 10-month-long break. The state’s higher and technical education minister Uday Samant announced that colleges can start classes with 50% attendance on a rotation basis. Classes and examinations will be conducted both online and offline and attendance will be voluntary, he said. Mumbai University will take a call on the matter soon and issue its circular after deliberating with local authorities, report Sujit Mahamulkar and Yogita Rao. Samant said universities can come out with their own SOPs, adding the mandatory 75% attendance rule will be relaxed and students will not be debarred from exams. ‘Will try to match students’ schedule with train timings’University and college campuses in the state are set to re-open physically for students. The first phase of the reopening will be from February 15 to March 5, after which the state will review the situation and decide on the future course of action. Colleges will follow guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission on November 5, and the state higher and technical education department. Hostels will not be opened for students in the first phase. “It will be necessary to conduct a structural and fire audit of hostel buildings before reopening. We will also have to see how students can be accommodated in the hostel rooms by following Covid norms,” Samant said. “Many hostels are still being used as quarantine centres, and therefore outstation candidates can continue to take online lectures. Many who are apprehensive about joining physical classes can continue with online lectures too,” he said. The decision about reopening of colleges located in “restricted areas” will be taken by the university, only after consultation with the local body or district collector and district disaster management authority. Asked about the cases still found in hundreds in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur circle, Samant said, “We have discussed the issue with all university vice-chancellors and district collectors, and there will not be an issue to reopen colleges anywhere in the state, including Mumbai.” Asked about students’ commuting woes in Mumbai, Samant said the university was trying to work out their academic schedule to match the restricted train timings in the city. An MU official said they have already prepared an SOP in line with UGC guidelines, but will release it only after consultation with the district authorities. He said the university has already worked out a plan for the rotational time-table. Students who have practical component will surely get priority over others, he said. The university’s jurisdiction spreads over Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg. A city college principal said they would want to conduct practicals/projects physically, and lectures can continue to be online this term. Students from other states can come for practicals alone or can even opt out as attendance is not compulsory, he said, adding many have already called him to seek permission to opt for online mode. Another principal pointed out that transport is still a concern as local trains are only available at odd hours for the general public. He added that even with 50% attendance, there will be tremendous pressure on the infrastructure as laboratories are shared. Also, colleges are yet to figure out how they would conduct online and offline lectures simultaneously. Meena Chintamaneni, registrar, SVKM’s NMIMS University, said they are reviewing the government notification internally and will soon issue their action plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-colleges-to-reopen-from-february-15-at-50-attendance/articleshow/80679627.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

February 4, 2021||Goa||‘GIDC’s ineptness cost govt revenue, held up job creation, industrialisation’||Panaji: Calling out the state government’s claims of promoting investment and employment, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) said lack of adequate infrastructure at industrial estates has delayed industrialisation and job creation in Goa. The CAG has also blamed the Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) for short-changing entrepreneurs by allotting plots without creating the required infrastructure. The CAG’s report for the year ending March 2019 has identified several lapses on the part of the GIDC and has suggested that the corporation has shown “ineptness” and “poor-decision making process” while developing industrial estates. “While lack of adequate infrastructure delayed industrialisation and employment creation at some industrial estates, considerable revenue was lost due to unrealistic fixation of plot rate,” the CAG said in its report. On June 1, 2019, TOI highlighted the story about the Panchawadi Industrial Estate where 32 industrial units exist only on paper. On December 4, 2019, TOI carried a similar story about the Tuem Industrial Estate. In its report, the CAG has highlighted the lack of infrastructure at Panchawadi, Latambarcem, Tuem and Verna. “The allotment of plots without readying infrastructure was fraught with the risk of under-recovery of full infrastructure cost and non-utilisation of the allotted plots,” it said. Referring specifically to the Panchawadi and Tuem industrial estates, the CAG said the GIDC’s failure to create adequate infrastructure also caused a loss to the corporation. “While allotting the plots, adequate infrastructure was not readied by the corporation. Consequently, the allottees refused to pay the premium amount,” the CAG said in its performance audit report for the GIDC. Interestingly, in December 2016, the GIDC’s board had resolved that no industrial plot would be advertised or allotted unless proper infrastructure was created. The CAG report also found that 62% of the 146 industrial units identified by a task force committee in 2011 continue to remain non-functional. The GIDC has also failed to repossess 72 non-functional units. “It gave a long rope to non-functional units by not re-possessing their plots and cancelling their allotments, which blocked industrialisation and held up employment generation on land measuring 1.9 lakh sqm that remained idle for 10-30 years,” the CAG report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gidcs-ineptness-cost-govt-revenue-held-up-job-creation-industrialisation/articleshow/80677190.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Business||GMR, Adani among 9 in fray for Rs 6,500 cr New Delhi station revamp||NEW DELHI: Nine major players, including GMR Highways, Adani Railways and realtor Omaxe are in the fray for redevelopment of New Delhi railway station entailing an investment of around Rs 6,500 crore. Along with the modernisation of Mumbai's Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), the capital's key station is among the most prominent asset monetisation and railway modernisation programme being undertaken by the Centre. Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), which has been tasked to undertake the redevelopment, said BIF IV India Infrastructure Holding, ISQ Asia Infrastructure Investments, Anchorage Infrastructure Investments, Kalpataru Power Transmission, Arabian Construction Company and Elpis Ventures have also participated in the technical bidding for the station. At least five of the players - Adani, GMR, Kalpataru, Anchorage and ISQ Asia - are also in the fray for the modernisation of CSMT. "In these two cases there is more interest in railway station modernisation that in the redevelopment or construction of some of the airports," a government officer told TOI. This is the first stage of the process. After evaluation, the qualified bidders will be allowed to put their financial bids. The RLDA said the efforts have borne results with reputed players participating in the technical bidding stage. Railway officials said the government would announce the user charges before floating the financial bids since the collection of user charges is expected to be a long-term source of revenue for the successful private player. The project is slated to be completed in four years from the day construction starts. The concession period is for 60 years. The redevelopment of New Delhi station will be a mix of retail, office and hospitality spread across 30 acres near Connaught Place. The RLDA is taking up the redevelopment project on Transit-Oriented Development. The project offers multiple revenue streams to the private player, including income from real estate rights The project will be redeveloped into a world-class station. It will have dome-shaped terminal buildings with two arrival and two departure points at the concourse level, two multi-modal transport hubs on its every side, 40-floor high-rise twin towers (for hotels, offices and retail at podium) and pedestrian boulevard with high-street shopping among the salient features, the Rail Land Development Authority said. Pedestrian movement, cycle tracks, green tracks and non-motorised vehicles have been integrated into the proposed development plan. The station has a master plan area of 120 hectares, out of which 88 hectares is being planned in the first phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gmr-adani-among-9-in-fray-for-rs-6500-cr-new-delhi-station-revamp/articleshow/80679595.cms||---
February 4, 2021||Goa||Goa: Bid to smuggle Rs 5.5 lakh liquor foiled||PONDA: A bid to smuggle liquor worth Rs 5.5 lakh to Andhra Pradesh was foiled after the truck driver was stopped for routine checking at the Goa-Karnataka border check post at Mollem early Wednesday morning. The officials noticed that the truck driver looked scared and this triggered suspicion over the nature of the goods in the truck This is the second such incident in two months where an attempt to smuggle large quantities of liquor outside Goa has been foiled. A stock of liquor worth Rs 2.7 lakh was seized on December 10, 2020, while being smuggled to Karnataka. On Wednesday, the excise team headed by sub-inspector Jitendra Adpoikar, intercepted the vehicle while it was attempting to cross the state border via the Mollem checkpost around 1.40am. When officials at the checkpost began checking the goods, the driver ran away and disappeared into the surrounding forest taking advantage of the darkness and abandoned the truck, Dessai. “We were lucky enough to have been able to intercept the truck. It would have given us the slip if the driver was not scared during routine border checking,” the officer said. The excise team included Adpaikar, excise guards Sunil P Naik, Mahadev Gaonkar, Dashrath Gawas and Ashish Gaonkar, and assistant excise guard Deepak Prabhu Dessai. The seizure was carried out under supervision of the excise inspector Rohit Dessai, in charge of Sanguem Taluka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bid-to-smuggle-rs-5-5l-liquor-foiled/articleshow/80677238.cms||---

Naik had met with an accident in Karnataka on January 12. He suffered multiple fractures while his wife Vijaya and an aide, who were travelling with him, died. Naik has undergone four surgeries. Bandekar said the minister has started walking, but will need two weeks for the free movement of his hand that had fractured. “The decision with regards to his discharge will be taken after that,” he said. A day after his accident a team of doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had visited GMC to examine Ayush minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shripads-recovery-satisfactory/articleshow/80677268.cms||---

These children will be entitled to all the benefits given by the state government. According to the latest figure available with the department, around 6,000 children were enrolled under the drive until December. Jharkhand Project Education Council director Shailesh Chaurasia said, “After enlisting the students, we are informing the schools located in nearby areas to admit them on a priority basis. The survey in this regard is still going on.” He said many children who came back to state during lockdown have migrated again with their parents for jobs. The children will be eligible for various government schemes, including mid-day meals, free books and uniforms and bicycle and scholarship schemes, provided for promoting education. Those not enrolled are included in ‘out of school going children’ category, a list of which is sent to officials and schools in various areas for their enrollment He said the government also conducts bridge courses for children of seasonal migrants. The state government also conducts special campaigns for enlisting kids in order to enroll them in schools. Chaurasia said, “Our department carries out door to door surveys to make ‘Shishu Panji (children’s register)’ containing names of children belonging to school-going age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/drive-to-admit-migrants-kids-to-schools/articleshow/80675602.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Ranchi||RJD eyes Madhupur contest||Ranchi: The Jharkhand unit of the RJD has staked claim over the Madhupur assembly seat, which is due for a bye-election. The Madhupur seat in Deoghar district fell vacant with the demise of its MLA and state minority affairs minister Haji Hussain Ansari in October 2020. The election date for the seat has not yet been announced. Speaking to media persons on Wednesday, state RJD president Abhay Singh said, “Our mahagathbandhan partners — JMM and the Congress — contested one assembly bypoll each in 2020. The RJD, which is also part of the grand alliance, should be allowed to contest the upcoming bypoll.” He added that the RJD had sacrificed Garwha, Latehar and Manika seats during the assembly election for the benefit of the coalition and that gesture must now be reciprocated. Asked how RJD would fare in a seat where it failed to put up a strong performance in the past, Singh said, “The RJD nominee will fight the bypoll as a mahagathbandhan candidate, so he or she would win. In addition, the party candidate will get the support of Muslims and Yadavs, who are in large numbers in the constituency. It may be stated here that the RJD was never in contention to win the Madhupur seat. Since 2005, the BJP and the JMM have won from here twice each. The RJD was not even the runner-up in any of the contests. Reacting to the Union Budget, Singh said the Budget was planned keeping in mind the forthcoming assembly elections in states like Assam and Bengal. He added that Jharkhand was neglected in the Budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rjd-eyes-madhupur-contest/articleshow/80675544.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
February 4, 2021||Kolkata||Didi sees ‘irregularities’ in ex-minister’s stint||Alipurduar: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee took a jab at former forest minister Rajib Banerjee three days after he quit Trinamool Congress and joined BJP. “A person has done some irregularities during recruitment of Bana Sahayaks. We will look into it. Everything will be investigated. He has joined BJP recently and is making tall talk,” Mamata said at Alipurduar Parade Grounds on Wednesday without taking names. The state government by a notification in 2020 started the recruitment of 2,000 Bana Sahayaks on contract under the forest department with a consolidated salary of Rs 10,000. Rajib was the forest minister then. The notification had sparked a controversy in the Hills because it specified that applicants should know Bengali. Gorkha Territorial Administration (GTA) chairperson Anit Thapa wrote to the forest minister to recognise Nepali language in GTA area. The CM, however, focused on alleged corruption in the recruitment process and said: “The person, after indulging in corruption, is lecturing others. The corrupt and greedy have left Trinamool. They will now dance to the BJP tune. But they will be defeated in the coming assembly polls. Trinamool will win Bengal polls.” New BJP entrant Rajib became the CM’s target after he kept highlighting the state’s “non-cooperation” with the Centre, arguing it was putting the brakes on Bengal’s development. In Baruipur, the former forest minister had floated the idea of a “double engine” government in Bengal (BJP in the state and at the Centre), telling the gathering that the Union home minister had assured him of a special economic package for Bengal if BJP was voted to office. Mamata said BJP symbolised “greed” and was trying to strengthen itself by poaching people from Trinamool. “Let them go. Our booth-level workers are our real leaders. They are not going to be sold out,” she said. The CM also took a dig at the BJP-led Centre over waiving railway fare for migrant workers returning home during the pandemic. “They (BJP) can get some corrupt politicians flown in to Delhi by a chartered flight. But they couldn’t waive railway fare when migrant labourers from Bengal were returning home. We bought tickets for them. BJP is a party of moneyed people with no sympathy for the poor,” she said. Mamata also hit out at the Centre for promising to build 650km of roads in Bengal. “They are talking of constructing 650km road when the state government has built 85,000km of roads,” she said. Defining her party’s position on the Bengali versus outsider debate, the CM, emphasising Bengal asmita, said: “We do not distinguish between Bengalis and non-Bengalis because Bengal has been home to multiple languages, religions and cultures. But remember one thing — we don’t want Gujarat to dominate Bengal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-sees-irregularities-in-ex-ministers-stint/articleshow/80678042.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
